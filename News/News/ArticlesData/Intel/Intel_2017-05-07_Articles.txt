This Intel chip bug can still allow hackers to remotely hijack it Experts said a vulnerability in Intel chips allows hackers to remotely hijack computers, control keyboards and more. By India Ashok May 8, 2017 06:13 BST A Shodan search revealed that over 8,500 devices are vulnerable, with nearly 3,000 of those in the USiStock A major vulnerability in Intel chips can allow hackers to remotely gain complete control of PCs. The bug, which was first disclosed last week, had remained undetected for nearly a decade. According to security experts, the vulnerability can allow hackers to remotely control a computer's keyboard and mouse, even when the PC is switched off. The bug came in a feature of Intel's Active Management Technology (AMT), which is designed to allow administrators to remotely conduct maintenance work and other tasks such as software updates. "This vulnerability has the potential of being a proverbial big one. The vulnerability has been part of the Intel chipsets for years, specifically the Management Engine (ME). The ME runs things like DRM (Digital Rights Management) and does TPM (Trusted Platform Modules) checks as well as AMT. AMT enables systems administrators to re-image bare metal machines over a remote connection," Cris Thomas (AKA SpaceRogue), Strategist for Tenable Network Security, told IBTimes UK. "To accomplish that, the AMT requires many privileges, from network access to writing to memory and disk," he added. "The AMT is hardware and operates separately from any operating system installed on a system. Obviously, with this much power there is some protection: in this case, access to AMT is protected by a password. The vulnerability in AMT is that the password can be bypassed." According to security researchers at Embedi, who published a whitepaper about the AMT vulnerability, the flaw was detected in how the default "admin" account processes passwords. Researchers said the flaw ensured that the bug allowed anyone to log in, without even having to input anything at the login prompt. The findings were also confirmed by security experts at Tenable, who said the flaw could be exploited remotely fairly easily. It remains unclear as to how many devices may be affected. However, ZDNet reported that a Shodan search revealed that over 8,500 devices are vulnerable, with nearly 3,000 of those in the US. However, reports speculate that there could be thousands of other devices vulnerable as well. Intel said it was working with computer makers to roll out security updates to fix the issue. "We expect computer-makers to make updates available beginning the week of May 8 and continuing thereafter," Intel said in a statement. IBTimes UK has reached out to Intel for further clarity on the matter and will update this article in the event of a response.

Such is the complexity of the modern-day computer, we could've written an article twice this size on any one of the categories listed below (look at any graphics card forum for proof) — but the main aim here is to help you understand the specs you see listed with desktops and laptops, and give you an idea of the difference they make to performance. CPU Image: Peter Miller/Flickr The Central Processing Unit, or CPU, or processor, is the brains of the operation: it handles all those calculations that keep your computer actually working. The CPU inside your machine is the main (but not the only) contributor to its overall speed and performance. CPUs have a certain number of cores, mini computing units that are effectively CPUs in their own right — they let your computer work on multiple tasks at the same time, so the more cores the better. On top of this, each core has a clock speed, a measurement of how fast it can do its number crunching, usually measured in gigahertz (GHz). Comparing the performance of CPUs based on core number and clock speeds is notoriously difficult (sorry shoppers). That's because multiple factors are involved, most related to the microarchitecture of the CPUs. The microarchitecture is basically the way that the cores and the other bits of a CPU are packed together. The two big computer CPU makers, Intel and AMD, have their own microarchitecture designs. When you see references to Intel Skylake, Intel Kaby Lake, or AMD Zen (on Ryzen chips), this is what's being referred to, and newer is always better as successive microarchitectures allow the CPU to work faster and more efficiently (and use less power). Image: AMD Intel and AMD also apply their own labels — i3, i5, and i7 in Intel's case — to indicate relative performance within a microarchitecture family. It's a useful shorthand reference to the power you can expect, with i7 CPUs the best of the bunch from Intel. In AMD's case, you're talking about Ryzen 3, Ryzen 5 and the top-end Ryzen 7. If you want the very best processors around, you should also look out for what Intel calls hyper-threading and what AMD calls simultaneous multi-threading. These technologies effectively double the number of cores (virtually, not physically) so you've got significantly improved performance for demanding applications like video editing or CAD software. Unless you're building your own PC from scratch, that's probably all you need to know when looking at system listings, but CPUs have numerous other specs, including the amount of high-speed memory cache and the extra graphics processing capabilities that are on board. If your CPU has enough integrated graphics oomph, you don't need a separate card or chipset, of which more below. Graphics Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo The other big factor in computer performance, particularly if you're gaming or working with a lot of video and images, is graphics. We only gave it a brief mention in the processor section, but many Intel CPUs now come with a decent amount of graphics processing power built in, enough for most users to get by with a bit of web browsing, Twittering, essay writing and even light image editing and gaming. You can also get integrated graphics chipsets built into the motherboard as well as the CPU. Integrated graphics share memory with the CPU and aren't as powerful as having a dedicated (or discrete) card, but it's a cheaper option that also draws less power, which is why it's often deployed on laptops where battery life is important. Wherever it's installed on your system, the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) churns through calculations just like the CPU does, but only the number-crunching related to rendering pictures, animations, and videos on screen. GPUs are much better at performing many operations in parallel, as you can see here, which is why they're now being used in other areas like science and encryption. Image: Nvidia In terms of specs, it's not particularly easy to weigh one graphics card or GPU against another. You'll see reference to number of compute units (like cores in a CPU) and raw clock speed. As with a CPU, these are two key factors to consider, but also keep an eye out for FLOPS, or Floating Point Operations Per Second — a type of maths operation particularly important in graphics. Video card GPUs come with their own RAM or video RAM (vRAM). This works in a similar way to the computer's main RAM, but deals solely with graphics (with the same specs references to speed and bandwidth). The more RAM your graphics card has, the more pixels it can render in memory at once, which leads to games running at higher resolutions with faster frame rates. Essentially video cards are like separate miniature computers, with processors, RAM and architecture all of their own, and the same performance factors apply. For the non-expert, there are a couple of useful shortcuts to working out how powerful a graphics setup is without having to pour over the specs in too much detail: how much it costs and the benchmarks reported on the web. RAM Image: Glenn Batuyong/Flickr Random Access Memory or RAM gives your computer room to think, and the more of it the better, as long as you can afford it. When you've got 3,000 browser tabs open, the RAM is the first to suffer, because your computer's trying to remember what's in all of those 3,000 tabs at once. More RAM helps your computer deal with bigger images and files, or more images and files at once, or more open tabs, or more applications running simultaneously — it's not a direct measure of the raw speed of your machine but it certainly helps performance, especially when you're trying to do a lot. If the RAM gets overloaded, your computer sometimes stores data it needs on the (slower) hard drive instead, which is one reason more RAM equals a speedier experience. For the majority of users shopping for a desktop or laptop, all that really matters is how much RAM is installed, but dig deeper and there are plenty of additional specs to consider — especially if you're trying to build the fastest computer you can. Image: The Beard/Flickr Clock speeds appear again, usually in terms of a frequency rate, which help to determine how fast the RAM can read and write data as well as how much data the RAM can handle at once (its overall transfer rate). Latency, or how fast the RAM responds to instructions, is an important specification as well. One other prominent specification is DDR or Double Data Rate, with DDR4 being the best yet for consumer computers (and an upgrade over DDR3) — it has faster clock speeds, lower power draw, and lower latency. Yet more RAM specifications relate to stability and how well your RAM sticks can handle errors, but again, this isn't something that most of us will have to worry about: the performance differences only become apparent in very specialist tasks. Other computer specs Image: Marlon J. Manrique/Flickr The CPU, RAM, and graphics are the main specs to consider when assessing your own computer or looking out for a new one, but there are of course other components to bear in mind as well, which you'll see in system listings. The hard drive is very simply the amount of room you've got to store stuff permanently (it remembers its data, unlike the RAM). Need more storage? Get a bigger hard drive. Solid-state drives used in Apple's MacBooks and most high-end laptops have no moving parts and are faster than the older mechanical hard disk drives, but they're also more expensive and don't offer as much capacity. Newer technologies like hybrid drives and Intel's Optane technology are looking to find a better compromise between the two. You probably won't give any thought to your motherboard unless you have to build a PC yourself, but it acts as the nervous system for the whole machine and connects all the various bits together. Motherboard specs, such as they are, don't make a huge difference to overall performance but they can help the key components work together more efficiently and faster. The motherboard also dictates how many input and output ports you've got on your system. Other specs you see should be self-explanatory, like the size of your monitor or the number of memory card slots you're getting. And if you're in the market for a new phone, a lot of the specs — processor, RAM, storage — do the same job on these miniature computers as they do on the full-sized versions. WATCH MORE: Tech News Comments welbot @welbot May 8, 2017, 11:23am I think an important thing to note about RAM, is that the clock speed doesn't necessarily reflect its actual operating speed. The speed at which your RAM operates is directly linked to the bus speed of the CPU. For instance, the i7-6850, has a bus speed of 2133MHz. If you buy RAM that is capable of 2666MHz, and just slap it in your machine, it's going to run at 2133MHz. If you want to use your RAM at the faster rate, you have to fiddle with BIOS settings for overclocking etc., so if you don't plan to overclock (or simply have no idea how) don't waste money buying faster RAM. Find out what the bus speed of the CPU is, and get RAM to match. That being said, some motherboards do have settings to enable slight automatic overclocking too, and if you enable that, it would be beneficial to have slightly faster RAM than the bus speed, but it's not worth going too overboard. Using my example above of the i7-6850, you would benefit from using RAM that operates at 2400MHz, but auto overclocking is probably extremely unlikely to push it to the point where it would hit 2666MHz. Sometimes it just comes down to money though. When I bought my recent upgrade, 2666MHz RAM was cheaper than 2400MHz, so no harm in getting it, but if it costs a good bit more, probably not worth it. Save your money and put it in to other components or keep it for a rainy day! Reply 3 grunt @grunt May 8, 2017, 12:01pm Good points welbot. I'd also add that when looking at RAM, pairing it properly also makes a difference. Always buy RAM as two sticks where possible, and slot them into slots 1 & 3 or 2 & 4 on the motherboard. Or is that no longer as important as it was in the past? I havent really been paying major attention the last few years :) Reply 1 welbot @welbot May 8, 2017, 1:35pm Yeah it is still very valid if your motherboard supports dual channel (or quad channel RAM as mine does.) There are some motherboards which only have 2 slots, and I've never actually looked to see if they run dual channel or not, but it's hard to go wrong when there's only 2 any way. (Generally they'll be either very cheap boards, or mini-ITX - the tiny ones that really don't have room for any more slots) Reply 0 Join the discussion!

Last week, Intel issued a security advisory for their server-based products that said AMT could be exploited and give unauthorised parties access to a number of processor features. Analysis at SSH Communications Security says this is a very serious issue and that owners of affected systems should disable AMT. Consumer systems are not affected. The exploit, officially noted as CVE-2017-5689, is a big deal. Often, we hear about vulnerabilities that require a very specific set of circumstances in order to be used by threat actors. Here's what SSH says: The exploit is trivial, max five lines of Python, could be doable in one-line shell command. It gives full control of affected machines, including the ability to read and modify everything. Intel has made it clear what systems they believe are affected: The issue has been observed in Intel manageability firmware versions 6.x, 7.x, 8.x 9.x, 10.x, 11.0, 11.5, and 11.6 for Intel® Active Management Technology, Intel® Small Business Technology, and Intel® Standard Manageability. Versions before 6 or after 11.6 are not impacted. Given that Intel's nomenclature can be a tad confusing, what I understand is if your machine came with an Intel vPro sticker and Windows was pre-installed then you're likely to be affected as AMT is enabled by default. There's some mixed signals coming from security analysts with Hardware.info saying systems running processors ranging from 2008's Nehalem series through to today's Kaby Lake impacted - including consumer systems. But others are saying consumer systems aren't hit. Intel's advisory provides links to firmware updates for affected HP. Lenovo, Fujitsu and Dell systems. The Hacker News provides some further information as well as suggestions on a GutHub script to disable AMT as well as other mitigations strategies.

Advertisement Such is the complexity of the modern-day computer, we could've written an article twice this size on any one of the categories listed below (look at any graphics card forum for proof)-but the main aim here is to help you understand the specs you see listed with desktops and laptops, and give you an idea of the difference they make to performance. CPU Image: Peter Miller/Flickr The Central Processing Unit , or CPU, or processor, is the brains of the operation: it handles all those calculations that keep your computer actually working. The CPU inside your machine is the main (but not the only) contributor to its overall speed and performance. Advertisement CPUs have a certain number of cores, mini computing units that are effectively CPUs in their own right-they let your computer work on multiple tasks at the same time, so the more cores the better. On top of this, each core has a clock speed, a measurement of how fast it can do its number crunching, usually measured in gigahertz (GHz). Comparing the performance of CPUs based on core number and clock speeds is notoriously difficult (sorry shoppers). That's because multiple factors are involved, most related to the microarchitecture of the CPUs. The microarchitecture is basically the way that the cores and the other bits of a CPU are packed together. The two big computer CPU makers, Intel and AMD, have their own microarchitecture designs. When you see references to Intel Skylake, Intel Kaby Lake, or AMD Zen ( on Ryzen chips ), this is what's being referred to, and newer is always better as successive microarchitectures allow the CPU to work faster and more efficiently (and use less power). Image: AMD Intel and AMD also apply their own labels-i3, i5, and i7 in Intel's case-to indicate relative performance within a microarchitecture family. It's a useful shorthand reference to the power you can expect, with i7 CPUs the best of the bunch from Intel. In AMD's case, you're talking about Ryzen 3, Ryzen 5 and the top-end Ryzen 7. Advertisement Sponsored If you want the very best processors around, you should also look out for what Intel calls hyper-threading and what AMD calls simultaneous multi-threading. These technologies effectively double the number of cores (virtually, not physically) so you've got significantly improved performance for demanding applications like video editing or CAD software. Unless you're building your own PC from scratch, that's probably all you need to know when looking at system listings, but CPUs have numerous other specs, including the amount of high-speed memory cache and the extra graphics processing capabilities that are on board. If your CPU has enough integrated graphics oomph, you don't need a separate card or chipset, of which more below. Graphics Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo The other big factor in computer performance, particularly if you're gaming or working with a lot of video and images, is graphics. Advertisement We only gave it a brief mention in the processor section, but many Intel CPUs now come with a decent amount of graphics processing power built in, enough for most users to get by with a bit of web browsing, Twittering, essay writing and even light image editing and gaming. You can also get integrated graphics chipsets built into the motherboard as well as the CPU. Integrated graphics share memory with the CPU and aren't as powerful as having a dedicated (or discrete) card, but it's a cheaper option that also draws less power, which is why it's often deployed on laptops where battery life is important. Wherever it's installed on your system, the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) churns through calculations just like the CPU does, but only the number-crunching related to rendering pictures, animations, and videos on screen. GPUs are much better at performing many operations in parallel, as you can see here , which is why they're now being used in other areas like science and encryption. Image: Nvidia In terms of specs, it's not particularly easy to weigh one graphics card or GPU against another. You'll see reference to number of compute units (like cores in a CPU) and raw clock speed. As with a CPU, these are two key factors to consider, but also keep an eye out for FLOPS, or Floating Point Operations Per Second-a type of maths operation particularly important in graphics. Advertisement Advertisement Video card GPUs come with their own RAM or video RAM (vRAM). This works in a similar way to the computer's main RAM, but deals solely with graphics (with the same specs references to speed and bandwidth). The more RAM your graphics card has, the more pixels it can render in memory at once, which leads to games running at higher resolutions with faster frame rates. Essentially video cards are like separate miniature computers, with processors, RAM and architecture all of their own, and the same performance factors apply. For the non-expert, there are a couple of useful shortcuts to working out how powerful a graphics setup is without having to pour over the specs in too much detail: how much it costs and the benchmarks reported on the web . RAM Image: Glenn Batuyong/Flickr Random Access Memory or RAM gives your computer room to think, and the more of it the better, as long as you can afford it. When you've got 3,000 browser tabs open, the RAM is the first to suffer, because your computer's trying to remember what's in all of those 3,000 tabs at once. Advertisement More RAM helps your computer deal with bigger images and files, or more images and files at once, or more open tabs, or more applications running simultaneously-it's not a direct measure of the raw speed of your machine but it certainly helps performance, especially when you're trying to do a lot. If the RAM gets overloaded, your computer sometimes stores data it needs on the (slower) hard drive instead, which is one reason more RAM equals a speedier experience. Advertisement For the majority of users shopping for a desktop or laptop, all that really matters is how much RAM is installed, but dig deeper and there are plenty of additional specs to consider-especially if you're trying to build the fastest computer you can. Image: The Beard/Flickr Clock speeds appear again, usually in terms of a frequency rate, which help to determine how fast the RAM can read and write data as well as how much data the RAM can handle at once (its overall transfer rate). Latency, or how fast the RAM responds to instructions, is an important specification as well. Advertisement One other prominent specification is DDR or Double Data Rate, with DDR4 being the best yet for consumer computers (and an upgrade over DDR3)-it has faster clock speeds, lower power draw, and lower latency. Yet more RAM specifications relate to stability and how well your RAM sticks can handle errors, but again, this isn't something that most of us will have to worry about: the performance differences only become apparent in very specialist tasks. Other computer specs Image: Marlon J. Manrique/Flickr The CPU, RAM, and graphics are the main specs to consider when assessing your own computer or looking out for a new one, but there are of course other components to bear in mind as well, which you'll see in system listings. Advertisement The hard drive is very simply the amount of room you've got to store stuff permanently (it remembers its data, unlike the RAM). Need more storage? Get a bigger hard drive. Solid-state drives used in Apple's MacBooks and most high-end laptops have no moving parts and are faster than the older mechanical hard disk drives, but they're also more expensive and don't offer as much capacity. Newer technologies like hybrid drives and Intel's Optane technology are looking to find a better compromise between the two. You probably won't give any thought to your motherboard unless you have to build a PC yourself, but it acts as the nervous system for the whole machine and connects all the various bits together. Motherboard specs, such as they are, don't make a huge difference to overall performance but they can help the key components work together more efficiently and faster. The motherboard also dictates how many input and output ports you've got on your system. Advertisement Other specs you see should be self-explanatory, like the size of your monitor or the number of memory card slots you're getting. And if you're in the market for a new phone , a lot of the specs-processor, RAM, storage-do the same job on these miniature computers as they do on the full-sized versions.

You won’t play the latest titles in 4K using an Intel integrated GPU, but if your game library consists of lightweight titles or classic games, integrated graphics are the cheaper solution. With the launch of its 7th-generation Kaby Lake CPUs, Intel debuted its new generation of integrated graphics processors. These integrated chips provide a fair amount of graphics processing power and can support resolutions of up to 4K. We examined Intel’s Kaby Lake integrated graphics processors to find out how effective they are at running modern games. Hardware Integrated GPUs share a silicon die and resources with the CPU, and although there are named models with the same specifications, the performance of each GPU varies depending on which CPU it is coupled with. Intel HD Graphics GPUs do not have dedicated video memory and share RAM with the CPU. The powerful Intel Iris Graphics processors include onboard eDRAM, though, which is used as dedicated memory for the integrated GPU. Intel’s 7th-gen processors feature both Intel HD Graphics and Intel Iris Plus graphics chips, with the latter usually reserved for high-end, expensive processors. The specifications of Intel’s HD and Iris Plus graphics chips are below. GPU Base Frequency Max Frequency eDRAM Processors Intel HD Graphics 610 350MHz 950MHz – Desktop Celeron, Pentium G45, and Core i3-7101 Intel HD Graphics 615 300MHz 1,050MHz – Pentium 4410Y, Core i7-7Y75, Core i5-7Y54, Core i5-7Y757, Core m3-7Y30 Intel HD Graphics 620 300MHz 1,050MHz – Core i7-7600U, Core i7-7500U, Core i5-7300U, Core i5-7200U, Core i3-7100U Intel HD Graphics 630 300MHz 1,100MHz – Desktop Pentium G46, Core i3, i5, and i7, Laptop H-series Core i3, i5, and i7 Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 300MHz 1,050MHz 64MB Core i5-7260U, i5-7360U, i7-7560U, i7-7660U Intel Iris Plus Graphics 650 300MHz 1,100MHz 64MB Core i3-7167U, i5-7267U, i5-7287U, i7-7567U Gaming Performance The performance of Intel’s integrated GPUs depends on a number of factors, including the clock speed and L3 cache of the CPU. However, Intel lists the recommended settings for various titles depending on which processor you own – and this can give users a good idea of their chip’s capabilities. We have compiled the recommended settings for each integrated graphics chip when playing Blizzard’s Overwatch and Valve’s Dota 2, using information from Intel’s gameplay portal.

While the Celeron and Pentium-based chips are not viable for all casual gaming, and the Iris Plus processors require a reduction in resolution for smooth gameplay, the level of performance provided by the higher-end chips is adequate for laptop gaming. This is particularly the case for laptops with a native resolution of 1,366 x 768.

Dan Goodin (US) - May 7, 2017 8:05 am UTC Enlarge Intel reader comments 121 Share this story A remote hijacking flaw that lurked in Intel chips for seven years was more severe than many people imagined, because it allowed hackers to remotely gain administrative control over huge fleets of computers without entering a password. This is according to technical analyses published Friday. Further ReadingIntel patches remote hijacking vulnerability that lurked in chips for 7 yearsAs Ars reported Monday, the authentication bypass vulnerability resides in a feature known as Active Management Technology. AMT, as it's usually called, allows system administrators to perform a variety of powerful tasks over a remote connection. Among the capabilities: changing the code that boots up computers, accessing the computer's mouse, keyboard, and monitor, loading and executing programs, and remotely powering on computers that are turned off. In short, AMT makes it possible to log into a computer and exercise the same control enjoyed by administrators with physical access. AMT, which is available with many vPro processors, was set up to require a password before it could be remotely accessed over a Web browser interface. But, remarkably, that authentication mechanism can be bypassed by entering any text string—or no text at all. According to a blog post published Friday by Tenable Network Security, the cryptographic hash that the interface's digest access authentication requires to verify someone is authorized to log in can be anything at all, including no string at all. "Authentication still worked" even when the wrong hash was entered, Tenable Director of Reverse Engineering Carlos Perez wrote. "We had discovered a complete bypass of the authentication scheme." A separate technical analysis from Embedi, the security firm Intel credited with first disclosing the vulnerability, arrived at the same conclusion. It stated: With a little help of the local proxy at `127.0.0.1:16992`, which is meant to replace the response with an empty string, we're able to manage the AMT via the regular Web browser as if we've known the *admin* password: ``` GET /index.htm HTTP/1.1 Host: 127.0.0.1:16992 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:45.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/45.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Connection: keep-alive HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized WWW-Authenticate: Digest realm="Digest:048A0000000000000000000000000000", nonce="qTILAAUFAAAjY7rDwLSmxFCq5EJ3pH/n",stale="false",qop="auth" Content-Type: text/html Server: AMT Content-Length: 678 Connection: close GET /index.htm HTTP/1.1 Host: 127.0.0.1:16992 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:45.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/45.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Connection: keep-alive Authorization: Digest username="admin", realm="Digest:048A0000000000000000000000000000", nonce="qTILAAUFAAAjY7rDwLSmxFCq5EJ3pH/n", uri="/index.htm", response="", qop=auth, nc=00000001, cnonce="60513ab58858482c" HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Thu, 4 May 2017 16:09:17 GMT Server: AMT Content-Type: text/html Transfer-Encoding: chunked Cache-Control: no cache Expires: Thu, 26 Oct 1995 00:00:00 GMT 04E6 Embedi e-mailed the analysis to reporters, but didn't publish it online. Making matters worse, unauthorized accesses typically aren't logged by the PC because AMT has direct access to the computer's network hardware. When AMT is enabled, all network packets are redirected to the Intel Management Engine and from there to the AMT. The packets bypass the OS completely. The vulnerable management features were made available in some but not all Intel chipsets starting in 2010, Embedi has said. In a blog post published Friday, Intel officials said they expect PC makers to release a patch next week. The releases will update Intel firmware, meaning patching will require that each vulnerable chip set is reflashed. In the meantime, Intel is urging customers to download and run this discovery tool to diagnose potentially vulnerable computers. Systems that test positive should be temporarily secured using this mitigation guide until a patch is supplied. Computer makers Fujitsu, HP, and Lenovo, have also issued advisories for specific models they sell. [Update, 5:40pm EDT] A query of the Shodan security search engine found over 8,500 systems with the AMT interface exposed to the Internet, with over 2,000 in the United States alone: Enlarge / One of the hits for the AMT interface on Shodan.

According to a blog post published Friday by Tenable Network Security, the cryptographic hash that the interface's digest access authentication requires to verify someone is authorized to log in can be anything at all, including no string at all. What? I get that security is hard and that sometimes there are unforeseen vulnerabilities. But... you can enter any text as the password, and it accepts it? Did no one at Intel test a wrong password at any point? This isn't a bug, this is outright negligence. The article is a bit confusing regarding this, but no, you can't send an empty password. That's because when a browser does digest authentication it doesn't actually send the password, or even a password hash, to the web server. The browser sends instead a response MD5 hash computed on a string composed of various items, including a variable nonce sent by the server, in addition to the password, for example: response=MD5(MD5(username:realm:password):nonce:MD5(method:digestURI)) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_ac ... entication This means a normal browser would never send an empty response, even when you enter an empty password. It would always send a 32 hex digit MD5 hash looking like this: response="6629fae49393a05397450978507c4ef1" The server would then compute the same hash, and compare them. If they are equal, it allows login, if they are different it denies login. The bug was in the code to compare the two strings. It used the strncmp function that compares the first N characters of two strings: strncmp(string1, string2, N) http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strncmp/ And applied it to the computed hash and the hash response received from the browser, with N set to the length of the response received from the browser, so something like: strncmp(computed_hash, response, strlen(response)) So when it compared a real hash generated by a browser it would do something like: strncmp("6629fae49393a05397450978507c4ef1","d3d4914a43454b159a3fa6f5a91d801d", 32) This would work just fine for hashes sent by the browser, which are always 32 characters in length. Even if the password field is empty, it would compare the two strings, they wouldn't match, and it would reject the empty password or invalid password. So anyone testing this from a browser would find it works perfectly. The problem is what happens if you don't use a browser, but you generate an invalid request manually or using a proxy to alter the response, sending an empty string instead of the 32 character hash. Then the compare code does this: strncmp("6629fae49393a05397450978507c4ef1","",0) This means the function will compare the first 0 characters between the two strings. So it is equivalent to: strncmp("","",0) Of course, two 0 length strings are equal, so it wrongfully concludes the hashes are equal. What the programmer should have done is check if the hash coming from the browser has the correct length, 32 characters, before attempting to compare the two strings. Or even better, the programmer should have used the proper string comparing function, strcmp, that already does that for you and you don't need to supply a length parameter, like this: strcmp(string1, string2) http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strcmp/ 122 posts | registered 9/25/2016 Dan Goodin Dan is the Security Editor at Ars Technica, which he joined in 2012 after working for The Register, the Associated Press, Bloomberg News, and other publications.

Under load at random the processor spikes close towards its designed thermal limit.  The report comes from the register who explains that i7-7700 owners are finding that the chips will occasionally kick themselves into overdrive, running at temperatures as high as 90°C (194°F) at times. Intel says the i7-7700 will run at temperatures up to 100°C (212°F): "My own chip suffers from it, (without any overclocking) which is quite an annoyance," our tipster writes. "This despite a delid modification and a proper water loop, resulting in the fans ramping up and down very frequently, and the temperature appearing to frequently spike near the danger zone." The users note that these temperatures are even being seen in high-end gaming rigs with liquid cooling setups with the chips running at fairly low voltages. "At this point though, with the temps most people are seeing, even good chips capable of hitting high clocks at low voltage still have very little headroom due to the thermal spikes these chips are displaying at even stock settings," notes user mrobscura. "It's ridiculous that previous gen chips run cooler at equal or higher clocks despite needing to pump much higher voltage through them to obtain said clocks." Making things worse, the users say, is that after more than three months of asking for a fix or even an explanation from Intel, the only response from Chipzilla has been a forum post more or less shrugging off the matter. "The reported behavior of the 7th Generation Intel Core i7-7700K Processor, showing momentary temperature changes from the idle temperature, is normal while completing a task (like opening a browser or an application or a program)," an Intel rep told the customers. "In our internal investigation, we did not observe temperature variation outside of the expected behavior and recommended specifications." Even if the high temperatures don't pose a risk to the health of the chip itself, the effect of constant spikes will wear on the nerves of PC owners who see their cooling fans constantly spinning up to top speed, only to rev back down seconds later and repeat when the next temperature spike hits. "For the i7-7700K, momentary temperature changes from the idle temperature are normal while completing certain tasks like opening a browser or an application," a spokesperson said. "We've looked into the reports and have not seen any unexpected behavior or indication of performance impact." For those annoyed by the constant on-and-off frenzy of cooling fans, Intel suggests you set the speed control so that the whirring kicks up gradually, rather than all at once. We're sure customers will find that recommendation to be wholly satisfying and adequate for their concerns. Please do share your comments. Interesting to see is that from the result sets plotted we can only see OCCT tests, and really that test itself might be the cause if the spikes. Thus far we have never been able to see similar results ourselves. Do you own such a processor? let's us know in the below thread if you can see / replicate similar thermal behaviour patterns.

Sounds more like there could be a mounting issue where the coolers don't fully make contact with the CPU. I ran into that with my old H100i. It needed extra washers to fully make contact otherwise it would randomly spike to 90-95C interceptor Newbie Posts: 26 Joined: 2014-01-28 #5428051 Posted on: 05/04/2017 05:59 PM after deliding, nothing like that happens with my 7700k NH-D15 on board reno_skychaser Maha Guru Posts: 1694 Joined: 2005-09-23 #5428054 Posted on: 05/04/2017 06:08 PM Also wonder if it could be an internal temperature sensor issue.

Robbo9999 Master Guru Posts: 500 Joined: 2012-10-07 #5428078 Posted on: 05/04/2017 06:40 PM Temp spikes in OCCT are completely normal because if you look at the CPU Package Power in HWInfo Sensors you can see it jumping around, it does this on my 6700K - it's completely normal, it's the test (OCCT). I'm not sure why the OCCT graphs are included, I don't see it as any kind of meaningful information, for reason just described - the basis for the complaints isn't based on OCCT is it? EDIT: just ran OCCT for 5 mins to double check. Individual core temperatures fluctuate by a large amount up to just over 20 degC difference (temperature fluctuations of any given core, fluctuations within itself - not compared to other cores). CPU Package temperatures fluctuate in region of 10 degC. EDIT 2: just ran Prime95(v26.6) for 5 mins as a comparison to OCCT above. Temperature fluctuations were a LOT lower: 6 degC temperature fluctuation of any given core, and 4 degree temperature fluctuation of CPU Package. That's a big difference between the two tests, OCCT creates massive temperature fluctuations, so if the complaints are just based on seeing fluctuations in OCCT, then I don't think the complaints are founded.

Paulo Narciso Maha Guru Posts: 1062 Joined: 2007-02-21 #5428097 Posted on: 05/04/2017 07:09 PM Most of the heat gets trapped between die and IHS, because Intel do not use solder bewteen them like AMD. So, without delidding, the difference between water and decent air cooling is none. kapu Ancient Guru Posts: 3674 Joined: 2006-12-22 #5428106 Posted on: 05/04/2017 07:22 PM Quote: Originally Posted by H83 Never happened with my 7600K.

If i remember correctly the 7700K needs much more voltage than the 7600K to reach the same clocks: https://www.bit-tech.net/hardware/20...7600k-review/8 Turanis Maha Guru Posts: 1043 Joined: 2014-08-15 #5428124 Posted on: 05/04/2017 07:42 PM Quote: Originally Posted by kapu But why 7700k would run much hotter than 7600k ?

Looks like Overclocked "new series" i7 6700(aka i7 Kaby Lake) suffer from ...overclocking. i7 7700K suffer from bad TIM compund and need to be delided. And remember: i7 7700 have vPro&IME&AMT,but 7700K dont have it. Good to know the i5 7600k OC work well. 4 pages 1 2 3 4 Post New Comment Click here to post a comment for this news story on the message forum. Guru3D.com © 2017

Home Featured Articles Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War III The quest for playable Dawn Of War III on a laptop By Alec Meer on April 30th, 2017 at 7:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Something I enjoy doing, because my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours, is trying to get games working on below-minimum spec PCs. Specifically, my aged Surface Pro 3 and its lousy integrated Intel graphics. Offline mode confusions aside, Warhammer 40000: Dawn of War 3 [official site] is exactly the kind of game I want to play on train rides, but officially it requires a 2GB dedicated graphics card. Unofficially, not so much. I’ve got it running, and made it look like an early 2000s RTS in the process. First, here are the official minimum specs: Processor: 3GHz i3 quad logical core or equivalent Memory: 4 GB of RAM, 1 GB of VRAM RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce 460 or AMD Radeon 6950 or equivalent DirectX 11-card And my Surface Pro 3’s specs: Processor: 2.50GHz i5 dual core (with hyperthreading) Memory: 8GB of RAM, no dedicated VRAM Graphics: Intel HD 4400 integrated Oh dear, basically. Once in a while I can get a new game running at 30 fps at 720p and bare-minimum settings on this thing, but that’s becoming rarer and rarer as time goes by. I just had this feeling that DOW3 might be possible, though, so I persevered. The problem with the SP3 goes beyond simply its specs, however. This is an ultra-portable laptop (and tablet hybrid), which means it’s sacrificed cooling for slimness, and that in turn means that it brutally underclocks itself if it gets too hot. And “too hot” means “more than about five minutes of CPU load.” Games make it run super-slow super-quickly, so even if I can get DOW3 playable, it will cease to be so within minutes. The solution is this: A USB fan angled to blow cold air at the top-right corner of the device, which is where its heat concentrates. It’s very noisy, it looks stupid and I always lose some skin trying to make it point just so, but it works. The CPU speed doesn’t drop through the floor so long as this thing is blowing. Which leaves the matter of settings. Obviously, rock-bottom everything is required, but in the case of DOW3, turning off all the post-processing stuff makes surprisingly little difference so long as you’re not looking too closely. Resolution was the problem – even 720p meant about 10 frames per second. As did 1024×768. Fortunately, DOW3 offers the increasingly common option for reducing rendering resolution. I.e. I can set it to 1024×768 and that’s the image ‘size’ I get, but the game is actually rendering at half of that (or 66% of it, depending on what you choose). Essentially, I’m playing a high-end 2017 game at VGA resolution. The UI is still rendered at the higher setting, however, so doesn’t become illegible. And this is how it looks: Awful, right? Oddly, in practice I quite like it. It puts me in mind of the limited-but-characterful animations of the pixel people in olden Command and Conquers and Ages of Empire, which pleases the old nostalgic in me. Occasionally, performance will spike to 30 or even 35 fps, but by and large it’s sat around 20-25 – which is absolutely fine. In an FPS it’d probably be horrible, but an RTS doesn’t seem to suffer for it. Sure, it all looks and sounds abominable on paper, but here’s the thing with game graphics settings and even performance: you only really notice while you’re trying to notice. Learn to stop worrying and the blockiness, Harryhausian jerkiness and soft edges all fades away after a few minutes. You’re playing a videogame, caring about videogame things like building and fighting and upgrading, and that’s what you really see, what you really care about. Sure, this is an extreme case, but how many times has beefing up a game’s settings to the max – e.g. by buying a new graphics card – really, honestly improved the experience? Anyway, now you know how I spend my weekends.

Even if it comes at a fairly drastic cost, a sale’s a sale, and a lot of people will gladly play anyway and not think less of the game for it, assuming of course that it’s properly signposted before you start that “these settings will make the game look like shite”. Fair play to those that do, mind. It’s sometimes rather puzzling exactly which games work and which don’t – you’d assume that being 3D was the big factor, but on my cheap and now old laptop, I can run some 3d games just fine (Left for Dead 2 comes to mind), but even a fair few 2d games are either a slog or outright unplayable.

For the average user the game is going to have mediocre performance, and this inherently alienates a large portion of the playerbase. Inversely, the ability to run LoL WC3 and Starcraft on low end systems was part of the reason for their success and popularity in general 02/05/2017 at 09:15 Ferno says: Is it badly optimised? I must be lucky as I’ve had no performance issues whatsoever! 01/05/2017 at 19:20 TheSkiGeek says: Even if it comes at a fairly drastic cost, a sale’s a sale… Well… that’s exactly the problem. Do you spend extra months of development time trying to make your game run better on hopelessly obsolete hardware? Or take time away from making the game look super-shiny on modern hardware to do that? In the hope that people who can’t or won’t spend $100 every few years on a GPU (or paying a similar amount to put a discrete GPU in their shitty laptop) will pay $60 for your game? Their minimum specs are already basically “anything that’s not the worst available Intel integrated graphics”. It’s one thing if you’re making an F2P game like League or DOTA, but for premium-priced AAA titles it seems like this would be unlikely to pay off unless you are very sure you’ll sell a bajillion copies (say… Overwatch.)

Mind you, I don’t think you can reduce the settings quite as much as you have done with DOW3 here. The worst game I’ve played recently to stress out my poor laptop 860M is Black Mesa, which feels incredibly badly optimised (or perhaps just really hates laptop graphics cards?).

Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 20:13 Mister eX says: I’m doing this a lot too, mainly out of necessity. I’ve had my first “proper”, new PC in 2003, and used that until october of 2015, when my friends gifted me a much better one for my birthday. Since I’m a grown, working man, I can’t play games as much as I’d like to, so while I went through a dozen of games that I couldn’t since about 2007, there is still a lot of stuff I want to try. This machine is looking like this: Core 2 Duo E8400 (3ghz), 4GB RAM, Gerforce GT730. So it’s not enough for today’s (AAA) games, but it doesn’t bother me much – as I’ve said, still a lot of stuff to try, and almost every big game from 2007-’08 looks great to me. :D But occasionally there is a newer game I’d really love to play, and then comes the tweaking. :D The first one I thought I’d never be able to play was Dragon Age: Inquisition. I’ve already played through the first two, and in fact, I was still playing 2 when I started to research running DAI on dual cores, and below min. reqs in general. Looking at youtube videos and reading forums, I didn’t have much hope. But I’ve tried anyway, and I’ve worked out a setup where it still looked beautiful to me, and could keep a more or less steady 30 fps. Judging by my research, I may be the only one with a dual core who could play it without those annoying “freeze frames” every few seconds. :D Then, since it uses the same engine (and while I used cfg tweaks in DAI, ingame settings were far from the lowest), I thought I’d try Mass Effect: Andromeda. Results: while the gpu could handle it on below minimum (with cfg tweaks) settings, now I had those annoying “freeze frames” ’cause of the cpu. But, here comes my latest “triumph”: I’m playing, and enjoying DOOM (2016). :D Granted, it almost looks as Doom 3, but man-oh-maaaan, gameplay! :D Btw, RPS has been my favorite store on the C… I mean, place on the internet for about this past one & a half years now, and this was my first post.

Yeah, thankfully a lot of games can be run on below min. spec PCs and sometimes you don’t even have to go full low with the settings. :) Like, when there’s some resource-heavy post process setting that you can’t turn off in the game settings (only turn it to low), but in a cfg file you can, and then maybe turn a few other options up, and it ultimately looks better. :D I’ve had that exact situation with Mad Max for example, if I remember correctly.

His channel I mean… :D Helped me a bit with DOOM too, and I didn’t even had to go as low he did in those videos. :) As I’ve said, it barely looks better then Doom 3, but the gameplay is just epic, and mostly fluid. I enjoy it, so it’s waaay better than waiting for years to be able to play it. :D 02/05/2017 at 18:03 Hydrogene says: Ah ah!

You have to do research on what kinds of parameters you can put in there, etc… 30/04/2017 at 21:07 Railway Rifle says: “my capacity to be tedious is matched only by my willingness to waste time on doomed endeavours” This man will go far.

Especially when you have to do such a hassle every time you want to play a new game, at some point the time loss makes it just worth to get a new laptop. Also a side note: I had “supporter” written in red on the top oif my screen below the “Howdy Tigris” this kinda seemed like a bug.

Log in to Reply 02/05/2017 at 02:58 ogopogo says: …but if he’s writing an article on low-spec gaming, he’s going to have to play on a crappy machine?? Articles on bleeding edge GFX cards are interesting, sure, but probably only really relevant to a few % of the readers. Low-spec gaming articles are probably relevant to a much higher percentage. Also, how much do you imagine a journalist gets paid? Look that up, then adjust down for “gaming journalist..” (your words!) and adjust again for “…for a blog.” Aww great, now it sounds like I’m beating on an author that has my dream job. Love these low-spec articles– I can always read hardware porn on Tom’s or Ars, but this here blurb addressed a topic that’s underserved.

Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 22:11 haldolium says: Do you use streaming? My laptop had the same issues, clocking down and getting too hot and also way too loud, so I tried streaming instead. With not too fast paced games that delivered solid FPS on my main rig it worked quite well. Haven’t had too much time to try it out more intense since my HDD crashed shortly after I began using it, but it sure delivered a better result as native rendered games did. At the end even older games frequently caused too much heat and noise, video encoding though was bearable and steady.

Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 19:34 haldolium says: Well I don’t know about others, but for me playing core games isn’t viable most of the time in any train or plane anyways, unless you pay a tremendous amount of money for traveling in a (good) 1st class in which case you might be able to get a proper rig anyways. I already abandoned deeper games on my PSP pretty fast back a decade ago, since I found an unstable environment distracting and disruptive to any kind of more involved gameplay. Turn based stuff might still work, but anything that needs fast action is out of the question for me personally. Log in to Reply 30/04/2017 at 23:17 icarussc says: Your baby is cute. That’s all.

I get a real kick out of playing games in pristine condition, at high resolution without or pop in aliasing or other compromises. For me laptop gaming is about going back far enough in time to get games that can still look their best. Dawn of War 1, Vampire Bloodlines and Crypt of the Necrodancer all worked great. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 11:39 Syrion says: I love playing lots of older games and actually prefer the graphics of many of those to more recent games, like the old X-Com, Doom or Quake. Also, I always try as much as possible to play games “as they were intended by the developer”, which means I played through Doom at 320×240 resolution and Quake with a software renderer that looks exactly like the DOS release (not just as a matter of principle, I just love the look!). For newer games, though, that means I also really don’t like turning down graphics options, as I just don’t want to lose details that were specifically made to be there. So, I’m fine with lowering resolution and not using anti-aliasing, but anything else always seems rather critical to me. So far, my “gaming laptop” has held up and I think the best it did was running Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag at 720p with high settings. But, when I get around to playing Fallout 4 and Doom 4 I suppose it’s going to get a bit trickier. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 04:57 Frankie The Patrician[PF] says: The graphics remind me of the Myth RTS series, which is not bad! For 90s, anyway. Yeah, I have been there – I remember trying to get Bioshock Demo get to work on my PC, which had a dedicated graphics card without a TnL functionality (GF2 MX, I think). I did get it to work via a specialty tool, but it ran really bad with many missing effects. Still, I was pretty excited to play it at least for a little bit. I got to play the game a few years later on a better machine. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 12:32 MajorLag says: It’s the landscape texture in Myth it’s reminding you of. Those games had brutally small textures stretched over the map mesh. It’s really noticeable with a modern patched version. Also, high-five for remembering that Myth existed. Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 16:45 Enkidum says: I wish someone would remake Myths I and II. The basic gameplay was superb, both in single-player and multiplayer, and I’ve never played anything else with that specific type of pure tactical combat with no resource management at all. And the writing + art assets, both sprites and loading screens, were so much better than… honestly virtually anything I’ve played before or since.

Results may vary, but I’ve had 2 Surface Pro 3s for work and both got to around -25mv on the GPU and -50mv on the CPU (I think that’s both pretty bad too). Google it, however, as you may need to look into disabling connected standby (which I hate anyway). With the the undervolt it will barely throttle at all under just CPU load and will take quite a lot more heat when gaming. (no, there is no chance of hardware damage, just crashes and a slight/minute chance of software corruption or losing unsaved work) Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 15:31 poliovaccine says: As someone currently doing most of their gaming on a laptop with almost exactly the same specs as the “clearly underpowered” one in this example, I gotta say, the struggle is real. The big broad bouncer of technological limitation keeps me out of the current gen of games – if it werent for titles like Tyranny and Diaries of a Spaceport Janitor I wouldnt be playing anything newer than 2014..! Gee you guys, The Witcher 2 was pretty interesting, wonder what they’ll cook up next..? Log in to Reply 01/05/2017 at 17:18 Kaeoschassis says: On an ancient, physically broken laptop bearing a particularly terrible intel graphics setup (which has all sorts of fun quirks, for example, glitching out like crazy anytime anything tries to do v-synch ever), and yeah, I know the feeling. There are entire generations of gaming I haven’t got to try yet. Sometimes, like Alec, I can get modern-ish games running pretty well if the devs were gracious enough to let me switch off unnecessary shine in the .cfg or .ini, but that’s always a big ‘if’. On the other hand, it’s really made me appreciate some games from the previous couple of generations that I might not even have bought otherwise, so there’s definitely a silver lining. Log in to Reply 02/05/2017 at 01:40 poliovaccine says: Totally hear you there – frankly, I’m in less of a hurry to upgrade than I could be – I took a years-long hiatus from gaming, so when I got interested again I was left with a huge backlog of classics I’d never heard of before. I only really feel the pinch when I remember the existence of things like MGSV.. or The Witcher 3… or Fallout 4, or DXMD, or Dishonored 2, or Dark Souls 3, or Resident Evil 7, or Prey, or… But some stuff really surprises me. For instance, I can run Shadow of Mordor at a solid 30-35 FPS. It’s because the devs let me ramp down the settings so low it damn near looks like Populous, but hey, I still play Populous sometimes too! That’s also why it bums me out to find I wasted a purchase on things like Anno 2270, which I thought should run fine, since it’s ostensibly the same thing as Anno 1440 in a spacesuit, right? Wrong, apparently. I can run a 3D open world with complex combat and dynamic, group AI out the hind area, but I cant run too recent of a city builder? What is it even doing that makes it so needy??

Log in to Reply 03/05/2017 at 10:26 BlueTemplar says: The Surface Pro 3 has a native resolution of 2160×1440 (3:2 or 13.5:9), which is _way_ too high in pixel density (216 ppi) for a 12.0 inches (30 cm) screen. You have to run it with scaling, which causes all sorts of issues with older software and additional screens – annoying for what is supposed to be a “Pro” device. So recently I settled on running it directly at 1440×900 (16:10), with no scaling. It’s the native horizontal resolution of 2160 divided by 1.5, so the blurriness is minimized, it has a pixel density of a bit more than 140 ppi, which feels not too dense, and the integrated graphics can better withstand games at that resolution. This also means I can run some games windowed at 1280×720. Log in to Reply 03/05/2017 at 19:06 Nolenthar says: Fun times. In the case of the author (being, an user having one normal PC and one non gaming PC), it’s good fun I admit. I have good fun as well playing on my laptop, even though I generally stick to old games just because, technically, a game is fun irrelevant if it was made in 2005 or in 2017. New games on a crappy hardware, it’s better to avoid it imo, as a new game on low settings generally look a lot worse than an old game on medium or high settings, for some reasons Log in to Reply 04/05/2017 at 17:53 Kamikaze-X says: What is the point of trying to run modern games on hardware that can’t handle it if it ends up looking like older games anyway? I had an Atom based tablet for a little while, and it was perfectly content running games like Rise of Nations, an absolutely fantastic yet by todays standards ancient game and it ran it great. we just cannot expect devs to cater for every single hardware combo out there, and you would buy hardware for a particular use case. Its like buying photoshop for your ZX Spectrum and complaining to adobe that it won’t work. Log in to Reply 08/05/2017 at 04:14 bill says: “What is the point of trying to run modern games on hardware that can’t handle it if it ends up looking like older games anyway?” Er.. usually the point is to be able to play modern games when you have older/weaker hardware. Playing older games is also an option of course. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply. Comment on this story You must be registered and logged in to post a comment.

In a note published on Friday, the company says it's published firmware fixes for most vulnerable kit. As readers should already know, Intel introduced the bug in 2010, and it turned out that an attacker need only offer an empty login string to Chipzilla's VPro AMT remote management firmware to access vulnerable systems. Intel has published a scanner for the bug, designated CVE-2017-5689. The company emphasises that “only those purchased with Intel AMT, SBT, or ISM capability are vulnerable”. Fixes are at Dell's support page. Systems still waiting for a fix are: Client System Firmware Version OptiPlex 9010 AIO 8.1.71.3608 OptiPlex 9010 8.1.71.3608 OptiPlex 790 7.1.91.3272 OptiPlex 990 7.1.91.3272 OptiPlex 780 6.2.61.3535 Latitude E6440 ATG 9.1.41.3024 Latitude E5530 8.1.71.3608 Latitude E6320 7.1.91.3272 Latitude E6420 7.1.91.3272 Latitude E6520 7.1.91.3272 Latitude E6420 XFR 7.1.91.3272 Latitude E6220 7.1.91.3272 Latitude XT3 7.1.91.3272 Latitude E4310 6.2.61.3535 Latitude E6510 6.2.61.3535 Latitude E6410 6.2.61.3535 Latitude E6410 ATG 6.2.61.3535 Precision T1650 8.1.71.3608 Precision M4600 7.1.91.3272 Precision M6600 7.1.91.3272 Precision T1600 7.1.91.3272 Precision T7600 7.1.91.3272 (WS) Precision T5600 7.1.91.3272 (WS) Precision T5600XL 7.1.91.3272 (WS) Precision T3600 7.1.91.3272 (WS) Precision T3600XL 7.1.91.3272 (WS) Precision M4500 6.2.61.3535 ® Tips and corrections Post a comment MORE Intel Dell Vulnerability Patch Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register You only need 60 bytes to hose Linux's rpcbind Sigh ... people just leave it on without blocking the port world+dog knows it uses.

Fitch credit rating reaffirmed Israel’s credit rating at A+, based on the stability of Israel’s economy, balance of payment surplus, expansion of foreign exchange reserves, decline of debt-GDP ratio from 95.2% in 2003 to 62.2% in 2016, decrease of budget deficit, natural gas potential, etc. (Globes, April 26, 2017). 4. The Economist Intelligence Unit (April 1): “Israel’s recent strong overall economic performance…. Real GDP grew by 4% in 2016, set to persist for most of the forecast period…. Export growth will pick up in 2017-18.  Further increases in gas output and a modest recovery in exports, particularly in new and established markets in Asia…. The Israeli Shekel’s strength against the Dollar will continue to pose challenges for policymakers…. The Shekel remains strong against the Euro and the British Pound…. Trade deficit will narrow steadily….  The opening of new production facilities by Intel will further boost technology goods exports, and natural gas exports will begin by the end of the forecast period.” 5.  Adam Reuter, the Founder & CEO of Israel’s Financial Immunities: Against all odds Israel’s aggregate economic growth since 2008 – 35%, almost twice the OECD average; Israel’s GDP per capita is almost $36,000, 24th in the world (while population is much younger than all advanced economies); Israel’s foreign exchange reserves exceed $100bn, one of the highest per capita in the world; debt-GDP ratio reduced substantially; unemployment decreases below 5%; higher participation in the labor market (more ultra-orthodox and Arab participation); Israel is the global leader in research & development investment per GDP (over 4%), employing 140 per 10,000 in research & investment (the US is second, employing 85 per 10,000); Israel is one of only eight countries developing, manufacturing and launching space modules; Israel is a global co-leader (with the US) in the area of unmanned aerial vehicles and second global power in cyber technology; over 350 global companies operate research & development centers in Israel, which has become the largest industrial global laboratory; Israel’s economy benefit from the highest fertility rate among advanced economies and net-positive-migration (no need to import labor force, in order to sustain economic growth); Israel’s income tax is one of the lowest among OECD countries; Israel’s technology transformed the country from inherent irrigation deficit to surplus (almost 90% of sewage is recycled – drinking water standard – for agriculture); offshore natural gas development is already bolstering the economy; etc. 6. Over 80 Israeli companies are traded on NASDAQ and eleven are traded on Australia’s Stock Exchange (Globes, April 28). 7. Israel’s defense industries exports surged 14% in 2016, reaching $6.5bn (Globes, March 30).  A $2bn missile export transaction concluded between India and Israel’s Aircraft Industry (Globes, April 6) Advertisement SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleChinese Billionaire Receives ‘Beloved of the Jewish People’ Award Next articleFeminists Don’t Love Ivanka Trump’s New Book for Working Women Yoram Ettinger Ambassador (ret.)

This is evident in how much we have grown through the ages. In 1999, the age of Indian Information Technology (IT) began with IT giants such as Intel, Wipro, Infosys, and TCS paving the way. In 2010, the global era struck us, bringing with it many more international players to the technology scene – think Accenture, Bosch, IBM, HCL and many more. The present is the era of start-ups. Start-ups that are too big and innovating so much so soon, that it almost doesn’t feel right to attribute the word ‘start-ups’ to them. Ola, Flipkart, Practo, Furlenco, Zomato and so many more that they are easier to recall today than the IT pioneers. Representation image. Reuters So, what has changed? We are currently in the middle of, what is popularly known as, the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution.’ Anybody who has been reading the news would know about the wave of automation that has hit most areas of work, all over the world, but specifically made its impact felt within the IT sector. Newspaper headlines around layoffs within these tech companies (old and new alike), and large manufacturing firms (automobiles, hardware, etc) have become extremely common these days, with managers often citing the need to keep up with changing business needs and technological transformations as the reasons for such downsizing. Without a doubt, the data and digital age is transforming and restructuring the working world as we know it and the pace of change is exponential. This is not only reflected in the economic impact the country is experiencing, but also wages. While many consider the new political scenario in the US to be the reason for tumbling IT stocks, the truth is that Indian IT exports have been declining for the past few years. In Karnataka itself, (given that it is home to Bangalore – the true Silicon Valley of India) in 2015-16, revenue from exports of electronics, IT software and BT fell by 65 percent from 2014-15, according to a newspaper report. In addition, in 2015-17,  tens of thousands of IT employees were laid off­ by giants like Wipro, Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services, and even start-ups like Flipkart. In the Indian IT Industry, revenue from digital technology projects is growing 7x faster than that from traditional projects. So, it is evident that we need to focus our (human) resources in the right areas and skill them for the jobs of tomorrow. Unfortunately, most policies around employment and skill training have stayed limited to blue-collar jobs rather than white collar ones. This has made us land up in a unique situation wherein our demographic dividend is at the risk of turning into a disaster. We have a surplus of low-skilled workers whereas we need to fill all the upcoming, high-skill jobs. In straight numbers: two million existing IT employees need to be reskilled in digital technology areas and 1.5 million new employees by 2025. What are some of these emerging roles? Data scientists, mobile app developers, compliance officers, social media architects, cloud integration specialists and thousands of other exciting opportunities are coming up. And beyond just skills upgradation is required to have a strong change in mindset amongst technology professionals. But how do we take on this mammoth task of upskilling more than three million people? Especially considering the obstacles that hinder our path to achieving this goal: 65 percent of IT employees are not retrainable 80 percent of engineering graduates are unemployable 50 percent of subject-knowledge acquired during the first year of a four-year technical degree is outdated by the time students graduate 65 percent of children entering school today will ultimately end up working in completely new job types that don’t yet exist It is, therefore, evident that we need to come up with new solutions, fast. Gone are the days – when individuals have to rely just on college education and hope that their employees will pay for their skill upgradation. It is important for professionals in the technology domain to take charge of their career and invest in their future. It is imperative for professionals to unlearn and relearn – and not expect someone else to take care of their careers. Let us be prepared then for what the knowledge economy holds for us, instead of painting a gloomy picture about the number of jobs being lost due to automation, we should be readying ourselves for the careers of tomorrow.

Little wonder that another expert suggested that cybersecurity is “by far” the biggest threat to small and medium enterprises. But with results of user education varying dramatically, it never hurts to have another technique to try to get them to use stronger passwords – or to work to secure employees’ home endpoint devices. If nothing else, a concerted effort at improving human defences now will help boost corporate defences to financial cybercrime – which is still keeping banks up at night. As always, reducing the chances of a serious compromise requires a commitment to addressing the basics. China is attempting to address the basics by using regular security checks on IT vendors that are designed to identify vulnerable Internet and networking services early on. They’d be wary of compromises such as a sneaky Gmail phishing attack, which incorporates a fake Google Docs app. That’s a problem given the reliance on cloud-based applications that, a Google executive said, can ease the burden of data protection compliance. Indeed, online platforms require particular vigilance as many warn that a phishing attack or ransomware infection may just be a lead indicator of a broader extortion or fraud attempt. Mac users were being warned about new malware – linked to Russian attackers who recently ported their Windows backdoor program to macOS – that snoops on encrypted connections, while the Xen project was hit with the third highly critical virtual-machine escape bug in 10 months, Intel rolled out a patch to fix a severe vulnerability in some Intel-based business computers, and Android got security patches for over 100 vulnerabilities affecting a range of components. Search engine Shodan took a new approach to botnet management, launching a service that enables security researchers and law enforcement officers to look for malware command-and-control servers. It’s a notable step forward that could help improve the response to new malware families. Security practitioners are still suffering threat alert fatigue, while employers are suffering their own form of fatigue as they try to derive meaning from the range of cybersecurity credentials in the market. This, as experts warned about tightening controls on third-party access and remaining extra vigilant when choosing the right cybersecurity products in the face of often dubious claims by cybersecurity product vendors. Read more Attack, detection metrics improve but security specialists warn against complacency Meanwhile, criminals are continuing to explore new methods for financial exploitation, with fraudulent gift cards becoming increasingly popular. Another group was abusing the Windows Application Compatibility Infrastructure to facilitate financial crimes, while others were notching up their success in compromising government agencies with a Frankenstein malware framework built from a range of publicly available tools. Others are sticking to old favourites, with the average ransomware demand now past $US1000 ($A1320). New technologies were causing other problems, too: India’s Supreme Court, for one, was hearing a challenge to a biometric authentication system that forces the use of biometrics identifiers when filing tax returns. These sorts of real-world problems are just some of the many challenges facing innovative security startups, who need to hedge their bets carefully to maximise their chances of survival.

Monday, May 8, 2017 A look inside San Jose politics and culture Twitter Facebook San Jose Inside San Jose Inside is made possible through support by: San Jose Inside (http://_/2017/05/01/san-jose-may-day-march-expected-to-draw-10000/) More News Opinion Investigative Reports The Fly Categories News Opinion Investigative Reports The Fly News Updated: Thousands Turn Out for May Day March in San Jose By Jennifer Wadsworth @jennwadsworth / May 1, 2017 11 Thousands of people have turned out for the May Day march in San Jose, and it’s safe to say not everyone is a fan of President Donald Trump. (Photo by Greg Ramar) At Silicon Valley’s march for International Workers Day, activists echoed a recurring theme: that the concerns of laborers overlap with those of all marginalized people. Organizers of San Jose’s May Day rally said Monday’s event also took on greater urgency because of President Donald Trump’s divisive rhetoric and attacks on civil rights. “Trump showed us that it’s so easy to play people against each other,” said Huy Tran, a 34-year-old attorney for the Justice at Work Law Group. “But I think this movement is a way to show that we’re all part of a bigger struggle.” Huy joined activists who marched from the Mexican Heritage Plaza in San Jose’s East Side to the SAP Center in downtown. Before the procession took off down Alum Rock Avenue, people cheered and clapped as speakers, poets and dancers took turns on the stage. The crowd responded periodically by chanting in unison. “Get up, get down, there’s a migrant movement in our town,” they shouted. “When our immigrants are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back!” “The people united will never be defeated.” Aztec dancers elaborately adorned in feathers led the way from the East Side to the heart of the city. Trailing behind them, a parade of hundreds that swelled into a conflux of about 3,000 as the evening wore on. One group of marchers carried a huge puppet-like effigy of Trump—orange face distorted in a wrinkled grimace, garish yellow hair, abnormally long red tie. Outside City Hall, activists took bats to “walls of alternative facts,” paper banners scrawled with falsehoods uttered by the Trump administration. Throughout the day, protest signs, costumes and homemade T-shirts inspired countless selfies and snapshots. Twenty-seven-year-old Jayden Lee wore the transgender pride flag as a cape. A woman dressed as the Statue of Liberty raised a torch in her right hand and in her left, a sign declaring that “no human being is illegal.” Students from the Roberto Cruz High School Leadership Academy held up bright and bold-lettered handmade signs. “Something smells bad in the White House,” one read. “We should flush it.” “Yes, he Klans!” “We didn’t cross the border, the border crossed us!!” “We are not immigrants, we are the original Americans.” Roberto Cruz High Principal Yesenia Marquez said a lot of her students were too afraid to show up to class after the November election. But the school held a town hall and a know-your-rights training that empowered the students to act. “Supporting our community means supporting immigrants,”Marquez said. Elsewhere, a poster took a shot at a tone-deaf commercial that tried to co-opt political resistance movements to sell soda. “We need papers, not Pepsi,” it read. “Justice is the opposite of just ICE,” quipped another sign, referencing Trump’s orders to ramp up U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportations. Rabbi Melanie Aron’s sign bore a phrase oft-repeated at the march, “No human being is illegal.” She said she attended with two other rabbis on behalf of a Jewish social justice organization called Bend the Arc. “For Jews, supporting immigrant rights comes partly from an identification with our history,” she said. “As a people, we have been refugees, we have been displaced and persecuted. But this is also about basic issues of justice.” People should have the right to keep their families intact, she said, as well as the right to housing and health care, to a dignified job and the chance to build healthy, stable lives. “For some of us, it was a struggle just to be here,” said Maria Guerrero, a 28-year-old barista at Intel. “Some people were scared to take the day off work.” Major tech companies that allowed employees to take the day off to protest had to be pressured to extend that commitment to vendors as well. Dozens of lawyers across the country—including Ruth Silver-Taube, of the Silicon Valley Wage Theft Coalition—offered to represent pro bono workers whose employers retaliate against them for taking the day off to protest. “Some people are still at risk,” Guerrero said. “Subcontractors are seen as less valuable.” At least Guerrero had reason to celebrate, she said. Her union, Unite Here Local 19, ratified a contract two weeks ago that raised the wage floor to $15 an hour and included protections for immigrant workers. The labor deal marked the culmination of nearly 20 months of organizing. Michael Sanchez, a Tesla worker on disability leave, said there’s a lot of fight left before he sees similar resolution at his workplace. Five years of 12-hour days installing underbody batteries at Tesla’s Fremont factory herniated two discs in his neck, leaving him in constant pain but with enough time to rally for stronger worker protections. But attempts to unionize 6,000 workers at the company’s East Bay facility have been met with intimidation and harassment, according the United Automobile Workers, which filed four complaints against Tesla with the National Labor Relations Board. “We’re trying to build a union, but there’s that fear factor,” Sanchez said. “People are afraid to speak up.” Jeff Powers, 73, said working conditions have deteriorated in the past two decades. When he became a passenger train conductor for Amtrak 20 years ago, he said, the crews were bigger and enjoyed more institutional support. “The loss of worker protections have led to understaffing in the railroad industry,” he said. “Crews have shrunk, which follows the trends in other industries to require fewer people to do more work.” Maricela Gutierrez, head of immigrant advocacy nonprofit SIREN, noted that South Bay labor activists have long championed immigration reform. But she said the coalition behind this year’s May Day demonstrations has never been more diverse, representing queer and transgender communities, religious and ethnic minorities, feminists, students, renters and every imaginable cross-section of the working class. Supporting each one of those groups means resisting federal policies that exclude refugees and target undocumented immigrants, said Rev. Rowan Fairgrove, a member of the activist group Rise Up for Justice. It also means pushing for laws that protect tenants from eviction and make health care a basic right, said Tom Linebarger, a retired painter and affordable housing advocate.  “This community belongs to all of us,” Gutierrez added, “and we must band together in this political climate to push back against harmful policies from the federal administration that promote hate and fear.” Nassim Nouri, a member of the Santa Clara County Green Party, said the same goes for environmental justice. She pointed to her sign, which named the party’s four core principles: social justice, ecology, democracy and peace. “We can’t stand for one of these without the other,” she said. “We stand for democracy, so we can have peace, so we can protect our ecology and promote social justice.” SJI May Day - 1 Thousands of people have turned out for the May Day march in San Jose, and it’s safe to say not everyone is a fan of President Donald Trump.

Reply TAXPAYER May 1, 2017 @ 12:25 pm “Businesses that have agreed to close their doors in solidarity are listed online, so people can thank them with their patronage at a later date.” None listed when I checked the organizer’s website. “coalition of marchers from groups representing immigrants, women, the LGBTQ community, teachers, Muslims and other religious affiliations, students and more.” Yet the march isn’t listed on DeFrank (LGBT), SBIA, SABA, or any other Muslim group I checked. South Bay Labor Council is MIA too. Would be interesting if SJI reported SIREN’s parade permit and costs for SJPD staffing and VTA impacts. Or a gift of public funds?

It is my hope that we never forget this fact and rededicate ourself to make sure it does not happen again. Liberty and property rights are the most fundamental human rights, the only protection from totalitarianism that is inherent in this singularly bad idea.

Apple will invest $1 billion to help create more U.S. manufacturing jobs and counter recurring criticism about its reliance on overseas factories to assemble most of its iPhones and other devices. AP urgent Apple steps up its effort to emphasize its economic impact Michael Liedtke and Christopher S. Rugaber AP Business Writers 15 hrs ago AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks during a 2016 announcement of new products in Cupertino, Calif. Apple will invest $1 billion to help create more U.S. manufacturing jobs and counter recurring criticism about its reliance on overseas factories to assemble most of its iPhones and other devices. SAN FRANCISCO — Apple is getting more aggressive about emphasizing its role in the U.S. economy, apparently hoping to counter recurring criticism over its reliance on overseas factories. On Wednesday, Apple for the first time released a state-by-state breakdown of where its 80,000 U.S. employees work, showing that more than half of them are located outside Silicon Valley. It also announced a $1 billion fund aimed at creating more U.S. manufacturing jobs, although it provided few details. The strategy appears aimed at complicating efforts by President Donald Trump and other politicians to vilify Apple for using companies in China and elsewhere to assemble most of its products. Apple had no comment on political ramifications of its announcements. CEO Tim Cook first described the manufacturing fund in an interview on CNBC, but didn't say how the money will be disbursed or who will be eligible to receive it. Apple will provide more details when it announces its first investment by the end of the month, he said. Apple's initial billion-dollar investment amounts to a tiny fraction of its $257 billion in cash. Cook also promised that Apple will hire "thousands of employees, thousands more in the future" in the U.S., although he didn't specify how quickly that will happen. Apple's U.S. payroll has grown roughly 40-fold since 1998, when it had 5,000 U.S. workers. Cook also said Apple is examining ways to help more people learn the programming skills to make apps. Threats to Apple Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on products from China, a change that would drive up Apple's costs. That could pressure the company to raise its prices at a time when it is already having trouble increasing its sales of iPhones and iPads. "They are trying to make the case that they really do have a lot of folks working in the U.S.," said technology industry analyst Rob Enderle. "So if you want to pick on somebody, you might want to pick on somebody else because they won't be a good example." Cook isn't the only CEO who has been trying to highlight his company's hiring and expansion plans in the U.S. Trump has attacked many companies, frequently on Twitter, for moving jobs out of the U.S. and lavishly praised those who have announced major hiring initiatives. As a result, many companies, including Exxon Mobil, Intel, Charter Communications and Ford Motor, have unveiled big hiring plans, though in many cases they were already in the works before the presidential campaign. "There is a lot of political pressure to create jobs in the United States," Diane Swonk, CEO of DS Economics, said. Chief executives "do not want to show up in a tweet." Apple in the states Since 2014, Apple has issued a series of reports intended to underscore its contributions to U.S. jobs and economic growth. Its first report came after years of complaints about labor practices and suicides at Foxconn, one of the company's major contractors in China, drew more attention to Apple's reliance on overseas factories. Apple to also issues a separate "supplier responsibility" report reviewing the labor conditions in those facilities. The Wednesday report on U.S jobs is its fourth update, but the first to include a state-by-state breakdown of Apple employees. Unsurprisingly, the numbers show its highest concentration of workers (36,786) is located in California, home to the company's Silicon Valley headquarters and 53 stores. Apple's second biggest employment center is in Texas (8,407 jobs), where it has a corporate campus and 18 stores. Its smallest pockets of employment are in North Dakota (four jobs), Vermont (six) and Wyoming (seven). Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

Apple's decision to provide detailed information about the locations of its U.S. employees could help the company win support from lawmakers eager to protect jobs in their states, Enderle said. "It gives senators something to push back with, recognizing that Apple is a real risky company to target anyway because its products are so popular with people." Besides showing how many of its full-time and part-time employees work in each state, Apple also lists where its 9,000 U.S. suppliers are located. The company says it spent more than $50 billion at its U.S. suppliers last year, helping them employ a total of 450,000 workers. App economy The company also cited a study by the Progressive Policy Institute that attributes 1.5 million U.S. jobs to Apple's iPhone "ecosystem." That figure not only includes programmers that work on the apps, but also supporting staff and employees working everywhere from banks to restaurants that have jobs because of the spending generated by apps. Such "spillover" effects are widely recognized, although economists sometimes spar over their magnitude. But for a company to claim credit for all or most of the jobs in a particular industry is a stretch, Swonk said. The vast majority of app developers, for example, also produce apps for Android phones from Samsung and other manufacturers. The Public Policy Institute only found 1.7 million jobs in the entire "app economy" — and 1.35 million of those were associated with Android apps. Most of those overlap with the jobs linked to Apple.

The 51-year-old, who revealed in 2015 that he is HIV- positive, struggled with a number of serious side effects after prescribing to the medicines. "They (the drugs) kept me suppressed and alive, but I struggled with a constant migraine and at times, borderline dementia," said Sheen.

However, we can add some new data as a Core i7 8650U processor has been spotted in the GFXBench database. The Core i7 8650U is based on kaby lake architecture, thus not Cannon Lake. The u series is mobile and Core i7 8650U will be fabbed at 14nm FiNFET. According to Intel these processors should ne up-to 15% faster and more power efficient.  If you look at the benchmark report the Core i7 8650U is clocking in at 1.90 GHz, which undoubtedly will clock higher with some sort of Turbo. Intel earlier on indicated that these models would be able to do up-to 4.0 GHz Turbos. The Integrated Graphics is listed as HD Graphics 620. The Kaby Lake refresh will be will be fabbed at an improved 14nm ++ procedure and should hit the market in the second half of 2017. Before that we should still see a Skylake-X and  Coffee Lake processors launch. Source: computerbase via hardware.info Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ... Not the best 3 ... Average 4 ...

If one or more of these factors are not my liking I won't bother at all or keep an eye on Skylake-X (if affordable for once)... Although I heard Coffee Lake-X is where it's at :p kidding Aura89 Ancient Guru Posts: 5890 Joined: 2008-07-31 #5428931 Posted on: 05/06/2017 10:01 PM Quote: Originally Posted by Undying Kaby was more like 5% faster than Skylake. Quote: Originally Posted by Stone Cold Clock for clock, Kaby Lake is 0% faster than Skylake. This is my point. Not saying kaby lake was 0% faster clock for clock, but every single time Intel has made claims (in the last few years) of a new family being faster, they base "faster" on it being clocked higher, rather then really any real performance increase clock for clock. I mean, i get it, if you could last year get a processor for $300 at 3.4Ghz, and they claim that this year you can get a processor at $300 that is 15% faster, and the only thing that has changed is the newly released processor is now 3.9Ghz, that's not a "wrong" statement. I'm just getting tired of them continually claiming faster architectures when in reality its faster clocks that 99% of the time was capable on the previous architecture no problem.

Which is important, i agree, but that doesn't make a processor faster like Intel continually claims, that makes it more efficient. Again, which is great, especially for portable devices, but doesn't mean it's faster. You don't state a car that goes 50mpg with the 200 horsepower is 15% faster then a car that goes 44mpg with the same 200 horsepower, it's just more efficient. -Tj- Ancient Guru Posts: 13673 Joined: 2012-05-18 #5428942 Posted on: 05/06/2017 11:11 PM Quote: Originally Posted by EL1TE I'm waiting for Cannonlake, if it's just 15% better than 7th gen with 8 cores, i'll probably just buy a Ryzen 7 since they will go down on price by then and i bet Intel will overprice their CPUs like always. <_< Wait a bit further, CannonLake is still old stuff since SandyBridge era, next step is x86 refresh with IceLake Arch [img]https://s21.postimg.org/7vzpjszcn/icelake.png[/img] and by AMD around that time Zen+ I personally will wait until then ~ 2019-2020 and see what's up, this i7 Haswell is still more then enough TheF34RChannel Master Guru Posts: 272 Joined: 2015-06-06 #5428948 Posted on: 05/07/2017 12:08 AM That ice lake refresh will be very, very welcome (if it's good).

There won't be a Kaby Lake refresh in the sense the article states it. The 8 series is Coffee Lake, so the chip shown is exactly that.

Quote: Originally Posted by Stone Cold Clock for clock, Kaby Lake is 0% faster than Skylake. This is my point. Not saying kaby lake was 0% faster clock for clock, but every single time Intel has made claims (in the last few years) of a new family being faster, they base "faster" on it being clocked higher, rather then really any real performance increase clock for clock. I mean, i get it, if you could last year get a processor for $300 at 3.4Ghz, and they claim that this year you can get a processor at $300 that is 15% faster, and the only thing that has changed is the newly released processor is now 3.9Ghz, that's not a "wrong" statement. I'm just getting tired of them continually claiming faster architectures when in reality its faster clocks that 99% of the time was capable on the previous architecture no problem.

Which is important, i agree, but that doesn't make a processor faster like Intel continually claims, that makes it more efficient. Again, which is great, especially for portable devices, but doesn't mean it's faster. You don't state a car that goes 50mpg with the 200 horsepower is 15% faster then a car that goes 44mpg with the same 200 horsepower, it's just more efficient.

AMD's Technical Marketing Lead, Robert Hallock, confirmed that B die chips from Samsung were the best for out-of-the-box compatibility with Ryzen processors, and allowed for the highest overclocking results as well.

Supplier Lenovo Price $998 AUD > Pricing info Tweet Email this Print this Feedback This is one convertible that's not afraid to Miix things up. Oh look, another top-spec tablet with detachable keyboard and pressure-sensitive stylus. Must be a new Surface Pro, right? Not so fast - Microsoft isn't the only one cranking out high-end hybrids. The Miix 510 is Lenovo's take on the tech, one that borrows more than a bit of design inspiration from the company's Yoga range of convertible laptops. Because hinges that look like watch bands will apparently never go out of fashion. What'll really make you sit up and take notice, though? The Miix 510 goes toe-to-toe with the Surface Pro, and even exceeds it in some areas, but somehow does it for significantly less cash. LENOVO MIIX 510 DESIGN & BUILD A mix of magnesium and aluminium give the Miix 510 a classy look, and it feels every bit the premium tablet when you pick it up. Those watch band hinges on the back are the only real design flourish, but they're functional as well. They let you tilt the kickstand to almost any angle, so you can work, watch, or sketch on the screen at whatever position you find comfortable. It's stiff enough to hold the screen in place, but you can still adjust it with one hand. The whole thing feels sturdy and well-built, with no unsightly flex or bend from the metal chassis. It's a bit portly, compared to a Surface Pro, but still light enough to hold in one hand - with the keyboard detached, anyway. There's still room at the sides for a full-size USB port, USB-C and a headphone jack, but the microSD card slot has been hidden underneath the kickstand. At least you get one at all - it'll save you having to lug an adapter around wherever you go. The detachable keyboard isn't quite so slick, with synthetic leather that isn't fooling anyone, but it's a lot more subtle than Microsoft's bright alcantara covers. It hooks into the tablet with magnets and a dedicated connector, so you don't have to mess around with Bluetooth pairing or recharging. LENOVO MIIX 510 KEYBOARD & STYLUS You won't have to break out the credit card to get any work done on the Miix 510 - both the detatchable keyboard cover and digital stylus are included in the box. The former is fine to type on, even if there's some noticeable flex in the tray once you start tapping on keys. This isn't too much of a pain when you're sat at a desk, but gets worse when you're working on your lap. It's backlit, which is handy when you're working late, but there's not a huge amount of travel or feedback in each key. It's great to see Lenovo sticking to a standard layout, too, instead of trying to cram extra keys in and messing with your muscle memory. Still, Surface Pro's Type Cover still has the edge overall. The touchpad beneath is a little on the small side, but tracks your finger accurately and lets you pull off multi-touch gestures too. As far as hybrid touchpads go, it's one of the best. For some strange reason, though, you can't use the keyboard and touchpad at the same time. You won't notice in everyday use, but it pretty much rules the Miix 510 out for gaming, unless you plug in a controller or mouse. Holding the W key to move in Minecraft will actively stop you from clicking or looking around with the touchpad. It's really quite annoying. Lenovo's digital stylus takes a single AAAA battery - making this the first time I've ever encountered one. It works just as well as Microsoft's Surface Pen, detecting pressure as you'd expect. The Windows 10 Anniversary update made stylus inputs that little bit easier to use, too - so you'll actually want to scribble onscreen. The bundled carrying case has a slot for storing it when you're not using it, or you can plug a tiny plastic grip into the USB port and keep it close by while you're typing instead. LENOVO MIIX 510 SCREEN AND SOUND It might use an IPS panel instead of AMOLED, but the Miix 510 has fantastic contrast and really inky blacks. It makes videos pop off the 12.2in panel, and should come in handy for anyone that spends all day staring at Photoshop. Colours are delightfully vibrant at full brightness, but it can't quite match the Surface Pro 4 even when cranked up to the max. Microsoft's convertible is that little bit easier to use in direct sunlight. Viewing angles aren't the best, either, so you'll have to bunch in tightly to share the screen with more than one other person. The bezels are a little on the chunky side, too. The biggest issue, for anyone deciding between this and a Surface, anyway, is resolution. The Miix 510 opts for a Full HD 1920x1200 panel, which is fine for regular work but falls behind Microsoft's 2736x1824 display. If every pixel matters (say you're a graphic designer or photographer) then it might be worth spending the extra for a Surface Pro 4. At least the speakers are decent. They're loud enough to fill a small room with sound, and can drown out the sound of a boiling kettle when you're trying to catch up on Masterchef in the kitchen, but for any critical listening you'll still want to plug in a proper pair of cans. LENOVO MIIX 510 PERFORMANCE & BATTERY LIFE With a 7th gen Intel Kaby Lake CPU at its heart, the Miix 510 isn't messing around when it comes to power. This isn't a fanless Core M chip, but a full-fat mobile processor that'll easily handle your day-to-day desktop work, even if that includes image and video editing. OK, so it isn't silent, like the Miix 700, but you certainly can't call it noisy, either. Unless you're working in an echo chamber, you won't notice the fans whirring away over any general background noise. The vents point upwards, anyway, so the hot air is forced away from you. The 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD in our review sample helped keep Windows 10 feeling smooth, with no major slowdown or stutter unless you max out on browser tabs or try running seriously intensive software. It comfortably outpaces a Surface Pro 4 for all 2D jobs, which still uses a previous-gen Core i5 CPU. Intel's HD 620 graphics are a small step up from last year, and can even handle a few older games, but anything new will still bring it to its knees. Stick to simple stuff like card battler Hearthstone, and you'll be fine. Battery life is the only real sore point, and even then depends what you're actually doing with the thing.. Streaming video? Expect to run out of juice in less than five hours. Just typing up emails? Keep the brightness around 50% and you should nudge six or seven. It's not long enough that you can leave the power adapter at home, but it's still respectable compared to other convertibles. LENOVO MIIX 510 VERDICT By matching the Surface Pro in almost every area, the Miix 510 is a fantastic alternative to Microsoft's killer convertible. It's cheaper, more powerful, and has a keyboard in the box, instead of making you buy one separately. It's not perfect, though. The screen resolution is lacking, and that keyboard hints at how Lenovo has managed to keep the costs down. You've still got to carry a power cord around with you, too - not just because battery life is only average, but because it doesn't use USB-C to keep charged up. Still, if you've been eyeing up a hybrid but couldn't justify spending all that cash on a Surface, the Miix 510 is a great buy.

Patterson encored the event last May with a personal 16-minute history, chronicling his days as a wrestler in high school and college and a math major at UCLA, followed by a job at Hughes Aircraft and four decades at Berkeley. From writing two books with Stanford University's John Hennessy to chairing the Computing Research Association, Patterson told the audience that a key to his success was doing "one big thing at a time." His next big thing could be enormous. Rather than hitting the beach after retirement, Patterson joined Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL) in July to work on an ambitious new chip that's designed to run at least 10 times faster than today's processors and is sophisticated enough to handle the intensive computations required for artificial intelligence. It's called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), and Patterson has emerged as one of the principal evangelists. He spoke to about 100 students and faculty members at the Berkeley campus on Wednesday, a few days shy of the anniversary of his retirement celebration. "Four years ago they had this worry and it went to the top of the corporation," said Patterson, 69, while sporting a T-shirt for Google Brain, the company's research group. The fear was that if every Android user had three minutes of conversation translated a day using Google's machine learning technology, "we'd have to double our data centers," he said. Google parent Alphabet already spends $10 billion a year on capital expenses, largely tied to data center costs. And now it's addressing what it calls a "renaissance in machine learning." Deep neural networks, or computers that are modeled to learn and get smarter over time as data sets get bigger and more complicated, require big breakthroughs in hardware efficiency. Patterson, who gave the same talk at Stanford on Thursday, was among the lead authors on a report from Google last month on the TPU's performance. The report concluded that the TPU is running 15 to 30 times faster and 30 to 80 times more efficient than contemporary processors from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The paper, written by 75 engineers, will be delivered next month at the International Symposium on Computer Architecture in Toronto. The report was Patterson's debut project at Google. Once a week he treks down to the Mountain View headquarters and twice a week he works at the company's office in San Francisco. He reports to Jeff Dean, an 18-year Google veteran and head of Google Brain. It's not Patterson's first Google gig — he worked there while on academic sabbatical from 2013 to 2014. This time, he joined the TPU project as a distinguished engineer, a year after the chips were first put to use in Google's data centers and just two months after his retirement party. Not really a retirement Patterson has never been one to sit idle. In 2013, while still teaching, he participated in a powerlifting competition — and set a new California state record for his age group. "Now that I think back, there was no evidence for the assumption that he was retiring except that it was called a retirement celebration," said Mark Hill, a PhD student of Patterson's in 1987, and one of the speakers at his party. Hill, who now chairs the computer sciences department at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, said that in computer architecture Patterson is "on the short list of the great ones of the last half of the 20th century." He called the computer architecture book that Patterson wrote with Hennessy the field's most influential textbook of the last 25 years. Google says the TPU is being tested broadly across the company. It's used for every search query as well as for improving maps and navigation, and it was the technology used to power DeepMind's AlphaGo victory over Go legend Lee Sedol last year in Seoul. But don't expect Google to compete in the semiconductor market against the likes of Intel and Nvidia. Outside developers who want the sort of performance that Google's processors can offer have to turn to the company's cloud computing service and products like TensorFlow, an open-source software library for machine learning workloads. Read More "They're much better at building tools for themselves than for others," said Chris Nicholson, co-founder and CEO of deep learning start-up Skymind. "They've never really succeeded as a hardware company and I don't see them pursuing that strategy." At least one start-up may be trying to fill in the gaps where Google won't tread. Several engineers from the project have teamed up with investor Chamath Palihapitiya to form a mysterious start-up called Groq . It's still very early days for the TPU. Thus far, the processor has proven effective at what's called inference, or the second phase of deep learning. The first phase is training and — as far as we know — for that Google still counts on off-the-shelf processors. But Google is famous for keeping quiet about its most cutting-edge projects. During his speech at Berkeley, Patterson was asked what's next for his team. He didn't take the bait. Patterson said that one thing he's learned at Google is that, unlike in academia, he's not allowed to talk publicly about future products. "I can say that Google isn't resting," he said. "It seemed like it was a good experience. They didn't give up. Nobody got laid off."

Previously, he spent five years writing, copy-editing and producing at "CNN Headline News," three years writing, copy-editing and training writers at MSNBC, and also served several local TV newsrooms as producer, executive producer and assistant news director.

Follow Subscribe to feed Share on Facebook Share on Twitter ShareEmail  Print WASHINGTON – Statistics contained within an official government report indicate the Obama administration requested the unmasking of almost three times as many Americans under surveillance during the election year of 2016 than during the year before. Unmasking is the revealing of names within the intelligence community of U.S. citizens whose communications were monitored during foreign surveillance. The director of national intelligence released a report at the end of April titled, “Statistical Transparency Report Regarding Use of National Security Authorities.” It contains a chart that shows the identities of 1,934 Americans were unmasked upon requests made by the Obama administration in 2016. That was nearly triple the number of those unmasked upon request the year before, which was a total of 654. Writing an analysis of the report in Powerline, attorney John Hinderaker pointed out the significance of an explanatory note that claimed, virtually as a footnote, the sudden jump in unmaskings was due to a change in methodology from 2015 to 2016. The note claimed the 2015 report “provided the number of approved requests (i.e., 654) for unmasking of U.S. person identities, rather than the number of U.S. person identities that were released. A single request may contain multiple U.S. person identities. This year’s (2016) report provides the number of U.S. person identities referred to by name or title released in response to specific requests to unmask those identities.” But no explanation is given for why the accounting method should have suddenly changed, or precisely how that change accounted for such a dramatic increase. The note simply said, “A single request may contain multiple U.S. person identities.” It did not say such requests sought, on average, three separate identities. It also did not provide statistics to prove that, in fact, was the case. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper The report was released at the end of April, meaning it was compiled under the Obama administration. Dan Coats became the director of national intelligence on March 16. The report was prepared under his predecessor, James Clapper, who served in that position from August 9, 2010 until January 20, 2017. That is the same DNI Clapper who lied to Congress in March 2013, by answering, “No,” when asked, “Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?” Revelations made just months later by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden forced Clapper to admit his answer had been untrue. Another Obama administration official who lied about spying was former National Security Adviser Susan Rice who, during an appearance on PBS on March 22, denied any knowledge of the unmasking of associates of candidate and President-elect Trump, collected in foreign surveillance. Two weeks later, multiple reports identified Rice as the Obama administration official who requested the unmasking of incoming Trump administration officials on several occasions. As WND reported, Rice implicitly acknowledged she was not telling the truth when she did not deny the reports in a subsequent interview with NBC. Like the reporting you see here? Sign up for free news alerts from WND.com, America’s independent news network. In his analysis of the 2015 and 2016 DNI reports of unmasking, Hinderaker says the discrepancies “cry out for witness testimony.” National Security Adviser Susan Rice And, “First on that list is Susan Rice, but she has already refused to appear before the Senate subcommittee investigating this matter. That is no surprise; stonewalling was the Obama administration’s invariable response to scandal.” “Obama and his minions stonewalled successfully for two terms, and there is no reason to doubt that they can keep it up for two more terms – Trump’s,” he added. Hinderaker points out that the figure citing the number of Americans unmasked by requests in 2015 “was flatly wrong.” That was why, he said, “The data in these two reports cry out for witness testimony. Only witnesses familiar with the processes described in the reports, and who know which Obama officials requested ‘unmasking’ of American citizens, and why, can shed meaningful light.” On Wednesday, Rice declined a request from U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., to testify before a judiciary subcommittee hearing next week on alleged Russian interference in the presidential election. Were she to appear, Rice would undoubtedly be asked details about her unmasking of Trump associates and whether it was for political purposes, rather than national security. President Trump has claimed the Obama administration spied on him and his associates. On Thursday, the president tweeted: “Susan Rice, the former National Security Advisor to President Obama, is refusing to testify before a Senate Subcommittee next week on allegations of unmasking Trump transition officials. Not good!” Also on Thursday, Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., said Congress may subpoena Rice to compel her to testify. Gowdy told Fox News, “There are things called subpoenas. You shouldn’t have to use it with a former national security adviser, but if you do, you do.” “Members of Congress don’t pick the witnesses. Lawyers don’t pick witnesses. The facts pick the witnesses,” he added. “And whether Ambassador Rice likes it or not, she’s a really important fact witness.” On Friday, former presidential candidate Sen. Ron Paul, R-Ky, announced he has formally requested the White House and House and Senate intelligence committees provide information on whether the Obama administration spied on him, and any other presidential candidates or members of Congress. He tweeted: “Did the Obama admin go after presidential candidates, members of Congress, journalists, clergy, lawyers, fed judges? “Did the Obama admin use warrantless “wiretapping” on other candidates besides @realDonaldTrump? “I have formally requested from the WH and the Intel Committees info on whether I was surveilled by Obama admin and or the Intel community!” Also on Friday, Paul told Breitbart that “several sources” had told him that the Obama administration spied on his presidential campaign. “We’ve had several people come to us and say that it happened. I don’t have access to that information, but I’ve been very concerned that too many Americans’ information is being culled through without a warrant,” he said. “I don’t have any facts to say it happened,” added the senator. “But numerous sources are coming to us saying it did happen so I want to search through, find out why I wasn’t notified. Was it on purpose?” “There’s a lot of things to be found out, particularly since we found out that Susan Rice was unmasking people and we need to know was there a political motivation, because one of the real dangers in a free society is if government gets so powerful it’s listening to all of our phone calls, the possibility of extortion, the possibility of blackmail — all of that goes up exponentially.” Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break!

Published on May 7, 2017. 0 As far as the hybrid tablet market goes, it’s no secret that Microsoft has dominated it for years with their Surface Pro line. The Microsoft Surface Pro tablets are everyone’s favorites when it comes to hybrid devices, a.k.a. a tablet that can also stand in place of a laptop successfully by attaching a keyboard and mouse to it. However, Samsung has tried to keep up with the trend and overtake some of Microsoft’ monopoly on said market with its Samsung Galaxy Book 2 tablet. The Korean tech giant has made a bold and brazen statement about their tablet, declaring that it will rival with the upcoming Microsoft Surface Pro 5. The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 hasn’t been launched yet, but rumor has it that it’s going to be spectacular. The tablet is speculated to come with Intel’s latest Kaby Lake design, as well as an improved display, 16GB of RAM and 512G in storage. The Surface Pro 5 will also have a restyled Surface Pen with a wireless charging option. The tablet is expected to come this fall. Samsung Galaxy Book 2 cannot compare with its 4GB of RAM, and although it comes in two screen sizes, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 simply has no contender on the market right now. However, it’s important to note that the tablet hasn’t launched yet, so who knows how it will look like. The Surface Pro 5 is expected to launch this fall, and we’ll just have to wait for that particular (still unset) date to find out how the hybrid tablet will be. Until then, the Samsung Galaxy Book 2 is a viable option as far as hybrid tablets go. It just depends on you whether you want one now, or are willing to wait a bit more and get your hands on the Microsoft Surface Pro 5.

If you are a subscriber, simply log in or Subscribe now! It’s a mistake to damage the building blocks Oregon needs for a strong economy — yet it’s one of the possibilities the state faces. It’s in the way the Legislature decides how to fill the $1.6 billion hole in the next biennial budget. Legislators are trying to mend the financial mistakes of previous legislatures which ignored the long-term costs of the state’s pension system. Legislature after legislature kicked the problem down the road until it became too big. Now the problem calls for a real answer from the legislative class of 2017. × Advertisement Among those building blocks for Oregon’s future — perhaps even its keystone — is the state’s higher education system, seven universities that provide education necessary to participate in the modern economy. They also bring research dollars into the state and work with scientists and industry to find the “next big thing.” The universities serve as magnets for industrial development, which is one of the approaches targeted in Klamath Falls with Oregon Tech. Oregon Tech already generates $75 million and 700 jobs for the Klamath County economy and another $32 million annually and 300 jobs in the Portland metro area, according to figures furnished by the school. Local economic development officials are trying to expand it. At the top year after year Oregon Tech’s well-deserved reputation for excellence is demonstrated year after year as it chalks up the higher ed system’s highest “success” rate — 98 percent for the class of 2016, with an average annual starting of $57,000. Success is defined as being employed or in graduate school within six months of graduation. When it comes to return on investment for the state’s taxpayers, Oregon Tech is at the top. Legislators should keep that in mind as they struggle through the budget process which, this time around, is likely to be dominated by decisions on what gets cut. The state’s university system has felt the cuts many times. So have students through tuition increases. During the past 10 years, support from the state slipped during the recession, moving more of the cost to students. State support began a slow recovery in 2012-13 but still hasn’t gotten back to the 2007 level in state dollars per full-time equivalent student in inflation-adjusted dollars. We could go on and on about the need, which is valid; about the university system’s economic and cultural impact wherever it has a branch; about Oregon Tech’s special contributions not just to Klamath County and the Wilsonville area but to Oregon as a whole as it produces well-qualified graduates for such Oregon-linked companies as Boeing, Intel, Jeld-Wen, Sky Lakes Medical Center and Microsoft. Sports lottery fund at risk The university system’s presidents have asked for a 2017-19 budget of $765 million, compared to the present $667 million budget which is also Gov. Kate Brown’s recommended budget for the next years. Her budget also proposes to remove the $13 million the schools get through the sports lottery fund, which is the reason that some sports at the smaller schools, such Oregon Tech, can even exist. The University of Oregon and Oregon State University have other major sources of funds, such as TV revenue, but the other schools have to have those funds to keep all of their programs alive. Sports programs can also be an incentive to come to Oregon Tech for students who, in addition to being good scholars also want to keep playing a sport they love. Those students also attract others to the university, such family members and friends. An active sports program is definite plus. Whether that continues is going to be up to the Legislature. Engineering building possible In the way of capital improvements, the big legislative goal for Oregon Tech this year is funding for the $42 million Cornett Hall Renovation and Center for Excellence in Engineering and Technology. It would integrate various parts of the College of Engineering, serving 500 more students increasing classrooms and research capability and provide training that makes the route to graduation faster and students more prepared to work in sophisticated professional labs when they graduate. The building is the seventh-highest priority among higher-education capital construction projects which gives it a good chance of being approved. We don’t envy the legislators’ job, having to weigh one necessity against other as the $1.6 billion juggernaut comes rolling down the road. But in addition to simply surviving another biennium, they need to look to the future, and that’s where the higher education system, and Oregon Tech, should loom large.

The event is scheduled to take place in Shanghai on May 23. By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: May 7, 2017 6:50 pm Microsoft to host another hardware-related event on May 23. ( Image credit: Microsoft) Just days after launching the Windows 10 S operating system and the Surface Laptop, Microsoft will host another Surface-related event.  The announcement will be made in Shanghai on May 23. Microsoft’s VP of devices, Panos Panay went to Twitter and Instagram to tease the event, but there’s absolutely no details beyond the #Surface hashtag. Microsoft’s web page for the event just says that May 23, the company will “show the world what’s next” in Shanghai. See you in Shanghai. May 23. #MicrosoftEvent #Surface http://t.co/aMgvkkqE52 pic.twitter.com/vzcK9MqIpf — Panos Panay (@panos_panay) May 5, 2017 According to the Verge, however, Microsoft confirmed to the publication that it will reveal a new hardware. The company might launch the Surface Pro 5 at its China event, given that fact that the Surface Pro 4 was launched way back in 2015. Microsoft isn’t telling when it plans to release the successor to the Surface Pro 4, but several reports already suggest that the next-generation device will be launched soon. Sounds like Surface Pro 4.5. — Paul Thurrott (@thurrott) April 6, 2017 Last month, technology blogger Paul Thurrott had said that the new 2-in-1 might not be a major revamp and could be more like a “Surface Pro 4.5”. It will reportedly feature Intel’s seventh-generation “Kaby Lake” processors and will reportedly use the same Surface Connect power connector. Microsoft is holding the event in Shanghai, the location might mean that the announcement could be related to the Chinese market. Panos himself will be present at the event giving more air to the rumour that a major announcement is on the cards. It’s possible that Microsoft could unveil a Surface-branded smartphone. This  rumour has been recently backed up CEO Satya Nadella, who said that the next phone from the Redmond-based giant will not even resemble a typical smartphone. Microsoft’s event will be held in Shanghai on May 23 at 7 pm local time. A live stream will be provided by the company.

The day before France's most momentous presidential election in recent history, authorities were still investigating the "massive and coordinated piracy action" that independent candidate Emmanuel Macron reported just minutes before the campaign's official end on Friday (May 5) night. The data dump, the Macron campaign said, involved thousands of non-incriminating emails and other internal communications - some of which, the campaign insisted, were fake. In a year of populist upheaval, this was the nightmare scenario for many observers, immediately reminiscent of the American election - in which, as US intelligence agencies recently concluded, Russian President Vladimir Putin commissioned an "influence campaign" to benefit Mr Donald Trump. Get The Straits Times newsletters in your inbox Sign Up The identity of the hacker remains unconfirmed, but the parallels were clear enough in Paris and Washington: Mr Macron, an independent centrist candidate and staunch defender of the European Union, is facing off against Ms Marine Le Pen, a far-right populist whose party has relied on Russian banks in the past and who favours pivoting France's foreign policy toward the Kremlin. In March, Ms Le Pen met personally with Putin on a visit to Moscow. "Intervening in the last hour of the official campaign, this operation is obviously a democratic destabilization, as has already been seen in the United States during the last presidential campaign," the Macron campaign said, stopping short of assigning blame. The sentiment was echoed across the Atlantic, with Rep Adam Schiff (California), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, warning that the hacking, if successful, "would represent yet another dangerous escalation of cyberinterference in a Western nation's democracy." But amid France's government-mandated day of silence that always precedes election day - when candidates are strictly prohibited from campaigning in any way - the impact of the leaks on the election remained to be seen. In the French press, the leaks received comparatively little coverage: In keeping with French campaign law, reporting on the emails' contents could result in criminal charges. On Saturday, France's electoral commission urged journalists and media organisations to heed "the sense of responsibility they must demonstrate, as at stake are the free expression of voters and the sincerity of the election" itself. Mr Ben Nimmo, a research fellow with the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, said in an interview that enthusiasm for the leaks was scarcely discernible beyond the far-right, pro-Le Pen online circles that had circulated them in the first place. "It doesn't seem at this stage that there are lots of high-profile non-Le Pen accounts jumping in and spreading the message around," he said of social-media patterns surrounding the leaks. "They have kept their constituency - and they have galvanized their constituency - but they haven't necessarily stepped outside of that constituency." Most French voters interviewed on the streets of the capital the day before the vote shrugged off the hack. The stakes are much too high to be bothered by compromising internal campaign documents, they said. Mr Paul Lotere, a 29-year-old civil servant, said he was most upset that Mr Macron had no chance to respond given the strict campaign curfew. He plans to vote for the former finance and economy minister and said he has no interest in the documents until their veracity is confirmed. "Ah, yes, 'hashtag Macron leaks,'" sneered Mr Alain Chappotteau, a 51-year-old psychologist, repeating the Twitter tagline popularizing the news. "With all the fuss, all the tricks, in this campaign, what's one more? I'm voting for my child's future. This doesn't matter." Although the hacker remained unknown, Mr Nimmo said, the social-media campaign following the Macron data dump originated in the United States, in a well-known network of alt-right Twitter accounts. The #MacronLeaks Twitter storm - notably in English, not French - largely began with the account of Jack Posobiec, a Washington-based correspondent for the alt-right website TheRebel.media, Mr Nimmo said. Posobiec has written that he served, in 2016, as "Special Projects Director of Citizens for Trump, the largest Trump grassroots organisation in the US," according to an article Mr Nimmo wrote on the Macron case. From there, Mr Nimmo said, news of the Macron leaks - allegedly containing details of offshore accounts and tax evasion - was retweeted by Mr William Craddick, another alt-right activist known to have spread in December a fake news story about German Chancellor Angela Merkel tolerating Islamic State terrorists to deploy an EU "army" to subdue her country's neighbors. Eventually, Mr Nimmo added, the leaks began to be retweeted by well-known National Front accounts - reaching 47,000 tweets in just three hours. Despite France's strict prohibition on campaigning after the deadline, the National Front's deputy leader Florian Philippot tweeted early Saturday morning: "Will #Macronleaks teach us something that investigative journalism has deliberately killed?" For months now, Ms Le Pen has also received exceedingly positive coverage in Russian state media. Meanwhile, those news outlets have pilloried Macron, accusing him of being secretly gay and of embezzling public funds. To date, most of those rumours seem to have had little effect on French voters. Throughout the election, Mr Macron has frequently said that his campaign has been the target of Russian meddling, though the Kremlin has repeatedly denied those accusations. In a report issued last month, researchers at the cybersecurity firm Trend Micro linked intrusions into the Macron campaign's online network to Russian hackers operating as an arm of Kremlin intelligence. The Tokyo-based firm said it was the same group - known variously as Pawn Storm, APT28 and Fancy Bear - that hacked the Democratic National Committee and officials tied to Mrs Hillary Clinton's unsuccessful campaign for president. In the specific case of the leaked documents, a Russian connection was not immediately identified. But according to analysis conducted by Flashpoint Intel, a digital risk firm, "it appears to be linked to the Russian state-sponsored campaign by APT28." Mr Nicolas Vanderbiest, an expert on social-media information dissemination and the author of the well-known blog "Reputatio Lab," said in an interview that there were significant connections in the Twitter storm following the leaks to accounts linked to Sputnik and Russia Today. In a paper published several weeks ago, he studied many of these accounts, some 40 per cent of which were involved with spreading the news about the Macron scandal early Saturday, he said. In any case, analysts say, the French government has taken the threat of cybersecurity in the election very seriously. In March, for instance, France's National Cybersecurity Agency said that there was "an extremely high risk" of cyberattacks and hacking of the country's electoral process, which prompted the government to suspend electronic voting this year for French citizens overseas. Mr Alexander Klimburg, an expert on cyberwarfare at The Hague Centre for Security Studies who has been in regular contact with French civil service officers, said he believes the French government is sufficiently prepared for Russian cyberattacks, especially after Russian hackers nearly destroyed a French television network, TV5Monde, almost exactly two years ago. "The sense was, 'If this happens again, we're going to be ready,' " Mr Klimburg said. "I expect there to be a massive escalation in the covert information environment." Polls show Mr Macron, a former investment banker and Socialist finance minister, with a considerable lead over Ms Le Pen, at 63 per cent to 37 per cent of the vote, according to the latest analysis from the Ipsos firm, released Friday. For many, the hacking and subsequent data dump represented a desperate, last-dash attempt to thwart Mr Macron's considerable lead in the polls - a lead that has actually grown in the final days of the campaign. "It's so obvious, and you can make all the connections so easily," said Mr Vanderbiest. "It's very amateur."   Related Stories:  collagefrenchpres2.jpg Related Story French reactions to Emmanuel Macron victory 42487077_-_08_05_2017_-_france2017-vote.jpg Related Story Healing France's divisions will be a huge challenge for new president Emmanuel Macron resultsfrench.png Related Story Interactive: Results of French presidential election 42480316.1_42481698_-_07_05_2017_-_france2017-vote.jpg Related Story 5 challenges for France's new president Emmanuel Macron who.jpg Related Story Who's who of new French president Emmanuel Macron's inner circle 42486595_-_08_05_2017_-_france2017-vote.jpg Related Story Timeline of new French president Emmanuel Macron's first month in office In victory speech, Macron pledges to serve France with "humility and love" Related Story Macron victory: The verdict of the world's media Macron pledges to serve France with 'humility and love' Related Story Luck, skill and France's dark history: Why Emmanuel Macron won the presidency ST_20170508_VNUJUPPE_3126275.jpg Related Story 10 defining moments in France's roller-coaster election youngleaders08.jpg Related Story Emmanuel Macron becomes French president at 39: A look at young leaders around the world pzvote08.jpg Related Story Emmanuel Macron expected to take time reforming economy in divided France befunky_collage.jpg Related Story The vote on Twitter: Is Emmanuel Macron or Justin Trudeau the hottest among world leaders? 42481354_-_07_05_2017_-_topshot-france2017-vote.jpg Related Story Third of French voters in presidential election spoiled ballots or abstained 41913940_-_15_03_2017_-_europe-euro_currency.jpg Related Story Euro rallies after Emmanuel Macron wins French presidency French people 'voted for continuity': Le Pen Related Story France's Marine Le Pen says National Front to be overhauled after election defeat Topics:  FRENCH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 2017 HACKING VOTERS More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Permalink: http://str.sg/42ta Copy BrandInsider Sponsored Content Merck_A125676_20170501_300x200 Women are at higher risk for anaemia housead_2016oct29_354x235.jpg SPH deepens foray in content marketing with BrandInsider relaunch ha386_300x200_default.jpg Read the latest ST Specials and Supplements right here!

The bipartisan legislation would provide clear and equal protections under federal law for all Americans in vital areas of life, like employment, access to public spaces, housing, credit, education, jury service, and federally-funded programs. Today, in a majority of U.S. states (31), LGBTQ people remain at risk of being fired, evicted or denied services because of who they are. 'No person's fundamental rights should be determined by which side of a state line they live on,' said HRC President Chad Griffin. 'The Equality Act will once and for all end the unacceptable patchwork of non-discrimination laws across this country that leaves LGBTQ people at risk. Every American should have a fair chance to earn a living, provide for their families, and live their lives without fear of discrimination. And at its core, that's what the Equality Act is all about.' Discrimination is a real and persistent problem for far too many LGBTQ Americans. HRC polling has found that nearly two-thirds of self-identified LGBTQ Americans report experiencing discrimination - including people like Carter Brown, a transgender man from Texas who lost his job after he was outed by his colleagues. Currently, 50 percent of LGBTQ Americans like Mr. Brown live in states where they are at risk of being fired, denied housing, or refused service because of who they are. There is no federal law explicitly protecting LGBTQ people from discrimination, and 31 states still lack fully-inclusive non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people. Today's announcement included unprecedented support from the business community: 92 major corporations have now joined HRC's Business Coalition for the Equality Act. While the overwhelming majority of America's leading businesses have already started addressing workplace fairness for LGBTQ employees, these major employers know how important the need is for a federal standard that treats all employees the same no matter which state they live in. The slate of companies endorsing the Equality Act have combined operations in all 50 states, headquarters spanning 23 states, and collectively generate $2.6 trillion in revenue. In total, these companies employ more than 5.8 million people across the United States. The overwhelming majority of Americans support full federal equality for LGBTQ people. Polling released last year by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) found that support for a bill like the Equality Act topped 70 percent nationally, including a majority of Democrats, Republicans and Independents. PRRI's groundbreaking survey included 42,000 interviews in 50 states and found majority support for the Equality Act in all 50 states. The Equality Act is co-sponsored by 240 members of Congress. It was first introduced in 2015 by Representative David Cicilline (D-RI) and by Senators Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Cory Booker (D-NJ). Major corporations in the HRC Business Coalition for the Equality Act include Abercrombie & Fitch Co.; Accenture; Adobe Systems Inc.; Advanced Micro Devices Inc.; Airbnb Inc.; Alcoa Inc.; Amazon.com Inc.; American Airlines; American Eagle Outfitters; American Express Global Business Travel; Apple Inc.; Arconic; Automatic Data Processing Inc.; Bank of America; Best Buy Co., Inc.; Biogen; Boehringer Ingelheim USA Corp.; Booz Allen Hamilton Inc.; Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc.; Brown-Forman Corp.; CA Technologies Inc.; Caesars Entertainment Corp.; Capital One Financial Corp.; Cardinal Health Inc.; Cargill Inc.; Chevron Corp.; Choice Hotels International Inc.; Cisco Systems Inc.; The Coca-Cola Co.; Corning Inc.; Cox Enterprises; CVS Health Corp.; Darden Restaurants Inc.; Delhaize America Inc.; Diageo North America; The Dow Chemical Co.; Dropbox Inc.; E.

The first commercial flight of the ERJ 145 occurred on April 6, 1997, with U.S. airline Continental Express. “The ERJ 145 marked Embraer’s commercial renaissance, paving the way for the development of new programs, such as the E-Jets, which moved the Company into the lead of the commercial jet market for up to 130-seat aircraft,” said Paulo Cesar de Souza e Silva, Embraer President & CEO. “Personally, I have a great affection for the program, which brought me to Embraer. I participated in practically all the jet’s sales campaigns as Vice President of Customer Financing.” The ERJ 145 family of jets consists of the ERJ 145 (50 seats), the ERJ 135 (37 seats), the ERJ 140 (44 seats) and the ERJ 145 XR (long-range 145 version). Since its entry into operation, the ERJ 145 family has accumulated more than 27 million flight hours and almost 730 million passengers transported, being used by more than 120 operators. Over the last seven years, the ERJ’s global customer base has almost doubled, from 39 operators, in 2010, to 70, today. During the same period, the application and use of ERJ models has been growing in emerging markets, such as Africa, where the ERJ fleet has increased from 16 units in 2010 to almost 60 jets in 2017. Robust and with excellent operating history, the ERJ platform is a success in commercial aviation, with almost 900 units delivered, having applications in the business aviation market, with the Legacy 600 and Legacy 650 jets, as well as in defense, such as the AEW&C, Multi-Intel and maritime patrol for the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) segment.

"HSMC has been working with potential investors. However, investors want to see a reliable market size for which we have approached the government," HSMC Chairman Deven Verma told PTI in an interview. Hindustan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (HSMC) is the only electronic chip firm that is working with the government to set up India's first semiconductor plant. It has tied up with STMicroelectronics and Silterra Malaysia to set up the facility. The government had also approved the JP Associates-led consortium to set up one more plant, but the group backed out in the absence of an appropriate market. The Cabinet had initially cleared setting up of the two semiconductor plants in September 2013. A global tender was issued to invite interest from other semiconductor firms to set up plant in India. The government had promised same incentives as the two electronic chip plants, but no company turned up. Chips constitute a major cost of smart devices and are considered as drivers of modern electronic products like mobile phones, camera, automotive and defence electronic products and the like. The government has given HSMC time to submit its investment road map with firm financial commitments. "The government is giving subsidy to electronic companies and those companies' procurements should be channelised such that they procure India-made products. This will also help implementation of 'The Make in India' programme. Once we get India market commitment, it will become viable to make chips in India," Verma said. The government, he said, already has policies like preferential market access (PMA) in place that needs to be implemented sincerely for cyber security of the country. Under the PMA policy, products procured by the government and which have security implications are required to source some critical components that are made indigenously. "The government is giving subsidy to electronic companies. It is public money which has to be channelised in a manner that those who benefit or are subsidised by it are made to procure components that are made in India. Once we get such market, it will become viable to make chips in India," Verma added. According to him, China is making strategic efforts to become a world leader in the semiconductor space. "As per public domain information, China has earmarked about USD 100 billion for the semiconductor industry. Chinese companies are acquiring US semiconductor companies, which has set off alarm bells in the US. India needs to take note of such development which almost imports 100 per cent of chip used in electronic products," Verma pointed out. Further, he said, it is not an easy task to implement such a difficult project and no new semiconductor wafer fabrication plant is coming up in the world except in China with very strong government support. He hinted that some foundries may be extending their production capacity. He cited the instance of Intel that has announced setting up an additional fabrication plant in Arizona. "Keeping in view the national interest, the government should ensure... These semi-chips are manufactured in India by an Indian fabrication unit," Verma suggested. He said HSMC should be seen as developing India's first fabrication plant where the government is also a stakeholder.

Why market gyrations can actually help your portfolio. 3 reasons you should embrace sudden market shifts. Also recommended: What happens when you add rocket fuel to tiny stocks? That is because volatile markets are frequently associated with losses as asset prices gyrate. But believe it or not, volatility is actually a good thing for long-term investors. Better yet, even short-term investors can harness the power of volatility — booking massive returns in small time frames. Senior analyst Jonathan Rodriguez breaks down exactly why below. Ahead of the tape, Louis Basenese Chief Investment Strategist, Wall Street Daily Three Huge Upsides to Volatility No matter how you trade stocks as a long investor, the basic idea is to buy stocks that will be worth more tomorrow than they are today. And over time, stocks have an upward bias. Consider that in the last 50 years, the S&P 500 has returned 7% annually, including dividends. If you’re an investor aiming to beat the market, volatility is your best friend. Big price swings allow investors to take advantage of temporary dislocations of a stock’s current price from its “true value.” During these turbulent times, long investors can scoop up shares of great companies at sometimes fire-sale prices. Or by positioning themselves just right, investors can get into stocks primed to pop — and let a volatile market hand them profits. Here are three examples of how you can get in on the action… Volatility Play #1 — Earnings Reports As you may know, for an individual stock, the most volatile periods are always around its quarterly earnings reports. Investors get four reporting opportunities a year on thousands of publicly traded stocks to position themselves for big profits. Let’s say a fundamentally sound company that’s growing sales and earnings well over the period of several years reports a bad quarter and its stock drops 5%. If the quarter represents a short-term misstep, then investors are looking at a 5% discount on a quality stock. Volatility Play #2 — Natural Disasters Mother Nature is one of the single most powerful forces on Earth. Natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions move stocks — fast. It’s not just weather disasters that disrupt share prices, either. The deadly Ebola outbreak of 2014–16, for example, claimed the lives of more than 11,000 people in Africa. Between September and October of 2014— the peak of the outbreak — the S&P 500 fell 8%. Shares of American Airlines Group Inc. — America’s largest airline company — fell 30% from their September 2014 peak to their October 2014 low. To put that into perspective, the plunge was more than three standard deviations from the stock’s 50-day moving average at the time. But a savvy investor who bought the American Airlines dip in October would have made an 86% gain on the shares by the end of the year as the stock recovered. Volatility Play #3 — Takeovers Thus far, we’ve covered two great ways to pick up stocks at a discount after a big move to the downside. But one of the best ways to bag a big gain quickly is to be ahead of the move. And there are few catalysts more powerful than mergers and acquisitions. 2016 was the third-largest year for global M&A, with $3.7 trillion worth of transactions made. Companies that make for attractive takeover targets can see a one-day rise of anywhere from 20–60% in their stock on the announcement of a deal. For instance, Intel Corp. struck a $15.3 billion deal to buy semiconductor company Mobileye NV in March. Mobileye’s stock soared 13% on the day the deal was announced. And with a huge tax cut on the Trump administration’s legislative agenda, the next two years could be record-breaking for takeovers. Bottom line: Investors should embrace volatility, rather than run from it. Some of the largest gains ever harvested will come from buying the dips — or being ahead of the pack on a major market-moving event. On the hunt, Jonathan Rodriguez Senior Analyst, Wall Street Daily Jonathan Rodriguez has helped develop successful products that earned readers triple-digit gains. With a focus in options trading, he has worked alongside the brightest minds in the financial industry to uncover timely and profitable investment opportunities.
