The shift to digital marketing comes with a lack of reliable outcomes making it harder to forecast sales — bad news for pre-IPO startups and public companies By Tom Foremski for Tom Foremski: IMHO | May 19, 2017 -- 00:04 GMT (17:04 PDT) | Topic: Start-Ups Wall Street hates missed estimates. Photographer: Maciej Bledowski, Getty Images/iStockphoto The lesson for startups from Snap's recent share fall when it reported huge losses was not the lack of profitability -- it was that it missed analyst estimates despite a big jump in marketing spend. The seemingly unstoppable demise of the media industry has forced many companies to be media companies as they try to reach potential customers with their marketing through traditional and social media channels, and across multiple devices. In this fractured media world the old marketing programs don't work the same way while the new marketing programs might not work the same way the next time you try them. When I met Microsoft CMO Grad Conn earlier this year, he told me that everything he knew about marketing he had to re-learn and this is coming from a former Procter & Gamble marketing executive -- P&G marketing is almost a science. Google revamps ads to prioritize mobile, focus on local searches More than 50% of Google search queries now come from mobile devices, while location-related mobile searches are growing 50% faster than all mobile searches. Read More Traditional marketing such as advertising, TV, web seminars, trade shows, etc is less effective because potential customers are spending their time with many other types of media: social, games, Instagram, Twitter, forums, etc. It's a many-media world and company marketing campaigns are getting used to the fact that each type of media has to be approached in its own way which adds complexity. The fickle nature of online trends means that marketing needs to be vigilant and responsive on a near real-time basis. Microsoft employs more than 150 social media product managers for such tasks. ""You have to be constantly learning," says Conn. Constantly learning because things are constantly changing. Most CMOs would rather manage a process rather than be engaged in the process through leadership by example, Conn is an exception. This constant change in online trends means that the results of marketing programs cannot be used to a reliably forecast sales. With traditional marketing programs for example: P&G knows what each $1m spent in TV ads will generate in product sales. But what will $1m in marketing across a many-media landscape generate? Is it better to spend it on podcast sponsorships or maybe public relations? Foggy marketing... It's a fog as Sean Maloney, Intel's former CMO once told me when he spoke about the new types of challenges thrown up by this many-media landscape which because of Intel's global reach he had to figure out country by country. Intel currently has a marketing budget of over $2 billion showing the scale of this problem. When the marketing gets tough the tough get going: CMO job tenure continues to fall (3.5 years compared with CEOs 7.2 years). It's the toughest job in the C-suite. For IPO: Predictability trumps profitability... Predictability in revenues is the biggest challenge to tech IPOs -- not profitability as Snap found to its cost. All pre-IPO companies face the same scaling challenge: they have to demonstrate how invested capital equals predictable growth. Young tech companies know that revenues are lumpy and have tried to do away with estimates. When Google went public it said it would not issue any financial guidance -- but that didn't work. Pre-IPO statements such as Snap's warning about the difficulty in forecasting revenues didn't work either -- investors have their own risk assessment based on many factors. If companies don't offer guidance the consensus estimates could be way out of line and so would its effect on the share price. Missed estimates... Large companies face the same problems. A few recent headlines: IBM posts first revenue miss in five quarters, shares tumble Sramana Mitra Blog | SAP Continues to Soar, Despite Earnings Miss Johnson & Johnson misses estimates after $17B in revenue. Intel, Microsoft miss estimates, but growth businesses remain strong Cisco revenue forecast disappoints; says to cut 1,100 more jobs | Reuters Will AT&T Inc. (T) Stock Be Derailed By Its Earnings Fallout? | InvestorPlace Apple lower on revenues miss Twillio and other tech companies revise estimates Procter & Gamble sales disappoint... It is not fair to blame marketing unpredictability for making every company's financial estimates unreliable -- but it certainly does nothing to help improve accuracy. Online ads continue to fail in effectiveness and performance metrics are proliferating and confusing. In such an environment it is not surprising that marketing costs are rising says Gartner. As digital marketing spend overtakes traditional channels we should see: a rise in the number of missed financial estimates across all companies; stock volatility during earnings season will be more common; and the tech IPO pipeline will continue to struggle with successful launches. And there is no easy solution (tracking is not selling).

Creative Commons Attribution Carla Schroder So, you want to stuff your Linux laptop or PC full of virtual machines and perform all manner of mad experiments. And so you shall, and a fine time you will have. Come with me and learn how to do this with KVM. KVM, kernel-based virtual machine, was originally developed by Qumranet. Red Hat bought Qumranet in 2008, re-licensed KVM to the GPL, and then it became part of the mainline kernel. KVM is a type 2 hypervisor, which means it runs on a host operating system. VirtualBox and Hyper-V are type 2 hypervisors. In contrast, type 1 hypervisors run on the bare metal and don't need host operating systems, like Xen and VMware ESX. "Hypervisor" is a old term from the early days of computing. It has taken various meanings over the decades; I'm satisfied with thinking of it as a virtual machine manager that has control over hardware, hardware emulation, and the virtual machines. Prerequisites KVM runs unmodified guest operating systems, including Linux, Unix, Max OS X, and Windows. You need a CPU with virtualization support, and while it is unlikely that your CPU does not have this, it takes just a second to check. 
$ egrep -o '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo
vmx
vmx
vmx
vmx
vmx
vmx
vmx
vmx
 vmx means Intel, and svm is AMD. That is a quad-core Intel CPU with eight logical cores, and it is ready to do the virtualization rock. (Intel Core i7-4770K 3.50GHz, a most satifying little powerhouse that handles everything I throw at it, including running great thundering herds of VMs.) Download a few Linux .isos for creating virtual machines. Create two new directories, one to hold your .isos, and one for your storage pools. You want a lot of disk space, so put these in your home directory to make testing easier, or any directory with a few hundred gigabytes of free space. In the following examples, my directories are ~/kvm-isos and ~/kvm-pool. Installing KVM Remember back in the olden days, when how-tos like this were bogged down with multiple installation instructions? We had to tell how to install from source code, from dependency-resolving package managers like apt and yum, and non-dependency-resolving package managers like RPM and dpkg. If we wanted to be thorough we included pkgtool, pacman, and various graphical installers. Happy I am to not have to do that anymore. KVM on Ubuntu and CentOS 7 consists of qemu-kvm, libvirt-bin, virt-manager, and bridge-utils. openSUSE includes patterns-openSUSE_KVM_server, which installs everything, and on Fedora install virt-manager, libvirt, libvirt-python, and python-virtinst. You probably want to review the instructions for your particular flavor of Linux in case there are quirks or special steps to follow. After installation, add yourself to the libvirt or libvirtd group, whichever one you have, and then log out and log back in. This allows you to run commands without root privileges. Then run this virsh command to check that the installation is successful: 
$ virsh -c qemu:///system list
 Id Name                 State
--------------------------------
 When you see this it's ready to go to work. Starting the Virtual Machine Manager Look in your applications menu for Virtual Machine Manager and open it. In Ubuntu and openSUSE it's under System. If you can't find it then run the virt-manager command with no options. You will see something like Figure 1. figure-1.png Figure 1: Virtual Machine Manager. Used with permission It's not much to look at yet. Cruise through the menus, and double-click QEMU/KVM to start it, and to see the Connection Details window. Again, not much to see, just idle status monitors and various configuration tabs. Create a Virtual Machine Now create a new virtual machine with one of those .isos you downloaded. I'll use Fedora 25. Go to File > New Virtual Machine. You get a nice dialog that offers several choices for your source medium. Select Local Install Media (ISO image or CDROM), then click Forward. On the next screen check Use ISO Image:, and click the Browse button. This opens the Choose Storage Volume screen. The default storage volume of around 24GB in /var/lib/libvirt/images is too small, so you want to use your nice new kvm-pool directory. The interface is a little confusing; first, you create your nice large kvm-pool in the left pane, and then create individual storage pools for your VMs in the right pane each time you create a new VM. Start by clicking the green add button at the bottom left to add your new large storage pool. This opens the Add a New Storage Pool screen. Select the dir: Filesystem Directory type, type a name for your storage pool, and click Forward (Figure 2). figure-3.png Figure 2: Create storage pool. Used with permission In the next screen, click the Browse button to browse to the pool directory you created back in the Prequisites section; this becomes the Target Path, and then click Finish (Figure 3). figure-4.png Figure 3: Choose a target path. Used with permission Now you're back at the Choose Storage Volume screen. You should see the default and your new storage pool in the left pane. Click the Browse Local button at the bottom of the right pane to find the .iso you want to use. Select one and click Forward. This automatically adds your .iso directory to the left pane. In the next screen, set your CPU and memory allocations, then click Forward. For Fedora I want two CPUs and 8096MB RAM. Click Forward, and enable storage for your new VM. Check Select or create custom storage, and click the Manage button (Figure 4). figure-5.png Figure 4: Create new virtual machine. Used with permission Now you're back at the Choose Storage Volume screen. Click the green create new volume button next to Volumes in the right pane. Give your new storage volume a name and size, then click Finish (Figure 5). (We'll get into the various format types later; for now go with qcow2.) figure-6.png Figure 5: Name your storage volume. Used with permission This brings you back to Choose Storage Volume. It should look like Figure 6. figure-7.png Figure 6: Choose Storage Volume Used with permission Select your new storage pool, highlight your new storage volume, and click Choose Volume. Now you're back at Step 4 of 5, Create a new virtual machine. Click Forward. In Step 5, type the name of your new VM, then click Finish and watch your new virtual machine start. As this is an installation .iso, the final step is to go through the usual installation steps to finish creating your VM. When you create more VMs, the process will be more streamlined because you will use the .iso and storage pools you created on the first run. Don't worry about getting things exactly right because you can delete everything and start over as many times as you want. Come back next week to learn about networking and configurations.

Computing Phones Cars Gaming Science Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Extreme Why BMW, Intel, and Mobileye Invited Delphi to the Self-Driving Party Why BMW, Intel, and Mobileye Invited Delphi to the Self-Driving Party By Bill Howard on May 18, 2017 at 4:00 pm Comment One of the autonomous driving parties just got bigger. Delphi has been added to the consortium of an automaker (BMW), a chipmaker (Intel), and a developer of sensor systems (Mobileye), all working to bring self-driving cars to market by 2021. They’re working together to develop Level 4 and Level 5 self-driving solutions (the highest levels), up to and including capabilities where the car is so good at it, it doesn’t need a steering wheel. It’s possible others may join the BMW-etcetera consortium in the near future. Prototype self-driving car developed as a consortium between Audi and Delphi. Why Delphi: expertise in integrating complex systems Delphi is one of the world’s largest suppliers of components. It has sold off the powertrain part of its business and concentrates now on electronic and software solutions, including self-driving technologies. Delphi also has expertise in integrating components from multiple vendors into a packaged solution an automaker can stick in a car with less of its own testing before going to market. One recent example of Delphi’s integration skills is a project to stitch together a 48-volt system, a strengthened starter motor (a motor generator), lithium-ion battery packs, a DC-to-DV converter, and automated cylinder shutdown. The result, says Mary Gustanski, Delphi vice president of engineering and program management, is a mild hybrid that can improve fuel economy by as much as 20 percent at a cost of $1,500 to $2,000. Even before the four-way partnership announced this week, Delphi has worked since 2016 on autonomous driving with Mobileye, and then also with Intel, without BMW (in a separate partnership). In addition, Delphi and Mobileye worked with Audi on autonomous driving. A test in their car in December 2016 showed a car comfortable on urban streets, albeit one making only right turns. (Lots of early-stage autonomous vehicles don’t turn left into oncoming traffic, at least not when editors are on board.) That was the same time (December 2016) that Intel joined the Delphi-Mobileye cooperative effort BMW, too, has worked with Intel and Mobileye since 2016 (apart from Delphi), and plans to start testing a prototype fleet of 40 autonomous cars later this year. Meanwhile, the mapping consortium HERE (evolved from Navteq) that is owned by Audi, BMW, and Daimler (Mercedes) now has Intel taking a 15 percent stake. Trunk of a BMW outfitted for autonomous-drive testing earlier this year. Non-exclusive consortiums While BMW, Delphi, Intel and Mobileye are working together, they can also work apart, or bring more partners into make an even larger consortium. That’s part of the consortium agreement. They are all getting access to each others’ test data, suitably anonymized. At the announcement Wednesday, Glen DeVos, CTO of Delphi, said, “We recognize how complex these systems are, and when you’re talking about automated driving where the vehicle is in control, you have to have the most robust, best technology at every link in the chain of that platform … You’re going to see a number of companies that are trying to do everything on their own or in a very closed system are going to really struggle.” Klaus Fröhlich, BMW board member, said in a statement, “From the very beginning we designed our cooperation on a non-exclusive platform for this technology of the future. With the onboarding of Delphi we significantly strengthen our development of the automated driving and do a future step in spreading this technology across the industry.” The more companies involved, the more the cost — probably hundreds of billions — can be shared over more companies. Also, when everybody has a stake, there may be fewer patent infringement issues. If there are, a company setting out to sue might be naming itself as a co-defendant. Anti-trust issues? Fuggedabout If this sounds like an anti-trust issue, the answer is a) probably not under the current, pro-business administration, and b) probably not ever, especially when it’s for a common function. GM and Ford in 2013 agreed to jointly develop a 10-speed automatic transmission debuting in the 2017 Ford Raptor pickup and 2017 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1. Each will use unique control software for the radically different vehicles. This, by the way, is the kind of transmission that can handle 500 hp and may be one more nail in the coffin of manual gearboxes. GM and Ford partnered before on six-speed automatics. GM and Chrysler in 2004, with BMW added in 2005, developed a two-mode automatic for hybrids. BMW and Toyota are jointly developing a sports car that will be the next Z4 (BMW) and Supra (Toyota). Production starts in 2018 on neutral ground, at the Magna Steyr factory in Austria. When companies aren’t jointly developing components, they may use the same components from a third party. Aisin of Japan and Getrag of Germany each sell transmissions to a wide variety of automakers, again with software tweaking the transmission to best support the mission of the vehicle it’s in: quiet and unobtrusive in a family sedan, quick and possibly noticeable shifts in a sports car. In the case of self-driving, the software might be massaged to provide gentler braking to avoid startling the passengers, or it might allow for shorter (still legal) following distances and more aggressive braking. Otherwise, the car would leave too much following distance, and another self-driving car might cut in front.

Computing Phones Cars Gaming Science Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing L2 vs. L3 cache: What’s the Difference? L2 vs. L3 cache: What’s the Difference? By Joel Hruska on May 18, 2017 at 3:17 pm Comment Yesterday we discussed how caches work, what the difference is between L1 and L2, and the various design elements that determine how fast (and how effective) a CPU’s cache is. Today, we’re going to take one step further and explore the difference between L2 and L3 caches. At its simplest level, an L3 cache is just a larger, slower version of the L2 cache. Back when most chips were single-core processors, this was generally true. The first L3 caches were actually built on the motherboard itself, connected to the CPU via the backside bus. When AMD launched its K6-III processor family, many existing K6/K-2 motherboards could accept a K6-III as well. Typically these boards had 512K-2MB of L2 cache — when a K6-III, with its integrated L2 cache was inserted, these slower, motherboard-based caches became L3 instead. By the turn of the century, slapping an additional L3 cache on a chip had become an easy way to improve performance — Intel’s first consumer-oriented Pentium 4 “Extreme Edition” was a repurposed Gallatin Xeon with a 2MB L3 on-die. Adding that cache was sufficient to buy the Pentium 4 EE a 10-20 percent performance boost over the standard Northwood line. Cache and the multi-core curveball As multicore processors became more common, L3 cache started appearing more frequently on consumer hardware. These chips, like Intel’s Nehalem and AMD’s K10 (Barcelona) used L3 as more than just a larger, slower backstop for L2. In addition to this function, the L3 cache is often shared between all of the processors on a single piece of silicon. That’s in contrast to the L1 and L2 caches, both of which tend to be private and dedicated to the needs of each particular core. (AMD’s Bulldozer design is an exception to this — Bulldozer, Piledriver, and Steamroller all share a common L1 instruction cache between the two cores in each module). Intel’s Haswell-E, for example, has eight separate cores that all back up to a common L3 cache. Private L1/L2 caches and a shared L3 is hardly the only way to design a cache hierarchy, but it’s a common approach that multiple vendors have adopted. Giving each individual core a dedicated L1 and L2 cuts access latencies and reduces the chance of cache contention — meaning two different cores won’t overwrite vital data that the other put in a location in favor of their own workload. The common L3 cache is slower but much larger, which means it can store data for all the cores at once. Sophisticated algorithms are used to ensure that Core 0 tends to store information closest to itself, while Core 7 across the die also puts necessary data closer to itself. Unlike the L1 and L2, which are nearly always CPU-focused and private, the L3 can also be shared with other devices or capabilities. Intel’s Sandy Bridge CPUs shared an 8MB L3 cache with the on-die graphics core (Ivy Bridge gave the GPU its own dedicated slice of L3 cache in lieu of sharing the entire 8MB). In contrast to the L1 and L2 caches, both of which are typically fixed and vary only very slightly (and mostly for budget parts) both AMD and Intel offer different chips with significantly different amounts of L3. Intel typically sells at least a few Xeons with lower core counts, higher frequencies, and a higher L3 cache-per-CPU ratio. Intel’s Core i7 processors have maintained an 8MB L3 since the debut of Nehalem in 2008 (roughly 2MB of L3 for every CPU core) but the highest-end parts are typically pegged at 2.5MB of cache per CPU core. Today, the L3 is characterized as a pool of fast memory common to all the CPUs on an SoC. It’s often gated independently from the rest of the CPU core and can be dynamically partitioned to balance access speed, power consumption, and storage capacity. While not nearly as fast as L1 or L2, it’s often more flexible and plays a vital role in managing inter-core communication. With Intel having already added L4 to its Skylake chips, it’s possible we’ll see the L3 take a more simplified role — with some of its functions and capabilities shifting over to the newer, larger pool of cache. Tagged In intel amd cpus memory processors xeon cache caching L2 cache L2 L1 L3 L4 Post a Comment Comment ExtremeTech Staff yes uhuh very good ExtremeTech Staff yes uhuh very nice Frank Johnson I thought Intel’s L4 cache was just for the gpu side of the processor pelov lov It can be used by the CPU as well, though I believe it’s still independent with respect to the GPU or CPU accessing it. http://www.anandtech.com/show/6993/intel-iris-pro-5200-graphics-review-core-i74950hq-tested/18 Joel Hruska It is not. A cache that was specific only to the GPU would be a frame buffer. Crystal Well can act like a frame buffer, but is not limited to such. Guest Unlike previous eDRAM implementations in game consoles, Crystalwell is true 4th level cache in the memory hierarchy. It acts as a victim buffer to the L3 cache, meaning anything evicted from L3 cache immediately goes into the L4 cache. Both CPU and GPU requests are cached. The cache can dynamically allocate its partitioning between CPU and GPU use. If you don’t use the GPU at all (e.g. discrete GPU installed), Crystalwell will still work on caching CPU requests. That’s right, Haswell CPUs equipped with Crystalwell effectively have a 128MB L4 cache. Joel Hruska In the tests I’ve been able to run, the performance difference between L4 and not-L4 wasn’t particularly large, but it’s difficult to say for certain — platform-level differences tend to intrudde and could crowd out other metrics. realtebo I love this kind of articles, please go on ! Dozerman Up next, the difference between L1 and registers! http://www.mrseb.co.uk/ Sebastian Anthony Ha. We weren’t planning to. But maybe… *gets out his notebook* Dozerman Heh massau or maybe we go to the power side of the story clock gating vs power gating etc. Dozerman That would be cool. I think I’d like a comparison of CPU cores and GPU cores, too. massau that is also a possibilety if you want to know more abouth it look up vliw and now the modern GPGPU is SIMD. its just a huge pool of small simple in order processors . while a cpu is a huge complex core. a very good article would combine cpu vs gpu while putting the chip size, chips per wafer and yields into the consideration. so people would finally know why cpus have smaller die sizes than a gpu and the cost isn’t linear for larger chips. massau i wonder what those Sophisticated algorithms are, don’t they just slit up the cache addresses by the number of cores and give each a preferred address block. so with 8MB L3 and 4 cores the 0 core will prefere the first 2MB while the last core will prefere to use the last part. these adresses will be cache close to the core. FG11 Much Better to put all 128MB on L2 Cache rather than to put 128MB on L4 Cache. LOL. its like the higher the Lcache. the slower the speed. jdwii I for one would like to meet the idiots at Amd who thought sharing L1 cache was a great idea!

By Ben Ames Comment Honeywell International Inc. today rolled out a shipment tracking solution for high-value and perishable goods, adding another page to the industrial powerhouse's growing catalog of products for retail and supply chain operations. Honeywell said its "Connected Freight" system could help users reduce damage, loss, and theft by providing real-time location and status details for critical freight in transit, whether on the road, rail, or sea. The system works by attaching sensor tags to pallets or individual packages, collecting their signals through a mobile gateway placed inside a truck or shipping container, and transmitting that data over cellular networks to a cloud-based platform, Honeywell said. Users can monitor the variables that most affect their cargo, such as temperature, shock, tilt, humidity, pressure, or intrusion detection, Honeywell said. Technology companies such as BlackBerry Ltd. and Roambee Corp. also provide asset-monitoring tags that bolt on to trucks and containers to monitor data over wireless sensors. Honeywell said its system is different because it collects data from a handful of relatively inexpensive sensor tags that are priced so low that they are considered disposable, Sameer Agrawal, vice president of supply chain solutions at Honeywell's Safety & Productivity Solutions unit, said in an interview. The system then routes that data through a reusable "smart gateway" that contains enough computing power to perform edge-processing functions and alert local warehouse workers or truck drivers of immediate problems, he said The Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled system was originally developed by chipmaker Intel Corp. to track the movement of high-value supplies through its corporate supply chain, Intel Corporate Vice President CJ Bruno told reporters in Minneapolis Friday prior to today's launch. Honeywell then brought the system to market through a collaboration with Intel and with third-party logistics (3PL) providers Deutsche Post DHL Group, Expeditors Inc., and Kuehne + Nagel International AG. The tags are currently used to protect high-value goods such as high-technology items, precision equipment, medical devices, or perishable goods, Agrawal said. But Honeywell's long-term vision is to extend that model to a much broader market by driving down the cost of sensors through mass production of "smart labels" that can be affixed to individual items of far lower value, he said. "The Internet of Things can play a significant role in the connected supply chain, but [we] need to figure out the places where we want to connect and figure out why we want to connect," Agrawal said. "Today's consumers are ordering products off of Amazon, and they can get shipping and tracking information so easily, but it is a lot harder for businesses to get similar information for their shipments, and the accuracy is severely limited." Honeywell's goal is to provide both the freight's owner and its custodian with improved information about any given shipment, Agrawal said. These units of "intelligent freight" should be able to answer three questions, said Agrawal: Where am I? What condition am I in, and Do I need help? And they must also answer the questions When will I reach my destination, and What processes need to be followed when I arrive? Morris Plains, N.J.-based Honeywell entered the supply chain management market when it acquired data-capture equipment supplier Intermec Inc. in 2012. It has steadily expanded its presence since then, acquiring material handling automation provider Intelligrated in 2016 and announcing a partnership with Intel earlier this year to develop IoT solutions for retail and logistics applications. #Logistics #Software & Systems About the Author Ben Ames Senior Editor Ben Ames has spent 20 years as a journalist since starting out as a daily newspaper reporter in Pennsylvania in 1995.

The new solution, developed in collaboration with Intel and third-party logistics companies, provides real-time information about the location and condition of critical freight while in transit. The solution was introduced during Honeywell Safety and Productivity Solutions' launch event on May 18. "Honeywell is developing a range of Connected Supply Chain solutions that leverage technology and data to make supply chains more efficient and better able to adapt to rapid change," said Taylor Smith, president of Honeywell's Workflow Solutions business. "For shippers, logistics providers, retailers and others faced with a host of costly freight challenges, such as theft, damage, spoilage and delays, this convenient cloud-based solution provides customers with detailed analytics in order to plan, anticipate and react immediately to incidents that occur during shipment." Popular Now Can This Smartphone App Replace CB Radio? Are you ready for blockchain technology? Truck safety and new technology Real-time shipment information is critical, for example, when shipping perishables and goods that require uninterrupted refrigeration, such as pharmaceuticals, or high-value equipment that is sensitive to vibration or shock. "After assessing our internal supply chain needs and the needs of the industry, we forged a unique collaboration with Honeywell. Together, we've customized Intel's Connected Logistics Platform technology to deliver an IoT offering that solves real logistics problems," said Chet Hullum, general manager for Industrial Solutions at Intel. "Thanks to data accessibility, shippers and carriers will be able to establish a more reliable supply chain network by having deeper visibility and information on shipments." Honeywell's Connected Freight solution consists of sensor tags that sense a range of environmental conditions, such as temperature or vibration. The tags can be affixed to pallets or individual packages. The sensor data is captured by a mobile gateway placed inside a truck or shipping container and then transmitted via cellular networks to a cloud-based command-and-control platform. Users can establish alerts based on temperature, shock, tilt, humidity, pressure and intrusion detection. The solution can alert manufacturers of high-value, highly sensitive technology if equipment has been damaged while being loaded or unloaded, or if it may have been stolen. The cloud can also store data for compliance and audit needs, and provide predictive and reactive analysis, such as which routes to avoid. Honeywell developed the technology with Intel and three third-party logistics companies: DHL, Expeditors and Kuehne + Nagel. "Kuehne + Nagel chose Honeywell and Intel to partner in the development of Connected Freight because of their expertise and competence in this kind of technology. We have used our competence as a global provider of logistics services and our expertise in supply chain management in order to co-develop this new technology," said Martin Kolbe, chief information officer at Kuehne + Nagel International AG. "We understand and anticipate the need for real-time data to inform customer actions during transportation very well. Armed with the Connected Freight solution, Kuehne + Nagel can offer a variety of new services tailored to our customers' specific needs. There are ongoing trials of the technology with one of our customers in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry, which is of strategic importance for Kuehne + Nagel." In addition to Connected Freight, Honeywell unveiled a range of connected solutions for truck drivers, delivery workers and field technicians to improve productivity and ensure compliance with regulations.   Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

The Flynn Scandal Explodes: What This Means and How It Happened A timeline of all the bizarre twists and turns. Daniel Schulman and Hannah LevintovaMay 18, 2017 3:06 PM Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Carolyn Kaster/AP On Wednesday, not one but two bombshells exploded concerning Michael Flynn, the national security adviser President Donald Trump was compelled to fire after only 22 days on the job. The New York Times reported that on January 4—weeks before the inauguration—Flynn informed Trump's transition team that he was under Justice Department investigation for his undisclosed lobbying work on behalf of Turkish interests. And McClatchy revealed that six days later, Flynn attended a meeting with Susan Rice, President Barack Obama's national security adviser, and asked her to delay a planned US-Kurdish military operation against a top ISIS target, an action that Turkey, which had opposed joint US-Kurdish operations, would not have supported. Together these two stories present a stunning scenario: Trump's team allowed a lobbyist for foreign interests who was under federal investigation to become the president's top national security aide and to participate in decision-making related to his lobbying. The story gets worse. It was 16 days after Flynn's meeting with Rice that Sally Yates, then the acting attorney general, informed the Trump White House that Flynn had lied about conversations he had with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak regarding the sanctions Obama imposed on Moscow for its covert intervention in the 2016 campaign. Yates also warned Don McGahn, the White House counsel, that Flynn was now vulnerable to Russian blackmail. Still, the White House kept Flynn in the job for another 18 days. It was only after the extent of Flynn's contacts with Kislyak was publicly exposed by a Washington Post story that Trump fired him. (On Thursday morning, Yahoo News reported that on April 25, Flynn told a group of friends that Trump had recently sent him a message: Stay strong.) Flynn, who has offered to testify before Congress if granted immunity from prosecution, has emerged as central figure in the Russia scandal enveloping the Trump administration. The retired lieutenant general who led "lock her up" chants during the presidential campaign is currently under investigation on several fronts. The Justice Department is probing his Turkish lobbying, and the FBI is investigating his contacts with Russian officials during the presidential campaign and transition period. The Senate intelligence committee recently subpoenaed Flynn for records of his Russian contacts. The latest Flynn revelations are a tremendous blow for a White House already reeling from the Trump-Russia scandal, the news that Trump disclosed highly sensitive top-secret information to Russian officials in the Oval Office, Trump's firing of FBI director James Comey, and the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller. The Flynn affair, which has the potential to derail Trump's presidency, is full of twists and turns, and it seems like there's more to come. Here's how it has unfolded so far. April 30, 2014: Flynn announces his retirement form the military about a year earlier then expected. He has reportedly been forced out as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency by the Obama administration. Flynn subsequently forms the Flynn Intel Group. October 8, 2014: The counsel's office of the Defense Intelligence Agency responds to an inquiry from Flynn about ethics restrictions that will apply to him after his Army retirement. The office explains in a letter that he can not receive foreign government payments without prior approval, due to the Constitution's emoluments clause. "If you are ever in a position where you would receive an emolument from a foreign government or from an entity that might be controlled by a foreign government, be sure to obtain advance approval from the Army prior to acceptance," the letter states. December 10, 2015: Flynn travels to Moscow to attend the 10th anniversary dinner of Russia Today, a media outlet owned by the Russian government. Flynn is paid more than $30,000 to speak at the event and is seated next to Russian President Vladimir Putin. February 2016: Flynn begins advising the Trump campaign. July 18, 2016: During his speech at the Republican National Convention, Flynn eggs on the chanting crowd, saying, "Lock her up, that's right. Yep, that's right: Lock her up!" August 9, 2016: Flynn and his company, the Flynn Intel Group, ink a $600,000 contract with Inovo BV, a company owned by Ekim Alptekin, a Turkish businessman and ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. According to the New York Times, the contract calls for Flynn's company to "run an influence campaign aimed at discrediting Fethullah Gulen, an reclusive cleric who lives in Pennsylvania and whom Mr. Erdogan has accused of orchestrating a failed [July 2016] coup in Turkey." August 17, 2016: Trump receives his first classified intelligence briefing as the GOP nominee for president. He brings Flynn with him to the meeting, which includes discussion of the intelligence community's assessment that Russia was interfering in the US election. November 8, 2016: On Election Day, Flynn publishes an op-ed in the Hill that calls Gulen "a shady Islamic mullah" and "a radical Islamist." November 10, 2016: During a meeting at Trump Tower with Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Flynn says he wants the national security adviser post in the new administration, NBC News reports. Kushner and Trump indicate that "President-elect Trump would certainly approve of that request to reward Flynn's loyalty," according to NBC. That day, Trump meets with Obama in the Oval Office, where Obama warns him against hiring Flynn. November 11, 2016: The Daily Caller reveals Flynn's contract with Inovo BV. November 2016: "Days after" seeing the Daily Caller story, according to the New York Times, Trump campaign lawyer William McGinley holds a conference call with members of Flynn Intel Group to gather more information about its foreign business dealings. November 17, 2016: Trump names Flynn as his national security adviser. November 30, 2016: The Justice Department notifies Flynn in a letter that it is investigating his Turkish lobbying work. December 2016: Flynn and Kushner meet with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak at Trump Tower. Kislyak was not caught on tape entering the building, suggesting that he may have been brought in through a back entrance. December 29, 2016: Obama announces sanctions against Russia in response to that country's interference in the US presidential election. The measure includes the ejection of 35 Russian diplomats from the United States; the closure of Cold War-era Russian compounds in New York and Maryland; and sanctions against the GRU and the FSB (Russian intelligence agencies), four employees of those agencies, and three companies that worked with the GRU. Flynn holds five phone calls with Kislyak that day, during which they at some point discuss US sanctions against Russia. (White House press secretary Sean Spicer later claims falsely that they held just one call, in which they merely discussed "logistical information.") January 2017: The FBI begins investigating Flynn's December phone conversations with Kislyak. January 4, 2017: Flynn tells McGahn, who at the time was the transition team's top lawyer, that he is under investigation for failing to disclose his work as a lobbyist for Turkey during the campaign. January 6, 2017: Flynn's attorney and transition team lawyers hold another discussion about the investigation involving Flynn. January 10: According to McClatchy, Obama's national security adviser, Susan Rice, informs Flynn of the Pentagon's plan to use Syrian Kurdish forces to retake the Islamic State's de facto capital, Raqqa. Flynn asks Rice to delay the operation, a position that "conformed to the wishes of Turkey." January 15, 2017: In an appearance on CBS' Face the Nation, Vice President-elect Mike Pence says Flynn told him that he did not discuss US sanctions during his conversations with Kislyak. January 23, 2017: Spicer holds his first White House press briefing. He insists that Flynn's conversations with Kislyak included no discussion of US sanctions. January 24, 2017: The FBI interviews Flynn about his phone conversations with Kislyak. Flynn reportedly denies having discussed US sanctions on Russia. January 26, 2017: Yates, the acting attorney general, informs McGahn—who by then was the White House counsel—that Flynn had discussed US sanctions on Russia with the Kislyak, despite Flynn's claims to the contrary. Yates also warns McGahn that as a result, Flynn could be vulnerable to Russian blackmail. McGahn subsequently informs Trump of Yates' report. January 27, 2017: Yates and McGahn meet again at the White House. January: Michael Cohen, Trump's personal attorney, meets at a Manhattan hotel with Felix Sater and a pro-Putin Ukrainian lawmaker to discuss a potential peace plan for Ukraine and Russia, according to the New York Times. The Times reports that Cohen delivered this plan to Flynn. Cohen confirms he met with Sater and the Ukrainian lawmaker but denies that they discussed a Ukraine-Russia peace plan or that he delivered such a plan to Flynn or the White House. February 1, 2017: In a letter to Defense Secretary James Mattis, the ranking Democrats on six House committees demand an investigation into Flynn's connections to RT. February 8, 2017: In an interview with the Washington Post, Flynn denies discussing US sanctions with Kislyak. February 9, 2017: A spokesman for Flynn softens the national security adviser's denial, telling the Washington Post that "while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions, he couldn't be certain that the topic never came up." February 10, 2017: Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump says he is not aware of reports that Flynn has discussed US sanctions with Kislyak. He has in fact been aware of Flynn's contacts with Kislyak since late January. His transition team has known Flynn was under Justice Department investigation for more than a month. February 13, 2017: Flynn resigns following reports that Yates warned the White House that Flynn had misled senior members of the administration, including Pence, about whether he discussed US sanctions with Kislyak. February 14, 2017: In an Oval Office meeting with Comey, Trump asks the FBI director to drop the bureau's investigation of Flynn. "I hope you can let this go," Trump says, according to a two-page memo of the conversation reportedly drafted by Comey. February 15, 2017: During a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump does not answer a question about potential connections between his campaign and Russia during the election. He blames Flynn's ouster on leaks. This is a different position than the one taken by the White House previously: that Flynn was asked to resign because he misled Pence about his communication with the Russian ambassador. March 7, 2017: Flynn retroactively registers as a foreign agent in connection with his Turkish lobbying work. March 30, 2017: The Wall Street Journal reports that Flynn has told the FBI and the congressional committees investigating ties between the Trump campaign and Russia that he will agree to be interviewed in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Flynn's attorney says in a subsequent statement that the retired general "certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit." March 31, 2017: Trump tweets that Flynn "should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!" But NBC reports that the Senate intelligence committee has denied Flynn's request for immunity, telling Flynn's lawyer the request was "wildly preliminary" and currently "not on the table." April 4, 2017: The Pentagon launches an investigation into Flynn for accepting payments from a foreign government without prior approval, in potential violation of the Constitution's emoluments clause. April 25, 2017: Leaders of the House Oversight Committee tell reporters that Flynn may have broken the law by failing to disclose the $34,000 payment he received for speaking at the 2015 RT gala. "As a former military officer, you simply cannot take money from Russia, Turkey or anybody else," committee chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) says. "And it appears as if he did take that money. It was inappropriate. And there are repercussions for the violation of law." The same day, Trump apparently reached out of Flynn. "I just got a message from the president to stay strong," Flynn tells a group of loyalists during a gathering at a restaurant in Northern Virginia, according to a later report from Yahoo News. May 8, 2017: Ahead of a Senate hearing, where Yates will testify about her warnings to the Trump administration over Flynn, Trump appears to blame his hiring of Flynn on his predecessor: "General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration - but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that," Trump tweets. May 9, 2017: Trump fires Comey. CNN reports that day that the US attorney's office in Alexandria, Virginia, has issued grand jury subpoenas to Flynn associates. May 10, 2017: The Senate intelligence committee subpoenas Flynn for documents concerning his communications with Russian officials. May 16, 2017: The New York Times reports that Trump pressured Comey to end the bureau's investigation into Flynn, according to the then-FBI director's notes of their meeting. May 17, 2017: Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appoints former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to oversee the Trump-Russia investigation. May 18, 2017: Trump tweets: This is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 18, 2017 Get the scoop,  straight from Mother Jones.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: There Is No Intel-AMD Licensing Deal Intel doesn't need AMD's intellectual property. Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) May 18, 2017 at 1:03PM It all started last December. Kyle Bennett, chief editor of tech website HardOCP, penned a forum post claiming that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) had signed a deal with Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) to license its Radeon graphics technology. The post suggested that Intel was aiming to use AMD's GPUs in its own products, an idea that seemed far-fetched. But Intel licensing AMD's graphics-related patents was plausible. Intel signed a cross-licensing deal with NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in 2011 as a result of a lawsuit, paying the graphics chip specialist $1.5 billion over six years for access to its patents. The last of that revenue has now been recognized, and with no sign that the agreement has been renewed, the AMD rumor was able to take off. That rumor reemerged on Tuesday when another tech website, Fudzilla, claimed that the Intel-AMD licensing pact was a done deal, without citing any sources. AMD stock surged as investors took that claim as fact, undoing some of the damage that followed the company's lackluster first-quarter report. Image source: AMD. AMD's analyst day event was held Tuesday evening, and investors were expecting the company to confirm the deal. It didn't, and the stock tumbled. Intel later refuted the rumors outright, with a company spokesperson telling CNBC that the "recent rumors that Intel has licensed AMD's graphics technology are untrue." Based on all of this, I would wager that the deal was nothing more than a rumor. And looking at the original agreement between Intel and NVIDIA, it's clear that Intel probably has no need for AMD's intellectual property. What the NVIDIA deal says The 2011 cross-licensing deal between Intel and NVIDIA "expired" early this year, in the sense that NVIDIA is no longer recognizing revenue from Intel. The last payment occurred in January 2016, with NVIDIA recognizing that revenue throughout the fiscal year. The deal gave Intel a nonexclusive, nontransferable worldwide license to all patents owned or controlled by NVIDIA that have a filing date on or before March 31, 2017. While the payments have now stopped, Intel hasn't lost the license to those patents. The key clause in the agreement: "The term of the patent cross license agreement continues until the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed patents, unless earlier terminated." In other words, Intel's access to NVIDIA's patents filed prior to March 31 of this year will persist until all of them have expired, presumably decades from now. What this means: Intel probably doesn't need to license anything from AMD. The deal is almost certainly nothing more than a rumor. AMD's refusal to comment and Intel's refutation make it hard to believe that any deal is in the works. Buying on rumors is a bad idea The ups and downs of the stock in reaction to the Intel rumor tells me that quite a few investors were duped by what has turned out to be mere speculation. Buying a stock based on rumors is a recipe for disaster, especially if those rumors come without sources from tech websites with questionable reliability. Based on the original Intel-NVIDIA agreement, there seems to be no reason for Intel to require AMD's intellectual property. AMD may be able to sign deals with other companies and extract high-margin royalty income, but the odds of an Intel deal look vanishingly small. Some rumors turn out to be true, but the Intel-AMD deal isn't one of them. Timothy Green has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Nvidia.

An Intel spokesperson tells CNBC the "recent rumors that Intel has licensed AMD’s graphics technology are untrue."More The biggest question that had traders in chip stocks buzzing this week is finally resolved, with Intel (INTC) flatly denying the rumor it licensed AMD's (AMD) graphics technology. Positive and negative speculation over the rumor sparked daily billion-dollar moves in AMD shares during the past two days. "The recent rumors that Intel has licensed AMD's graphics technology are untrue," an Intel spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC. AMD shares surged 12 percent Tuesday after website Fudzilla reported Intel signed a deal to license AMD's graphics technology. The company's shares then declined 12 percent Wednesday after Wall Street analysts downplayed the report and AMD didn't confirm the deal during its financial analyst day Tuesday. "Heading into the investor event, mainstream media reports suggested AMD's largest competitor, Intel, may license AMD's graphics IP. However, during the prepared remarks and meetings post-event, we came away with a view that AMD would not likely license core IP to a competitor," JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. AMD also declined to comment on the Fudzilla report. "As a matter of policy we don't comment on rumor or speculation," an AMD spokesperson said in a statement. AMD was one the best-performing stocks in the market in the past year. Its shares are up 192 percent during the past 12 months compared with the S&P 500's 15 percent return in the same time period. However, the hot chip stock is down more than 25 percent from its 52-week high, which roughly coincided with the March 2 launch of its new Ryzen line of desktop processors that disappointed some gamers. Barron's Tech Trader Daily initially reported on Intel denying the AMD deal speculation late Wednesday evening. AMD shares were off by 3 percent in Thursday premarket trading.

(AMD) Stock for Big Rebound Profits Whenever Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Dips, Double Down Is the Bitcoin Bubble About to Burst? View All Posts Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has been nothing short of a roller coaster ride in May, and long-suffering AMD investors have been feeling the heat. But a breeze is blowing, and AMD stock is putting together what could be the start of a recovery. Source: Shutterstock AMD’s debacle begun when the company reported lower-than-expected revenue growth on May 1 that led to shares tanking nearly 25% — the stock’s worst one-day selloff in a decade. But the chipmaker slowly managed to pare back a good chunk of those losses after rival Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) blew Q1 earnings estimates out of the water and proved that the GPU space was alive and well. AMD Stock Flies Out of the Traps Advanced Micro rallied 12% two days ago after it unveiled the Epyc server chip that was accompanied by fresh rumors that Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) was prepping a GPU licensing deal with AMD after its old deal with Nvidia expired in March 2017. Heavy options volume as well as heavy interest in May $12 calls and puts were the main feature of the day. But that was just as well, because the party was frozen in its tracks sooner than it started. AMD stock tanked 12% on Wednesday after Intel came out with a straight-up denial of the licensing deal, terming the rumors ”untrue.” The denial coincided with negative reaction to Advanced Micro Devices’ analyst day by Wall Street. In the presentation, AMD had painted a rosy picture of how it was gearing to compete in the high-end data center market, one that enjoys nearly two-thirds of all margin dollars despite representing just 15% of the volume. Unfortunately, the report came up short where it really matters — hard numbers. Buying the Rumor, Selling the News The latest selloff by AMD stock was a classic case of investors buying the rumor and selling the news. The rumor mills seem to be particularly adept at manipulating AMD stock, such as when the stock rallied hard in December after Jim Cramer made it his No. 1 pick in his top 10 list of takeout candidates in 2017. Merger mania makes it possible to play merger arbitrage, but that’s a risky game for investors to play. The purported AMD-Intel deal was built on cheap speculation and was doomed to come crashing down like a house of cards. The rumor surfaced about a year ago and was embellished by tech sites such as ExtremeTech, which reported that Intel had an ongoing $1.5 billion patent licensing deal with Nvidia that was set to expire on March 17, 2017. Fudzilla was the latest site to fan the rumor, saying: “It is more likely that Intel has a license from AMD but neither company has officially announced it. … If you are in Intel’s shoes, there are two options, Nvidia or AMD.” Fudzilla framed it in such a way that investors were led to believe that Intel had little choice in the matter than to put AMD’s tech in its graphics cards. Savvy investors, however, were careful not to take that to the bank. After all, March 17 had come and gone yet we had not heard any reports about disruption in the production of Intel chips. Naturally, you would have expected Intel to cozy up to AMD and sign a new patent deal with the company well before the Nvidia arrangement came to an end. Curiously, investors also failed to question why the Nvidia-Intel cross-licensing deal, signed in 2011 according to this SEC filing, was set to expire after just six years, whereas patents are usually enforceable for 20 years.

In its current lineup, Lenovo offers two models specifically that command attention perhaps more than others, the ThinkPad X1 Yoga that we recently revisited--with its 360-degree hinge and sweet OLED display--and the new 5th generation ThinkPad X1 Carbon that we'll be looking at here today. Though the 5th gen ThinkPad X1 Carbon may share a similar design signature and materials as the previous generation, Lenovo's 2017 version has been almost completely re-designed. Lenovo made some tough, smart decisions here and that's really what the 2017 ThinkPad X1 Carbon is all about. The machine is still built with its tried and true, flat black carbon fiber and Super Magnesium Alloy materials, the latter of which is claimed to be the world's strongest and lightest metal. However, the similarities end there both in terms of its exterior mechanical design and interior processing platform, which is now powered by Intel's 7th gen Kaby Lake Core Series processors. We took a quick tour of the machine, as well as a few other Lenovo highlight products, at CES in Las Vegas this year. If you've got a few extra minutes to spare, check out Lenovo's CES 2017 product demo suite, with the ThinkPad X1 Carbon on display toward the end of the clip, then we'll dive deep on this ThinPad refresh from every angle...  Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (2017) 5th Generation Specifications & Features Price: $1,335 As Tested, Base: $1,175 Perusing the specs, we see Lenovo opted for the Intel Core i5-7300U in our test machine, which is a nicely balanced dual-core, quad-thread CPU that turbos up to 3.5GHz. However, there are also Core i5-7200U and Core i7-7600U options available. The Core i7 will get you 4MB of L3 cache (versus 3MB in the Core i5) and a top-end speed of 3.9GHz, but as you'll see, the Kaby Lake Core i5 we tested holds up rather nicely under load. Starting at about ~ $1175, it's a pricey but nicely equipped machine to be sure, and it also sports an NVMe SSD for its storage subsystem, something that is thankfully becoming commonplace now.  The other notable features here are two Thunderbolt 3 capable USB Type-C ports, along with a single USB 3 port, a full-sized HDMI output port, and a Micro-Ethernet dongle port. So connectivity-wise, you're in pretty solid shape with this machine. And when it comes to battery life, users should be in even better shape as the new ThinkPad X1 Carbon not only sports the better efficiency of Intel Kaby Lake architecture, but also a larger 57 Whr battery, as opposed to the 52 Whr battery of the previous generation.  All those upgrades aside, there is now but one display option for the ThinkPad X1 Carbon, a 14-inch FHD 1920X1080 matte finish, anti-glare IPS panel with 322 nits brightness. This may or may not be a concern for you, but if you're looking for a 1440p or 4K option unfortunately that's not in the cards. 2016 ThinkPad X1 Yoga (left) - 2017 ThinkPad X1 Carbon (right) On the other hand, what you get for a more limited panel selection with the new ThinkPad X1 Carbon is a decidedly more compact machine. Here, Lenovo took a page from the thin bezel playbook and dropped the side bezels to 5mm and the top bezel to 9mm, just thick enough to still support that HD webcam up top.  Next to one of Lenovo's also 14-inch ThinkPad X1 Yoga machines, as you can see in the two shots above, the new ThinkPad X1 Carbon strikes a significantly smaller footprint overall. Both the display bezel and optimized palm rest area contribute to much cleaner, more compact lines. What's also impressive is how Lenovo managed to get the overall system weight of the machine down to just she of 2.5 pounds, which is over a half-pound lighter than the previous generation machine. This is one svelte ultrabook to be sure. If only we could get an OLED option here too? Sigh, one can dream right?  Let's drop in for a closer look at the 5th gen ThinkPad X1 Carbon...

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 18 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Honeywell’s Connected Freight Technology Monitors High-Value And Perishable Goods In Transit, Helping Prevent Damage, Loss And Theft FORT MILL, S.C., May 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced a  new Connected Freight solution that gives shippers and logistics companies unprecedented ability to monitor shipments of high-value and perishable goods, helping prevent costly damage and loss. The new solution, developed in collaboration with Intel and third-party logistics companies, provides real-time information about the location and condition of critical freight while in transit. The solution was introduced during Honeywell Safety and Productivity Solutions’ launch event today. „Honeywell is developing a range of Connected Supply Chain solutions that leverage technology and data to make supply chains more efficient and better able to adapt to rapid change,” said Taylor Smith, president of Honeywell’s Workflow Solutions business. „For shippers, logistics providers, retailers and others faced with a host of costly freight challenges, such as theft, damage, spoilage and delays, this convenient cloud-based solution provides customers with detailed analytics in order to plan, anticipate and react immediately to incidents that occur during shipment.” Real-time shipment information is critical, for example, when shipping perishables and goods that require uninterrupted refrigeration, such as pharmaceuticals, or high-value equipment that is sensitive to vibration or shock. „After assessing our internal supply chain needs and the needs of the industry, we forged a unique collaboration with Honeywell. Together, we’ve customized Intel’s Connected Logistics Platform technology to deliver an IoT offering that solves real logistics problems,” said Chet Hullum, general manager for Industrial Solutions at Intel. „Thanks to data accessibility, shippers and carriers will be able to establish a more reliable supply chain network by having deeper visibility and information on shipments.” Honeywell’s Connected Freight solution consists of cost-effective sensor tags that sense a range of environmental conditions, such as temperature or vibration. The tags can be affixed to pallets or individual packages. The sensor data is captured by a mobile gateway placed inside a truck or shipping container and then transmitted via cellular networks to a cloud-based command-and-control platform. Users can establish alerts based on temperature, shock, tilt, humidity, pressure and intrusion detection. The solution can alert manufacturers of high-value, highly sensitive technology if equipment has been damaged while being loaded or unloaded, or if it may have been stolen. The cloud can also store data for compliance and audit needs, and provide predictive and reactive analysis, such as which routes to avoid. Honeywell developed the technology with Intel and three prominent third-party logistics companies: DHL, Expeditors and Kuehne + Nagel. „Kuehne + Nagel chose Honeywell and Intel to partner in the development of Connected Freight because of their expertise and competence in this kind of technology. We have used our competence as a global provider of logistics services and our expertise in supply chain management in order to co-develop this new technology,” said Martin Kolbe, chief information officer at Kuehne + Nagel International AG. „We understand and anticipate the need for real-time data to inform customer actions during transportation very well. Armed with the Connected Freight solution, Kuehne + Nagel can offer a variety of new services tailored to our customers’ specific needs. There are ongoing trials of the technology with one of our customers in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry, which is of strategic importance for Kuehne + Nagel.” In addition to Connected Freight, Honeywell today unveiled a range of connected solutions for truck drivers, delivery workers and field technicians to improve productivity and ensure compliance with regulations.  A replay of the launch broadcast can be viewed on Honeywell’s website or by visiting: http://hwll.co/live.

The firm presently has a $40.00 target price on the chip maker’s stock. Zacks Investment Research‘s target price would indicate a potential upside of 14.16% from the company’s current price. According to Zacks, “Intel’s first-quarter 2017 results demonstrated a turnaround in the company’s businesses after a long time. The improving PC shipment data – as per Gartner and IDC – is positive for the company. The upcoming launch of Skylake is anticipated to benefit data center results in the second half. Moreover, the company revised up its 2017 revenue and EPS outlook based on improving average selling price (ASP). Further, anticipated improvement in cost structure and lower spending, primarily due to improving operational efficiency will aid in expansion of margins going forward. Additionally, aggressive share buyback will boost the bottom line in 2017. We note that Intel has underperformed the broader market on a year-to-date basis. Despite intensifying competition in most of the markets, we expect that these aforesaid factors will help Intel stock to rebound in the rest of 2017.” INTC has been the subject of several other reports.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | May 18, 2017 -- 15:00 GMT (08:00 PDT) | Topic: Internet of Things Intel and Honeywell on Thursday announced they're extending their Internet of Things partnership to shipping and logistics. Internet of Things in the enterprise: The state of play The Internet of Things can be a major driver of digital transformation, enabling new business models based on widespread devices and new data streams--if you can cope with the immature ecosystems. Read More Intel is launching a Connected Logistics Platform that enables companies to get real-time information, and make real-time decisions, about products they're moving. Building on the Connected Logistics Platform, Honeywell is launching what it calls its Connected Freight solution. It includes a package of low-cost sensors to attach to packages or other assets, which send information to Honeywell's enterprise cloud service. Effectively, it "allows shippers to have visibility of their product from Point A to Point B," Chet Hullum, GM for Industrial Solutions at Intel, told ZDNet. The sensors can track several variables of the package in question: location, temperature, shock, vibration, tilt, humidity, pressure, and exposure to light. They're connected in a mesh protocol network developed by Intel that allows interconnection between devices. The data is captured by a mobile gateway and transmitted via cellular networks to a cloud-based platform. Along with Honeywell and Intel, the whole solution was developed in conjunction with the logistics companies DHL, Expeditors, and Kuehne + Nagel. The data collected would be useful for a range of industries and use cases. For instance, data temperature or humidity is key for the food and beverage industry. Meanwhile, manufacturers of sensitive technology can track if their equipment has been damaged and find out exactly where and how. Storing data can also come in handy for audit and compliance requirements. The data could also be used for predictive or reactive analysis of factors such as travel routes. Third-party logistics providers like DHL are the most likely customers for the Intel and Honeywell package, Hullum said. They've also seen a strong response so far from shippers in key segments include food and beverage. Meanwhile, Amazon's overwhelming e-commerce presence has raised the stakes when it comes to fast and efficient shipping. While Honeywell has experience providing logistics support, Intel has in recent years cultivated its IoT segment -- along with other business segments -- as it shifts its focus from PCs. The technology Intel's developed in that effort, such as RealSense technology, can naturally apply to logistics and shipping, Hullum said. "It's about taking Intel technology and moving it into these spaces and partnering with the ecosystem," he said, "with folks like Honeywell that have a legacy of supplying certain products and who will allow Intel be part of that solution."

The idea seems to have had its genesis in a forum post on HardOCP, and it didn't take long for other sites to pick it up and run with it. Giving further energy to the rumor is the fact that Intel made its final payment to Nvidia as part of a lawsuit-settling patent-licensing agreement this March. We now know that rumor is simply incorrect. In a statement given to Barron's Tech Trader Daily column, Intel explicitly says that "the recent rumors that [it] has licensed AMD's graphics technology are untrue." AMD stock gained as much as 12% on renewed reports of the rumor, and when no such deal was announced at the company's financial analyst day Tuesday, that gain was quickly reversed. A few sources guessed that the rumor made sense because the Intel-Nvidia patent-licensing agreement was coming to an end. Upon actually reading the Nvidia document it clearly states that the licensing agreement continues until the patents expire. As explained by Mark Hibben over at SeekingAlpha, that effectively means that Intel has full use of Nvidia's relevant patents into perpetuity, and that means Intel has no reason to license graphics patents from anyone else. Besides, Intel has its own mature graphics technology with excellent power consumption characteristics. Allowing Intel to stick Radeon graphics into its CPUs could have provided AMD with some much-needed short-term capital, but the idea seemed far-fetched to begin with. No Intel CPU ever shipped with Nvidia graphics tech on board over the course of those companies' agreement, and any new licensing agreement would likely only exist to protect Intel from legal action. Furthermore, AMD needs to move Ryzen chips into high-volume laptops and desktops. Touting the potentially superior graphics performance of Vega-powered APUs is a path to positive press and potential future sales for AMD, and giving its largest competitor access to that graphics IP would seem to erode the red team's competitive position. In any case, we think we can consign this myth to the "busted" pile. Tags: CPUs Graphics Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars PC GAMING Building the virtual reality experiences and worlds of the future Dean Takahashi@deantak May 18, 2017 7:00 AM Pretty soon, real life will be stranger than fiction when it comes to bringing the great inventions of science fiction and games into technology. Kim Pallister, the director of Intel’s virtual reality center of excellence, moderated a fireside chat about that topic with science fiction writer Austin Grossman at our recent GamesBeat Summit 2017: How games, sci-fi, and tech create real-world magic. They dwelled on the future of virtual reality experiences and building worlds like the metaverse in Neal Stephenson’s 1992 sci-fi novel Snow Crash. Given the advances of VR, it’s not such a crazy talk to have anymore. People are really looking for an experience that lives up to the imagination portrayed in such early works of fiction. “Snow Crash imprinted [the idea of virtual life] on the culture,” Grossman said. Pallister added, “It feels like the current set of hardware has tipped us over a point where people can feel a magical experience but it is really only just the beginning of the types of experiences depicted in those fictional works.” Pallister leads Intel’s virtual reality (VR) project lab in Hillsboro, Oregon. His team is working to improve the state of VR technology and to bring VR to mainstream audiences. In his current role, Pallister forecasts the progress of VR and the ingredient technologies responsible for driving VR experiences.

Image Credit: Michael O'Donnell/VentureBeat Assisting Intel’s original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners, from Microsoft to HTC and Oculus, Pallister works closely with the underlying solutions making VR possible. Prior to rejoining Intel in 2007, Pallister worked on Microsoft’s business development team conducting deals for MS Casual Games services, including MSN Games, Xbox Live Arcade and Windows Live Messenger. From 1998 to 2005, he served as games technical strategist at Intel. Grossman straddles the lines between books and games, as he is both a novelist and game designer. Above: Kim Pallister of Intel talks with Austin Grossman (right) about the future of virtual reality. Image Credit: Michael O'Donnell/VentureBeat Grossman’s novels include Soon I Will Be Invincible, YOU: a novel, and Crooked. Soon I Will Be Invincible was nominated for the 2007 John Sargent Sr. First Novel Prize. His writing has also appeared in Granta, the Wall Street Journal, and the New York Times. His game credits include Ultima Underworld 2, System Shock, Trespasser, Deus Ex, Epic Mickey, and Dishonored, which received the 2012 BAFTA award for Best Game. “It’s discouraging if the thing that VR gives us is an escape from a dystopia rather than tool to better ourselves or better the world,” Pallister said. That was part of the premise behind the world of Ready Player One, the novel by Ernest Cline that is being turned into a sci-fi movie by Steven Spielberg, Grossman said. In the future, Grossman wants to be able to get all of the senses and sensations in VR so that he can learn how to dance in VR, and then come out into the real world and know how to dance in real life. Pallister, by contrast, wants to learn how to juggle in VR.

Blog Qualcomm Takes on the World, in Court Junko Yoshida, Chief International Correspondent 5/18/2017 09:31 AM EDT  0 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet When Intel and Samsung joined the fray last Friday by filing amicus briefs in support of the FTC's complaint against, matters went from bad to worse for Qualcomm What apparently started out as a royalty negotiation gone wrong between Qualcomm and Apple is now taking on a life of its own. This is no longer just a two-team legal hassle. When Intel and Samsung joined the fray last Friday by filing amicus briefs in support of the Federal Trade Commission’s complaint, matters went from bad to worse for Qualcomm. The case is starting to look like Qualcomm v. The World.   Amidst a hail of legal actions, Qualcomm Wednesday shot back. It filed a lawsuit against four ODMs who manufacture Apple’s products for not paying royalties. The contract manufacturers listed in the filing by Qualcomm are Foxconn, Pegatron, Wistron and Compal Electronics.   Qualcomm said in a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California that Apple had advised the contract manufacturers to withhold royalty payments. Apple agreed to indemnify them against any damages resulting from breaching their agreements with Qualcomm.   Under the arrangement, Apple would compensate royalty payments ODMs must make to Qualcomm. But last month Qualcomm claimed that Apple had decided to withhold royalty payments to its contract manufacturers that are owed to the chipmaker, for sales made in the first quarter of 2017, until the dispute is resolved in court. Twists and turns Complaints filed against Qualcomm are many. Beyond Apple’s $1 billion lawsuit against filed Jan. 20, Qualcomm is also battling regulatory agencies.   Last December, a ruling by South Korea’s Fair Trade Commission, for example, fined Qualcomm $854 million for violating competition laws. Qualcomm appealed on Feb. 21, seeking a stay of the fine.  Arguably Qualcomm's biggest worry right now is an FTC’s anti-trust case. On January 17 in federal court, the FTC charged Qualcomm with "using anticompetitive tactics to maintain its monopoly in the supply of a key semiconductor device used in cell phones and other consumer products."   In that filing, the FTC laid out three major allegations, charging that Qualcomm 1) maintains a “no license, no chips” policy under which it will supply its baseband processors only on the condition that cell phone manufacturers agree to Qualcomm’s preferred license terms, 2) refuses to license standard-essential patents to competitors, and 3) extracts exclusivity from Apple in exchange for reduced patent royalties.   Qualcomm filed a motion to dismiss the FTC suit on April 3. Qualcomm lawyers said that the FTC’s legal theories are flawed, and that it failed to prove harm to Qualcomm competitors.

AMD shares are down more than 25 percent from its 52-week high, which roughly coincided with the March 2 launch of its new Ryzen line of desktop processors that disappointed some gamers. Tae Kim | @firstadopter 18 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Ashley Pon | Bloomberg | Getty Images An Advanced Micro Devices AMD-A10-4600M Series APU computer chip. The biggest question that had traders in chip stocks buzzing this week is finally resolved, with Intel flatly denying the rumor it licensed AMD's graphics technology. Positive and negative speculation over the rumor sparked daily billion-dollar moves in AMD shares during the past two days. "The recent rumors that Intel has licensed AMD's graphics technology are untrue," an Intel spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC. AMD shares surged 12 percent Tuesday after website Fudzilla reported Intel signed a deal to license AMD's graphics technology. The company's shares then declined 12 percent Wednesday after Wall Street analysts downplayed the report and AMD didn't confirm the deal during its financial analyst day Tuesday. "Heading into the investor event, mainstream media reports suggested AMD's largest competitor, Intel, may license AMD's graphics IP. However, during the prepared remarks and meetings post-event, we came away with a view that AMD would not likely license core IP to a competitor," JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. AMD also declined to comment on the Fudzilla report. "As a matter of policy we don't comment on rumor or speculation," an AMD spokesperson said in a statement. AMD was one the best-performing stocks in the market in the past year. Its shares are up 192 percent during the past 12 months compared with the S&P 500's 15 percent return in the same time period. However, the hot chip stock is down more than 25 percent from its 52-week high, which roughly coincided with the March 2 launch of its new Ryzen line of desktop processors that disappointed some gamers. Barron's Tech Trader Daily initially reported on Intel denying the AMD deal speculation late Wednesday evening. AMD shares were off by 3 percent in Thursday premarket trading.

Blog AMD Goes Epyc for Data Centers Kevin Krewell, Principal Analyst, Tirias Research 5/18/2017 05:30 AM EDT  2 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet So far AMD is making good progress in its return to profitability, but it's too early to raise the "mission accomplished" banner. The key for AMD to return to more robust profitability is to move into more profitable segments of the industries that it already is in and reenter the server market. To do so, it has to move up the performance and price stack, as it did with the Ryzen processor for high performance PCs. The one area where AMD has the most growth opportunity is in the $21 billion server market.  Around 2005, AMD had more than 20 percent market share of the x86 server business with its Opteron processors. The company now readily admits it has nearly zero presence in the data center market. AMD hopes to change all that with a new Zen-based server processor code-named Naples. At its analyst event this week it gave these chips the Epyc brand. Beyond the name and the epic jokes, this chip has potential to disrupt today’s cloud data centers. The Epyc processor has 32 cores that support 64 threads, and it has 128 lanes of I/O and eight channels of memory, bringing a new level of balance between memory, I/O and compute. Just one Epyc processor can potentially replace two mainstream Intel Xeon processors. A single-socket Epyc server can actually replace a dual-socket Intel Xeon server, potentially changing the cost dynamics for cloud data centers. Epyc also supports dual-socket configurations and can compete and beat Intel’s dual-socket Xeon’s as well. We’ll have to wait for the company to reveal the pricing information at the official launch in the second half of June to see how attractive the company makes the parts. Interestingly, the Epyc processor is not based on a single die, but rather a multichip module composed of four smaller die. Each has eight processor cores and is roughly the same die as in AMD’s Ryzen PC processor. Tying the four ingredient die together is AMD’s Infinity interconnect that can be used on die, between die in package or between packaged parts. The scalable fabric allows AMD to build the processor more cost effectively. AMD's Epyc server processor puts four die on its Infinity fabric. (Image: AMD) This contrasts with the Volta GPU that Nvidia pushed the very limits of manufacturability with an 815 mm² die. By contrast, AMD built a high performance server processor composed of four die, each of which is approximately 200 mm2. The AMD approach is much more cost-effective thanks in part to better yields, but it requires a little bit of operating system support for maximum scalability of its non-uniform memory architecture. At the event, AMD revealed a server processor roadmap beyond Naples. Over the next three years, the company will release the Rome processor in a 7nm process using a second generation Zen core and a Milan processor in a 7nm+ process using a third generation Zen core. AMD also revealed a new premium PC processor with 16 cores supporting 32 threads called Ryzen Threadripper. Although no pricing was given, I expect this CPU to cost more than $1,000. AMD would not confirm it, but I expect Threadripper is based on two die in a multichip module. The company also released information on its forthcoming Vega GPU architecture expected to launch in the second half of June. The first Vega card will be called the Frontier Edition and will target machine learning workloads with up to 16 GBytes of HBM2 memory. Early benchmarks indicate the high-end Vega card will be competitive with Nvidia’s Pascal P100 GPU, but it looks to be significantly behind the performance of Nvidia’s Volta on machine learning. With up to 25 TFlops of 16-bit floating point performance, Vega at least gets AMD into the machine-learning conversation. Perhaps future Vega GPUs can be connected together on one substrate as AMD did with the Epyc. AMD’s Radeon group also showed its 2020 roadmap with a 7nm Navi GPU followed by a yet unnamed 7nm+ GPU. Overall, AMD plans to use a mix of wafers from Globalfoundries and TSMC for the 7nm and 7nm+ processors. Presently the company primarily uses Globalfoundries for its 14nm Ryzen, Epyc, and Vega products. --Kevin Krewell is a principal analyst at Tirias Research Email This Print Comment Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] User Rank Rookie Pending Review RAV   5/18/2017 5:57:16 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate This comment is waiting for review by our moderators.

They can have a SKU or two above 1000$ but AMD needs to have a 16 cores at 799$ so customers can fit CPU +mobo in 1000$. Will be interesting to see how they price 12 cores and less, if they have less than 12. No point in pricing it higher than server parts either - you can get a low clocks dual socket 8 cores Xeon E5-2620 v4 at 411$ today in retail. Vega was advertised at 26TFLOPS FP16 not 25 so AMD got the boost clocks close to 1600MHz. Anyway this was the weirdest presentation ever. AMD and its maniacal focus on shooting itself in the face. Lots of positive news, especially with Naples but then they went ahead and provided an impossibly low financial outlook. They made the claim that in PC Ryzen expands the SAM from 9 billion to 28 billion, that Vega in PC/Workstation expands it from 2.25 billion to 5 billion (2016 numbers) and that server is at 0% today so another big opportunity. All good until AMD decided to project double digit revenue growth. If you want to be cautious just don't provide any long term revenue outlook or folks will focus on the negative and fail to see the positives. They forgot to mention ARM server, semi-custom, cars and address long term plans for machine learning. AMD still has severe execution problems. Vega lost an entire cycle with it's delays, Zen wasn't quite ready on time. AMD's RX 560 hit retail this week under the radar despite being a substantial upgrade over the RX 460 - that's just really bad business. As for Epyc, Zen has higher throughput than Intel's core ,except with 256-bit vector code and it's pretty efficient so no reason not to sell well.

To try to offset this apparent malaise in the do-it-yourself market, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), the largest vendor of processors into this market, is "considering to push promotions bundling its Optane memory with motherboards using 200 series chipsets such as Z270, in the PC DIY channel to stimulate demand for the Kaby Lake platform." Image source: Intel. By way of reference, Optane memory refers to a type of high-speed solid-state storage based on a technology called 3D XPoint that Intel offers for the personal-computer market. It's designed to speed up system storage performance, particularly for systems that use traditional mechanical hard disk drives, which are much slower, but cheaper than, NAND-flash-based solid-state drives. According to Digitimes, "some retailers are pessimistic about the idea, since the next-generation Coffee Lake is scheduled to become available in late August and most consumers have adopted a watch-and-wait attitude about buying new products." Coffee Lake is the name of Intel's upcoming processor architecture for mainstream desktop computers. The main improvements it brings over the current Kaby Lake desktop chips that launched back in January are up to six processor cores, versus up to four for Kaby Lake, and an enhanced manufacturing technology for improved performance and efficiency, with 14nm++ replacing 14nm+. Let's look more closely at the bundling strategy Intel is reportedly considering, as well as some thoughts on how Coffee Lake could affect demand. Bundling strategy probably won't work The idea of selling component bundles in the do-it-yourself personal-computer market isn't new. Websites such as Newegg.com that specialize in selling components to DIY buyers offer such combo deals all the time, as do brick-and-mortar stores such as Microcenter. Perhaps Intel-sponsored bundles that may be a bit more aggressive than what the retailers offer on their own could help stimulate demand a little bit, but such bundles would probably be relevant only to people already in the market for new components; I doubt such deals would be effective in getting individuals who are happy with their systems to go out and buy a bunch of new components. Coffee Lake might do the trick, though One problem Intel probably faces in trying to stimulate demand in the DIY computer-part market is that it really hasn't offered dramatic performance-per-dollar improvements with each generation. For years, the company has offered mainstream chips with up to four processor cores, with modest improvements in performance per core in each successive generation. Members of the DIY market tend to be much more informed than typical computer buyers are, and they are therefore probably more sensitive to performance levels and generational performance improvements in determining when to upgrade and what to upgrade to. The Coffee Lake products should be interesting not because they'll push per-core performance up much, but because they'll offer 50% more cores than what Intel currently offers in this segment while probably not sacrificing on per-core performance. To the extent that the relatively weak demand in the do-it-yourself market is due to a lack of compelling products for consumers to buy, rather than just a general market weakness driven by other factors, the Coffee Lake chips could help improve demand here.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

It works well with OneDrive and other Microsoft stuff, and was excellent value too! Looking to upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile, I see there is no longer much choice of phones. I fancy the Lumia 650 and could splash out on a 950, but is this wise? I had an Android phone before that, which gradually ground to a halt, and my daughter uses iPhones, but they aren’t for me. I’m happy with Windows phones, but what’s happening with them? Will they go the way of BlackBerry? Mike Microsoft hasn’t launched a new Windows smartphone model for more than a year. However, it hasn’t given up on its smartphone operating system, so there may still be smartphones from other manufacturers. In fact, the best Windows 10 smartphone you can buy today, the HP Elite X3, is a third-party device. Fortunately, you don’t have to buy a new phone to run Windows 10. Your Lumia 640 shipped with Windows 8.1 v2 (aka Denim), but it should run Windows 10 reasonably well, and Microsoft provides a free upgrade online. The free upgrade also works with the Lumia 1520, 930, 830, 735, 640XL, 635, 535 and 435 smartphones. In fact, you could go one step further and enrol in the Windows Insider test program. This offers Windows 10 free on a wider range of hardware, including the Alcatel OneTouch Fierce XL, Xiaomi Mi4 and several BLU Win smartphones. Ideally, installing and updating Windows 10 should enable you to keep using your current phone until we see what happens with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 towards the end of this year and in early 2018. The future is Snapdragon In December, Microsoft said it was going to release a full version of Windows 10 for the fast eight-core Snapdragon 835 processor. Unlike earlier Windows phones and Windows RT tablets, this will run traditional Windows software, such as Adobe Photoshop, as well as Windows Store apps. Traditional Windows software is written for Intel x86 processors, not for the ARM chips used in most smartphones. However, new devices based on the Snapdragon 835 will “transpile” binary Intel code into ARM code on the fly via a sort of emulation layer. This approach is similar to the FX!32 that Digital Equipment Corporation used to run Windows programs on its Alpha processor in 1996. It’s also like Transitive’s QuickTransit program, which Apple licensed to run old Mac software when it switched from IBM PowerPC to Intel processors. (Apple called it Rosetta.) Like other Snapdragon chips, the 835 is designed for mobile phones such as Sony’s Xperia XZ, so it includes LTE and Bluetooth communications. Microsoft aims to enable PC manufacturers to create connected Windows 10 laptops with all-day battery life, but the 835 could power Windows 10 smartphones and Microsoft HoloLens headsets as well. Microsoft already has Continuum, which enables a Windows 10 smartphone to provide a PC-like interface on a large screen display, but that only works with apps. I’d buy a full Windows 10 smartphone just to get the same operating system on all my devices: desktop, laptop, tablet and smartphone. Ecosystem wars Facebook Twitter Pinterest Nokia Lumia 640 Windows phone. Photograph: Microsoft You say that your Lumia 640 “works well with OneDrive and other Microsoft stuff”. Microsoft wants Apple iPhone and Android users to say exactly the same thing. Last week, Microsoft announced plans for the next major version of Windows 10, the Fall Creators Update, at its developers’ conference in Seattle. This includes new features to enable “Windows experiences [to] move with you across Windows, iOS, and Android”. In particular, Microsoft is integrating Cortana, its intelligent assistant, into these operating systems to help users to work seamlessly on documents when they switch between devices. As I’ve been saying for a couple of years, the “platform wars” (between Windows, Mac, Linux etc) are over. The current battle is between the three major ecosystems backed by Apple, Google and Microsoft. In an earlier answer, I wrote that: “Apple’s approach is mostly ‘Apple only’ (apart from iTunes), while Google’s is mostly ‘cloud only’ (apart from Chrome). Both support only a very limited range of devices. By contrast, Microsoft is building an ecosystem that supports both on-premise and cloud operation, and that runs across all three ecosystems: it has dozens of apps for Android and Apple’s iOS, and is increasing its support for Linux in Windows 10 and Azure. Windows runs on everything from USB sticks, games consoles and smartphones to giant server farms, and there’s an internet of things version for the Raspberry Pi and other devices.” Either way, Microsoft’s long-term strategy is to make money from Azure cloud services such as Office 365 and Dynamics 365. It must cater for billions of iOS and Android users, not just Windows users. Phone choices As you have noticed, there are not many Windows smartphones available. That problem could be solved by third-party manufacturers such as HP, Acer, HTC and BLU Win, but I don’t have much confidence in that happening, unless the Snapdragon 835 restarts the hardware business. As it is, the Lumia 650, 950 and 950XL are your best choices, and the 650 is good value at £140-£150. It was launched in the UK on 18 February last year, so it’s only seven months older than the iPhone 7. Unfortunately, the 650 isn’t more powerful than your 640. The main differences are that it has 16GB of storage instead of 8GB, and that it has a nicer OLED screen. The 950 and 950XL are improvements, but cost more than twice as much. Worse, I don’t know of any other good Windows smartphones on the way. There’s the long-rumoured Microsoft Surface Phone, of course, but if it exists, it will be expensive and aimed more at business users – something like the HP Elite X3, perhaps. In fact, the next phone to arrive in Microsoft’s US stores will be the Samsung Galaxy S8 Microsoft Edition. This Android phone will be customised with Microsoft apps when you take it online. You could just buy an Android phone and do this yourself. Either way, if you like using a Windows smartphone, there’s no reason to change unless you have to. I consulted fellow journalist Mary Branscombe, who is another happy user. She said: “It’s not the thing Microsoft is putting the most effort into, but it’s not going away, and if it’s what you like, it’s fine to stick with it. I am!” Have you got a question?

More than 100 new business models from the world over  The presence of international enterprises has been given particular impetus this year with the inclusion of pavilions from countries like Sweden - which is also the DES2017 guest country - Belgium and Israel, which has returned after being the guest country in the first edition. Sweden, guest country  Sweden is one of the world's most innovative countries. "It is clear that digitalization brings enormous opportunities for the sustainable development of various business sectors, and it is also a prerequisite for making sure your company, public institution or country is competitive and an attractive business associate," commented Malin Svensson, Sweden's Business Advisor in Spain and Director of Business Sweden Spain and Portugal. According to the British magazine Wired, Sweden is the world's most connected and digital economy. Sweden's success story has been driven by a climate that favours the innovation of tomorrow and the improvements in productivity made by the Swedish economy, boosted by digitalisation since the 1990s, are testament to this. Proof can be found in the Swedish industry and its companies, some of which will be present in DES 2017. Stand-out partners include Ericsson and ABB who - together with other excellent examples such as Telenor Connexion, Aptilo Networks, Bambwa, CombiQ, Evothings Labs, H&D Wireless, Imagimob, Infracontrol, LumenRadio, Näktergal, Springworks, Things and WOK-World of Knowledge  - all contribute to the digital business fabric with innovative and cutting-edge solutions. The AReality exhibition, produced and presented together with the Swedish Institute in DES 2017, will display examples of pioneering innovation and industrial design through Augmented Reality. Magnus Melander, IoT (Internet of Things) guru, consultant and evangelist at THINGS Stockholm will lead the "Connected Business by Sweden" conference in the Masterminds Congress programme, together with representatives that will inspire by highlighting real life examples of the Swedish success story. He will also show how Sweden has created this climate of innovation through collaborations between large corporations and small companies, with truly close cooperation between the business fabric, public administration and the academic world.   ICEX will also be present in DES2017  Spain will also be present in DES2017 through the ICEX Spain Export and Investment Pavilion, in which 20 firms will participate. Key Spanish representatives include cyber security start-ups, grouped together by the INCIBE (National Institute of Cyber security), such as Randed, Electronic Identification, Formavolucion, Acerodocs, and Continuum Security. The Spanish Pavilion will also host a wide variety of technologies related to digital transformation including Cloud Computing, with the presence of Gigas and Capside; EdTech (training) with collaborative training platform, BluebottleBiz, and ISDI; FinTech with Innsomnia, Spain's first specialist FinTech incubator; MarTech (marketing) with Marketeer; networks with Ayscom and Quobis; and Big Data thanks to the presence of Carto, specialist in the analysis of geolocation data as a business development asset. Wallonia (Belgium) in DES2017  Through the Agency for Foreign Trade of the Walloon region (AWEX) and Digital Wallonia, a technological Hub that unites all the key players of the IT sector of Wallonia (Belgium) in a collaborative ecosystem, the pavilion of Wallonia (Belgium) will include the participation of companies dedicated to consultancy and management of digital transformation from strategy creation to implementation and management of the process, such as ACTORIS and I.R.I.S. (IMAGE RECOGNITION INTEGRATED SYSTEMS). INTERSYSTO is another notable company, which is behind 3S-Homecare, a system that helps the elderly and hospitalised people at home; and companies dedicated to the development of digital marketing solutions such as EXPOPOLIS, which has developed a modulated and integrated system to satisfy the organizational needs of fairs and virtual events; and QUALIFIO a leading platform in the generation of engagement and data collection on digital communities. Other companies that will also be present include CHAINREACTOR t/a AMMBR, DYNAMIC FLOWS and THINGSPLAY, which stands out for its IoT solution for the industry. ISRAEL, back for the second year in a row  The Israeli pavilion will feature 12 organisations from the areas of cyber security, New Media, digital transformation, Device Management, Enterprise Mobility, OTT, Media, Entertainment, Cloud Computing and storage solutions, Retail & Commerce, among others. Holland in DES2017  Holland has always been a country that is open to business and its presence in DES - Digital Business World Congress furthers its stake that will allow it to continue at the forefront of new technological trends. With the support of the companies present in the Pavilion, opportunities for collaboration that encourage innovation and digitalisation will be explored. We can all win through the process of economic digitalization, the challenge is to know how to adapt quickly to an environment in which the consumer has taken the reins and determines the need for new products and services. The Dutch pavilion will feature five companies (INTERXION, ONEGINI, MYMULTICHANNEL, TRIPOLIS SOLUTIONS and ING) along with three start-ups (Time Tracker, Cocoon and Gigastarter). "Us Dutch focus on innovation and we do it through the Dutch golden triangle. That is to say, in collaboration with research centres, businesses and the government, so that together we can maximise our returns in the development of new technological solutions. The DES - Digital Business World Congress is a powerful opportunity to establish new alliances with cutting-edge Spanish and international companies in the field of digitalisation. Madrid offers an excellent business ecosystem for Dutch companies. We want to be leaders in the ICT sector, in education, infrastructure, security and as business owners," commented Matthijs van Bonzel, the Dutch ambassador to Spain.

At the SAP Sapphire NOW conference, Intel showed up to 1.59x higher Intel Xeon processor performance running in-memory SAP HANA workloads. Diane Bryant, group president of the Data Center Group at Intel, outlined how the Intel Xeon Processor Scalable family - available in mid-2017 - will provide enhanced performance to in-memory applications like SAP HANA. This will provide customers faster time-to-insight and allow organizations to rapidly respond to change. Bryant also announced that SAP has certified HANA to support up to 6x greater system memory on the new Intel platform for 4- or 8-socket configurations over the representative installed base of systems available four years ago. More information about the immediate-term benefits of running SAP HANA workloads on the Intel Xeon Processor Scalable family is available at Intel's IT Peer Network site. Additionally, exhibiting Intel's commitment to re-architecting the data center to support the future needs of a data-intensive world driven by the growth of artificial intelligence, 5G, autonomous driving and virtual reality, Intel demonstrated live for the first time its future persistent memory solution in a DIMM form factor. Based on 3D XPoint media, Intel persistent memory is a transformational technology that will deliver to the mainstream memory that is higher capacity, affordable and persistent. With Intel persistent memory, Intel is revolutionizing the storage hierarchy to bring large amounts of data closer to the Intel Xeon processor, which will enable many new usage models and make in-memory applications like SAP HANA even more powerful. Intel persistent memory will be available in 2018 as part of an Intel Xeon Processor Scalable family refresh (codename: Cascade Lake). During a live demonstration of Intel persistent memory at SAP Sapphire, Lisa Davis, vice president of IT Transformation for Enterprise and Government in the data Data Center Group at Intel, noted that with Intel persistent memory, in-memory databases like SAP HANA will be able to deliver even faster transactions, perform real-time analytics and accelerate business decision-making. In preparation for next year's availability, software developers can accelerate their readiness for Intel persistent memory today with the libraries and tools at www.pmem.io. Further product details will be unveiled at a later date. Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ... Not the best 3 ... Average 4 ... Good 5 ...

So I expect the same comparison to be made here. Grabbed this from Intel's release on the show Quote: Intel estimate, Intel Xeon processor Scalable family series as compared to a representative Intel® Xeon® processor E7 v4 system.- - - Representative systems available four years ago (Intel® Xeon E7 Processor) Ok. So, let's dig into wording here, because this is bugging me something fierce. Quote: Bryant also announced that SAP has certified HANA to support up to 6x greater system memory on the new Intel platform for 4- or 8-socket configurations So, this enhanced memory support is only exclusive to Intel based systems running the upcoming Xeons? Or is this is a generalised update to HANA that allows it to support greater memory as a whole? If they want to start disabling specific instructions and feature support for Intel's competitors based on no technological reasoning, then that could end poorly. Quote: With Intel persistent memory, Intel is revolutionizing the storage hierarchy Nowhere can I find anything on this new memory, other than it being non-volatile. Which, considering the downtime servers face and how reliable they're designed to, shouldn't really be a consideration for anyone, especially in a 4 or 8 socket server rack. I find it amusing that even Intel are still trying to chant on about Self Driving cars, meanwhile no sane country will legalise them..Assisted driving maybe..But self? Nah. I mean, am I missing something here, or was the only meaningful thing released here was news of a vendor lock-in, and then some buzzwords to bulk it out?

Putin's press conference came amid controversy surrounding Trump's alleged disclosure of classified information to Russian officials last week.  Putin said the transcript could be provided, "if the US administration finds it appropriate," CNN reported. Read: Trump Denies Sharing Classified Intel To Russians In A Series Of Tweets Just a day after the Washington Post claimed Trump disclosed classified intel in a White House meeting about a planned Islamic State group (ISIS) operation, the New York Times claimed the information allegedly discussed came from Israel. On Tuesday, Trump and Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke over a phone call for over 20 minutes. However, officials claimed that there was no discussion of classified information during the call. Senior officials told Haaretz Tuesday night that Trump and Netanyahu talked about the upcoming Israel visit of the U.S. president.  Trump made the phone call to Netanyahu soon after talking with Jordan's King Abdullah II, after which the White House had released a statement. However, the call with Netanyahu was not publicized either by the White House or the Prime Minister's Office. Haaretz reported that Netanyahu's office confirmed the phone call took place. "The conversation dealt with a few issues that needed to be concluded regarding President Trump's visit to Israel," Haaretz quoted an anonymous source. Regarding the allegations in the New York Times report, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer said in an e-mailed statement: "Israel has full confidence in our intelligence-sharing relationship with the United States and looks forward to deepening that relationship in the years ahead under President Trump."  White House Press Secretary, Sean Spicer, refused to comment on whether Israel is the source of the classified information Trump is alleged to have shared with the Russian officials. However, he offered appreciation at the ambassador's comment on the U.S.-Israeli relationship. Spicer said during the press conference: "We appreciate the strong relationship that we have with Israel with respect to intelligence-sharing, and hope to continue to grow that bond.  But I'm not going to comment on specifically where it came from." On Tuesday, Trump defended himself over the alleged disclosure of classified intel saying that he shared information related to "terrorism" and "airline flight safety." On Monday, the Washington Post reported Trump did not disclose the exact source used for the intel, but he provided “code-word information,” apparently connected to an ISIS plot related to the use of laptops on board passenger aircrafts. Following the Post's report, the White House rejected the claims, with H.R. McMaster, Trump’s national security adviser, saying the president and Russian foreign minister “reviewed common threats from terrorist organizations to include threats to aviation.” "The story that came out tonight as reported is false," McMaster told reporters at the White House Monday. "At no time were intelligence sources or methods discussed. The president did not disclose any military operations that were not already publicly known. I was in the room. It didn't happen." Meanwhile, Trump drew strong condemnation from Democrats as well as some Republican lawmakers.  "The disclosure of highly classified information has the potential to jeopardize sources and to discourage our allies from sharing future information vital to our security," Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said. The president and the White House continue to deny the allegations.

Each of those chips comprises four eight-core Zen units, connects up to 8 memory channels, and has 128 lanes of PCIe 3.0 connectivity. Those specs are enticing enough on their own, but the first questions on every datacenter administrator's mind are how exactly do these CPUs perform and how exactly does AMD intend to fit them onto rack units. As it turns out, AMD isn't trying to aim cannonballs at top-end Xeon servers. Instead, the company wants to take a slice from the meaty middle of the two-socket (2S) server market, and is posing its Epyc offerings as single-socket alternatives that should hopefully deliver the same performance with much smaller boards—thereby potentially lowering cooling and power requirements. To illustrate the point, AMD offered a demonstration of a 2S Epyc system going against two high-end Xeon E5-2699A v4 CPUs, each with 22 cores and 55 MB of cache. AMD's machine had 256 GB of RAM thanks to its eight channels, while the Intel-powered server was rolling with 128 GB. The Epyc box finished a Linux kernel compilation in 15.7 seconds, around 43% faster than the 22.5 seconds it took the Intel system. Those figures may raise a couple eyebrows on their own, but AMD proceeded to point out that not a whole lot of systems are shipped with the mighty Xeon E5-2699A v4 onboard. According to the company, servers powered by Intel's Xeon offerings between the ES-262x and ES-265x series make up the bulk of shipments, and among those, the ES-264x series is the best seller among them. AMD proceeded to offer another demonstration, then: a single-socket Epyc system with 128 GB of RAM going up against a 2S box with Xeon ES-2650 v4 CPUs (12 cores each). For a Linux kernel compile, the Epyc system took 33.7 seconds, while the Xeon box did its work in 37.2 seconds. While this is but a single benchmark, it's nonetheless impressive and lends some credence to AMD's plan of going after two-socket systems with single-socket Epyc offerings. AMD offered some more figures to support its case. The company says that an Epyc 1S system has "significantly" lower power consumption versus a comparable 2S Intel-powered machine and can offer a 30% lower total cost of ownership (TCO). Taking a direct jab at Intel's world-famous and world-hated product segmentation, AMD says that all Epyc CPUs are "unrestrained," meaning that the entire lineup from the lower-end model to the fanciest CPU will offer the same PCIe connectivity, all eight memory channels, the same security stack, and the same set of chipset features. Finally, the company played up Epyc's I/O (namely those 128 PCIe lanes) as an advantage for machine learning applications (you thought you'd read an entire post without those words?) As a sample case study, AMD showed what it takes for an Intel system to drive six compute accelerator cards—two CPUs, a storage controller, two sets of eight DIMMs, and two PCIe switches. In comparison, an Epyc system would require a single CPU directly reaching out to the drives, 16 DIMM slots, and all six compute cards at once. Only time will tell whether AMD's Epyc moves in the server space will pan out, but we're at least cautiously optimistic. After all, I can barely even remember the days when I saw "Opteron" in a text console. Tags: CPUs Servers Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

News & Analysis Intel's Flash Gambit Evolving Into 3-Pronged Strategy Majeed Ahmad 5/18/2017 00:01 AM EDT 3 comments NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet LAHORE, Pakistan—After years of mostly covert development, Intel’s investment in flash memory is finally showing signs of bearing fruit in 2017, a year that some observers are calling “the year of NAND flash.” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich claims that the company's non-volatile memory business will finally be profitable by 2018. It's worth noting that Intel announced record revenue of $866 million in the first quarter of 2017. At the same time, however, the world's largest chipmaker has vowed to raise the capex for its memory business. Intel, for instance, has been expanding the NAND flash capacity at its Fab 68 in Dalian, China. A closer look at Intel's non-volatile memory business reveals a three-pronged strategy. First and foremost, Intel plans to focus on differentiated products with higher ASPs, said Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research. Intel is also investing heavily in much smaller 3D NAND flash chips while seeking opportunities in the planar-to-3D NAND transition. Intel is using floating-gate cells to bring significant improvements in the density of 3D NAND flash chips. Second, as a recent EE Times story points out, Intel is moving into solid-state drive (SSD) business in a bid to provide software-defined storage for datacenter and cloud computing applications. That also allows the chipmaker to protect its NAND flash margins while meeting the surge in SSD demand for servers. No wonder the majority Intel's flash revenues comes from the sale of its SSDs for the higher-end server market. It also lowers the reliance on NAND flash buyers like Western Digital, which dropped Intel a few years ago after acquiring SanDisk, Toshiba's NAND flash partner. Third, Intel is stepping up investment in 3D Xpoint, another non-volatile memory technology that promises to serve as a storage product as well as a DRAM replacement. The 3D Xpoint memory technology is said to offer vast improvements in speed and endurance when compared to NAND flash. Intel and its 3D Xpoint technology partner Micron Technology are years ahead when it comes to a viable flash replacement. However, as Krewell puts it, Intel hasn't been very transparent with details about the 3D Xpoint technology. And that makes it hard to verify Intel's claims. Krewell expects a gradual 3D Xpoint ramp in the near term. Intel—with a controlled supply—can match volume production of 3D Xpoint with demand and thus avoid over-supply that is intrinsically tied to the flash business. - Majeed Ahmad is a technology writer and historian who covers semiconductors for EE Times.  Related content: Intel Ramps up 3D NAND, NVMe SSDs Intel Boots Drives with 3D XPoint Intel Boosts CapEx 20% Email This Print Comment Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] User Rank CEO Re: Nonsense realjjj   5/18/2017 12:05:17 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate "First, Intel's memory group [NSG] has announced $866 million in revenue in Q1 2017, which is 55% more than $577 million in Q1 2016." Pay attention and do the math. Look at how bit output grows for the industry , account for the fact that Micron and Intel are above that average this cycle ( they were bellow average in the previous cycle) and then account for NAND pricing. Intel's CAPEX for NAND is due to them taking some production outside the JV not because there is a so called ramp. This bit is interesting, if the press would ask why but the press falls for the official nonsense because the press is a marketing vehicle nowadays. Look at clean room area for 2D vs 3D NAND, terms of the JV, Intel's (idle) fab capacity and maybe you find an answer. MIcron NV revenue (approx in millions) in the last 4 reported quarters 1400,  1270, 1000 , 900. Vs Intel's 866, 816, 649, 554. Revenue is a factor of volume, price and mix ofc but even when ignoring mix, see how both scale by a bit over 55%? It's the process transition (in this case 2D to 3D) and NAND pricing, no evidence of any ramp on top of it, at all.

Now show us any evidence at all of anything unusual and a so called ramp. It's a white lie for investors since Intel now has a reporting segement for NVM. Going forward, Xpoint will mask the pseudo-ramp for NAND so folks will keep thinking it's there - standard operating procedure for corporations like Intel.

We’re joined now by phone by John Carlin. He served as chief of staff and senior counsel to Robert Mueller. He’s now an attorney in private practice specializing in cyber-security and crisis management. Mr. Carlin, thanks for joining us. Tell us a little bit about your former boss. JOHN CARLIN, Former Assistant Attorney General for National Security: I can’t think of an American of higher integrity and experience. This is someone legendary who prosecutors and agents in the field, who — a former Marine, spent a career as a prosecutor, has been nominated by presidents, including President Clinton, President Bush, and President Obama, for different positions, and, throughout his career, has earned respect on both sides of the aisle. JOHN YANG: And do — talk about his independence. There was — you talked about being legendary. There’s — one of the legends about Robert Mueller is his threat to resign, ironically, with then-Deputy Attorney General James Comey facing down the Bush administration. JOHN CARLIN: He’s someone who has a firm belief in what’s right and wrong and what the appropriate role of a government official should be. I think he’s someone who looks to — epitomizes the idea that you should just follow the facts and the law, and has done so in all the different steps of his — of his career. And, as you have referenced, he’s someone who, if something appears that it’s outside the law, he won’t do it, or, if it’s improper, he won’t do it. And it’s that type of firm backbone that earned the respect of so many people that have worked with him as FBI agents, worked with him as prosecutors, and observed him over the years. He’s also highly unusual in this age. He’s someone who hates the — and avoids the limelight. And he’s managed to stay out of most news stories and keep an unbelievably low profile, when you consider what he’s done over his career. JOHN YANG: Could you remind us of that episode? Recount for us that episode with the showdown with, I believe, as I recall, it was White House counsel Alberto Gonzales. They wanted to overrule a Justice Department finding regarding surveillance, as I recall. JOHN CARLIN: Yes. And according to public reporting about what occurred there, there was a surveillance program that the then attorney general — Attorney General Ashcroft was ill. So, and Deputy Attorney General Jim Comey had assumed the role of acting attorney general. And based on the advice he received from lawyers at the Office of Legal Counsel, he found that the program, as it was currently being run, wasn’t lawful, and so had to be shut down. And he learned about a visit that was going to be made by members of the White House, including the White House counsel, to Attorney General Ashcroft in his hospital bed, and was concerned. And so he asked Director Mueller to accompany him to that hospital room. Director Mueller did so. Attorney General Ashcroft said that, as acting attorney general, it would be Comey’s decision as to what was lawful or not lawful. And I think Director Mueller, kind of consistent with his career, if the lawyers at the Justice Department say something is not lawful, then you can’t do it, until you work out a way that it’s within the confines of the law. No matter how important the program might be, the law is the law. JOHN YANG: Ironically, the careers of James Comey and Robert Mueller once again intertwined. John Carlin, thank you very much for joining us. JOHN CARLIN: Thank you. JOHN YANG: And now we turn to — continuing on this story, we turn to Congressman Adam Kinzinger, a Republican of Illinois. He called today for a special counsel. Representative Kinzinger, I presume your — well, what’s your reaction now to the appointment of former FBI Director Robert Mueller? REP. ADAM KINZINGER, R-Ill.: Well, I was surprised. I was surprised in a good way. I think this is the right thing to do. The reason I called for it today, with the revelations of the supposed memo yesterday, the questions that have been arising, I just came to the realization — and I have always said from the beginning the American people deserve the facts, whatever they are, whoever they exonerate or whoever they indict. The American people deserve that. And this had become way too political. Any new story, any new piece of information that had come out, you know, the left screams — some on the left mention impeachment right away. Some on the right would say it’s fake news. And neither is true. So, we need to get to the bottom of it. We need answers, and we need them in a nonpartisan way. And my hope is, this is the beginning of the process of saying, let’s all tack a deep breath. Let’s aggressively find out the truth of everything and the facts, and then we can move ahead, and the American people can have faith again in the institutions of government. JOHN YANG: Do you think this is going to turn the temperature down a little bit on the Hill, sort of the boiling controversy that’s been going on for the past really couple of weeks now? REP. ADAM KINZINGER: It’s hard to tell. You know, truthfully, probably not a lot. You’re going to have now an outlet, I guess, for this. It’s — Congress can say — there will probably be these investigations continuing still in the Congress, but the majority of the focus will be with the special counsel’s office. But this is a very hot-button issue. And any new revelation that comes out, people are angry or people are happy about what they see or whatever. So, you’re going to continue to see that dynamic, I think. I think this is going to continue to drive news cycles and drive stories. But I think this is the right way to go for the American people, so they can say — you know, look, notoriously, have a very low faith in Congress to be able to do things in a nonpartisan way, because we’re a partisan body. But to be able now to move forward and say we want to get to the bottom with a very honorable American like Mr. Mueller, I think, is a good step. JOHN YANG: Is this any way an acknowledgment that the turmoil and sort of the back-and-forth that you saw with the House Intelligence Committee trying to investigate this, that they just could not handle this, that you had to turn to someone, an outsider like this? REP. ADAM KINZINGER: Well, I think, ultimately, it’s handleable. And whether it’s the House Intel or the Senate Intel Committee, they do this kind of stuff. They have access to the information. They go through the process. But there’s no doubt, a month or two ago, it got very heated, it got very personal. You can’t have that on the Intel Committee. I don’t necessarily know who to throw stones at on that, but you can’t have that on the Intel Committee. What you need is a calm, rational investigation. This, with this special counsel now, hopefully, we can get that. And, again, there will still be a lot of passion. Donald Trump is a very controversial president. People either love him or they don’t love him, and so you will continue to have that. But I think now people can hopefully rest assured that the work is going to be done. But they need to understand, everybody needs to understand this is going to be a slow and deliberate process. I guess I’m hearing it’s almost 60 days to even get a special counsel up and running. JOHN YANG: Let me talk you about the other controversies that have been around this week, the — not — this was topped obviously yesterday by the Comey memo. But, before that, we had the allegations about President Trump giving Israeli intelligence, what’s reported to be Israeli intelligence, to the Russians. What do you think about that? REP. ADAM KINZINGER: So, I was disappointed. So, I’m a military pilot. I still serve in the Guard and fly planes, and I have been in since basically after college. And we learned early that, when it comes to classified information — I have a military classification, as well as a congressional classification — you have to be very careful with that. Now, the president does have the right to declassify information whenever he wants to. Theoretically, a president could take everything Edward Snowden stole and release that himself. But it doesn’t make it wise. And so if you’re going to, especially with an adversary, talk about something that’s classified, you need to do two things. Number one, talk to the folks that provided that information to you and make sure it’s OK, and, secondly, I think put that through the brain trust of your national security group, H.R. McMaster, everybody else, to say, hey, I want to reveal this to the Russians because it may help us in our fight with ISIS or whatever reason. If we can go through that filter, I think it would have been very different. But it seems like — I wasn’t in the Oval Office — it seems like it was released willy-nilly. And I think that’s a very bad thing, very dangerous, and hopefully a lesson learned from all this. JOHN YANG: How has all of this affected your confidence and trust in the president? It’s a very early administration, and we have had all this turmoil, all these stories going on. Has this shaken your confidence at all? REP. ADAM KINZINGER: Well, as I have always said, I think the policies — as a Republican, the policies coming out of this administration, the foreign policy, has been good. The strike on Syria was good, pushing back against North Korea. The words are not. You know, the tweets, the early morning kind of Twitter rampage and some of these other things aren’t. Does it shake my confidence? Look, I think that’s a pretty boisterous thing to say for a member of Congress to say whether or not their confidence is shaken. I have concerns. But I know he has a great team around him advising him, and I hope he takes that advice. This is, again — hopefully, this special counsel is the beginning of bringing the temperature down a little bit. It will always be pretty hot, but, hopefully, we can see that. JOHN YANG: Do you think — are you hopeful that you will and — you and your colleagues in the House will be able to focus more on the Republican agenda now than on the president’s tweets and other things? REP. ADAM KINZINGER: Yes. I’m really hopeful. I have been hopeful for while that we can do that. Look, we can walk — I hate to use the term, but we can walk and chew gum out here. So, we can have these controversies going on, but, still, today, we just voted on a bill passed unanimously for sanctions against Syria. We can continue to do that work. But when you have all this basically dominating the news cycle, it doesn’t give us an opportunity to get our message out, whether it’s health care, tax reform. And, frankly, then the president of the United States is not out selling that agenda, too. So, it takes away some key pieces to getting this done. So, hope springs eternal, and I have it now. JOHN YANG: Adam Kinzinger, representative from Illinois, thanks so much for joining us. REP. ADAM KINZINGER: Any time. Take care. JOHN YANG: And now we are joined by Matt Zapotosky from The Washington Post to talk about this. Matt, thanks for joining us. I think I probably butchered your last name. And I apologize. (CROSSTALK) JOHN YANG: Matt, this — as recently as yesterday, the White House was saying there was absolutely no need for a special counsel in this case. From your reporting, what — what happened? How did this — what precipitated all of this? MATT ZAPOTOSKY, The Washington Post: I don’t know that the White House always knows what’s going on inside the Justice Department. And, for days now, Rod Rosenstein, who is the deputy attorney general, had just seen his reputation battered over his role in the Comey case. You know, pressure had been increasing on both sides, Democrat and Republican, for the Justice Department to appoint an attorney general. I’m sure conversations were going on that we’re still trying to report on between him and Bob Mueller, the former FBI director that they appointed to be special counsel. And those obviously came to fruition today, though it’s really late-breaking. We’re still trying to report out exactly what happened. JOHN YANG: But do you think — we know there was reporting that Rod Rosenstein had — was unhappy that the dismissal of Comey was put on him, that the White House was putting it on him, and that he may have even threatened to resign. Is this a way for him to try to sort of reclaim his reputation? MATT ZAPOTOSKY: I think somewhat, you know? And, I mean, look, he maybe made some threats or said some things to express his unhappiness with the way this went down, but you can’t read his memo any other way than to see that he wanted Jim Comey gone. That was just a blistering critique of Jim Comey. I do think he saw a lot of the blowback and reacted in some ways, and maybe that is what led to us where we are right now. JOHN YANG: Let’s turn to this — the new development, Robert Mueller. What — remind us who he is, his background, and what he brings to this. MATT ZAPOTOSKY: He’s a former FBI director who is very well-respected in Washington. Just as I sat down, a former federal prosecutor I know was texting me saying, there just could not be a better pick. He has a reputation of fierce independence. I think he has some military experience in his background and, of course, led the FBI for a long time. So, you know, and what he will do now is just take over this investigation, take over what Rod Rosenstein would have done. He could bring in his own team. He could use FBI agents. Maybe he knows some from his time in the bureau, but just a very well-respected guy in Washington. JOHN YANG: Matt, you cover the Justice Department. What’s this done to the career prosecutors, the career officials, the career lawyers at Justice? What’s the morale been like, from what you can gather? MATT ZAPOTOSKY: I think there’s some frustration. But, by and large, people are just putting their heads down and working. I mean, there’s a very small number of people, you know, a very tight circle, I guess I should say — I don’t know about small number — but on this Russia stuff. And the other business of the Justice Department is going on. Certainly, I don’t think anybody likes the hit that it’s given to the Justice Department’s reputation, but these are career people who are going to come in and do their jobs every day. JOHN YANG: And do you have any sense of where this investigation is, where it was before this announcement? MATT ZAPOTOSKY: I would say now it has probably slowed down. I mean, Bob Mueller now has to come in, decide what he needs for a budget, decide who he’s going to keep on, and if he needs to bring in any new people. I don’t have a crystal-clear sense of exactly how far along they were. I think the FBI director — the former FBI director said that it had started in July, and that’s a pretty small amount of time for a counterintelligence case. And now, you know, Bob Mueller is going to have to come in and wrap his arms around this and decide where to go from here. JOHN YANG: The fact that it is a counterintelligence case and sort of the FBI and the Justice Department’s spy hunters, does that make it different? Or how does that make it different from a criminal investigation? MATT ZAPOTOSKY: Certainly, that adds sensitivities to this. You could be talking about clandestine sources and methods. You’re talking about FBI counterintelligence agents who have been involved in this. This is just a little more sensitive than, say, a bank robbery, which is something the FBI also investigates. But, at the end of the day, that’s not to say it could not produce criminal charges. Now, I’m not saying we’re there that — yet — excuse me. Even in making this announcement, Rod Rosenstein said, said explicitly, look, I am not saying this because I think we are ready for a prosecutor or this is ready for criminal charges. I’m just saying it’s in the public interest that someone outside the Justice Department oversee this thing. JOHN YANG: So, we are probably still months away? MATT ZAPOTOSKY: I would guess, yes. JOHN YANG: Matt Zapotosky, who covers the Justice Department for The Washington Post, thanks for joining us. MATT ZAPOTOSKY: Thank you. JOHN YANG: And now we go back to Capitol Hill for a Democratic perspective this time, Representative Adam Schiff of California, the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee. Mr. Schiff, thanks for joining us. Your reaction to this news that the Justice Department has appointed Robert Mueller as the special counsel in this case? REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-Calif.: Well, I think it’s a very positive step, and I applaud the choice of Bob Mueller. I think he’s very widely respected by people on both sides of the aisle, immensely bright, capable person. And I think it’s the right call. This is not to say that there aren’t good career people at the Department of Justice that could do this. But, nonetheless, I think it will have that much more credibility in the public eye by appointing someone in the special counsel position that has that added degree of independence from the department, still not the full independence that you would have had under the old statute, independent counsel statute, but, nonetheless, I think a very solid decision. And I think it ought to help inspire confidence in what the department is doing. JOHN YANG: Now, how will this work with the investigations on the Hill? Will your committee investigation continue in parallel with Mr. Mueller’s? REP. ADAM SCHIFF: Yes, absolutely. And it’s very important, I think, for people to understand just what this means and what it doesn’t mean. The House and Senate investigations will continue to go forward. We have very important oversight responsibility. And, obviously, if we uncovered facts that we think that prosecutors ought to know about, we would refer that now to the special counsel. In the sense that we may need to coordinate our activities, because we have parallel investigations running, we would now work with Mr. Mueller. So, none of this stops what’s going on in the House and Senate. Indeed, if we form an independent commission, that also is a completely separate mission than that by the special counsel. The special counsel will be overseeing the FBI agents who are working the investigation, and the special counsel will be making decisions, if it comes to that, whether charges ought to be brought and against whom. JOHN YANG: And what will your committee be asking for, with this disclosure that Mr. Comey appears to have kept contemporaneous memos of his conversations and dealings with the president throughout this? Will you be seeking those documents? Will you be seeking testimony from Mr. Comey? REP. ADAM SCHIFF: I think we will in Congress be seeking those documents. Indeed, many of the chairs have already asked for them. I also think it will be important for Director Comey to come and testify once again, I hope in open session, so that we can add context to whatever is in these written memoranda. If there are tapes as well, as the president has threatened, we ought to obtain those. Those, in fact, would be the very best evidence of the discussions that may have taken place along the lines of that New York Times report in which it’s alleged that the president asked Director Comey to drop the investigation of Michael Flynn. So, all of that work in Congress by the House Intelligence Committee, by the Senate Intelligence Committee and others will go forth. It’s just that the FBI investigation, the prosecutorial decisions will now be made by the special counsel, Bob Mueller. JOHN YANG: And on that question of the tapes, the — is there going to be any investigation to determine if there are tapes to ask for? REP. ADAM SCHIFF: Well, we do need to find out whether there are tapes. And so I think we need to use whatever compulsion, if necessary, to find out. The president has obviously stopped talking about the tapes, and we don’t know whether that was a — simply a hollow threat he was making against Director Comey or in fact it’s backed up by the existence of tapes, but we do need to find out. JOHN YANG: Where is this — can you give us an update on sort of where your investigation is, where the House committee’s investigation is, and where it’s likely to proceed in the immediate future? REP. ADAM SCHIFF: Well, we are where you would expect a large investigation of this kind to begin. And that is with a review of an extraordinary number of documents. A lot of them are intelligence assessments that underlie the intelligence community’s conclusion about Russian intervention, about the Russian motivations. Obviously, we’re also looking into the issues of collusions. Were U.S. persons involved associated with the Trump campaign? We’re inviting witnesses to provide us documents. We’re inviting witnesses to come before the committee. We’re scheduling open and closed hearings. And we should have more to say about that in the near future. But these are all the steps that we’re taking. And I think we’re working together very well in a nonpartisan way. JOHN YANG: Representative Adam Schiff, top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, thank you very much. REP. ADAM SCHIFF: Thank you.

The rumor had pushed up AMD shares by 12% on Tuesday, only to see the stock come crashing down by that amount on Wednesday after AMD management did not offer any mention of such a deal. By Tiernan Ray May 17, 2017 7:48 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Chip giant Intel (INTC) tonight refuted rumors it is licensing graphics chip technology from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). In a statement sent to Tech Trader Daily by an Intel spokesperson, the company said "The recent rumors that Intel has licensed AMD's graphics technology are untrue." A rumor had spread on Tuesday that AMD had won a deal to license its graphics technology to Intel, as related by Fuad Abazovic of Fudzilla, who wrote that an AMD-Intel deal was “confirmed,” without citing sources. When AMD failed to disclose any such deal yesterday, during its annual analyst meeting to discuss its technology and financial outlook, the AMD stock was punished Wednesday. I asked Intel if the company has any further detail on whether it has definitely decided not to license technology from AMD. The company said no further detail would be provided. AMD shares today closed down $1.55, over 12%, at $11.20, reversing a 12% climb yesterday on the Fudzilla rumor.

Supplier Toshiba www.toshiba.com.au Price $2915 AUD > Pricing info Specs Intel Core i7-7600U (twin core, HyperThreaded, 3.9GHz Boost Speed) • 16GB memory • 12.5-inch HD touchscreen • Wacom ‘Feel’ Stylus • 802.11ac • twin IR cameras for Windows Hello support Tweet Email this Print this Feedback Business at the front and back. Don’t let the diminutive, simple lines of the latest Portégé fool you – this is a lion in a business suit. It mightn’t have the laser cut lines of fashionable convertibles, or a glossy aluminium chassis, but hiding beneath that simple black exterior is a laptop that will get the job done quickly and efficiently. The 12.5-inch display makes this even smaller than most ultraportable convertibles, helping to keep its weight down to a mere 1.1kg for the base model. At this price point the HD resolution is a little hard to swallow, with competitors offering up 4K screens for just a few hundred dollars more, but Toshiba has focused on performance first and foremost. Besides, with the panel being so small, it’s still superbly clear, and the matte finish makes it usable in even the brightest conditions. Despite the tiny size, it’s a little chunkier than the competition, measuring 15.4mm at its deepest, but thanks to the low weight you won’t notice carrying this around all day. A simple twin-hinge mechanism allows the screen to flip through the full 360 degrees, and it’s surprisingly resilient to the bounce-back factor when using the touch-screen.  Considering the slightly thicker dimensions, we were a little surprised at the lack of I/O options. A single USB 3.1 Type C port is on the left, with another USB 3.0 Type A on the right. Thankfully Toshiba also includes a Type C docking port, which brings HDMI, another USB Type C and USB Type A connection to the single Type C port integrated into the laptop. It’s great to see that the Type C port is also fully Thunderbolt 3 compatible, delivering a whopping 40Gbps of bandwidth. Toshiba has turned to stylus professionals Wacom to deliver the Wacom ‘Feel’ technology pen, which can detect up to 2,048 differing levels of pressure, perfect for tablet sketches and quick mock-ups. Twin IR cameras deliver accurate facial recognition via Windows Hello sign-in feature, and is one of the more secure methods of biometric security currently available. The keyboard is a little small, a trade-off given the chassis’ small size, but at least it’s backlit and there’s plenty of separation between each key.  Taking a look at the PCMark 8 Home Accelerated score shows that underneath the keyboard lies some serious hardware. Our review sample came with Intel’s latest Core i7 7600U CPU. It may only be a twin-core model, but the Boost speed of 3.9GHz is industry-leading, without sapping battery life. Our battery result of 262 minutes is excellent, showing this laptop should easily handle 9 to 5 duties unless you’re being excessively demanding. HyperThreading is also included to allow for up to four threads of instructions at a time. The CPU has been combined with 16GB of memory, so it’s no wonder this machine performed so well in our tests, taking out the second top spot after the much larger, heavier Metabox gaming machine.  In terms of storage, Toshiba has gone for a Samsung 512GB M.2 drive in our sample, but that’s as big as you can get – there’s no option for a 1TB version. Integrated 802.11ac WiFi via a 2x2 transmitter/receiver delivers excellent wireless performance, though there’s no Ethernet backup if you find yourself stuck in cable-town.  It might not be flashy or pretty, but this is a machine for professionals who want to get the job done. With impressive performance and battery life, not to mention the incredibly light weight, it’s the perfect convertible for those who don’t mind a slightly smaller form-factor. Throw in Toshiba’s excellent support for businesses thanks to its comprehensive office-focused software, and it’s the perfect contender for an office convertible that does the job ably and swiftly.  Related Reviews Review: Acer Spin 7 convertible laptop Review: Dell Latitude 13 7370 Review: Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 hybrid Review: Asus Transformer Book Flip TP200SA Review: Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 Source: Copyright © PC & Tech Authority.

Image Credit: Sega/Platinum Games Sega made its name with its slogan for the beloved console: Genesis does what Nintendon’t. This still applies today, as the Japanese publisher has transformed from a console focus to a PC gaming-first company. And the results have been a positive for those who love playing games on the PC, especially when it comes to action and strategy games (such as Alien: Isolation from Creative Assembly or Company of Heroes). And now, Sega says it plans to focus even more on the PC than it has ever before. We’ve seen this with its past announcements on Bayonetta and Vanquish, a pair of properties that are cult favorites for the console crowd. Sega also signaled this with last year’s acquisition of Amplitude Studios, the makers of the Endless series of strategy games. But now the Japanese publisher is saying that it wants to dig into its massive collection of old IPs to see what could adapt to the modern era. We looked at five franchises that could make a comeback with this renewed focus on the PC sector. The strength of PC gaming these days is exciting, but there’s another component here at play as well. As more people in the developing world look beyond their smartphones for games, they aren’t going to the PlayStation 4 or the Xbox One. They’re going PC. And Sega plans to go with them.

That’s the thin line Tropico dev Haemimont Games is aiming for with its newly announced city builder Surviving Mars. Or “colony builder,” really. It’s a game about surviving on Mars, if you can believe it. Tooth-and-nail survival, fighting against a planet that’s indifferent to our arrival. This is no SimCity or Cities: Skylines.

Maybe that’s because “power ups” recalls something more cartoonish: a glowing orb that turns your character into a werewolf; a floating bullet icon that doubles the rate of your bright, orange fighter jet’s machine gun fire; a pill that lets you eat ghosts.

A follow-up to developer Deck13’s 2014 game Lords of the Fallen, The Surge builds on that game’s fairly successful cloning of the Dark Souls formula. Like FromSoftware’s popular series, The Surge is an extremely challenging third-person melee-focused action role-playing game.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BUSINESS Press Release Entrepreneur Mahesh Lingareddy Joins SitterFriends as Investor and Advisor Business Wire May 18, 2017 5:25 PM SAN FRANCISCO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–May 19, 2017– SitterFriends announced that Mahesh Lingareddy, founder of Soft Machines Inc (now owned by Intel) and founder of Smartron, an OEM and IOT company, joined SitterFriends as investor and advisor. SitterFriends, launching in June, aims to bring innovation to childcare, allowing parents to find help that is trustworthy, and affordable but also quickly accessible. A groundbreaking product in the childcare space, SitterFriends will allow parents to find their perfect match in a nanny but also feel at ease while the nanny provides care after the initial matching is done. We sat down with Mahesh to ask about his involvement with SitterFriends. How are you involved? I have a long standing relationship with the co-founders of SitterFriends Fahad Jalal, and Amit Jain. They worked with me when I was at Soft Machines, and because I believe in them, I wanted to get behind the team and their product. When they decided to go forward with SitterFriends I became one of the early investors in the company. I am also on the advisory board and meet with the key team members on a regular basis to discuss strategy, product and marketing. From CPU Design (Soft Machines) to Consumer Hardware (Smartron) to now childcare. Why the investment in a childcare company? Childcare and senior care are big markets in the US and around the world, largely untapped and fragmented. There is a lot of opportunity to bring both software and hardware innovation to solve some of the biggest problems in these markets, and I believe SitterFriends is going to do this. My involvement is largely due to my background in the consumer and industrial hardware. In the coming months the team will unveil some of the things we have been working on to make child care and senior care safer and richer leveraging various smart, sensor, IoT and AI technologies. Thank you Mahesh, for your input on SitterFriends.

Blog :  IBM Launches Blockchain Accelerator Program Article :  Cybersecurity Ventures Top 50 Security Companies to Watch Putting Legal in Its Place: Why Companies Shouldn’t Be Run by Execs with ‘No’ as Their Middle Names Rob Enderle |   Unfiltered Opinion   |   Posted 18 May, 2017          |         |     Share Over the years, I’ve watched a lot of companies go from success to failure because they allowed Finance or the Legal department to have excessive control over the business. These organizations do provide very valuable advice, but often the executives learn that while there is risk in approving an action, there is no risk in saying no and, as a result, no becomes their go to response. This hasn’t been the case at Apple, Intel and Oracle, all of which not only are scary with regard to litigation capability, but their legal and finance teams dance to tune the CEO plays, they don’t make the CEO and his staff dance to their tune. Risk Avoidance There are clearly some times where it is important to listen to your legal and finance teams. For instance, when HP bought Autonomy, CFO Cathy Lesjak had been against the deal because she was concerned about the integrity of their disclosures. She was overridden and the thing turned into one of the biggest messes of the decade. Clearly, running blindly into a stupid decision is equally stupid, and getting the feedback, and listening or reading it before a decision is made, will result in better decisions or, at least, a much firmer idea of the risks you are taking and a better chance of mitigating them. But this is understanding risk; it is when these groups move from advice to control that they become company killers. Successful firms are all about understanding and accepting “reasonable” risks. For instance, when Steve Jobs wanted to launch the iPhone, he was told he couldn’t have that name because Cisco owned it and had its own shipping iPhone product. He accepted the risk and, after the fact, negotiated a deal with Cisco in which that firm released the name to Apple and got a closer relationship with Apple, which was a win/win, in exchange. The iPhone was a massive success. However, when it came to the iWatch, also a name that Apple didn’t own, Apple walked away from it and instead launched the Apple Watch. Certainly, no risk of litigation, but the product’s sales are a fraction of what they otherwise might have been with the proper name and branding. In the first case, and in the same company, legal got it done over their own objections. In the second case, legal likely won but Apple clearly lost. Under Jobs, the firm was willing to take on one of the most powerful companies in the world. Under Tim Cook, it was scared off by a few far smaller firms that sort of owned, but likely couldn’t protect, the iWatch brand. Now could the Cisco thing have blown up in Jobs’ face? Sure. But Jobs’ entire history was one of taking risks. The iPhone was based on a design that had sold poorly. But he bet the firm that he could create a successful version and that decision resulted in making Apple the most valuable company in the world. So, huge risk, but equally huge rewards. This is what top executives are supposedly paid to do: Balance risks to rewards, and take reasonable gambles that drive corporate growth. One of my favorite Jobs examples was against Intel, which is also very litigious. It was running a campaign using Bunnymen to promote the Pentium. Most legal teams have a cow if you create a campaign that directly disparages a competitor’s product and Intel was famous for being so aggressive with litigation that, even if you won, you’d likely go out of business. Yet Jobs’ Apple ran a series of very damaging ads that made fun of Intel’s Pentium 2. Later, it ran one of the most successful campaigns, regularly making fun of Bill Gates, the richest guy in the world. And despite likely giving the Apple legal folks heartburn, nothing really happened. Wrapping Up: Remember Who Is the Boss The market is often defined by those who take risks and it regularly rolls over those who too aggressively avoid them. My whole point is that Legal and Finance both have really important jobs to do, and they are a critical part of the firm’s defense and operations, however, it is when they start running the company that they move from asset to liability. The most successful CEO, Jobs, knew how to use these organizations as critical resources rather than have them become his boss. This is a lesson way too many people either haven’t learned or too often forget.

But those who leaked the story to the news media “did commit a crime, and they should be held accountable.” That’s one of three lessons to be learned from the controversy. Another is that Trump’s national-security team is “not succeeding in persuading Trump to work off of a set of carefully written and coordinated talking points when meeting with foreign officials.” But the good news is that, contrary to speculation, “the president is actually paying attention to the intelligence community” and the information it gives him. Those who feared otherwise “were wrong” and it’s “time to admit it.” Mideast desk: The Bombshell Story Everyone Missed Breaking news out of Washington this week diverted attention from a Wall Street Journal story that otherwise would have been “a major bombshell,” says Evelyn Gordon at Commentary: “Major Arab states have grown tired of having their relationship with Israel held hostage to the Palestinian problem, and they’re actually seeking to do something about it.” Gulf states are “discussing a proposal to normalize certain types of commercial relations with Israel.” All they ask in return “are gestures” to the Palestinians “that would leave the status quo essentially unchanged.” The Saudis and United Arab Emirates already are on board. This shows that “Arab leaders — unlike Trump — understand that Israeli-Palestinian peace is nowhere on the horizon” and that they’re “no longer willing to give the Palestinians . . . a veto over their relations with Israel.” Foreign desk: Key to North Korea Lies in the Kremlin One of America’s “biggest foreign policy problems” — North Korea — “cannot be resolved without Russia’s participation,” says Leonid Bershidsky at Bloomberg. Unfortunately, “the idea of a grand bargain” between Washington and Moscow isn’t exactly popular right now. But Vladimir Putin “has built a close relationship” with Kim Jong-un “and it’s no longer enough to talk to China to mitigate the Stalinist state’s aggressiveness.” That’s because Putin “has lately come through for the isolated country when it needed help,” mostly by forgiving 90 percent of its $11 billion debt to Moscow. The Russian has been building “a stock of things to sell to the US in exchange for a free hand in the former Soviet Union, including Ukraine.” Media critic: Why Roger Ailes Mattered Roger Ailes “utterly transformed the face of cable news” by creating Fox News Channel, notes the network’s Howard Kurtz. And while “there’s no sugar-coating” the negative stories that led to his removal, it’s important, following his death Thursday, to balance that with “his many accomplishments.” No one believed there was a viable market for Fox, but within five years it had overtaken CNN. “Ailes used graphics, music and pacing in a way that made news feel more vibrant and forced his cable rivals to modernize their look,” says Kurtz. But “the secret to Fox’s success was making millions of viewers who didn’t trust the media feel that their views were getting a fair hearing.” Libertarian: Comey’s Done This All Before Conventional wisdom among the media establishment is that President Trump “is a known liar” while ousted FBI Director James Comey is an “honest public servant above reproach.” But Sean Davis at The Federalist recalls an episode that raises questions as to whether Comey “is as open and forthright as his allies would have you believe.” In 2007, he “plotted to oust a sitting Republican official through highly orchestrated political theater and carefully crafted narratives” portraying himself as “the courageous hero” involving a controversial surveillance program. Then-White House counsel Alberto Gonzales later wrote: “It felt to me that Jim’s loyalty was more to his friend Preet Bharara and to Chuck Schumer.” So Comey may be telling the truth, or he may be trying to “get revenge against a higher-ranking official who got in Jim Comey’s way. It wouldn’t be the first time.” — Compiled by Eric Fettmann Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under cia ,  donald trump ,  editorial ,  intelligence ,  james comey ,  kremlin ,  middle east ,  north korea ,  roger ailes Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Turkish thugs must pay for assault on DC protest Read Next Turkish thugs must pay for assault on DC protest Share Selection Columnists Seth Lipsky The left's ridiculous double standard on spilling secrets F.H.

It's been awhile since our last full-fledged SSD review. With the notable exception of Intel's long-prophesied Optane products, there hasn't been much new or exciting happening in the storage scene of late. But the market marches on regardless, and many new drives have launched without novel technological underpinnings. The NVMe competition has continued to heat up, as more of the smaller manufacturers get their hands on capable commodity controllers and NAND from the actual OEMs. Last time around we examined Patriot's Hellfire SSD, which blended Toshiba's 15-nm MLC with Phison's PS5007-E7 NVMe-enabled controller. Today, we've got a drive built on the same basic chassis: Corsair's Force Series MP500 240GB. We haven't gotten a fresh Corsair SSD in our storage labs in some time, but the company's drives are veterans in these parts. The Neutron GTX suffered horrible indignities under our infamous endurance experiment, and Force LS drives serve as the primary boot drives of our current storage rigs. The new MP500 is Corsair's debut NVMe drive, as its official specs give away. Patriot Hellfire Capacity Max sequential (MB/s) Max random (IOps) Read Write Read Write 120GB 2300 1400 150K 90K 240GB 2800 1500 250K 210K 480GB 2800 1500 250K 210K Much like the Hellfire, the MP500 is an NVMe-equipped M.2 gumstick that'll occupy four lanes of your PCIe Gen3 bandwidth. We've seen this NAND so many times now that I just keep the phrase "Toshiba 15-nm MLC" permanently copied to my clipboard. That's OK, though, since we've generally had good experiences with those chips. Phison's E7 controller impressed us in the Hellfire with good all-round performance and especially good scaling, so we hope to see more of the same this time, too. One thing that stands out about the MP500 is its sticker. As I peeled it back, the label had a curious heft to it that the Hellfire's lacked. The secret hidden therein turns out to be a layer of heat-dissipating copper, akin to the sticker tech Samsung employs in its 960 Series drives. We'll see whether that thin metal layer translates to any tangible advantages over drives without such novelties (like the Hellfire). Corsair backs the MP500 240GB with a three-year warranty and an endurance rating of 349 terabytes written—higher than might be expected for a 240GB drive, since the RD400 480GB and Hellfire 480GB are only rated for 296 TBW and 230 TBW respectively. The MP500 250GB currently sells for $135 at Newegg. Now let's see what the thing can do.

Trump held a listening session with the group to advance issues relative to the airline industry. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)    The Media Blasted All Over The World The Very Intel They Accused Trump Of Leaking To The Russians Ryan Pickrell China/Asia Pacific Reporter 3:01 PM 05/18/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP Major media sources revealed not only the classified intelligence that President Donald Trump allegedly revealed to Russian officials, but also additional sensitive information which could be detrimental to national security. The president allegedly shared classified details of an ISIS terror plot with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during a meeting last week. Sources and officials declared Trump’s revelations “highly damaging” and “inappropriate,” but that information may never have come to light without assistance from leakers and the media. Media outlets were quick to report that foreign intelligence might be able to identify the ally that provided the information to the U.S. and the intelligence source of the plot, potentially compromising operations or what is possibly a human intelligence source. But it was U.S. media outlets that outed the ally, the full nature of the plot, and the city where the plot was uncovered to the entire world, regardless of whether foreign intelligence agencies dished any of the information. With the assistance of U.S. officials leaking information, major media outlets were able to publish highly-classified information for the general public. WaPo introduced that the plot was linked to threats to aviation. The New York Times revealed Tuesday that Israel was the ally that gave the U.S. intelligence on the ISIS plot. The Wall Street Journal explained that it also uncovered the information but chose not to publish it because, “Trump administration officials said disclosing it could damage the two countries’ intelligence relationship and jeopardize operations.” Multiple outlets reported that the terrorist plot in question involved putting an explosive device, one made possible by advances in ISIS bomb making expertise, in a laptop to bring down a commercial airliner. CNN revealed that it had the information in March but did not release it due to its sensitive nature. CBS News said Thursday, “The laptop bomb that may evade airport scanners was built and tested by ISIS at Mosul University.” “Lives could well be lost as a result of an ISIS mole hunt that’s sure to follow,” Axios’ Mike Allen wrote Tuesday, citing reports from national security experts. Some doubted whether or not Russia could have determined all of this information, since sources and methods were not revealed in the recent meeting. Other observers argued that, even if Russia put the pieces together, it is highly unlikely that they would have shared the information with ISIS. But, thanks to the media, the country that provided the intelligence, the existence and nature of the plot, and the city where the plot originated are all public information available to the world, potentially jeopardizing a human intelligence source TheWSJ called “the most valuable source of information on external plotting by ISIS.” Follow Ryan on Twitter Send tips to ryan@dailycallernewsfoundation.org.

Drew Angerer/Getty Images In sharing intelligence with the Russian government given to him by Israel, President Donald Trump has not, in any way, shaken the foundation of the relationship between the United States and Israel. Those who think that the relationship has been damaged understand neither the nature of diplomatic relations nor the personalities of the leaders of these nations. That is not to say that underlings have not been hurt—they have been hurt. And it is not to say that the situation has given career bureaucrats an opportunity for acting out—they have been acting out. Not all diplomats are smart, and not all diplomats are savvy. Some are so petty and impressed with their own—albeit limited—power that they abuse the privilege of their positions. Indeed, it was petty bureaucrats who leaked the story of Trump divulging information to the Russians, and it was petty and ignorant diplomatic bureaucrats who barked out nonsense to the Israelis involved in planning Trump’s trip to Israel, telling them that the Western Wall is in the West Bank and therefore not under Israel control. Ignorance and petty behavior do not belong in the diplomatic corps. Case in point is the two American embassy diplomats who basically said to their Israeli counterparts, “We’re asking you to leave, and we need to be left alone. Israeli officials cannot be here; this is not your territory. It’s the West Bank. This is a private visit by the president and it’s none of your business.” According to reports, the culprits were David Berns, the political counselor at the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv, and Jonathan Shrier, an economic adviser.  They should be fired. Then, they should be re-taught history and re-trained in the art of diplomacy. But I digress. Now, back to the issue of the president sharing intelligence with the Russians. Intelligence sharing is not new to Trump and the Russian government. It’s a staple of world diplomacy. The rules are straightforward. The president knew the rules—minions, obviously, did not. It is also quite possible that these employees thought they knew better than their boss. And that arrogance has caused international and domestic flops. It is they who have compromised lives and diplomatic norms. The principle is clear. Very delicate intelligence can be shared in two directions when the original sharer lends agreement. Intel is proprietary. If it is spread inappropriately, it can compromise the intelligence itself, and it can compromise the identity and life of the asset supplying the pertinent information. Much time and capital is expended to get assets into position and to get listening devices or computer viruses into place. It can all be lost in a moment’s foolishness. The intel given to Russia, which included an ISIS plot to attack a civilian airliner and emphasized the need to clamp down on laptops on planes, was information the Russians were already sensitive to and gathering. They have firsthand experience with the devastation and damage terrorists can cause on civilian airliners. Two hundred and twenty Russians were murdered two years ago when ISIS blew up a charter flight shortly after it took off from Sinai. In that case, the explosive was hidden inside a Schwepps pineapple soda can brought on the plane by ISIS rebels in cahoots with the Egyptians providing food and drink to the airline. Contrary to the rumors capturing the attention of many Americans, I doubt that an Israeli is embedded in ISIS. I can also almost certainly guarantee that the asset would not know that he is reporting to Israel. The asset probably thinks he is reporting to Russia or Saudi Arabia. Israel is totally insulated. But it might not be an asset. It may very well be a virus or a technological device that gave Israel the intel. The odds of that being the case are much higher than the odds that it was a human. Assets are mono-dimensional. They are not usually trustworthy, and they usually only have limited access to information. They can be caught, and they are highly susceptible to being turned into double agents. This is real life—not television or movies. Gone are the days when you were able to rely on these agents of espionage. High tech monitoring is much more effective—it is the proverbial “fly on the wall” watching and hearing everything. Of course, a spy agency often needs a person to plant or insert the technology, but that is an in-and-out operation. While our enemies, in this case ISIS and al Qaeda, can try to deconstruct the intelligence and find its source, every agency knows that these devices have only a short lifespan before they are detected or before the agency itself sends them into dormancy. ISIS knows that the West is trying to monitor them, so they have instituted protocols that make them very difficult to crack. They do not use wireless communication that is not heavily encrypted, and they do not send emails or texts that are not encrypted. In the end, I would not worry too much about Israel’s sources. They have a multitude of sources and never rely on just one for their information gathering. Neither did they share everything they have with the United States. The Israelis have a healthy sense of suspicion and are not surprised when the United States passes their information along. Donald Trump was merely following a tradition set by his predecessors. It was his bureaucrat who broke with tradition and leaked the story. So really, vis a vis the relationship between the United States and Israel, nothing has changed, but there is one big change that needs to be made. The advisers and bureaucrats serving the president must get in line. Immediately is not soon enough.

Flynn previously refused to turn over the documents to Senate Intelligence Committee prompting the subpoena in the first place. Flynn reportedly had six undisclosed phone calls with Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergei Kislyak. U.S. officials however told Reuters these calls did not show any evidence of wrongdoing or collusion during the 2016 campaign. Flynn could be held in contempt of Congress, but would likely challenge the action in federal court. The legal proceedings could drag on for years, Austin Wright explained in a Politico essay Monday. He continued that Senate leaders would have decide if he was in contempt of court if he refused to comply and that the investigation would then head to the Department of Justice. The department would have to then decide whether to file charges, or a federal district court would civilly enforce the order. Follow Saagar Enjeti on Twitter Send tips to [email protected] .

Austin, Texas is one of those towns that when you visit, it makes you consider moving there.  Such nice watering holes (swimming and cocktails), warm nights, good food, and an appreciation of fun.  Austin makes my home region’s (the Bay Area) obsession with work seem a little shortsighted. You could feel this at Maker Faire Austin at the Palmer Center last weekend.  So easy!  Makers so warm and friendly and charming, with so much talent to share.   Really high quality Maker Faire content ranged from fabulous installation and performance (Total Unicorn! Vision Gland!), hands on making, startups and small biz, makerspaces (ATX Hackerspace! The Robot Group!), tons of Lego, craft vendors, kooky fun installations (Power Tool Drag Racing! art cars!).  The Drone Racing zone was especially impressive, and it was no demonstration:  this was an invitational of advanced pilots competing for first place.  But no matter the subject, the vibe uniformly relaxed and open. It could be the town vibe, but it’s got to also be the Faire leadership.  Maker Faire Austin is truly a community-led event.  Kami Wilt (pictured below, 3rd from right), founder and chief maker behind the Austin Tinkering School, has been the primary driver behind the Faire since 2012. And then this year, cabinet maker / musician / family man / force of nature Joey Ficklin (pictured, top left)  joined as co-producer.  This very Austin dynamic duo and their loyal circle of volunteers are in it for the makers, and and their enthusiasm and personal connection to the maker community permeate every corner of the show. For example:  Joey’s brother and maker celeb Jared Ficklin not only brought three large and amazing installations to the Faire, but his product design company, argodesign, also sponsored a Saturday night party—bringing in even more exhibits to play with—and raised $10,000 for Girls Who Code. ! Team Ficklin installing the Zen Gardener Another example:  Bernadette Noll, incorrigible textile hacker and Maker Faire Austin collaborator since 2012, produces the impressive “SwitchAndStitch” textile hacking zone at the Faire.  This year she also took on organizing Project Maker, a Project Runway-style competition with restyle challenges. People worked all day and made amazing things for the runway competition. Bernadette, the deserving recipient of an Editor’s Choice Blue Ribbon. Even Faire sponsor Intel’s booth was really about the makers of Intel, 10+ individuals or team showing projects they submitted to an internal Call for Makers.  Intern Rita Kambil converted a classic 1951 Singer sewing machine into a computerized embroidery machine using the company’s Edison Arduino breakout board. If there was a “headliner” at Maker Faire Austin, it was Sean Di Ianni, Chief Operating Officer of the legendary Meow Wolf, a production company creating crazy, large-scale and large-budget immersive art experiences. Sean walked the audience through the evolution of Meow Wolf’s work, including the bona fide Santa Fe tourist attraction, The House of Eternal Return.  Sean shared some insight into how such a large team stays organized AND creative, and an update on their search for a building to host a new attraction in Austin (still seeking!). Austin fire artist and all-around maker Tim Deagan showed off a lovely assortment of fire pieces that had enough gumption to actually impress, even in the middle of the day.  (Of course evenings are always nicer!)  Tim has not only been a “cornerstone” at Maker Faire Austin, he also serves as the Faire team’s fire and safety expert. This balloon “couture” dress was an onsite weekend collaboration by well-known Austin balloon guy Nate the Great and his protege, Balloons by Pineapple. The dress was ready to model for the 5 pm Sunday evening news: Julio Rodriguez shared a prototype of his Bright Water Bottle, the world’s first illuminated water bottle.  The goal is to keep cyclists safe and hydrated. Jimmy Cox is founder of Rockdale Tiger Flight, a club of High School and Jr High students learning the skills to build an airplane. The current project is building an RV-6 all metal 2-seat airplane. The young man pictured below showed me the riveting process, step by step. What a cool project! CLAW Amusement Technologies is an Austin-based company that design and build electronic and mechanical arcade-style games and amusements. Alan Watts (pictured, below) is a software developer that likes to get 3D with detailed, high-finish homemade arcade games.  They are gorgeous! Point in case about the warmth:  what other Maker Faire happens over Mother’s Day that celebrates with FREE MASSAGES for moms???  What a brilliant idea.  Lindsey here graced me with her great hands and eight minutes of bliss. Take a look at ALL of these beauties below.  These people INSPIRE!  Thank you GOOD PEOPLE of Maker Faire Austin!  See you next year.         Advertisement Show comments × Sabrina Merlo Sabrina is the Maker Faire Program Director.

This is no longer just a two-team legal hassle. When Intel and Samsung joined the fray last Friday by filing amicus briefs in support of the Federal Trade Commission’s complaint, matters went from bad to worse for Qualcomm. The case is starting to look like Qualcomm v. The World. Amidst a hail of legal actions, Qualcomm Wednesday shot back. It filed a lawsuit against four ODMs who manufacture Apple’s products for not paying royalties. The contract manufacturers listed in the filing by Qualcomm are Foxconn, Pegatron, Wistron and Compal Electronics. Click here to read more ...

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Vulnerability disclosure bill wins praise By Tim Starks 05/18/2017 10:24 AM EDT With help from Cory Bennett, Eric Geller and Martin Matishak A WELCOME CHANGE, FOR A CHANGE — A coalition of House and Senate Democrats and Republicans dropped legislation Wednesday that serves as the first answer to the recent global ransomware outbreak, an outbreak widely believed to be triggered by the leak of an NSA hacking tool. The new bill would make permanent, but alter, the current Vulnerabilities Equities Process that decides when the federal government discloses software vulnerabilities. And the bill — known as the PATCH Act — got a joyous reception from the tech industry, cybersecurity experts and civil liberties groups who consider the current process biased toward hoarding vulnerabilities. Story Continued Below “The PATCH Act is a critical step forward to reform this broken process,” said Information Technology and Innovation Foundation Vice President Daniel Castro. “The legislation will bring needed transparency to the vulnerabilities equities process and balance national security interests with economic interests. Moreover, disclosing vulnerabilities to companies in a timely manner will allow them to develop patches sooner and help keep the nation secure.” Andi Wilson, policy analyst at New America’s Open Technology Institute, said the legislation makes necessary changes. “One of the most critical components of a strong vulnerabilities review process is that it apply to absolutely all vulnerabilities in the government’s possession, not just the ones that the intelligence community chooses to put into the process,” Wilson said. The Coalition for Cybersecurity Policy and Law also issued a supportive statement: “The events of the past week clearly demonstrate the real-world consequences of exploited vulnerabilities. Governments have a critical role in getting vulnerability information to organizations capable of acting to protect security in a timely manner upon discovery.” HAPPY THURSDAY and welcome to Morning Cybersecurity! Your MC host is just catching up on Patriothole, which was pretty great. Send your thoughts, feedback and especially tips to tstarks@politico.com, and be sure to follow @timstarks, @POLITICOPro and @MorningCybersec. Full team info is below. THE 6 P.M. NEWS DUMP, WEDNESDAY EDITION — The Justice Department late Wednesday appointed a special prosecutor to investigate Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 election, including whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Moscow on those interference efforts. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein tapped Robert Mueller — who led the FBI from 2001 to 2013 — to take the reins of the probe, bringing a widely respected, mostly apolitical figure to an investigation that has generated considerable partisan bickering. The DOJ’s move was made under intense pressure from Capitol Hill Democrats — and some Republicans — who are still peeved over Trump’s sudden dismissal of FBI Director James Comey. Democrats and Republicans applauded the move, as did a number of cyber-focused lawmakers on the House and Senate Intelligence committees, which are conducting their own probes into Russia’s apparent hacking campaign during the election. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, an Intel panel member and the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, called it “a good first step to get to the bottom of the many questions we have about Russian interference in our election.” Sen. Ron Wyden, another Intel panel member and one of the upper chamber’s most frequent cybersecurity voices, vowed, “I am going to bird-dog this every step of the way to be sure that former Director Mueller is given the broad scope and resources he needs to conduct a thorough investigation.” Over in the House, Intelligence Committee ranking member Adam Schiff said Mueller’s appointment “will help re-establish public confidence” in the FBI’s probe. — MUELLER? MUELLER? — Here’s a backgrounder to get you up to speed on Mueller. Interestingly enough, his most recent gig has been working with Booz Allen Hamilton to review the government contractor’s security protocols after two Booz Allen employees — Edward Snowden and Harold Martin — pilfered reams of sensitive information from the NSA, rattling the intelligence community and exposing government secrets. SENATE CYBER PIONEER LIEBERMAN INTERVIEWS FOR FBI — Former Sen. Joe Lieberman, who led a fight to pass the first major cybersecurity legislation alongside Sen. Susan Collins, interviewed Wednesday for the job of FBI director. The 2012 Collins-Lieberman legislation was chock full of cyber provisions but never advanced in the Senate because of industry and Republican opposition. It did, however, contain information sharing language that formed the root of the landmark 2015 cyber law, and its language on voluntary industry standards inspired a White House effort that led to creation of technical standards agency NIST’s cybersecurity framework. Lieberman and Collins were also instrumental in creating the Department of Homeland Security, which is sometimes at odds with the FBI over cyber incident response. Lieberman was an advocate for expanding the DHS’s cybersecurity role despite failings of Einstein, DHS’s government-wide intrusion detection program. “I’m a big admirer of the DHS,” he told Cory in a 2015 interview about the Office of Personnel Management breaches. “Although there had been screw-ups with the Einstein programs, I still felt that DHS was doing a pretty good job.” But Lieberman conceded that the OPM hack had slightly diminished his view of the job DHS was doing. He also advocated, in the same interview, for digital retaliation against the OPM hackers. WHAT’S NEXT FOR MGT ACT? — The House passed a bill (H.R. 2227) Wednesday by voice vote that’s designed to upgrade federal government computer systems, but that was always the easy part. Similar legislation passed the House late last year, but it didn’t make it through the Senate. This year’s edition of the Modernizing Government Technology Act comes with a reduced price tag — it authorizes $500 million over two years, instead of a one-time $3 billion investment. Bill sponsor Rep. Will Hurd told MC he’s “absolutely” confident the Senate will act on it this year because of negotiations that have occurred since last year’s bill fell short. “That’s what we’ve been doing since” last year, Hurd said. “We’ve been working with my Senate friends on that side, with staff there, making sure we understand their concerns with this. And so we have had a number of conversations before we dropped the original bill.” Senate appropriators Jerry Moran and Tom Udall are sponsors of the companion legislation (S. 990), and Hurd said that could help with getting the money allocated. Their legislation is in the hands of the Senate Homeland Security Committee. A panel spokeswoman said, “Committee staff is reviewing the bill.” — AND NEXT ON HURD’S AGENDA: Once the MGT Act “goes to bed,” Hurd said at a VMware summit Wednesday, he plans to turn to his idea for a cyber national guard. Hurd, who chairs the Oversight Subcommittee on Information Technology, wants to offer scholarships to cyber experts who would serve in government for a while, then move to industry, and finally devote some period of time — like one weekend a month — working back for government. After that, he wants to figure out how to improve the quality of cybersecurity information the government shares with industry. CISOs ON THE HILL WRAPS — Today is the last day for the National Technology Security Coalition’s inaugural DC fly-in. The three-day event has seen chief information security officers from around the country visit with lawmakers and government officials to discuss the group’s cybersecurity priorities. “Our 2017 legislative agenda includes many important issues such as national data breach notification legislation, the way we share threat intelligence information through private/public sector exchanges, and strong, protected encryption,” NTSC President Larry Williams said in a statement. Patrick Gaul, the group’s executive director, added that the CISOs’ “presence on the Hill not only helps us deliver our policy messages but also reinforces NTSC as the primary resource for federal policymakers on technology security issues important to businesses.” GETTING SERIOUS ABOUT ELECTION SECURITY — Politicians at all levels of government must turn cybersecurity into a mainstream issue in order to reduce digital vulnerabilities to the election system, according to a new Council on Foreign Relations brief. “A comprehensive strategy should heighten the political attention cybersecurity receives in efforts to ensure the integrity of elections,” wrote David Fidler, a CFR adjunct senior fellow for cybersecurity, in a paper released Wednesday. Fidler praised the Department of Homeland Security’s decision to label elections critical infrastructure — putting them on par with hospitals and banks — and said other countries should follow suit. He also encouraged governors to offer all necessary support to the National Association of Secretaries of State’s election cybersecurity task force and urged state attorneys general to “raise the political profile of election cybersecurity” in their own meetings. “Democracies should emphasize election cybersecurity’s importance in protecting the human right to vote in free and fair elections,” Fidler wrote. “European democracies should pursue this goal in the European Union and Council of Europe and seek action in the U.N. human rights system, such as updating the authoritative guidance on voting rights issued in 1996 to address, among other things, election cybersecurity.” YOU’VE GOT A FRIEND IN ME — The American and Dutch governments on Wednesday announced a joint initiative to improve collaborative cybersecurity research. The two sides will offer $2.6 million in funding to joint U.S.-Dutch research teams. The program will fund up to five research proposals focusing on industrial control systems; distributed denial-of-service, or DDoS, attacks, which involve flooding targets with traffic to disable them; and threats to the Domain Name System, which routes internet traffic. “Cybersecurity concerns do not stop at national borders,” said Robert Griffin, the acting head of DHS’s science and technology arm, in a statement. The program, he added, will fund research to “develop capabilities that will benefit both countries.” The two nations will jointly review all proposed research projects before an international committee with members from both countries selects the winners. DHS also said it was “working on similar bilateral agreements with its other international partners.” PASSWORD IS WINTERWHITEHOUSE45 — Reporters tested the cybersecurity at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort — which he has occasionally dubbed the “winter White House” — and found that “any half-decent hacker could break in.” The folks at ProPublica and Gizmodo teamed up to test three other Trump properties he has visited as president and found “weak and open Wi-Fi networks, wireless printers without passwords, servers with outdated and vulnerable software, and unencrypted login pages to back-end databases containing sensitive information.” “Those networks all have to be crawling with foreign intruders, not just ProPublica,” Dave Aitel, chief executive officer of cyber firm Immunity, told the publication. The discovery adds to the security concerns about Trump’s properties that POLITICO reported on earlier this year. A Trump Organization spokeswoman said the business follows “cybersecurity best practices,” adding, “we are confident in the steps we have taken to protect our business and safeguard our information.” TWEET OF THE DAY — If you don’t show up, they assume you’re too secure to participate. RECENTLY ON PRO CYBERSECURITY — The Senate Intelligence Committee wants memos from fired FBI Director James Comey detailing his conversations with the White House about the Russia investigation. … Sen. Tim Kaine said that if the memo contents are true, Trump is on the precipice of having committed obstruction of justice. … Sen. Ben Sasse said all of Comey’s Trump notes should be turned over to Congress. … More Hill Republicans want Comey to testify before Congress. … House Speaker Paul Ryan says some people are trying to hurt Trump and Congress should be “sober” when considering allegations that Trump asked Comey to call off an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. A top House appropriator suspects a yearlong fiscal 2018 stopgap spending bill looms. … “House Chief Administrative Officer Philip Kiko urged lawmakers today to rubber-stamp a $13 million boost for the next fiscal year to help the chamber fight hackers.” QUICK BYTES — Chinese state media points the finger at the NSA over the ransomware outbreak.

Intel began shipping Optane DIMMs to partners for testing early this year, and yesterday the company committed to delivering Optane DIMMs as a product called "Intel persistent memory" alongside a refresh of its Xeon Processor Scalable family called Cascade Lake. Both the persistent memory product and Cascade Lake CPUs will arrive sometime in 2018. An Optane DIMM. Source: Intel Intel says that Optane DIMMs will upend the traditional "small, volatile, and expensive" view of system memory by providing a much denser and persistent way of putting data close to the processor, all at lower prices than DRAM. The company showed off these potential benefits at the SAP Sapphire conference by running the ERP giant's HANA analytics tool on a pool of Optane DIMMs. Intel says that for in-memory database apps like HANA, these DIMMs will be a no-brainer for improving performance because of the much larger data sets they'll put closer to CPUs. Without a doubt, Intel Optane DIMMs have the potential to reshape how we think about computer architecture in general. That said, questions about whether 3D Xpoint is ready to endure memory-like workloads have dogged the technology since its commercial introduction earlier this year. Presumably, Intel is taking time to improve the fundamental characteristics of the medium before it begins large-scale deployment of the tech in a DIMM form factor. Still, the fact that Optane DIMMs are up and running is a promising sign for Intel's convergent vision of DRAM and persistent storage.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)    Media May Have Compromised Intel Asset Crucial In The Fight Against ISIS Ryan Pickrell China/Asia Pacific Reporter 9:38 AM 05/18/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP Recent media reports may have jeopardized an intelligence asset providing information essential in the fight against the Islamic State. President Donald Trump shared information provided by an ally with Russian officials about an ISIS terror plot, mentioning the town in which the plot originated, but the president did not reveal intelligence-gathering methods, the name of the country that provided the information, or the intelligence source. The media, however, filled in the gaps. The New York Times, relying on leaked information from anonymous U.S. officials, revealed that Israel provided the information that Trump shared with Russian officials, narrowing the search field and making it easier for enemies to possibly identify the intelligence asset. Trump “discussed with the Russians the information obtained by Israel, without identifying the country,” The Wall Street Journal explained, citing two officials with direct knowledge of the events. “Trump may not have provided enough detail to the Russians to damage that source,” U.S. officials introduced to the WSJ. The WSJ decided not to reveal the source was Israel, noting that, “Trump administration officials said disclosing it could damage the two countries’ intelligence relationship and jeopardize operations” against potential threats. The source was, “the most valuable source of information on external plotting by ISIS,” the WSJ wrote. “The source of information was particularly valuable for tracking Islamic State’s attempts to place explosive devices on commercial airplanes.” Officials reportedly disagree over the impact of Trump’s revelations. While some suspected that the Russians might be able to identify the source from the information provided, others doubted that Russia will be able to root out the nature of the source from Trump’s comments. “I don’t see what Trump gave as a leak,” Air Force Colonel James Waurishuk, a former senior intelligence officer, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “That is part of a foreign policy capability and process to share publicly with other countries for whatever reason.” “If anything, the only real concern is the mention of Israel,” he added. Russia is unlikely to share information with ISIS, which suggests that without media reports on the alleged leak, the intelligence asset might have never been at risk. While no direct sources or methods have been revealed, the mention of Israel potentially exposes information essential to keeping this intelligence asset in the field.

It was only a matter of time until Chipzilla retaliated, and a leaked slide from a German presentation suggests that Intel is stepping up its own Skylake-X HEDT (High End DeskTop) platforms. According to the leaked information, Intel will offer a top-end 12-core Core i9-7920X, with 24 threads and 16.5MB of L3 cache, with 44 PCIe 3.0 lanes. Base clock and turbo frequencies are all TBD, but the chip supposedly has 16.5MB of L3 cache. The other chips are listed as follows: Original forum post by Sweepr, image by dooon Core i9-7900X: 10 cores, 20 threads, 3.3GHz base, 4.3GHz Turbo, 4.5GHz Turbo Boost 3.0, 13.75MB of L3, 44 lanes of PCIe 3.0. Core i9-7820X: 8 cores, 16 threads, 3.6GHz base, 4.3GHz Turbo, 4.5GHz Turbo Boost 3.0, 11MB L3, 28 lanes of PCIe 3.0 Core i9-7800X: 6 cores, 12 threads, 3.5GHz base, 4GHz Turbo, no Turbo Boost 3.0, 8.25MB L3, 28 lanes of PCIe 3.0. Core i7-7740K: 4 cores, 8 threads, 4.3GHz base, 4.5GHz Turbo, no Turbo Boost 3.0, 8MB L3, 16 lanes of PCIe 3.0. Core i7-7640K: 4 cores, 4 threads, 4GHz base, 4.2GHz Turbo, no Turbo Boost 3.0, 6MB of L3 cache, 16 lanes of PCIe 3.0. The two Core i7 chips would be Kaby Lake-derived while the rest of the Core i9 family is based on Skylake-X. No clean match with existing Intel products I’m not at all certain these leaks reflect the chips Intel will announce at Computex. First, there’s the amount of L3 cache. These new cores have far less L3 cache than any current Intel HEDT chip — Intel’s 10-core 6950X, for example, has 25MB of L3. For the last six years, all the way back to the 3960X, Intel has offered 2-2.5MB of L3 cache per CPU core in the HEDT family. These new chips slash that ratio to 1.375MB per core. Sweepr, the Anandtech poster who leaked this information, claims that Intel has made up for the sharp L3 deficit by quadrupling the size of its L2 cache. While we’ve talked before about how Intel might respond to AMD’s Ryzen, there’s no way Intel could have possibly made this change in response. Increasing cache sizes without negatively impacting cache latency is a significant undertaking; Intel would have had to do a fundamental respin on Skylake to make this change. If these cache counts are accurate, they reflect plans Intel made a year or more ago, not any recent response to a renewed competitive environment. And how effective (and how large) various caches need to be for optimal performance is partially a function of the cache architecture. Increasing the L2 cache by 768KB doesn’t automatically compensate for shrinking the L3 cache. If this leaked roadmap is true–and that’s a big if–it implies Intel won’t be fixing one of the artificial segmentation barriers that’s most annoyed enthusiasts: the lockout on PCI Express lanes. If you want to run two graphics cards at full x16, you have to buy a 10-core chip to do it. Unless Intel plans to substantially slash prices, that would actually be a worse deal than at present. Currently, the Core i7-6850K supports 40 PCI-Express lanes with an MSRP of $617 – $628. Intel’s 10-core processor, the 6950X, is a $1,800 core. Unless Intel plans a serious price cut at this core count, enthusiasts will have to pay top dollar for a 32-lane solution. Ryzen 7 doesn’t currently offer a 32-lane solution either, though there’s speculation that the company’s rumored HEDT competitive solution will, when and if it’s released. Finally, it’s not clear why Intel would even bother releasing Core i7 CPUs with these specs. There’s the tiniest hint of an upgrade in the i7-7740K, with its 4.3GHz base clock as opposed to the 4.2GHz base clock of the 7700K, but the Core i7-7640K isn’t an i7 at all. It’s nothing but an i5 with higher base clocks, and any four-core / eight-thread i7 from the past few years will outperform it in any multi-threaded application of note. Releasing an entry-level HEDT “Core i7” that would assuredly be outperformed by the Core i7-4790K, 6700K, or 7700K isn’t the best way to encourage enthusiast adoption and I’m taking these rumors with a fair bit of salt.

CREDIT: Will Anderson Advertisement Editor's Note: Thalmic Labs is a winner of Inc.'s 2017 Design Awards, our annual recognition of entrepreneurs using design to build great companies, in the "Interaction Design" category. On a cool April night five years ago, Stephen Lake, Matthew Bailey, and Aaron Grant were drinking beers when they stumbled upon what seemed like a life-altering question: What would the next iteration of the computer mouse--invented in 1964--look like? Eventually, the University of Waterloo students arrived at an answer--one they had to create for themselves. The Myo armband is a "natural interface" wearable gadget that recognizes a person's gestures, allowing him or her to control Bluetooth-enabled devices with a flick of a hand. Built with sensors powered by electromyography--a medical technique used to record and evaluate the tiny electrical impulses sent between one's brain and muscles--the Myo arm bracelet translates muscle activity into commands that any Roku or drone will respond to. The engineers used student loans and credit card debt to fund the first Myo proto­type--buying a 3-D printer on Kijiji (the Canadian version of Craigslist) and then hijacking a co-working-space bathroom stall for their personal R&D lab. Finally, after four sleep-deprived months of placing electrodes on their shaved, gel-doused arms, they had a working unit. It's been a blur ever since. In 2013, a successful preorder campaign resulted in $4 million in sales during Myo's first month, helping Kitchener, Ontario-based Thalmic Labs raise a $14.5 million Series A round led by Intel Capital. The next year, Myo shipped worldwide, but Thalmic couldn't keep up with demand, so it decided to open its technology to developers, who have since created more than 100 applications that span medicine, music, and gaming. Then, last September, Amazon, Intel, and Fidelity Investments Canada led a $120 million investment round. Thalmic Labs co-founders Matthew Bailey (left), Stephen Lake, and Aaron Grant. CREDIT: Courtesy Company While the co-founders won't reveal what's next in their quest to reinvent how humans interact with computers, they've devoted a team in their 190-person company to building a comprehensive database of human body measurements, such as hair-to-skin ratios and the average girth of an arm. "We're developing technology that responds to humans, not the other way around," says CEO Lake. "We believe human variability isn't a hurdle to be overcome when innovating, but something that should be embraced." The many ways to wear a Myo armband Medicine Surgeons are analyzing X-rays and CT scans with the Myo as they perform surgery, zooming in and rotating the images to ensure their scalpel is accurately placed. Prosthetics An amputee at Johns Hopkins University is using the device on his upper arm to convert muscle activity into commands that control his robotic prosthetic forearm. Language Researchers at Arizona State University are using it to translate sign language to text. The device recognizes the user's hand gestures and matches them with their corresponding words or phrases in a sign language database, which then appear as text on a smartphone. Drones Developers created an app that can sync a Myo to a drone, so someone can fly it with simple hand gestures. Music An Amsterdam-based DJ uses two Myo armbands to control the visual and light effects during his shows, so when he raises his right arm, the stage lights move with him.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print ROSENSTEIN BRIEFS THE SENATE TODAY – Capitol Hill cheers special prosecutor for Russia probe – SENATE PANELS DEMAND COMEY MEMOS – Dems try to stifle impeachment talk 05/18/2017 08:06 AM EDT By Heather Caygle (hcaygle@politico.com or @heatherscope) With an assist from Burgess Everett Story Continued Below ROSENSTEIN BRIEFS THE SENATE — Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will be on Capitol Hill today to brief the Senate on the circumstances surrounding FBI Director James Comey’s firing last week. President Donald Trump initially cited a memo from Rosenstein as his rationale for firing Comey before shifting stories a couple of days later and saying he’d planned to dismiss the FBI director all along. The closed briefing starts at 2:30 p.m. Rosenstein is likely to face a much friendlier reception, particularly from Democrats, after he appointed a special prosecutor Wednesday to take over the federal investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Rosenstein tapped Robert Mueller, the former FBI director under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, who is well respected on both sides of the aisle. What this means on Capitol Hill: Both the Senate and House Intel investigations into Russia will continue, GOP leaders said. But for Democrats, many of whom had demanded a special prosecutor after Comey’s firing, Mueller’s appointment is a major victory. It could also take a little pressure off the confirmation of the next FBI director—some key Democrats had vowed to oppose the nomination until a special prosecutor was appointed. CNN’s Manu Raju sums it up in a tweet: “On Russia probes, Ds wanted Sessions to step aside. He did. They wanted Nunes recusal. He did. They wanted a special counsel. They got that.” Bandwagon fans: “And key Republicans jumped on the special prosecutor bandwagon on Wednesday after the announcement… ‘I see it as a positive thing, especially having Bob Mueller involved,’ Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said. …Burr, whose committee is leading its own investigation, had previously opposed the appointment of a special prosecutor.” Austin rounds up Capitol Hill reaction: http://politi.co/2pOAweH Back so soon? Rosenstein will be back on the Hill Friday for an all-members briefing with the House at 10 a.m. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) sent a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) Monday asking for the meeting. Do your homework: Burgess dug up this brief CRS explainer on special prosecutors. “These special counsels are appointed by, are answerable to, and may have their prosecutorial or investigative decisions countermanded by the Attorney General.” More: http://bit.ly/2pOg0uK BACK ON TRACK? Mueller’s appointment could also bring a little focus back to the GOP’s agenda, which has suffered as lawmakers struggled to respond to the stream of Russia-related bombshells coming from the White House lately. But some Republicans still fear “that subpoenas and congressional inquiries will swamp the time they need to pass a health care or tax bill in 2017 — not to mention renegotiate NAFTA, unify behind a $1 trillion infrastructure plan or build that border wall,” Nancy Cook and Burgess report this morning. Republicans “say they’re still determined to push through policy wins before the 2018 midterms. …But the congressional calendar is tight, with long recesses in June and August. Floor time will be consumed by the passage of spending bills and action on the debt-ceiling limit this fall, not to mention the ongoing confirmation of Trump’s political appointees. Congress has only so much bandwidth — and now investigations related to Trump's campaign and Russia will be taking up a share.” More: http://politi.co/2qzUxmw THE LONG-TERM IMPACT OF TRUMP’S SCANDALS — “House Republicans facing tough reelection bids are running for cover from Donald Trump — an early sign that they believe the president’s deepening scandals could cost them their seats and even put the House in play,” Rachael and Kyle report this morning. “More than 10 centrist Republicans over the past 48 hours have criticized Trump … Many joined Democrats in calling for a special prosecutor … Others want a select congressional committee to be appointed.” Much more: http://politi.co/2qzYkAg Y’ALL, IT’S THURSDAY. Welcome to May 18 and as always, thanks for reading POLITICO’s Huddle, the play-by-play guide to all things Capitol Hill. WEDNESDAY’S MOST CLICKED: Rachel’s tweet about being flipped off by Rep. Darrell Issa was the winner. SENATE SCUTTLEBUTT: DEMS OPPOSED TO LIEBERMAN AS FBI DIRECTOR — Many Senate Democrats are strongly opposed to their former colleague Joe Lieberman taking over the helm of the FBI, a little birdie tells Huddle. The reason? Lieberman, the former Democratic-turned-independent senator, is senior counsel at a major law firm that has represented Trump for years, threatening legal action on everything from publication of his tax returns to news stories about the infamous Access Hollywood tape, Newsweek reports. Of course, Republicans can confirm a new FBI director without Democratic help. But the job has traditionally received overwhelming bipartisan buy-in. The White House interviewed Lieberman on Wednesday. DAMAGE CONTROL? WHO NEEDS IT? The White House has made essentially zero attempts to control the damage on Capitol Hill after the Comey memo was reported. “No talking points have been distributed, and few reassurances have been given to Republicans, leaving frazzled and exhausted lawmakers to freelance their own response,” Burgess and Josh Dawsey report. Quote du jour: “I’ve not heard that from them. I’ve heard nothing. I should, shouldn’t I? I’m not sure that there’s that level of organization,” said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), whose job in leadership is essentially to help Republicans form a message and defend their party leader. More: http://politi.co/2qAgxOe SENATE WANTS COMEY MEMOS — Senate Intel leaders asked the FBI on Wednesday to turn over all memos Comey wrote about conversations he had with the White House and DOJ about the federal investigation into Russia. Separately, top members of the Senate Judiciary Committee put in requests with the FBI and the White House for any documents that detail communications between Comey and Trump. Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley has also invited Comey to testify. Austin and Seung Min with the deets: http://politi.co/2qzUCq7 Across the Capitol, House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz has invited Comey to testify at a hearing next week. “Officially noticed a hearing for next Wed at 9:30am ET with former FBI Dir Comey. But I still need to speak with him...evidently has a new #,” Chaffetz tweeted Wednesday. What Capitol Hill is reading: Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn stopped a military plan Turkey opposed after being secretly paid to lobby for the country, McClatchy reported. And Trump’s team knew Flynn was under federal investigation for his lobbying work before bringing him on as national security adviser, the New York Times reports. TOP DEMS TRY TO QUELL IMPEACHMENT TALK — More than a dozen House Democrats are now raising the idea that Trump could be impeached. And there’s mounting pressure from Democratic activists to force the issue. But party leaders in both the House and Senate aren’t ready to go there – and frankly wish the House rank-and-file would stop talking about it so much. Until there’s clear proof Trump broke the law, party leaders say, impeachment chatter does little more than distract from the party’s broader messaging. “I’ve been talking to the base since November the 9th and telling them this is a marathon, it’s not a sprint,” Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said. “We have an orderly process in our government. We’re going to follow it.” Your Huddle host teams up with Elana for this bicameral collaboration: http://politi.co/2qA0jEL Handy bookmark: CNN is keeping a running tally of Democrats who are talking impeachment (and what they’re saying) here: http://cnn.it/2pUUYqf GOING BIG IN BIG SKY — The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is pouring a last-minute $200,000 ad buy into the Montana special election, hoping to give GOP candidate Greg Gianforte a boost ahead of the May 25 election. “It’s the first investment the Chamber has made in the race. Over $8 million has been spent on the Montana special, most of it in support of Gianforte. …Democratic groups, seeing the race for the conservative-leaning seat as a reach, have largely stayed out of the contest,” Alex Isenstadt reports. More: http://politi.co/2qA4Jew FIRST IN HUDDLE: PRO-CHOICE CAUCUS LETTER TO IVANKA — Leaders of the Pro-Choice Caucus are sending a letter to Ivanka Trump today, inviting her to meet with the group to talk about ensuring women still have affordable access to birth control. “Unfortunately, we fear that the administration may take additional steps in the very near future that will further jeopardize women’s access to contraception,” they write Read the letter: http://bit.ly/2qAeidM PSA TO HILL REPORTERS — Capitol Hill officials appear to be looking for a reason to crack down on swelling crowds on the Senate side. It’s getting so bad that they are now publicly warning that a change in access is coming. Don’t give them an excuse! Please listen to the press gallery staff (they’re there to help), stop aggressively crowding senators and blocking pathways, and just generally abide by Capitol Hill etiquette. Read the memo: http://politi.co/2rg0t6Q TILLIS BACK ON THE HILL AFTER COLLAPSE — Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) was back to work in the Capitol Wednesday afternoon after collapsing during a morning charity run. Tillis, who posted a video update from the hospital and another once he made it back to the Hill, said he just got overheated during the three-mile race but has since been given a clean bill of health. “I want to apologize to some of the people, I may have slowed down their lap time if they happened to be behind me,” he said. TODAY IN CONGRESS — The Senate gavels in at 10 a.m. with a roll call vote on the confirmation of Rachel Brand, associate attorney general nominee, at 12 p.m. The Senate will also hold a procedural vote on Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad’s nomination to serve as ambassador to China. The House meets at 10 a.m. with first votes around 2 p.m. and last votes around 4 p.m. Today’s agenda: http://bit.ly/2pOEaFA ** A message from the American Society of Anesthesiologists: When Seconds Count … Physician Anesthesiologists Save Lives.

Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Derek Kilmer (D-Wash.) hold a 10 a.m. press conference in the House triangle calling on Republicans to raise the fiscal 2018 budget caps. Speaker Paul Ryan holds his weekly press conference in HVC Studio A at 11:30 a.m. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi hold’s her weekly press conference at 12:15 p.m. in HVC Studio A. Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Tom Udall (D-N.M.) and Rep. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.) hold an 11 a.m. press conference on their bill to close ethics loopholes related to the appointment of government officials. Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and other House Democrats hold a 12:30 p.m. press conference in HVC Studio B on potential Trump plans to renegotiate NAFTA. WEDNESDAY’S TRIVIA WINNER — Shay Hancock from Crossroads Strategies correctly guessed that former Sen. Evan Bayh, also the son of a former senator, brought a lawsuit to his state Supreme Court in order to be declared eligible to run for governor. TODAY’S TRIVIA — Shay is bringing some inside baseball to today’s trivia question: The father of this current, high-ranking congressional staffer defeated the longest-lived governor in U.S. history and later became a senator, succeeding the only person to have an Ohio-class submarine named for him/her.

Every surgery has risks. During her presurgery consultation, teenager Hunter shared information that triggered concerns by her physician anesthesiologist. As a highly trained physician with extensive medical knowledge and expertise in anesthesia – and in the human body and its systems – the physician anesthesiologist suspected Hunter might have an undiagnosed condition that could result in profound surgical complications. The physician anesthesiologist canceled Hunter’s surgery and ordered additional tests – and that decision altered Hunter’s life. If the original surgery had been performed, Hunter’s life could have changed completely. Having a physician anesthesiologist leading Hunter’s care saved her from being paralyzed and resulted in a diagnosis and successful treatment of a brain tumor.

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.—The first standalone virtual reality headsets based on Google's Daydream design go on sale later this year, Google announced at its I/O developers conference here on Wednesday. The new headsets, from HTC and Lenovo, will come with the built-in positional tracking that smartphone-based models currently lack, and Google promised simplicity: just pick them up and put them on. Qualcomm and Intel have been working on their own reference designs for standalone headsets. Intel teased its Project Alloy set last year, and Qualcomm showed off a model based on the Snapdragon 835 processor at CES in January. The Snapdragon 835 platform apparently impressed Google, and the standalone Daydream headsets will feature Qualcomm processors alongside Google's own tracking technology, which is also found in the Tango augmented reality smartphone platform, first seen on the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro. In the race to broaden virtual reality's appeal beyond hardcore video gamers, it is standalone designs that recently emerged as frontrunners, because they can deliver immersive VR experiences complete with motion tracking without being attached to a high-end gaming PC or laptop. Google's current VR headset, the $79 Daydream View, is one of several affordable sets on the market that rely on smartphones to function. It went on sale last fall, and competes against the second-generation Samsung Gear VR, a collaboration between the Korean tech giant and Facebook-owned Oculus. Both headsets require special apps and a narrow range of compatible smartphones to function, however, limiting their appeal among the everyday users their makers keenly want to attract. The Daydream and Gear VR also can't track their wearers' positions relative to the room in which they're standing, a key requirement for immersive VR games and other experiences. Related Hands On: Acer's Windows 10 Mixed Reality Headset Hands On: Acer's Windows 10 Mixed Reality Headset Their alternatives are expensive headsets like the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, which cost several hundred dollars and require both external tracking sensors and a cable connection to a PC with a powerful dedicated graphics card. A standalone set like the Daydream reference design announced today combines the best of both worlds: untethered from a computer but with all the tracking and other sensors required to run the most immersive apps. Oculus is working on a standalone headset, too. Its Santa Cruz prototype made a brief debut last fall, but appears to be far from ready to hit store shelves and online shopping carts. If you prefer smartphone-based AR, Google said Lenovo's next flagship smartphone, expected later this year, will support the Daydream platform. The Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ will also get Daydream support this summer.

Follow Hot Topics: Roger Ailes Robert Mueller James Comey President Trump Marc Thiessen IDs Seven Times the Press Published Damaging Obama-Era Intel By Tom Blumer | May 17, 2017 | 5:56 PM EDT Share it Tweet it 0 shares In a Tuesday post at the American Enterprise Institute's "AEI Ideas" blog, Marc Thiessen called out "The media hypocrisy over Trump’s intelligence leak." While acknowledging that the Trump-related leak, if true (very big if), would be "indeed a disaster" — though, as National Review's Andy McCarthy has noted, still within Trump's unreviewable authority" as President —Thiessen noted that the current hyperventilation is coming from "the same news outlets that regularly, and intentionally, published highly classified intelligence in recent years, based on leaks from the Obama administration." Thiessen, a weekly columnist at the Washington Post, a former chief speechwriter for President George W. Bush, and author of Courting Disaster: How the CIA Kept America Safe and How Barack Obama Is Inviting the Next Attack, identified seven such instances. Thiessen identified seven instances of Obama administration-tied leaks, and assured readers that "The list of leaks and liaison partners exposed during the Obama years goes on and on." Here are the seven (links added in instances where the writer provided them; bolds are mine throughout this post): EXPOSURE OF US-ISRAELI ROLE IN “STUXNET” ATTACK ON IRAN. Where was the outrage when The New York Times exposed the US government’s cyberattack on Iran’s nuclear program, including the fact that Obama personally ordered cyberattacks on the Iranian nuclear program using a computer virus called Stuxnet? ... The Stuxnet leak exposed intelligence sources and methods, including the top secret codename for the program (“Olympic Games”) and the involvement of a US ally, Israel. ... Where was the concern for the exposure this intelligence or the involvement of our liaison partner? The damage this leak did — both to the operation and the trust between our two countries — is incalculable. ... EXPOSURE OF NSA ABILITY TO ACCESS TERRORIST COMPUTERS NOT CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET. (New York Times, January, 2014) ... EXPOSURE OF THE IDENTITY OF THE PAKISTANI DOCTOR WHO HELPED US FIND BIN LADEN. Or how about the disclosure of classified operational details of the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, including the identity of the Pakistani doctor who helped us track down bin Laden? (ABC News, May 2012) ... (That doctor) is still rotting in a Pakistani prison to this day. (serving a 33-year sentence — Ed.) Did his exposure by Obama officials bragging about the president’s accomplishment have a chilling effect on intelligence cooperation? You bet. EXPOSURE OF SAUDI DOUBLE AGENT IN YEMEN. Or how the Obama administration’s shameful exposure of the role of a double agent recruited in London by British intelligence in breaking up a new underwear bomb plot in Yemen? (UK Guardian, May 2012) EXPOSURE OF LIBYAN COOPERATION IN CAPTURE OF AL QAEDA LEADER – WHICH LED DIRECTLY TO THE RETALIATORY KIDNAPPING OF THE LIBYAN PRIME MINISTER. (New York Times, October 2013) ... Not only was a liaison partner’s counter-terrorism cooperation exposed, the prime minister was kidnapped in retaliation for approving the raid! Worse still, the Times revealed that a second raid had been planned, but not carried out, “to seize a militia leader suspected of carrying out the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks on the United States diplomatic mission in Benghazi.” EXPOSURE OF A SECRET US DRONE BASE IN SAUDI ARABIA. (Washington Post, May 2013) EXPOSURE OF SPECIAL OPERATIONS ACTIVITIES AGAINST AL-QAEDA IN AFRICA. On June 13, 2012, the Washington Post reported: "... Under a classified surveillance program code-named Creek Sand, dozens of US personnel and contractors have come to [Burkina Faso] in recent years to establish a small air base on the military side of the international airport.” The Burkina Faso foreign minister, caught by surprise by the leak, is quoted as pleading, “This cooperation should be very, very discreet. We should not show to al-Qaeda that we are now working with the Americans." Too late. <<< Please support MRC's NewsBusters team with a tax-deductible contribution today. >>> DONATE Thiessen's harsh conclusion: None of this excuses Trump’s accidentally sharing top-secret intelligence with Russian officials. But it takes chutzpah for the media to express outrage over his apparently inadvertent disclosure of classified information – or to feign concern over the effect his actions might have on cooperation by our intelligence partners in the fight against terror – when they regularly published often intentional leaks from Obama administration that exposed sources and methods and endangered our national security. Trump may have stumbled badly in his meeting with the Russians, but he has a long way to go before he does the kind of damage that President Obama and his team of intelligence sieves did – with the help of The New York Times and other news outlets now crowing over his error. At Powerline yesterday, shortly after Thiessen's post appeared, Steven Hayward noted the following in light of the New York Times reporting which had just appeared (again, after Thiessen's post). The Times reported, as usual based on anonymous sourcing, that "Israel (was) Said to Be Source of Secret Intelligence Trump Gave to Russia." Hayward's reaction: ... yesterday the media was falling all over itself to declare how terrible it was that Trump had compromised a source. Today’s media line: Oh, by the way, it was Israel. As usual and has been said so often, if the establishment press didn't have double standards, it wouldn't have any standards at all. Cross-posted at BizzyBlog.com.

By Matthe Rosenberg and Mark Mazzetti New York Times  May 18, 2017 WASHINGTON — Michael T. Flynn told President Donald Trump’s transition team weeks before the inauguration that he was under federal investigation for secretly working as a paid lobbyist for Turkey during the campaign, according to two people familiar with the case. Despite this warning, which came about a month after the Justice Department notified Flynn of the inquiry, Trump made Flynn his national security adviser. The job gave Flynn access to the president and nearly every secret held by U.S. intelligence agencies. Advertisement Flynn’s disclosure, on Jan. 4, was first made to the transition team’s chief lawyer, Donald F. McGahn II, who is now the White House counsel. That conversation, and another one two days later between Flynn’s lawyer and transition lawyers, shows that the Trump team knew about the investigation of Flynn far earlier than has been previously reported. His legal issues have been a problem for the White House from the beginning and are at the center of a growing political crisis for Trump. Flynn, who was fired after 24 days in the job, was initially kept on even after the acting attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, warned the White House that he might be subject to blackmail by the Russians for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of conversations he had with the Russian ambassador to Washington.

Sign up for more newsletters here After Flynn’s dismissal, Trump tried to get James B. Comey, the FBI director, to drop the investigation — an act that some legal experts say is grounds for an investigation of Trump for possible obstruction of justice. He fired Comey on May 9. The White House declined to comment on whether officials there had known about Flynn’s legal troubles before the inauguration. Flynn, a retired general, is one of a handful of Trump associates under scrutiny in intertwined federal investigations into their financial links to foreign governments and whether any of them helped Russia interfere in the presidential election. Advertisement In congressional testimony, the acting FBI director, Andrew G. McCabe, has confirmed the existence of a “highly significant” investigation into possible collusion between Trump’s associates and Russian operatives to sway the presidential election. The pace of the investigations has intensified in recent weeks, with a veteran espionage prosecutor, Brandon Van Grack, now leading a grand jury inquiry in Northern Virginia that is scrutinizing Flynn’s foreign lobbying and has begun issuing subpoenas to businesses that worked with Flynn and his associates. The New York Times has reviewed one of the subpoenas. It demands all “records, research, contracts, bank records, communications” and other documents related to work with Flynn and the Flynn Intel Group, the business he set up after he was forced out as chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014. The subpoena also asks for similar records about Ekim Alptekin, a Turkish businessman who is close to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and is chairman of the Turkish-American Business Council. There is no indication that Alptekin is under investigation. Signed by Dana J. Boente, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, the subpoena instructs the recipient to direct any questions about its contents to Van Grack. Van Grack, a national security prosecutor based at the Justice Department headquarters in Washington, has experience conducting espionage investigations. He prosecuted a businessman for illegally exporting thousands of sensitive electronics components to Iran and a suspected hacker in the Syrian Electronic Army. In 2015, he prosecuted a Virginia man for acting as an unregistered agent of Syria’s intelligence services. According to people who have talked to Flynn about the case, he sees the Justice Department’s investigation as part of an effort by the Obama administration and its holdovers in the government to keep him out of the White House. In his view, this effort began immediately after the election, when President Barack Obama, who had fired Flynn as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told Trump that he would have profound concerns about Flynn’s becoming a top national security aide. The people close to Flynn said he believed that when that warning did not dissuade Trump from making him national security adviser, the Justice Department opened its investigation into his lobbying work. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid angering Justice Department or White House officials. The investigation stems from the work Flynn did for Inovo BV, a Dutch company owned by Alptekin, the Turkish businessman. On Aug. 9, Flynn and the Flynn Intel Group signed a contract with Inovo for $600,000 over 90 days to run an influence campaign aimed at discrediting Fethullah Gulen, an reclusive cleric who lives in Pennsylvania and whom Erdogan has accused of orchestrating a failed coup in Turkey last summer. When he was hired by Alptekin, Flynn did not register as a foreign agent, as required by law when an American represents the interests of a foreign government. Only in March did he file a retroactive registration with the Justice Department because his lawyer, Robert K. Kelner, said that “the engagement could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.” Trump campaign officials first became aware of a problem with Flynn’s business dealings in early November. On Nov. 8, the day of the election, Flynn wrote an op-ed in The Hill that advocated improved relations between Turkey and the United States and called Gulen “a shady Islamic mullah.” “If he were in reality a moderate, he would not be in exile, nor would he excite the animus of Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his government,” the op-ed said. Days later, after an article in The Daily Caller revealed that the Flynn Intel Group had a contract with Inovo, a Trump campaign lawyer held a conference call with members of the Flynn Intel Group, according to one person with knowledge of the call. The lawyer, William McGinley, was seeking more information about the nature of the group’s foreign work and wanted to know whether Flynn had been paid for the op-ed. McGinley now works in the White House as Cabinet secretary and deputy assistant to the president. The Justice Department also took notice. The op-ed in The Hill raised suspicions that Flynn was working as a foreign agent, and in a letter dated Nov. 30, the Justice Department notified Flynn that it was scrutinizing his lobbying work. Flynn hired a lawyer a few weeks later. By Jan. 4, the day Flynn informed McGahn of the inquiry, the Justice Department was investigating the matter. Kelner then followed up with another call to the Trump transition’s legal team. He ended up leaving a message, identifying himself as Flynn’s lawyer. According to a person familiar with the case, Kelner did not get a call back until two days later, on Jan. 6. Around the time of Flynn’s call with McGahn, the FBI began investigating Flynn on a separate matter: phone conversations he had in late December with Sergey I. Kislyak, Russia’s ambassador to the United States. Current and former U.S. officials said that, on the calls, Flynn discussed sanctions that the Obama administration had imposed on Russia for disrupting the November election. After news of the calls became public, Flynn misled Pence about what he had discussed with Kislyak, telling him that the two had only exchanged holiday pleasantries. Days after the inauguration, Yates, the acting attorney general, spoke with McGahn at the White House, telling him Justice Department lawyers believed that Flynn might be vulnerable to Russian blackmail. Since the Russians knew that Flynn had lied to the vice president, she said, they might have leverage over him. Loading comments...

Miller May 17, 2017 10 Comments At this week's financial analyst meeting, AMD unveiled a 16-core, 32-thread desktop processor called Ryzen Threadripper. At this week's financial analyst meeting, AMD unveiled a 16-core, 32-thread desktop processor called Ryzen Threadripper—its new Epyc brand for server chips—and introduced its first graphics board aimed at the machine learning market. But I was also glad to see the company unveil a roadmap of successive generations in its CPU, GPU, and server lines, with migration to 7nm and 7nm+ process nodes through 2020, which is crucial for the firm to regain credibility with business buyers. At this point, competitors Intel and Nvidia dominate their markets, particularly on the server side, and business buyers need to be convinced that AMD will be a long-term player in order for it to land on the consideration list. "Immersive and instinctive computing will transform all of our daily lives," AMD CEO Lisa Su said at the conference when defining the company's vision for the future. Immersive computing with high-end graphics is all around us, but instinctive computing—which involves using huge amounts of data and machine learning algorithms—is just beginning to evolve. All of this requires "high-performance computing," she said, a term she used to describe all sorts of high-end computing and graphics, not just the HPC or supercomputing market. Su talked at length about investing for "multi-generational leadership" in x86 CPUs, graphics for both PCs and integrated, and software—a big change for a company whose primary products have targeted the mainstream or low-end markets. AMD will now focus on premium products, she said, and noted that while the mainstream accounts for most of its units, the premium part of the market accounts for most of its revenue and profits. Her biggest announcement was probably Epyc, the branding for the new line of server chips, which had been codenamed Naples. Su said that the Zen architecture, which debuted in the Ryzen desktop chips was "created with the new data center in mind." And while she is enthusiastic for what Zen can bring in the desktop and laptop markets, she is even more excited about what Zen can do in the data center market. She talked about how AMD has also targeted the data center market through Radeon Instinct, a version its next-generation graphics architecture known as Vega—which will provide 25 teraflops of performance—and how these would work together in a vision of heterogeneous computing. "Today's data center really requires heterogenous computing to be successful," she said, describing AMD as the only provider of both high-performance computing and graphics. CTO Mark Papermaster gave more detail about the glue that will hold the new chips together, as well as the firm's process for designing new chips in a way that will "provide sustained innovation going forward." Papermaster described the major features of the Zen and Vega architectures for CPUs and GPUs, most of which had been described previously, and said the firm has to design "not only for performance, but also for efficiency." Tying the chips together is the firm's new Infinity Fabric, which connects CPUs, GPUs, memory controllers, and other features within a chip and between chip sockets. Papermaster called Infinity Fabric a "hidden gem," and explained how it includes a control fabric that manages sensors on the chip; can regulate performance and security; and can also work as a data fabric, moving data between the various parts of the system. He said this allows for "near perfect scalability" through 64 CPU cores. AMD is also supporting some new industry standard interconnects between systems, known as Gen-Z & CCIX, as it pushes for open standards (since it doesn't have the heft of Intel in the market). Papermaster said that one big challenge for the firm over the next few years will be "defying the slowing of Moore's Law." He said that through integration, software, and system design it would be able to stay at the pace of generational performance improvement, even without frequency improvements. To that end, Papermaster showed roadmaps for both the graphics and CPU lines through 2020, and said that the team is not only rolling out the current generation of products, but working now on the next two. The plans show moving to 7nm and 7nm+ production modes, with continuing improvements in both raw performance and performance per watt. While these weren't detailed, they were great to see. A 16-core, 32-Thread CPU and a GPU Aimed at Machine Learning Jim Anderson, General Manager of the Computing and Graphics group, said that in addition to the Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 products already announced, a lower-end Ryzen 3 will ship in the third quarter. More importantly, all five of the top PC OEMs (Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, and Lenovo) will have Ryzen desktops available for consumers in the market by the end of the quarter. Commercial desktops should follow in the second half of this year, he said. For those interested in the "absolute highest performance," Anderson announced a new version called Ryzen Threadripper with 16 cores and 32 threads coming "this summer." Anderson said that a mobile version of the Ryzen processor, with on-die Vega graphics, will be available for consumer systems in the second half of 2017. A commercial version should follow in the first half of 2018. He said the mobile chip will offer 50 percent more CPU performance and 40 percent more GPU performance while using 50 percent less power compared to the company's current seventh-generation APU. Meanwhile, in the graphics world, Raja Koduri, Chief Architect for the Radeon Technologies Group, discussed the company's plans for a new series of graphics boards based on the new Vega architecture. Koduri noted that the company's current Polaris architecture GPUs mostly address the mainstream and mid-market segments of the graphics market (with graphics boards under $300), and acknowledged that the company didn't play at the top end. This will change with the new Vega architecture. Among the features Koduri described were a new high-bandwidth cache controller (which can double or quadruple the available memory), a new programmable geometry pipeline, Rapid Packed Math (for 16-bit floating point), and an advanced pixel engine. He showed demos featuring much smoother motion in high-end gaming and said Vega will support 4K 60 Hz gaming. For the professional market, Koduri talked about getting more certifications and supporting SSG, which will allow for a 16GB high-bandwidth cache and up to 2TB of on-board SSG NVME flash memory. He showed demonstrations of this working in real-time ray-tracing and on producing 8K video clips in Adobe Premiere. Koduri then turned his attention to machine learning, where competitor Nvidia has made huge inroads in deep learning with its GPU-based products and its CUDA architecture. He acknowledged that "AMD is not even in the conversation today," but emphasized the company's heterogenous computing approach and what it calls the Radeon Open Compute Platform (ROCm), which supports running machine learning applications on all of the leading frameworks, including TensorFlow and Caffe. Koduri demonstrated the new product, which will be called Radeon Vega Frontier Edition, and showed that it is very competitive on Baidu's DeepBench machine learning training benchmark. He said this will offer 13 teraflops of performance at 32-bit, 25 teraflops at 16-bit, as well as up to 16GB of high-bandwidth memory (HBM2), which is four times that of AMD's current Fury X board. This is due out in late June. One would assume other Vega-based boards will follow shortly. Koduri said that he believes Threadripper and Naples will be disruptive, in part because the CPU bottlenecks will go away, leaving more room for GPU performance. AMD Promises 'A New Day for the Datacenter' Forrest Norrod, SVP and General Manager for the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom Business Group, gave details on the Epyc server ship. He said "datacenter leadership" is the company's No. 1 priority, despite having what he described as "a rounding to zero percentage market share." Norrod said the company's previous achievements in server technology—which include having created the first 64-bit x86 cores, high-speed coherent interconnects, and integrated memory controllers—are what make it "plausible… predictable… inevitable" for it to again compete in this market. Norrod said that Epyc will include 32 Zen cores, 8 memory channels, 128 lanes of high bandwidth I/O, and a dedicated security engine. But while that sounds like a huge chip, Norrod explained that the Infinity Fabric Papermaster described earlier enables the chip to actually be built from four 8-core die, which makes it much easier and less expensive to produce. Norrod said that in a two-socket configuration, the chip could offer 64 cores, 4TB memory, and 128 PCI Express lanes, thus giving it 45 percent more cores, 122 percent more memory bandwidth, and 60 percent more I/O than the Xeon E5-2699A v4 (Broadwell). And he presented a couple of demos that showed it outperforming the Xeon in tasks such as compiling Linux. I was more impressed with a demo of how a single-socket version of the chip could outperform a middle of the market dual-socket Intel configuration, which he said accounts for most of the market. (As always, I take vendor benchmarks with a grain of salt, and suggest you do as well.) Epyc will offer the "best value for end users," he said. AMD is looking for leadership in specific segments of the market; Norrod noted it's likely to get traction at first from the bigger datacenter customers who write their own software. One big difference between AMD and Intel's approach, he said, is that every Epyc will be "unrestrained, with all of the I/0, memory channel, high-seed memory, security stack, and integrated chipset features supported on all models. (Intel offers certain features only on higher-end models). Norrod said Epyc offers a simpler architecture compared to Intel, and made a big deal about combining Epyc and the Radeon Instinct platform for machine learning. Norrod said Epyc is scheduled to be launched in late June, with more than 30 server models expected to be shipped this year. Norrod also stressed that this is the first in a series of chips, and presented a roadmap with versions called "Rome" and "Milan" (to follow "Naples") between now and 2020, using 7nm and 7nm+ processes. He emphasized that it isn't all about core performance, but rather continuous innovation. Following a financial presentation, CEO Lisa Su returned to close the event, and told the financial analysts that while the numbers are important, "this company is all about the products." It's certainly good for the industry to have more competition in CPUs, graphics, and especially in the data center market. After all, the periods when we've seen the most competition have also been the periods when we've seen the most innovation.

Flynn told President Donald Trump’s transition team weeks before the inauguration that he was under federal investigation for secretly working as a paid lobbyist for Turkey during the campaign, according to two people familiar with the case. Despite this warning, which came about a month after the Justice Department notified Flynn of the inquiry, Trump made Flynn his national security adviser. The job gave Flynn access to the president and nearly every secret held by U.S. intelligence agencies. Flynn’s disclosure, on Jan. 4, was first made to the transition team’s chief lawyer, Donald F. McGahn II, who is now the White House counsel. That conversation, and another one two days later between Flynn’s lawyer and transition lawyers, shows that the Trump team knew about the investigation of Flynn far earlier than has been previously reported. His legal issues have been a problem for the White House from the beginning and are at the center of a growing political crisis for Trump. Flynn, who was fired after 24 days in the job, was initially kept on even after the acting attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, warned the White House that he might be subject to blackmail by the Russians for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of conversations he had with the Russian ambassador to Washington. After Flynn’s dismissal, Trump tried to get James B. Comey, the FBI director, to drop the investigation — an act that some legal experts say is grounds for an investigation of Trump for possible obstruction of justice. He fired Comey on May 9. The White House declined to comment on whether officials there had known about Flynn’s legal troubles before the inauguration. Flynn, a retired general, is one of a handful of Trump associates under scrutiny in intertwined federal investigations into their financial links to foreign governments and whether any of them helped Russia interfere in the presidential election. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 0:25 Tillis on hospital bed after collapse: I'm fine Pause 1:41 Yates on Flynn: ‘The National Security Adviser, essentially, could be blackmailed by the Russians’ 4:33 The web connecting the Trump administration to Russia 0:49 Trump names Alexander Acosta as pick for Labor Secretary 2:01 Venezuelan military officials discuss using snipers against protesters 1:06 Protesters force tank's retreat in Caracas 1:20 Miami attorney compares legalizing medical marijuana to legalizing pedophilia 0:49 Westminster Christian wins fourth softball championship 2:35 Beckham group unveils new stadium plan 2:11 Wyclef returns to Little Haiti promising a weekend of surprises Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Yates on Flynn: ‘The National Security Adviser, essentially, could be blackmailed by the Russians’ Former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates said that Gen. Michael Flynn misled Vice President Mike Pence with false information and created a “compromised situation" during her testimony on the Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. C-SPAN In congressional testimony, the acting FBI director, Andrew G. McCabe, has confirmed the existence of a “highly significant” investigation into possible collusion between Trump’s associates and Russian operatives to sway the presidential election. The pace of the investigations has intensified in recent weeks, with a veteran espionage prosecutor, Brandon Van Grack, now leading a grand jury inquiry in Northern Virginia that is scrutinizing Flynn’s foreign lobbying and has begun issuing subpoenas to businesses that worked with Flynn and his associates. The New York Times has reviewed one of the subpoenas. It demands all “records, research, contracts, bank records, communications” and other documents related to work with Flynn and the Flynn Intel Group, the business he set up after he was forced out as chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014. The subpoena also asks for similar records about Ekim Alptekin, a Turkish businessman who is close to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and is chairman of the Turkish-American Business Council. There is no indication that Alptekin is under investigation. Signed by Dana J. Boente, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, the subpoena instructs the recipient to direct any questions about its contents to Van Grack. Van Grack, a national security prosecutor based at the Justice Department headquarters in Washington, has experience conducting espionage investigations. He prosecuted a businessman for illegally exporting thousands of sensitive electronics components to Iran and a suspected hacker in the Syrian Electronic Army. In 2015, he prosecuted a Virginia man for acting as an unregistered agent of Syria’s intelligence services. According to people who have talked to Flynn about the case, he sees the Justice Department’s investigation as part of an effort by the Obama administration and its holdovers in the government to keep him out of the White House. In his view, this effort began immediately after the election, when President Barack Obama, who had fired Flynn as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told Trump that he would have profound concerns about Flynn’s becoming a top national security aide. The people close to Flynn said he believed that when that warning did not dissuade Trump from making him national security adviser, the Justice Department opened its investigation into his lobbying work. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid angering Justice Department or White House officials. The investigation stems from the work Flynn did for Inovo BV, a Dutch company owned by Alptekin, the Turkish businessman. On Aug. 9, Flynn and the Flynn Intel Group signed a contract with Inovo for $600,000 over 90 days to run an influence campaign aimed at discrediting Fethullah Gulen, an reclusive cleric who lives in Pennsylvania and whom Erdogan has accused of orchestrating a failed coup in Turkey last summer. When he was hired by Alptekin, Flynn did not register as a foreign agent, as required by law when an American represents the interests of a foreign government. Only in March did he file a retroactive registration with the Justice Department because his lawyer, Robert K. Kelner, said that “the engagement could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.” Trump campaign officials first became aware of a problem with Flynn’s business dealings in early November. On Nov. 8, the day of the election, Flynn wrote an op-ed in The Hill that advocated improved relations between Turkey and the United States and called Gulen “a shady Islamic mullah.” “If he were in reality a moderate, he would not be in exile, nor would he excite the animus of Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his government,” the op-ed said. Days later, after an article in The Daily Caller revealed that the Flynn Intel Group had a contract with Inovo, a Trump campaign lawyer held a conference call with members of the Flynn Intel Group, according to one person with knowledge of the call. The lawyer, William McGinley, was seeking more information about the nature of the group’s foreign work and wanted to know whether Flynn had been paid for the op-ed. McGinley now works in the White House as Cabinet secretary and deputy assistant to the president. The Justice Department also took notice. The op-ed in The Hill raised suspicions that Flynn was working as a foreign agent, and in a letter dated Nov. 30, the Justice Department notified Flynn that it was scrutinizing his lobbying work. Flynn hired a lawyer a few weeks later. By Jan. 4, the day Flynn informed McGahn of the inquiry, the Justice Department was investigating the matter. Kelner then followed up with another call to the Trump transition’s legal team. He ended up leaving a message, identifying himself as Flynn’s lawyer. According to a person familiar with the case, Kelner did not get a call back until two days later, on Jan. 6. Around the time of Flynn’s call with McGahn, the FBI began investigating Flynn on a separate matter: phone conversations he had in late December with Sergey I. Kislyak, Russia’s ambassador to the United States. Current and former U.S. officials said that, on the calls, Flynn discussed sanctions that the Obama administration had imposed on Russia for disrupting the November election. After news of the calls became public, Flynn misled Pence about what he had discussed with Kislyak, telling him that the two had only exchanged holiday pleasantries. Days after the inauguration, Yates, the acting attorney general, spoke with McGahn at the White House, telling him Justice Department lawyers believed that Flynn might be vulnerable to Russian blackmail. Since the Russians knew that Flynn had lied to the vice president, she said, they might have leverage over him.

Aaeon’s Nano-002N follows its Intel 5th Gen “Broadwell” based Nano-001N, which has an identical 150 x 125 x 55mm footprint, and is similarly powered from a Nano-ITX mainboard. The fanless mini-PC, which runs on dual-core, 15W 6th Gen Core “Skylake” U-Series processors, also has many of the same features. However, it breaks out with a pair of M.2 slots, among other changes. Nano-002N, front and back (click images to enlarge) Like the Nano-001N, the Nano-002N has two video ports, but it changes from DisplayPorts to similarly 4K ready HDMI ports. The previous two USB 2.0 ports are gone, but you still get 4x USB 3.0 ports, and the RS-232 header has morphed into a DB9 port for easier accessibility. The biggest change, however, is the replacement of the earlier mini-PCIe slot with two M.2 expansion slots. One defaults to mSATA, and is supported with optional 64GB or 128GB SSDs, and another defaults to PCIe, and is backed up with 4x antenna connectors. Nano-002N detail views (click images to enlarge) Once again, you can load up to 16GB RAM, and the Nano-002N advances to faster DDR4. The mini-PC is further equipped with dual GbE ports, audio jacks, a watchdog, and various buttons and LEDs. The VESA-mountable system again features a 12V-19V DC input. Fedora 22 is available for Linux lovers, and there are also a few Windows choices. No ruggedization features are available on the 0 to 40°C system, unlike Axiomtek’s Skylake based eBOX670-891-FL and eBOX565-500-FL mini-PCs. Specifications listed for the Nano-002N include: Processor — Intel 6th Generation “Skylake” U-Series dual-core processors, all with 15W TDP: 2.6GHz/3.4GHz Core i7-6600U 2.4GHz/3.0GHz Core i5-6300U, 2.3GHz Core i3-6100U 2.0GHz Celeron 3955U Memory — Up to 16GB DDR4- RAM (2133/1867 MHz) via 2x SODIMMs Storage — mSATA via M.2 2280 slot (see below) with optional 64GB or 128GB SSD Display — 2x HDMI 1.4 ports at up to 4096 x 2160 @ 24Hz Networking — 2x Gigabit Ethernet ports with WoL and PXE (Realtek 8111G) Other I/O: 4x USB 3.0 ports Audio line-out, mic-in jacks (Realtek ALC887) RS-232 serial port Expansion — M.2 2280 M-Key slot (PCIex4+mSATA); M.2 2230 E-Key slot (PCIe+USB) Other features — VESA mounting; LEDs; power button; reset switch; 4x WiFi antenna mounts; watchdog; fan connector; HW monitoring Operating temperature — 0 to 40°C Power — 12V-19V DC input; optional 60W adapter and regional power cords Lithium battery Dimensions — 150 x 125 x 55mm (with 120 x 120mm Nano-ITX mainboard) Operating system — Fedora 22; Windows 10/7/8.1   Further information No pricing or availability information was provided for the Nano-002N.

The Legion Y920 is a VR-ready system equipped with a 17.3-inch FHD (1,920 x 1,080 resolution) display utilizing Nvidia’s G-Sync technology. It’s powered by Intel’s seventh-generation Core i7-7820HK quad-core (eight-thread) processor clocked at 2.9GHz (Turbo up to 3.9GHz) alongside 16GB of RAM and Nvidia GTX 1070 discrete graphics. A 512GB solid-state drive is used as the primary drive although there’s also a 1TB traditional hard drive for less performance intensive / storage purposes. Lenovo’s latest also includes a mechanical keyboard with RGB lighting, dual 2W JBL speakers with 3W subwoofer, 720p webcam, Killer Wireless-AC 1535 and Killer LAN, a 6-cell, 90Wh battery and more. Connectivity-wise, you get four USB 3.0 ports, Thunderbolt 3, HDMI, a DisplayPort, Bluetooth 4.0 and a 6-in-1 card reader. Be prepared to do some heavy lifting, however, as the Y920 isn’t exactly lightweight at 10.14 pounds. Then again, that’s par for the course as high-end gaming laptops aren’t synonymous with being lightweight. It measures 16.7 inches by 12.4 inches by 1.41 inches and is primarily constructed of ABS plastic. The Lenovo Legion Y920 starts at $2,699.99 and will be available online from June.

Friday, May 19, 2017 Latest: Once Shunned, Bulgaria’s United Patriots Joins Governing Coalition – Analysis Honduras: A Country That Prioritizes Profit Over Indigenous Rights – Analysis T-Shirt Monitors Wearer’s Breathing Rate In Real Time Resurrecting Identities In The Andes Jordan, Not Israel, Was Original Intelligence Source For ISIS Bomb Plot – OpEd Eurasia Review A Journal of Analysis and News News Opinion Analysis Business Social Religion Entertainment Environment Technology About Editorial Staff Authors and Partners Contact Submit an Article Buzz Future Privacy Policy And Terms Of Use 1 Analysis  Covering Russia: What CNN And Fox News Media Review Shows Omit – Analysis May 19, 2017 Michael Averko 0 Comment Donald Trump, Foreign Policy, Intelligence, Israel, Judaism, Media, Politics, Russia, United States By Michael Averko US attitudes towards Russia bring to mind the overall poor coverage of that country on the leading American TV news networks. A certain preferred slant regularly gets the upper hand. This month has seen some occurrences of that ongoing trend, which don’t (at least for the most part) get reviewed on the Sunday morning aired Fox News show “Media Buzz“, hosted by Howard Kurtz, and its CNN rival (aired at the same time) “Reliable Sources“. RT picked up on the Fox News utilized “Democratic strategist” Julie Roginsky in a bully pulpit segment, where she stated a series of negatively inexact comments against Russia. In response, some of the posted comments at the online RT piece in question, derisively noted her Jewish former Soviet background. At play are some stereotypes which aren’t accurate. In some circles especially, the anti-Jewish posted comments will conjure up the inaccurate image of Russia as a Jewish unfriendly place – never minding the noticeable number of Jews who’ve returned to Russia from Israel and elsewhere, as well as the Jews inside and outside Russia who’ve a positive image of Europe’s largest country. This observation isn’t intended to gloss over past discriminatory instances and some (stress some) present negatives in Russia (as if other countries are so pristine.) Rather, it’s to put things in a truer perspective. Keep in mind that the ethnicity and nationality of the commenters isn’t known. RT’s English version is primarily geared to an English speaking audience outside Russia. RT’s staff is multi-national, with a strong non-Russian contingent. It’s not out of line for a pro-Russian advocate to respectfully caution RT on which posted comments get approved. Comments deemed as bigoted and associated with RT (in one form or another) don’t help that network’s reputation, which has been unfairly portrayed as is. Roginsky, Masha Gessen and Julia Ioffe don’t represent all Jewish people with roots from the former USSR. Relying mainly on US mass media can subconsciously influence perceptions. US mass media focuses on the negatives in Russia. Hence, there’s a top heavy reliance on anti-Russian leaning sources, regardless of their ethno-religious origin. Over the years, I’ve had numerous discussions with Jewish people from Brighton Beach (and elsewhere in the US) with former Soviet roots, who differ with the preferred US mass media slant. Likewise with those having a non-Jewish former Soviet and/or former Russian Empire background from other parts of the US – mostly ethnic Russians and ethnic Ukrainians, as well as those of mixed backgrounds. On another matter, the May 15 Washington Post (WaPo) article, claiming that Donald Trump faultily gave Intel to Russians at his recent Oval Office meeting with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak, drew much coverage on Fox News, MSNBC and CNN. In an exchange with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, longtime Vermont Democratic Senator Pat Leahy, conveyed apprehension about that claim. Shortly thereafter on Fox News, Laura Ingraham, expressed astonishment that Tennessee Republican Senator Bob Corker, appeared more willing to believe The WaPo story than Leahy. Later on in the evening, CNN’s Jim Sciutto suggestively gave a kudos to Corker. Sciutto carrying on as such is no surprise given his track record. Ingraham shouldn’t be so amazed. Corker is very much a foreign policy establishment type, as evidenced by the suggestive approval he received from Sciutto. Leahy has ample reason to second guess the latest WaPo story in question. Recall the not so distantly hyped WaPo story which (as later revealed) had erroneously claimed that Russia hacked the power grid in Leahy’s home state. CNN was all over that story until it was shown to be a nothing burger. I don’t recall this matter noted on the weekly CNN media review show hosted by Brian Stelter. The following day (May 16) saw the claim that Israel was the Intel source which Trump (as claimed) gave to the Russians. Very much downplayed are the very high level Russian-Israeli discussions over the past few years, which have been known to involve Intel matters. The heavily influenced neocon/neolib US mass media is prone to not second guess some questionable claims that don’t fit their preference concerning Russia related matters. Don’t be surprised if the spin on Trump compromising a US ally turns out to be bloated sensationalism, as seems true with some earlier instances. During a May 10 Brian Williams hosted MSNBC segment, Ioffe brought up how happy Trump looked with Lavrov and Kislyak, in comparison to Trump’s meeting with Angela Merkel. Hint: the Russian government has people who aren’t such ogres when compared to their Western counterparts. Merkel downplays the level of violent nationalism and corruption in Kiev regime controlled Ukraine – contrasted with her pious scorn against Russia. Besides this ethical inconsistency, perhaps Merkel isn’t as interesting and enjoyable a guest as Lavrov and/or Kislyak. In any event, it’s problematical to pursue better relations with Russia, when one is criticized for appearing friendly with that nation as others (like the US UN Ambassador Nikki Haley) carryon in an opposite manner, with limited high profile criticism. Former Soviet spy Jack Barsky is making the rounds on CNN and MSNBC. He doesn’t offer much, if anything, in terms of new and interesting insight. His clear purpose is to (supposedly) show how present day Russia and the USSR are much the same. In actuality, there’re noticeable differences that include savvy Russians (government affiliated and otherwise) who don’t shy away from the likes of Sciutto and Blitzer. A truly fair and balanced mass media would feature the intelligent opposites to Barsky, Ioffe and Michael McFaul. The former grouping include some folks who aren’t regular JRL (Johnson’s Russia List) court appointed Russia friendlies.

Andrew Cuomo's highly touted, billion-dollar Global 450mm Consortium is headed for the auction block. Back in the fall of 2011, Cuomo stunned the high-tech world by announcing he had convinced the world's largest computer chip companies to research next-generation chip manufacturing at SUNY Polytechnic Institute in Albany as part of a five-year, $4.8 billion program. The centerpiece of the deal was the $1 billion, Global 450mm Consortium, or G450C, an unprecedented collaboration between competitors Intel, GlobalFoundries, Samsung, IBM and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to figure out how to make the chips using 450 millimeter — 18-inch — silicon wafers instead of the current standard of using 300 mm, or 12-inch, wafers. But the G450C never attained its lofty goals. The industry postponed the move to 450mm manufacturing in favor of getting more efficiencies out of 12-inch wafers. The Research Foundation for SUNY, which manages grant money for SUNY schools, disclosed in recently released audited financial statements that it is looking to repurpose the G450C's equipment — known in the industry as tools — or sell them to the highest bidder. The Research Foundation says the remaining G450C equipment has a "book value" of nearly $115 million. "Management expects to utilize the G450C's equipment to the extent it can be deployed in other existing programs," the foundation disclosed. "However it is expected that a portion of the equipment will be sold to third parties during fiscal 2017." State officials previously hoped the program would make the Capital Region the epicenter for next-generation chips. They also predicted that when the industry was ready to build the first 450 millimeter chip factories, they would be built in upstate New York to be close to research and development. New York state promised $200 million to the G450C, with the industry promising another $800 million, including $75 million from each of the five participants. SUNY Poly also built a special building for the G450C, the $365 million NanoFab X building that once hosted President Barack Obama and was designed to house the massive multi-million dollar machinery, or tools, that would be needed to process 18-inch silicon wafers. When funding for the G450C officially ended in December, the consortium quietly disbanded amid the high-profile bid-rigging scandal that had engulfed SUNY Poly earlier in the year. Now the state is doing the best that it can to recoup its original investment. Paul Kelly, SUNY Poly's associate vice president for consortia and initiatives, said the process of selling equipment would begin soon. "With the wind down of the G450C as a result of industry consensus pushing reliance on 450mm wafers to the future, SUNY Poly is working with companies to maximize our return on investment in the equipment and tools that were purchased to run the program," Kelly said. "We are still exploring all of our options and expect the process to begin in a few weeks." lrulison@timesunion.com • 518-454-5504 • @larryrulison Most Popular 1 Great news: Mexico offers to pay for Trump’s impeachment 2 Drunken driver napped in grass outside State Police Academy,... 3 Lauded rocker Chris Cornell killed himself by hanging 4 'Most provable murder case' ends in Albany plea deal 5 Relatives populate Albany county, city governments 6 High winds drop wires, trees, cause 34,000 local outages 7 Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell dies at age 52 in Detroit View Comments © 2017 Hearst Communications, Inc.

Republican Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina had to retract a statement made hours earlier that Flynn's lawyer had told the committee he would not comply with the subpoena. Legal experts say it's unlikely Flynn would agree to turn over the personal documents because he would be waiving his constitutional protection against self-incrimination by doing so. Flynn, though his lawyer, had earlier asked for immunity from "unfair prosecution" in exchange for agreeing to cooperate with the committee. Flynn's attorney Robert Kelner did not respond to phone messages and emails seeking comment. The Senate committee is one of several on Capitol Hill investigating possible collusion between Russia and President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign. Flynn is also the target of other congressional investigations as well as an ongoing FBI counterintelligence probe and a separate federal investigation in Virginia. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, was fired from his position as Trump's national security adviser in February. At the time, Trump said he fired Flynn because he misled senior administration officials, including the vice president, about his contacts with Russian officials. The Senate committee issued the subpoena for Flynn's records on May 10 after he declined to cooperate with an April 28 request for documents. That request was similar to ones received by other Trump associates, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, Trump associate Roger Stone and former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page, a person familiar with the Senate investigation said. That person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential details of the committee's investigation. Page and Stone shared copies of their request letters with The Associated Press. Those letters sought a wide array of electronic and paper records related to any contacts made between people affiliated with the Trump campaign and Russian officials and businesses. Emails, text messages, letters, phone records and information about financial and real estate holdings associated with Russia were among the information requested by the committee. Nina Ginsberg, a veteran Washington defense attorney with extensive experience in national security cases, said that without an ironclad immunity deal from the committee, Flynn would be exposed to questioning from investigators about any personal documents he gave up. Providing those records to the committee would provide authorities with "a lot more information and the legal basis for questioning him about them," she said. Opening himself up to questioning from Senate investigations would be risky for Flynn given his current legal troubles. Flynn has been under scrutiny from the Justice Department since at least Nov. 30, when the department's Foreign Agent Registration Act unit sent him a letter questioning whether he needed to register as a foreign agent for lobbying work he performed for a Turkish businessman. The letter and initial stories on Flynn's lobbying were first reported by The Daily Caller. Flynn signed a $600,000 contract last August with a Turkish businessman, Ekim Alptekin. The contract called for Flynn's company, Flynn Intel Group, to gather information on a Turkish cleric living in the United States with the aim of getting a criminal referral against him. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has blamed the cleric, Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, for a failed coup attempt last summer and has pressured the U.S. to extradite him. The U.S. has rebuffed those calls. Flynn Intel was paid only $530,000 for the work, which ended in November after Trump's election victory. The day of the election, Flynn published a pro-Turkish op-ed, which railed against Gulen, in The Hill newspaper. Flynn has denied the op-ed was related to his Turkish work. The op-ed prompted scrutiny by the Justice Department, and now a full-fledged federal investigation. According to a U.S. official, authorities in the Eastern District of Virginia are examining Flynn's paid foreign consulting work last year for the Turkish-owned company while he was advising Trump's presidential campaign. The official was not authorized to discuss the probe and requested anonymity. The existence of the investigation was first confirmed by CNN, which reported that federal prosecutors recently sent grand jury subpoenas to Flynn associates and contractors who worked with his firm. Alptekin told the AP in an email that he is not a target of the investigation and has not been contacted by authorities. Amid Justice interest, Trump formally chose Flynn as his national security adviser. As the AP reported in March , an attorney for Flynn told Trump's presidential transition team — including now-White House counsel Don McGahn — that Flynn might have to register as a foreign agent. After Trump's inauguration, Flynn's representatives told the White House counsel that Flynn, who was already serving as national security adviser, would be registering with the Justice Department. Flynn finally registered in March, acknowledging his work could have benefited the government of Turkey. The White House has confirmed Flynn's attorney contacted the transition and the counsel's office about his possible foreign agent registration. But a White House official has said McGahn and others were not aware of the full details of Flynn's Turkish work. Flynn is separately being investigated by the Defense Department's inspector general. That inquiry is looking into whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. The top Democrat and Republican on a House oversight committee have said Flynn likely broke federal law by failing to get approval from the U.S. government to accept foreign payments, including $33,000 in 2015 from RT, Russia's state-sponsored television network. RT has been branded a propaganda outlet by U.S. intelligence officials. Stay Informed Subscribe to our politics newsletter. Email Address* Zip Code See our Privacy Policy. Must be age 13.

Home Archives Ed Morrissey Show Newsletters   Chaffetz: Do we even know Comey has memos? posted at 2:01 pm on May 18, 2017 by Ed Morrissey Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES “I don’t know that a special counsel is warranted at this point,” House Oversight chair Jason Chaffetz told George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s Good Morning America, although Chaffetz calls Robert Mueller “an excellent choice” for the position. Stephanopoulos asks how he can support Mueller but oppose the naming of a special counsel at all, especially after Donald Trump’s firing of James Comey and the reports of his memo about their meeting in February, in which Trump asked if Comey could let Flynn off the hook. Chaffetz then points out that the investigation has continued despite Comey’s removal, and called into question whether the memo exists at all, and what it actually means: ABC Breaking News | Latest News Videos “I think in the light of day in a public setting he should be able to tell us about the materials, if they’re there, and I question whether or not they’re actually there,” he said, adding that he has yet to hear back from Comey about his request for public testimony, which he hopes to schedule for next week. According to a memo whose existence and content was first reported on by The New York Times on Tuesday and later confirmed to ABC by sources close to Comey, the former FBI director was asked in March by President Trump to drop the bureau’s investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Trump fired Comey as director last week. When questioned by “GMA” host George Stephanopoulos about his skepticism about the Comey documents, Chaffetz said, “Well nobody’s seen them. Even the reporter that did the story hasn’t seen them. Nobody that I know of, even the reporter, has not actually seen those documents. “I want to look at the information and hear from the person who actually wrote it [the memo in question],” Chaffetz said. “I think that’s the fair way Republicans and Democrats can look in the light of day in a public setting.” Comey is known to be an inveterate memo writer, so it’s almost certain to exist. Whether it says what it does and whether it carries the meaning assigned to it by others can’t be known until it’s produced publicly. Even the news outlets that did report on the memo did so blind, having no access to the memo itself but instead relying on others who related its meaning. That’s why Chaffetz and Senate Intel chair Richard Burr have requested that the FBI turn over all of Comey’s memos-to-file during his three-plus years as FBI director, both to see precisely what he claims Trump said and the context of Comey’s own self-reporting. There’s another reason to be skeptical that the memo says what the news media has reported, too. On May 3rd, almost three months after the meeting that Comey memorialized in the document, Senator Mazie Hirono (D-HI) asked him directly whether there had been any political influence on the FBI’s investigations. Comey said it would be a big deal if it had happened — but that it hadn’t: HIRONO: Yes. And so speaking of the independence of not just the judiciary but I’d like you to clarify the FBI’s independence from the DOJ apparatus. Can the FBI conduct an investigation independent from the department of Justice. Or does the FBI have to disclose all it’s investigations to the DOJ? And does it have to get the Attorney General’s consent? COMEY: Well we work with the Department of Justice, whether that’s main justice or U.S. attorney’s offices on all of our investigations. And so we work with them and so in a legal sense we’re not independent of the department of justice. We are spiritually, culturally pretty independent group and that’s the way you would want tit. But yes, we work with the Department of Justice on all of our investigations. HIRONO: So if the Attorney General or senior officials at the Department of Justice opposes a specific investigation, can they halt that FBI investigation? COMEY: In theory yes. HIRONO: Has it happened? COMEY: Not in my experience. Because it would be a big deal to tell the FBI to stop doing something that — without an appropriate purpose. I mean where oftentimes they give us opinions that we don’t see a case there and so you ought to stop investing resources in it. But I’m talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for a political reason, that would be a very big deal. It’s not happened in my experience. One can see why Chaffetz has some skepticism over the reports, and it’s not just from the sourcing of the stories. Had Comey considered Trump’s actions to be improper attempts to politically interfere with his probe of Michael Flynn, then not only would he have been duty bound to report it at that time to Congress, but he would also have had to answer Hirono’s direct question in the affirmative. That doesn’t mean that Trump’s suggestion wasn’t inappropriate (if it happened as reports say) but that even three months later Comey didn’t see it as an attempt at political interference. At this point, it doesn’t pay to jump to conclusions in any direction. Congressional committees have demanded the memos, and if they don’t get them, subpoenas will undoubtedly follow. Let those chips fall where they may, but from the evidence at hand, don’t get your hopes too high for a major bombshell … at least from that memo. Addendum: Chaffetz may not stick around long enough to run the probe on the House side. According to Politico’s Jake Sherman, Chaffetz has told colleagues that he’s leaving the House early after earlier announcing his intention to retire. The timing of his departure is still unclear.

Republican Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina had to retract a statement made hours earlier that Flynn's lawyer had told the committee he would not comply with the subpoena. Legal experts say it's unlikely Flynn would agree to turn over the personal documents because he would be waiving his constitutional protection against self-incrimination by doing so. Flynn, though his lawyer, had earlier asked for immunity from "unfair prosecution" in exchange for agreeing to cooperate with the committee. Flynn's attorney Robert Kelner did not respond to phone messages and emails seeking comment. The Senate committee is one of several on Capitol Hill investigating possible collusion between Russia and President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign. Flynn is also the target of other congressional investigations as well as an ongoing FBI counterintelligence probe and a separate federal investigation in Virginia. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, was fired from his position as Trump's national security adviser in February. At the time, Trump said he fired Flynn because he misled senior administration officials, including the vice president, about his contacts with Russian officials. The Senate committee issued the subpoena for Flynn's records on May 10 after he declined to cooperate with an April 28 request for documents. That request was similar to ones received by other Trump associates, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, Trump associate Roger Stone and former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page, a person familiar with the Senate investigation said. That person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential details of the committee's investigation. Page and Stone shared copies of their request letters with The Associated Press. Those letters sought a wide array of electronic and paper records related to any contacts made between people affiliated with the Trump campaign and Russian officials and businesses. Emails, text messages, letters, phone records and information about financial and real estate holdings associated with Russia were among the information requested by the committee. Nina Ginsberg, a veteran Washington defense attorney with extensive experience in national security cases, said that without an ironclad immunity deal from the committee, Flynn would be exposed to questioning from investigators about any personal documents he gave up. Providing those records to the committee would provide authorities with "a lot more information and the legal basis for questioning him about them," she said. Opening himself up to questioning from Senate investigations would be risky for Flynn given his current legal troubles. Flynn has been under scrutiny from the Justice Department since at least Nov. 30, when the department's Foreign Agent Registration Act unit sent him a letter questioning whether he needed to register as a foreign agent for lobbying work he performed for a Turkish businessman. The letter and initial stories on Flynn's lobbying were first reported by The Daily Caller. Flynn signed a $600,000 contract last August with a Turkish businessman, Ekim Alptekin. The contract called for Flynn's company, Flynn Intel Group, to gather information on a Turkish cleric living in the United States with the aim of getting a criminal referral against him. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has blamed the cleric, Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, for a failed coup attempt last summer and has pressured the U.S. to extradite him. The U.S. has rebuffed those calls. Flynn Intel was paid only $530,000 for the work, which ended in November after Trump's election victory. The day of the election, Flynn published a pro-Turkish op-ed, which railed against Gulen, in The Hill newspaper. Flynn has denied the op-ed was related to his Turkish work. The op-ed prompted scrutiny by the Justice Department, and now a full-fledged federal investigation. According to a U.S. official, authorities in the Eastern District of Virginia are examining Flynn's paid foreign consulting work last year for the Turkish-owned company while he was advising Trump's presidential campaign. The official was not authorized to discuss the probe and requested anonymity. The existence of the investigation was first confirmed by CNN, which reported that federal prosecutors recently sent grand jury subpoenas to Flynn associates and contractors who worked with his firm. Alptekin told the AP in an email that he is not a target of the investigation and has not been contacted by authorities. Amid Justice interest, Trump formally chose Flynn as his national security adviser. As the AP reported in March , an attorney for Flynn told Trump's presidential transition team — including now-White House counsel Don McGahn — that Flynn might have to register as a foreign agent. After Trump's inauguration, Flynn's representatives told the White House counsel that Flynn, who was already serving as national security adviser, would be registering with the Justice Department. Flynn finally registered in March, acknowledging his work could have benefited the government of Turkey. The White House has confirmed Flynn's attorney contacted the transition and the counsel's office about his possible foreign agent registration. But a White House official has said McGahn and others were not aware of the full details of Flynn's Turkish work. Flynn is separately being investigated by the Defense Department's inspector general. That inquiry is looking into whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. The top Democrat and Republican on a House oversight committee have said Flynn likely broke federal law by failing to get approval from the U.S. government to accept foreign payments, including $33,000 in 2015 from RT, Russia's state-sponsored television network. RT has been branded a propaganda outlet by U.S. intelligence officials. Stay Informed Subscribe to our politics newsletter. Email Address* Zip Code See our Privacy Policy. Must be age 13.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Entrepreneur Mahesh Lingareddy Joins SitterFriends as Investor and Advisor SAN FRANCISCO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–SitterFriends announced that Mahesh Lingareddy, founder of Soft Machines Inc (now owned by Intel) and founder of Smartron, an OEM and IOT company, joined SitterFriends as investor and advisor. SitterFriends, launching in June, aims to bring innovation to childcare, allowing parents to find help that is trustworthy, and affordable but also quickly accessible. A groundbreaking product in the childcare space, SitterFriends will allow parents to find their perfect match in a nanny but also feel at ease while the nanny provides care after the initial matching is done. We sat down with Mahesh to ask about his involvement with SitterFriends. How are you involved? I have a long standing relationship with the co-founders of SitterFriends Fahad Jalal, and Amit Jain. They worked with me when I was at Soft Machines, and because I believe in them, I wanted to get behind the team and their product. When they decided to go forward with SitterFriends I became one of the early investors in the company. I am also on the advisory board and meet with the key team members on a regular basis to discuss strategy, product and marketing. From CPU Design (Soft Machines) to Consumer Hardware (Smartron) to now childcare. Why the investment in a childcare company? Childcare and senior care are big markets in the US and around the world, largely untapped and fragmented. There is a lot of opportunity to bring both software and hardware innovation to solve some of the biggest problems in these markets, and I believe SitterFriends is going to do this. My involvement is largely due to my background in the consumer and industrial hardware. In the coming months the team will unveil some of the things we have been working on to make child care and senior care safer and richer leveraging various smart, sensor, IoT and AI technologies. Thank you Mahesh, for your input on SitterFriends.

In fact, the firm first showed it off at Mobile World Congress in February, although certain minor things have changed. This device is a detachable, meaning that you can remove the display from the keyboard. It's meant for those that work in the field, so you can drop it (MIL-STD-810G tested), or you can spill a can of Coke all over it and spray it off with a hose so it doesn't get sticky. You can also see from the image above that the touchscreen works with gloves on, so workers in the field can use it without removing their gear. The Toughbook 33 comes with four choices of processors, a Core i5 or i7, with either one available in Intel's sixth-generation Skylake or seventh-generation Kaby Lake variants. The reason for the Skylake availability is so you can downgrade to Windows 7 if you need to; however, all of these devices will ship with Windows 10. Obviously, all of the guts of the device are in the display, including two batteries, which can be hot-swapped, meaning that you can actually change the batteries in the field without ever having to power down the Toughbook. There are two different keyboards available, a slim one and a larger one with a handle; as you'd imagine, it gets a bit top-heavy with the Lite keyboard, but on the larger one, the handle actually pops out to make it more stable. It's clear that Panasonic put a lot of thought into the Toughbook 33, right down to the pins that connect the display to the keyboard. Unlike many devices with such connectors, those pins won't corrode, according to Panasonic. You can also spill water in there, although it's the one part of the device where you wouldn't want to let it collect. The Toughbook 33 starts at $3,649 for the set of the tablet and the keyboard, although just the tablet will also be available; according to the announcement from February, that will be $3,499. The device will be available later on this month.

Republican Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina had to retract a statement made hours earlier that Flynn's lawyer had told the committee he would not comply with the subpoena. Legal experts say it's unlikely Flynn would agree to turn over the personal documents because he would be waiving his constitutional protection against self-incrimination by doing so. Flynn, though his lawyer, had earlier asked for immunity from "unfair prosecution" in exchange for agreeing to co-operate with the committee. Flynn's attorney Robert Kelner did not respond to phone messages and emails seeking comment. The Senate committee is one of several on Capitol Hill investigating possible collusion between Russia and President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign. Flynn is also the target of other congressional investigations as well as an ongoing FBI counterintelligence probe and a separate federal investigation in Virginia. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, was fired from his position as Trump's national security adviser in February. At the time, Trump said he fired Flynn because he misled senior administration officials, including the vice-president, about his contacts with Russian officials. The Senate committee issued the subpoena for Flynn's records on May 10 after he declined to co-operate with an April 28 request for documents. That request was similar to ones received by other Trump associates, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, Trump associate Roger Stone and former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page, a person familiar with the Senate investigation said. That person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential details of the committee's investigation. Page and Stone shared copies of their request letters with The Associated Press. Those letters sought a wide array of electronic and paper records related to any contacts made between people affiliated with the Trump campaign and Russian officials and businesses. Emails, text messages, letters, phone records and information about financial and real estate holdings associated with Russia were among the information requested by the committee. Nina Ginsberg, a veteran Washington defence attorney with extensive experience in national security cases, said that without an ironclad immunity deal from the committee, Flynn would be exposed to questioning from investigators about any personal documents he gave up. Providing those records to the committee would provide authorities with "a lot more information and the legal basis for questioning him about them," she said. Opening himself up to questioning from Senate investigations would be risky for Flynn given his current legal troubles. Flynn has been under scrutiny from the Justice Department since at least Nov. 30, when the department's Foreign Agent Registration Act unit sent him a letter questioning whether he needed to register as a foreign agent for lobbying work he performed for a Turkish businessman. The letter and initial stories on Flynn's lobbying were first reported by The Daily Caller. Flynn signed a $600,000 contract last August with a Turkish businessman, Ekim Alptekin. The contract called for Flynn's company, Flynn Intel Group, to gather information on a Turkish cleric living in the United States with the aim of getting a criminal referral against him. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has blamed the cleric, Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, for a failed coup attempt last summer and has pressured the U.S. to extradite him. The U.S. has rebuffed those calls. Flynn Intel was paid only $530,000 for the work, which ended in November after Trump's election victory. The day of the election, Flynn published a pro-Turkish op-ed, which railed against Gulen, in The Hill newspaper. Flynn has denied the op-ed was related to his Turkish work. The op-ed prompted scrutiny by the Justice Department, and now a full-fledged federal investigation. According to a U.S. official, authorities in the Eastern District of Virginia are examining Flynn's paid foreign consulting work last year for the Turkish-owned company while he was advising Trump's presidential campaign. The official was not authorized to discuss the probe and requested anonymity. The existence of the investigation was first confirmed by CNN, which reported that federal prosecutors recently sent grand jury subpoenas to Flynn associates and contractors who worked with his firm. Alptekin told the AP in an email that he is not a target of the investigation and has not been contacted by authorities. Amid Justice interest, Trump formally chose Flynn as his national security adviser. As the AP reported in March , an attorney for Flynn told Trump's presidential transition team-- including now-White House counsel Don McGahn -- that Flynn might have to register as a foreign agent. After Trump's inauguration, Flynn's representatives told the White House counsel that Flynn, who was already serving as national security adviser, would be registering with the Justice Department. Flynn finally registered in March, acknowledging his work could have benefited the government of Turkey. The White House has confirmed Flynn's attorney contacted the transition and the counsel's office about his possible foreign agent registration. But a White House official has said McGahn and others were not aware of the full details of Flynn's Turkish work. Flynn is separately being investigated by the Defence Department's inspector general. That inquiry is looking into whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. The top Democrat and Republican on a House oversight committee have said Flynn likely broke federal law by failing to get approval from the U.S. government to accept foreign payments, including $33,000 in 2015 from RT, Russia's state-sponsored television network. RT has been branded a propaganda outlet by U.S. intelligence officials.

McClatchy first reported that Flynn had blocked the plan to arm the Syrian Kurds for an attack on Raqqa, the ISIS capital in Syria, a move that was opposed by the Turkish government, which Flynn had been paid $500,000 to represent.

The administration went back and forth with the Turks about the issue until December 2016, when Obama decided it was "the right thing to do," the official said. Since the implementation would extend past Trump's inauguration, Rice told Flynn of the decision in early January. Flynn told her not to move forward with the plan. He said he didn't trust the Obama administration's decision-making process and the Trump administration would undertake its own review of ISIS policy, according to the official. After Flynn was fired as national security adviser on Feb. 13, the Trump administration opted to arm the YPG after all. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn arrives to deliver a statement during the daily briefing at the White House in Washington on February 1, 2017. Carlos Barria / Reuters file The Obama White House was surprised Flynn opposed the plan to arm the YPG, according to two former Obama officials. The former Obama officials insist the review by Trump officials delayed the final encirclement and then assault on Raqqa, the ISIS capital, by anti-ISIS forces. Related: Obama Warned Trump Against Hiring Flynn, Say Officials A U.S. military official also said the decision slowed the assault on Raqqa, but not by much. Anti-ISIS forces would not have been ready to go into Raqqa in January. Now the city is encircled, but the Syrian Kurds still don't have the equipment they need to start moving into the city. "It certainly caused an operational slowdown, but not one that they can't recover from," the U.S. military official said. A lawyer for Flynn did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

According to lawmakers, Rosenstein confirmed that the bureau’s investigation into Russian interference in the election is no longer strictly a counterintelligence investigation — a kind of probe that does not normally result in charges — but also a criminal one. He also said he was aware President Trump intended to fire Comey prior to penning a memo that the White House later used as its justification for the dismissal.  Lawmakers emerged from the closed-door meeting painting a sober picture of the briefing. Sen. Chris CoonsChris CoonsRussia probes in limbo after special prosecutor announcement Overnight Defense: Trump hits back over special counsel | US bombs pro-Assad forces | GOP chairman unveils proposed Pentagon buying reforms Senators told of broadening Russia investigation MORE (D-Del.) described the mood in the room as serious and thoughtful. Across town, as lawmakers descended into a secure facility to receive the briefing, Trump was ripping the appointment of the special counsel as something that “hurts the country.” “I believe it hurts the country terribly, because it shows we’re a divided, mixed-up, not-unified country,” Trump told news anchors at a luncheon at the White House. But Republicans declined to echo the president’s outrage amid an increasingly bipartisan swirl of concern that the White House may have tried to interfere with the FBI’s investigation. "The president is entitled to his opinion, but we’re a nation of laws. ... The acting attorney general has the authority to appoint a special counsel and has done so,” Sen. Marco RubioMarco RubioSenators told of broadening Russia investigation Rubio on Trump's 'witch hunt' tweet: 'We're a nation of laws' The Democrats can be great again, here’s how MORE (R-Fla.) told reporters.  Rosenstein met with lawmakers for more than an hour, but apparently gave few details about the decision-making process for firing Comey, including the role of Attorney General Jeff SessionsJeff SessionsTrump White House feels under siege Senators told of broadening Russia investigation House votes to expand death penalty for police killings MORE, who instructed him to write the Comey memo, or any conversations he had with President Trump. “He declined to answer in any meaningful way questions about the process that lead to the decision to fire Jim Comey — the preparation of his memo, who told him [to write it],” Coons said, adding that he was asked whether he was directed to produce the memo multiple times. Sen. Mark WarnerMark WarnerRussia probes in limbo after special prosecutor announcement Senators told of broadening Russia investigation Intel panels: House, Senate Russia probes to proceed MORE (D-Va.), the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, added that Rosenstein “did not answer specifics on virtually any question that was asked.” But senators — in part reassured by the selection of former FBI director Robert Mueller as a special prosecutor — signaled they were willing to give forgive Rosenstein's tight-lipped stance if it was meant to protect the FBI's investigation. "As it became clear how little he was willing to talk about, it also became clear how broad this investigation that Mueller is about to undertake actually is," Sen. Chris MurphyChris MurphySenators told of broadening Russia investigation Special counsel appointment gets bipartisan praise Potential 2020 Dems look beyond Trump MORE (D-Conn.) told reporters.  Sen. Dick DurbinDick DurbinMueller to ask Congress to step back Russia investigations: report Russia probes in limbo after special prosecutor announcement Senators told of broadening Russia investigation MORE (D-Ill.), the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said, "there was some frustration” in the room. “People wanted questions answered ...[but] it's not unreasonable position for him to take. People were respectful and thankful he showed up. He showed up. He didn’t have to.” Democrats pointed to the role of Sessions as one of their top unanswered questions leaving the briefing. Sessions recused himself earlier this year from FBI’s investigation but was involved in the decision to fire Comey — a move Democrats argue violated his promise. “Many of us including myself asked that question,” Durbin said. “I can't square Sessions's recusal with his role in dismissing the person who was in charge of the investigation." Rosenstein will cross the Capitol on Friday to hold an identical meeting with House lawmakers. Democrats also want Sessions to meet with all senators during a separate closed-door briefing. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) told reporters that Rosenstein was concerned that any comments he made to senators in the closed-door briefing “would be made public to press, so therefore he felt limited in what he could say.” Lawmakers on the Intelligence and Judiciary committees reportedly expressed concerns during the meeting that Mueller’s appointment will interfere with Congress’s ability to investigate election meddling — and possibly preclude testimony by Comey. Multiple committees have been clamoring for Comey to appear on the Hill to describe both the circumstances surrounding his dismissal and answer questions about any interference in the FBI’s investigation by the White House. Coons called the impact of the appointment on Comey’s testimony “an open question.” Both the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees are conducting their own probes into Russian interference in the election. Congressional investigations often cede jurisdiction to any concurrent federal investigations — a coordinating process called “deconfliction.”  Rosenstein on Wednesday gave former FBI Director Bob Mueller control of not only the investigation into whether Trump campaign associates coordinated with Russia, but also any other matters that “may arise directly from the investigation” — like Comey’s dismissal. Asked about the potential that the competing investigation could limit who appears before their committee, Warner called it a "great question" but that he and Sen. Richard BurrRichard BurrRussia probes in limbo after special prosecutor announcement Overnight Defense: Trump hits back over special counsel | US bombs pro-Assad forces | GOP chairman unveils proposed Pentagon buying reforms Senators told of broadening Russia investigation MORE (R-N.C.) needed more information from Mueller.  “In many ways our purview is broader than what may be some of the Justice Department/FBI investigation," he added, defending the need to continue the congressional investigations.  There was one moment of levity in the breifing, lawmakers said. One senator reportedly asked Rosenstein, very gravely, “I insist that you answer the one question that is on all our minds: how do we appropriately pronounce your name?”  “Rosen-stine” is correct, he replied.

Inspired by the hard-working mobile professionals who have relied on the Toughbook brand for two decades, the Toughbook 33 2-in-1 detachable laptop delivers rugged mobility in a highly customizable package along with a generation of backward compatibility for mobile professionals.

Lets make something clear: Nothing has expired in March 2017! Except so called capture period. And this "capture period" is used solely to define "patents" that the Nv/Intel Agreement is dealing with: "Patents" shall mean all classes or types of patents [...] to which such entities have the right to grant licenses [...] and have a first effective filing date during the Capture Period. In other words, any patent that is filled after March 31. falls outside the scope of the Agreement. That's all that happened at March 31. Under the patent cross license agreement [...] NVIDIA has granted to Intel and Intel's qualified subsidiaries, a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license [...] to all patents that are either owned or controlled by the parties at any time that have a first filing date on or before March 31, 2017. The term of the patent cross license agreement continues until the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed patents. Which effectively means that any patented technology that Intel is currently using for its built-in GPUs, it will be able to continue to use until the terms of the patents expire, which for recently granted patents, could be 20 years from now. http://investor.nvidia.com/secfiling...34&cik=1045810 Last edited by Noisiv; Yesterday at 15:07.     Noisiv View Public Profile Find all posts by Noisiv   (#3) icedman Master Guru     Videocard: MSI gtx 980 gaming 4g Processor: I7 3770k@4.2ghz delidded Mainboard: P8Z77-VLK Memory: 24gb 1866mhz corsair Soundcard: sound blaster audigy PSU: thermaltake 850w Yesterday, 22:27 | posts: 615 | Location: Ontario Canada That's really a shame looks like Intel will always suck in mobile when it comes to anything gaming related.     icedman View Public Profile Find all posts by icedman   (#4) Margalus Member Guru   Videocard: EVGA GTX 980 Ti FTW Processor: i7 6850k Mainboard: Asus X99 Deluxe Memory: 32GB Gskill 3200 DDR4 Soundcard: PSU: Corsair HXi850 Yesterday, 23:17 | posts: 112 | Location: St. Louis Quote: Originally Posted by icedman That's really a shame looks like Intel will always suck in mobile when it comes to anything gaming related.

The new devices won't require a phone or PC and will be made available to consumers later this year. But VR is a crowded space and Google will have to compete with Oculus, Intel, Samsung and others. According to IDC, global shipments of VR and AR headsets will increase from 10 million units in 2016 to nearly 100 million in 2021. Google's vice president of virtual and augmented reality Clay Bavor says the key technology here is the use of sensors, instead of external cameras or trackers, that makes the experience more realistic. These sensors pinpoint your location in the virtual environment using specific features, like bright dots or sharp corners, "which makes the view in the virtual world perfectly correspond with your motion in the real world, and it makes for a far higher sense of realism," Bavor explained. "Unless your view in the virtual world exactly corresponds exactly to how you're moving in the real world, when you see and feel different things it can be a little uncomfortable."

Burlington’s 93 degree afternoon reading smashed a previous high temperature for the date of 89 degrees.  Thursday’s warm-up brought safety advisories that apply for the next several weeks and months, and saw work to improve recreational fishing opportunities in Vermont this summer.  'Troubling': Lawmakers React to Alleged Trump Intel Sharing Burlington’s North Beach was busy Thursday afternoon, as groups of friends celebrated their college graduations.  “Mom, if you’re looking at this, I wore sunblock,” joked David Shektman, a recent graduate of St. Michael’s College.  'Cascading Crisis': Lawmakers React to Comey Memo Allegation Despite the sun and warm air Shektman and his buddies were enjoying, the water in Lake Champlain is still only in the mid-40s and will take weeks to gradually warm up to more comfortable levels.  The United States Coast Guard issued warnings to boaters, paddle boarders, and others, telling them that life vests are a must when participating in recreational activities on water that remains so cold.  Woman Charged With DUI, Child Cruelty After Crash A tumble into chilly water could mean hypothermia quickly, the Coast Guard warned, and a life vest could greatly improve chances of a successful rescue.  At the Central Vermont Humane Society in East Montpelier, shelter operations director Erika Holm was spreading another safety reminder.  Despite Unusual Heat, Some Vermonters Still Skiing She demonstrated with her thermometer how dangerously hot it can get in parked cars. Readings with her device on cars in the sunny parking lot ranged from 105 to 126 degrees, depending on their location, how long they sat parked, and whether they had windows cracked.  Those numbers should demonstrate why it is so critical for pet owners to ensure they do not leave their animals in parked cars on hot days, Holm said, because pets experience the heat even more intensely with their fur coats.  “It’s very serious and very quickly becomes serious, especially on a bright sunny day like today,” Holm said of the heat in parked cars. “So when it’s hot outside—with sun—it’s exponentially hotter inside [a vehicle].”  In Waterbury, a bucket brigade worked in the heat Thursday to prepare for all the other warm days still to come.  Volunteers helped the Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department add roughly 700 large rainbow trout to the Winooski River, aiming to boost summer recreation that connects families to nature.  “Vermont has endless opportunities when it comes to hunting, fishing, and going out wildlife watching,” said Adam Miller, the fish culture operations manager for the Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department. “Hopefully with this great weather, we’re going to see a lot of people going out into Vermont and having a good time outdoors.”  Miller said the state stocks approximately 1-million fish into waterways across the state, both to contribute to species conservation and to improve fishing opportunities that generate economic activity while boosting the public’s engagement with the natural world.  After two straight days of record-breaking heat, necn meteorologists say Vermonters can expect more typical temperatures over the next week.  Published at 5:33 PM EDT on May 18, 2017 Get the latest from necn anywhere, anytime Download the App Available for IOS and Android Follow necn Leave Comments TV Listings News Weather Politics Business Entertainment Sports Traffic Contact Us Connect With Us FCC Independent Programming Report FCC News and Information Programming Report NBC Non-Profit News Partnership Reports Send Feedback Terms of service Privacy policy © 2017 NBCUniversal Media, LLC.

By Lucas Mearian Senior Reporter, Computerworld | May 18, 2017 1:16 PM PT Credit: WDC More like this FAQ: 3D XPoint memory – NAND flash killer or DRAM replacement? WD releases its first 12Gbps SAS SSDs CW@50: Data storage comes into its own Video CW@50: 50 years of storage With data centers seeing rapid data growth, Western Digital Corp. (WD) has announced its highest performing 2.5-in. small form-factor SAS SSD. The drive is aimed at helping companies deal with increasing needs for virtualized storage systems, online transaction processing, database analytics and private and hybrid clouds. WD's Ultrastar SS300, developed in partnership with Intel, uses a 12Gbps SAS interface and sports sequential read/write speeds up to 2.1GBps and 2.05GBps, respectively; the drive also offers random read/write input/output per second (IOPS) of up to 400,000 and 200,000, respectively. "SAS SSD adoption continues to see strong growth across a variety of critical enterprise applications," said Gregory Wong, principal analyst at Forward Insights. "Western Digital's newest 12Gbps SAS SSD, the Ultrastar SS300, offers the optimum balance of performance, capacity and cost for the most demanding workloads," The drive is available with multi-level cell (MLC) NAND flash in capacities ranging from 400GB to 3.2TB, or triple-level cell (TLC) NAND flash available in capacities ranging from 480GB to 7.68TB. MLC NAND stores two bits and TLC stores three bits per transistor, requiring more sophisticated wear-leveling and error correction software while enabling greater densities. Users can choose the SSD in 9 Watt, 11 Watt or 14 Watt options, depending on their power requirements. The drive also takes advantage of Intel's 3D NAND technology, which stacks flash cells one atop another like microscopic skyscrapers, enabling vastly greater drive densities that drastically reduce production costs. The Ultrastar SS300 comes with four endurance choices that range from half a full drive write per day to 10 full drive writes in the same period. The Ultrastar SS300 also boasts a 0.35% annual failure rate (AFR) or 2.5 million hours mean-time between failure (MTBF), according to WD. For example, the 3.2TB version of the Ultrastar SS300 set at 10 full drive writes per day can endure up to 59 petabytes of random writes over its life. That's the equivalent of writing 16TB of data a day for five years. The Ultrastar SS300's predecessor -- the Ultrastar SSD1600MR -- offered up to three full drive writes per day for five years and had top sequential read/write speeds of up to 1100MBps and 700MBps, respectively. It delivered up to 130,000 random read and 30,000 random write IOPS. WD said it has significantly enhanced the Ultrastar SS300, particularly around random performance, gearing it specifically for the predominant applications used in environments such as virtualized storage systems, databases and private and hybrid cloud. The drive also offers a choice of data security options that include Instant Secure Erase, Self-Encrypting Drive capability that's compliant with the TCG Enterprise specification and FIPS 140-2 certification. The Ultrastar SS300 is shipping to equipment manufacturers only, and as a result, WDC isn't disclosing pricing. The company said the SSD will be available as an option from various partner vendors in support next-generation data center storage arrays.

The basic facts suggest a slow transition. The basic concepts represent a near-total reimagining of the way in which networks are configured. These new approaches must be superimposed onto networks for which they were not designed. A goal of SDN and NFV is to eliminate the need for expensive equipment. Network owners will not rip out what is already deployed until it is fully depreciated, however. This complicates matters. Sandra Rivera, the vice president and general manager for Intel’s Platform Services Group, told Fierce Wireless that virtualized rollouts became common in 2016. This year, she is quoted as saying, rollouts of SDN and NFV will happen at a “much, much higher rate” at telcos of all sizes. Perhaps one of the reasons that SDN and NFV are moving so quickly is that their main selling points are compelling. They enable the shifting of functionality, bandwidth allocations and network management parameters on a dime. These are valuable capabilities in their own right. They are also important precursors to the even bigger thing that comes next: All of that is foundational to 5G, with 5G acting as an accelerant for a lot of the service providers that want to move faster. If a service provider is trying to support the broad range of use cases that will be brought forward with 5G, like the ultra-low latency required for autonomous cars or remote telesurgery all the way to the low data rate required for the massive number of sensors in a smart city—all of that requires a great deal of agility. Another reason that the movement is gathering steam is that payoff is quick. AT&T CFO John Stephens told attendees of the MoffettNathanson Media and Communications Summit that the company virtualized 34 percent of its network last year and expects to hit its goal of 55 percent by the end of 2017. Stephens essentially said that the savings from virtualized parts of the network are financing the ongoing transition. The company has said that it will virtualize 75 percent of its network by 2020, which projects to operational savings of as much as 50 percent. The speed with which SDN and NFV is edging into the telecom landscape doesn’t mean that there are not significant challenges. Pipeline suggests that one of these will be supporting the hybrid networks that will dominate while the technology transitions. The story goes into great depths on the specifics of hybrid operational support system (OSS). The key issues are the need for cross-domain orchestration, integrating business support systems (BSS) and OSSes with emerging SDN and NFV platforms, and the maturation of NFV and SDN standards. SDN and NFV are dramatic technologies that modernize a very basic element of the network. Waiting weeks to make basic changes – and requiring the dispatch of trucks to do so – becomes a thing of the past. Capital costs are reduced in the bargain. The sales pitch is strong, and the transition figures to hit high gear this year. Carl Weinschenk covers telecom for IT Business Edge.

The Lenovo Flex 5 15-Inch offers upgraded 4K display technology for a better video watching experience. The Legion Y920 Gaming Notebook includes upgraded graphics cards, ports and processors to give gamers the best performance possible. The Lenovo Flex 5 and Lenovo Legion Y920 are just two of the revamped laptops that Lenovo revealed this week. The company also announced a slate of IdeaPad laptops with updated designs. The new Flex 5 and Legion Y920 add some power, but their designs have not changed a great deal. Lenovo Flex 5 has two new models, the Flex 5 14-Inch and the Flex 5 15-Inch. Flex laptops have special hinges for folding their displays over. They can be used as tablet replacements. These machines are still made of plastic to keep weight down, but they have narrower screen bezels that let users focus more on their videos. Precision touchpads make it possible to switch and minimize apps with a finger swipe. The Lenovo Flex 5 14-Inch. Every Lenovo Flex 5 can handle up to an Intel Core i7 processor, NIVIDIA GeForce 940MX processor, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. The ports on each model are the same too. They both have 1 USB Type-C port, 2 USB 3.0 ports, 802.11AC Wi-Fi, a web camera, Bluetooth 4.1, a memory card reader and a backlit keyboard. It’s up to buyers to add support for a digital pen, Lenovo says. The Flex 5 14-inch is the smallest of the two models. It has up to a 14-inch 1080p display and weighs just 3.9-pounds. Those that buy it don’t get the option to replace the HD display with a 4K display. It’ll cost shoppers $719.99 when it goes on sale later this month. The Lenovo Flex 5 15-Inch. It’s the Flex 5 15-inch that has a 15.6-inch 3840 x 2160 4K display option. 4K displays offer four times the amount of pixels that standard definition displays do. Netflix and Amazon offer 4K video that’ll truly make this laptop’s display shine. The Lenovo Flex 5 15-inch will sell for $829.99 beginning this May. The Lenovo Legion Y920 Gaming Notebook doesn’t have lots of options. Lenovo engineers designed it to offer the best video game experience possible. It only comes with the Intel’s 7th Generation Core i7 processor and 16GB of RAM. Buyers do get to decide what graphics card they want. The NVIDIA GTX 1070 graphics card is the most powerful option available. With this graphics processor, the Lenovo Legion Y920 becomes a pretty potent portal virtual reality gaming laptop. Buyers just have to buy a compatible headset separately. The Lenovo Legion Y920. Legion Y920 has a 17.3-inch 1080p display, Bluetooth 4.0, 4 USB ports, HDMI, Ethernet, a Display Port and media card reader. Every key on its mechanical keyboard has colored lights so that gamers can highlight only the keys that they need for a specific game. A Thunderbolt port makes it possible to quickly transfer photos and videos from a phone or external hard drive. Every key’s color is customizable. All the power that the Lenovo Legion Y920 provides comes at a cost. It weighs 10.14 pounds. Also, it’ll cost $2,699.99 when it begins shipping later this month.

Buy Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) Stock While It’s on Sale! 7 Blue-Chip Stocks That Are Due for a Reckoning Recent Posts: Broadcom Ltd (AVGO) Stock Is Poised for Long-Term Dominance Buy Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) Stock While It’s on Sale! 82 Blue Chip Trades to Make Right Away View All Posts Broadcom Ltd (NASDAQ:AVGO) is up 33% year-to-date, and there’s plenty of headroom left for AVGO stock to rise as this next iteration of technology expands. Source: Chris Hsia via Flickr Broadcom Ltd was formed last year when Avago Technologies bought Broadcom Corp for a whopping $37 billion. But this wasn’t the beginning of the mega mergers in the semiconductor chip space. Intel Corporation’s (NASDAQ:INTC) $17 billion merger with Altera in 2015 started the ball rolling, then it circled back this year as INTC bought Redeye for another $15 billion. Both of those deals still don’t match the size of the Broadcom link-up, but the point is size matters in the chip business moving forward. There are a number of reasons for this, but the keys to success in this low-margin business are being in the right sectors and having scale. For example, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) uses AVGO chips in its iPhones. Now, Apple is looking to add wireless charging as a feature on its latest models. That means AAPL needs an extremely reliable supplier that can deliver in the neighborhood of 80 million wireless charging chips. There are few chipmakers that can deliver on that kind of order. AVGO is now one of those. The company is also well-represented in the Galaxy S8, the flagship device of AAPL’s No. 1 competitor, Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF). Even before the merger with Avago, Broadcom was constantly buying smaller companies that could help it build out its capabilities. But, the big deals started happening when the chip sector was sluggish as buyers transitioned out of desktop computers and traditional networks and into the wireless space. These mergers happened when companies were cheap and larger firms made bets on the next generation of chip clients. Bottom Line for Broadcom and AVGO Stock With the growth of virtual reality and augmented reality, as well as the Internet of Things and smart cars, today’s chips are ending up in all manner of products, allowing them to do things that few had ever even conceived before. That means a greater demand for quality chips in large quantities. That theory is playing out in reality, too. AVGO reports earnings on June 1 and analysts are expecting that year-over-year quarterly growth will be nearly 16%. That’s a pretty big number, considering the economy isn’t even firing on all cylinders, yet. Add to that the recent $5.5 billion all-cash merger AVGO executed with Brocade Communications System Inc (NASDAQ:BRCD) to get a stronger hold on the networking storage business. AVGO is, by no means, resting on its laurels. There also has been talk that management is looking to buy Toshiba Corp (USA)’s (OTCMKTS:TOSYY) chip business as that giant tech firm liquidates assets to stay alive. The drivers are there. Expect plenty more out of AVGO stock before the year is through. Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

Lenovo’s Legion Y920 is proof of it: Announced Thursday, this new notebook is the company’s most powerful attempt yet to appeal to enthusiasts. Lenovo loaded this beefy 17-inch laptop with your choice of a Core i7-7700HQ or the Core i7-7820HK—Intel’s most powerful laptop chip. The GeForce GTX 1070 handles the Y920's graphics, paired with a 75Hz IPS 1080p G-Sync panel. Nvidia's powerful GPU should have no trouble pushing that display to its limits, and because the screen rocks Nvidia's G-Sync technology, you won't need to worry about tearing or stuttering in games. It looks like a recipe for a buttery-smooth gaming experience. Rounding out the Legion Y920's specs are an acceptable 16GB of DDR4 RAM and storage options that include a 512GB SSD plus a 1TB hard drive. [ Further reading: Our picks for best PC laptops ] Lenovo Lenovo’s Legion Y920 comes with a mechanical keyboard and per-key lighting. One of the Legion Y920's highlight hardware features can't be found on a spec sheet. This system marks Lenovo's debut into mixing mechanical keyboards with laptops. The Legion's keyboard features a 10-key pad and per-key RGB backlighting. There's another bonus: If you buy the laptop with the Core i7-7820K, pressing the Y920’s built-in “Turbo” key triggers a no-hassle factory overclock using the included Turbo Boost utility. Melissa Riofrio/PCWorld Lenovo's Legion Y920 laptop includes an overclocking utility for cranking it up responsibly.  Ports on the Y920 include full-size HDMI, DisplayPort, Thunderbolt, four USB 3.0 Type-A ports, an SD card reader, and gigabit ethernet. At 10.1 pounds, this laptop won’t win contests for portability, but gaming notebooks usually only move between the den and bedroom anyway. More important is how a system this large manages its cooling. More space should allow for a quieter experience. We ran a quick graphics load on the Legion Y920 to see how loud the fans would get, and the preliminary spot check indicates that it’s not bad. The noise level is far from silent, but the fan acoustics were reasonable under load. Lenovo The Legion Y920 is well-vented, which helps keep the fan noise down. The price isn't quite as reasonable, bucking Lenovo's reputation for giving gamers a lot of value. This notebook will set you back about $2,700 when configured as listed above—a heck of a lot more than other GTX 1070 notebooks like the Omen 17. HP’s laptop has an older Skylake quad-core and lacks the fancy keyboard, but it’s about $900 cheaper. Lenovo may intend to pit the Legion Y920 against Alienware’s 17 R4, which costs $2,400 when equipped with a similar load-out. Still, the Alienware 17 R4 is $300 cheaper. That much cash can buy a lot of games. Lenovo The Legion Y920 seems like a nice enough laptop, but it costs quite a bit more than its rivals.  To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

Chris Leckness10/01/2010 Is your data safe? With so many people using smart phones now, it’s only a matter of time before evil deeds begin to unravel. We trust our smart phones with so much private, sensitive info about our lives. We have all our friends and families contact data in there, many have their credit cards and passwords stuffed into notes and applications, banking apps legitimately transmitting your financial data. It’s really scary how much we can stand to share with the wrong folks if a malicious app mines our data. It might not be anything too serious right now, but an article on arstechnica paints a scary picture. The results of a study conducted by researchers from Duke University, Penn State University, and Intel Labs have revealed that a significant number of popular Android applications transmit private user data to advertising networks without explicitly asking or informing the user. This is quite shocking and scary to say the least. It brings back memories of an app earlier this year that was sending users cell numbers to a server in China. That might have been a big misunderstanding, but I’d be willing to be that a ton of developers would love to mine data from smartphones for their gain. The MMO gaming industry is full of scams trying to get into your game accounts to sell off your in game goods. Imagine what the marketing data from 1000’s of teens and young adults phones would fetch in the right market. This type of thing, harmless or not, is what makes Apple’s and soon enough, Microsoft’s closed OS more attractive. We complain about how Apple evaluates and scrutinizes each app submitted, but preventing something like this makes me feel better about the process. Would Apple’s reviewers actually catch something like this? I would hope so, but I suppose that some could make it through. With Android becoming more popular each day, thanks in part to Motorola and Verizon’s brilliant marketing, it becomes more of a target to hackers and viruses. So, according to arstechnica, these researchers developed an app called TaintDroid and proceeded to test 30 popular free Android apps. They found that half of the apps were sending private data to ad servers. This info included GPS data and phone numbers. They also reported that some of them were reporting as frequent as every 30 seconds. Imagine what that does to you phone’s battery. How can you protect yourself from these types of applications? Well, it’s not as simple as saying yes or no. I guess Google requires the developers to let the user know during installation that the app wants to use your location data, etc. The problem is, sometimes this request doesn’t seem out of line for the type app you are installing. I’ve never seen an app pop up a confirmation box that says, “AppX wants to share your phone number and GPS location with advertisers. Is this ok?”. I guess the best advice to protect yourself is to be careful. Don’t install apps from companies you do not trust. If an app that you know has zero reason to use your location info asks for permission to use it, run away. If you suddenly start experiencing less than average battery performance, evaluate the recent app additions and do some homework online. Maybe something you installed is sending data. I am sure more on this will come out soon since arstechnica says that these results are being presented next week at the Usenix OSDI conference. Update: Looks like Engadget has some new info regarding this report, including the list of apps and a corporate mumbo jumbo response from Google on the matter. 16 Responses 10/01/2010 Rob C Reply You would think a site that complains about the mis-reporting of the nonexistance of Windows slates would not conflate open source software with a (relatively) open ecosystem and market, versus a closed and tightly controlled ecosystem and market. Android is an open source operating system. The applications you’re complaining about ARE NOT open source software. If they were, one could inspect the source code & readily identify the privacy issues that concern you. One could even remive the offending bits and redistribute the new version. The open-ness you complain about really is nothing new (Windows is open in that sense, as well as Mac OS, as well as any web 2.0 app or any web site whose privacy statement you don’t read) and has NOTHING to do with open source software. Please, don’t perpetuate this musunderstanding. 10/01/2010 shauns Reply Honestly, this has nothing at all to do with open source. It happens on all mobile operating systems. It doesn’t matter whether you use Android, iOS, WP7 or anything else. Applications can and do collect and share data, on any OS. Sure, other than Google, Apple CAN prevent apps from doing this. But they don’t. Apple has even been collecting location data without the users’ knowledge (!) for years – long before they inroduced iAds. Apple may be quick to reject apps they don’t like, but their AppStore is equally full of “spy” apps. The best solution would be informing the user which data is collected and who it is sent to. Android (as opposed to other systems) at least shows what kinds of data an app CAN collect, but there should be a way to find out whether the data is sent to advertisers. 10/01/2010 Rob C Reply Q: Security Holes: Is this the cost of an open source Mobile OS? A: No 10/01/2010 Chris Leckness Reply Ok, maybe the title should have been: Security Holes: Is this the cost of an open ecosystem Regardless of what the title is, the facts still remain that transmission of user data without consent is no good. Shauns – Could you point me in the direction of a report that shows that some iPhone apps transmit data without the users knowledge? I am not saying that there are not apps that can and will, but I am fairly sure that no iPhone app is sitting their dormant pings your details out every 30 seconds or so since Apple won’t allow apps to run in the background. (not 100% sure how permissions are in iOS 4.x though) 10/01/2010 Rob C Reply No, not maybe. In fact, why haven’t you changed the title? It’s a factual error as a result of a writer being uninformedvin his own field, noy a matter of opinion. The type of thing you expect to seebin your local paper, not what purports to be a tech blog. It reminds me of an article I read in Byte during its dying days that referred to “IDE (integrated development enviromment) drives”. 10/01/2010 Mike Reply The title of this, as others have said, is ill conceived and reactionary. Having said that, I would like to see Google close such capabilities down. It would be nice if android (or any systems) had an easy to use logger that showed exactly which applications were transmitting and how much they were transmitting. It could also provide some specific areas of memory for storage of sensitive data and log what applications are accessing that and when. Something akin to a firewall which not only showed the information but allowed the blocking of such activity both for net transmission and for access to this restricted memory area. It would be a nice addition. 10/02/2010 Rob C Reply Since you’re such a stickler for the journalistic method and demand sources, Chris – wouldn’t want to get anything wrong or essentially rephrase what someone else said and slap a random headline on it – how about the study reference in this article from July: http://www.mobilemarketer.com/cms/news/research/6941.html Please note that this article makes no mention of open source nature of Android (because it’s irrelevant) and concludea that Google and Android provide better controls for how code accesses private data, which is important because the issue typically isn’t malevolent developers (are you really concerned about Evernote selling yor data to the mafia? Then perhaps you shouldn’t be using their service at all, because its very purpose is to store your personal and sensitive data on their servers.) Back to your headline and article: the study you originally referenced looked at Android. It didn’t look at Iphone apps and give them a clean bill of health. You drew your own conclusion based on speculation, essentially resatated it as fact, then put an inaccurate headline on it to not only drive your speculation home as fact, but to incorrectly drag the open source/closed source debate into it. Google open source software security and Windows vulnerabilities; educate yourself a little. Quoting from _More iPhone than Android apps can access sensitive user information_: The App Genome Project has scanned almost 300,000 applications and fully mapped close to 100,000 in order to understand how applications are interacting with personal data on phones and identify prominent security threats. So far, findings suggest that Android applications tap into sensitive data, such as contact lists, less often than comparable applications for the iPhone. … While more free Android applications (47 percent) include third-party code than comparable iPhone applications (23 percent), Lookout says that the permission model of the iPhone platform makes it easier for such code to cause applications to access sensitive data. 10/02/2010 Dale Lane Reply It’s been said in the comments already, but while the headline remains unchanged it’s worth another comment – the existence of spyware and malware for a platform has nothing to do with the platform being open source. There is a ton of spyware out there for Windows. Do we call Windows an open source OS now?

Burr initially said Flynn was not complying with a subpoena issued by the committee before quickly walking back his remarks to reporters. While Flynn "is not cooperating" so far, Burr said, he hasn't gotten a "definitive" answer from Flynn's lawyers. "I may have been premature," Burr said. "There may be a day or two left." Flynn's attorneys "have not yet indicated their intentions" on the subpoena, Burr said later in a statement released by his office, but he added, "I welcome their willingness to cooperate." Flynn's lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment or confirmation. ADVERTISEMENT The demand is for documents related to the committee’s investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election.  Flynn — the former national security adviser who was fired in February for misleading Vice President Pence and other White House officials about the contents of a December phone call with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak — has been under scrutiny for accepting payments from Russia and Turkey and allegedly misleading the government about them. Flynn had previously offered to testify before the Senate and House Intelligence committees — which are both investigating Russian interference in the election — in exchange for immunity, but it does not appear that either committee has accepted the offer. In April, the committee sent a series of requests to several former President Trump associates asking for records on any dealings with Russia — a request Flynn’s lawyers declined to cooperate with through counsel, sparking the subpoena.  Trump’s former foreign policy adviser, Carter Page, informal adviser Roger Stone and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort were also asked to provide documents. As of last week, the committee had received two responses, according to Burr. One of these, Page, is publicly known. Burr declined to reveal the second.   The letters asked for the men to list any meetings they might have had with Russian officials between June 16, 2015 — the day Trump formally launched his presidential campaign — and Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, as well as records of any communications during that period. The senators also want details on any financial assets or real estate holding tied to Russia and a broader list of meetings between any Trump campaign aides and Russians. In December 2015, Flynn was paid $45,000 to speak at an event hosted in Moscow by the Kremlin-backed network RT, during which he was seated with Russian President Vladimir Putin. He also received payments for additional speeches to Russian firms Kaspersky and Volga Dnepr. As a retired military officer, Flynn is prohibited under the emoluments clause of the Constitution from accepting payment from a foreign government without advance permission from both the secretary of State and the secretary of the Army. According to documents released by House Oversight Committee ranking member Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), Flynn did not disclose the RT payment when he applied to renew his security clearance in January 2016, just a month after he traveled to Moscow. Flynn’s lawyers have claimed that he briefed the Defense Intelligence Agency “extensively” both before and after the 2015 trip. — Jordain Carney contributed.

Breaking News 45 Congress Security The Nine Trumpmerica State Flynn rejected Obama's offer to arm Syrian Kurds, something Turkey would oppose By Elise Labott, Barbara Starr and Ryan Browne, CNN Updated 11:58 AM ET, Thu May 18, 2017 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. JUST WATCHED NYT: Flynn halted military plan Turkey opposed Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH NYT: Flynn halted military plan Turkey opposed 01:31 Washington (CNN)The Obama administration wanted the incoming Trump administration to sign off on a Pentagon plan to retake ISIS stronghold Raqqa by arming Syrian Kurdish forces because the operation would likely happen after Trump took office, according to former senior Obama administration and defense officials. Two former senior administration officials said it was retired Army Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, who rejected such a move, telling the Obama team that the Trump team first wanted to conduct its own review of an ISIS strategy. Fresh questions over Flynn add to White House turmoil One former US defense official explained to CNN the Obama administration offered to green light arming the Kurds during the transition in order to spare Trump the fallout with Ankara. At the time, this official had the impression Trump's people vetoed it because they wanted to do their own strategic review. The official did not speak to Flynn's role in this. Prior to Flynn making this decision, the Flynn Intel Group received $530,000 in payments from a Turkish-owned company based in the Netherlands and in March registered as a foreign agent with the Justice Department, acknowledging that the work may have benefited the Turkish government, according to foreign agent registration paperwork filed with the department. Flynn's firm was not compensated directly by the Turkish government. Flynn Intel had a contract with a Dutch firm, Inovo BV, a Dutch firm owned by a prominent Turkish businessman Kamil Ekim Alptekin.

MUST WATCH White House tries to manage controversies 04:12 Alptekin, the chair of the semi-official Turkish-American Business Council helped organize Turkish President Recep Erdogan's 2015 visit to Washington. In an email to CNN, Alptekin said that his firm works to strengthen "the transatlantic relationship and Turkey's future in that alliance." McClatchy newspapers was first to report that Flynn opposed the military operation to the Obama administration after recently lobbying for a Turkish owned firm. The decision to arm Syrian Kurds was something even the Obama administration struggled with in order to save the fragile US-Turkey relationship. Two Kurdish allies of the US -- the YPG and the Syrian Democratic Forces -- are enemies of Turkey. The Pentagon finally announced last week that Trump had authorized the limited arming of Syrian Kurds to help in the fight against ISIS in Raqqa, despite strong opposition from US NATO ally Turkey. A current senior defense official told CNN there was no delay in the military planning or operations to isolate Raqqa and continue to train local fighters. The official did not speak to Flynn's actions. Content by LendingTree Rates now at 3.12% APR (15 yr.) Do you qualify?

If you don’t have time for any of that and would rather stick with the traditional clamshell design, Lenovo has you covered with its refreshed line of mainstream IdeaPads. There are three IdeaPads being introduced today: the 320, 320S, and 720S. The standard IdeaPad 320 is the most basic device of the bunch. With two configurations – one with a 15.6-inch display and the other with a 17.3-inch one – you certainly have your options when it comes to size, especially considering that Lenovo is also offering a touch option in the 15.6-inch model. It sounds like there will be some degree of customization with this laptop, as Lenovo says that it will feature “up to” a 7th-gen Core i7 processor and “up to” 16GB of RAM. You can also opt to include a fingerprint scanner for use with Windows Hello and as much as 2TB of HDD storage. Here’s where the IdeaPad 320 begins to show its mainstream hardware, though, as there isn’t any options to add discrete graphics. You’ll have to settle for Intel integrated graphics you if opt for the 320, which still won’t be bad for most mainstream consumers. Like the standard 320, the 320S also comes with two display options. While you have your choice of 14-inch or 15.6-inch displays, it seems that your options actually decrease in some regards. For instance, you can only get up to 8GB of RAM with this model, though you can still include a 7th-gen Core i7 CPU if you so choose. In the 14-inch model, you’ll be limited to integrated graphics, but the 15.6-inch 320S comes with a NVIDIA GeForce 940MX. Finally we come to the IdeaPad 720S. Only available in a 14-inch configuration, this is still the cream of the crop. With all the same options you had before – including SSD storage – this notebook comes with a GeForce 940MX standard. Like the 320S, you’re looking at a 1080p IPS panel, along with options for up to a 7th-gen Core i7 and 16GB of RAM. While we see fairly standard hardware throughout all three, the main focus of the 320S and the 720S is design. Specifically, Lenovo designed these laptops with a narrow bezel that helps keep things thin, with an aluminum case present in the 720S. If you’re looking for a sleek, thin notebook, you’ll want to skip the standard 320 and opt for the 320S or 720S. All of these notebooks will be available beginning next month for a variety of prices. The standard IdeaPad 320 starts at $439.99 and $489.99 for the 15-inch and 17-inch models respectively. The IdeaPad 320S is holding down the mid-range, with prices starting at $739.99 for the 14-inch model and just $10 more for the 15-inch model. Finally, the IdeaPad 720S rounds out the group with prices starting at $969.99.

 Google's new cloud service shows increasing demand for the IoT Nicholas Shields May 18, 2017, 10:45 AM 796 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also The Internet of Everything — $12.6 trillion ROI expected over the next decade [SLIDE DECK] Microsoft brings IoT to the Edge THE INTERNET OF THINGS 2017 REPORT: How the IoT is improving lives to transform the world This story was delivered to BI Intelligence IoT Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Google has launched a new cloud-based service called IoT Core that enables its enterprise customers to manage their IoT devices, as well as collect and analyze the data those devices produce. IoT Core has access to all its data processing, analytics, and machine learning capabilities of Google's cloud and supports devices equipped with Intel, ARM, and Marvel processors. It's worth noting, however, that companies must manage IoT Core themselves, without assistance from Google. The service is currently available in preview mode with no stated release date. IoT Core marks Google's first major move into the enterprise IoT. Competing cloud providers Microsoft and Amazon carved out IoT-specific services based off their cloud offerings a while ago — Microsoft launched Azure IoT in September 2015 and Amazon released AWS IoT later that year. Until now, Google hasn't had a specially dedicated service to compete with those offerings. But it does now, and that means a large segment of Google's cloud customers could be looking to integrate the IoT into core segments of their businesses, and need the tools to manage, process, analyze, and store all the data that produces. But while the service could help Google play catch-up, it won't likely help it gain a lead over competing services quite yet. Here's why: Companies need help with IoT implementation and management. Forty-six percent of executives that are looking to deploy or have deployed an IoT solution cited system integration as a top challenge in implementing the IoT. That's because it's tough and expensive to manage all the devices, networks, software, analytics, and security protocols associated with implementing an IoT solution at scale, and many companies lack the resources to do so. IoT Core doesn't do that, but there are services from competitors that do. IoT Core can't manage a company's IoT deployments — it only helps companies manage their deployments themselves. Services from competitors, like Microsoft's IoT Central, which was announced late last month does exactly that. Google has a broad addressable base, which is advantageous, but it may not be enough to outweigh the cost savings and efficiencies that outsourcing IoT deployment and management brings. That could draw players to competitors rather than Google. The Internet of Things (IoT) is growing rapidly as companies around the world connect thousands of devices every day. But behind those devices, there’s a sector worth hundreds of billions of dollars supporting the IoT.  Platforms are the glue that holds the IoT together, allowing users to take full advantage of the disruptive potential of connected devices. These platforms allow the IoT to achieve its transformational potential, letting businesses manage devices, analyze data, and automate the workflow.

Two former senior administration officials said it was retired Army Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, who rejected such a move, telling the Obama team that the Trump team first wanted to conduct its own review of an ISIS strategy. One former US defense official explained to CNN the Obama administration offered to green light arming the Kurds during the transition in order to spare Trump the fallout with Ankara. At the time, this official had the impression Trump’s people vetoed it because they wanted to do their own strategic review. The official did not speak to Flynn’s role in this. Prior to Flynn making this decision, the Flynn Intel Group received $530,000 in payments from a Turkish-owned company based in the Netherlands and in March registered as a foreign agent with the Justice Department, acknowledging that the work may have benefited the Turkish government, according to foreign agent registration paperwork filed with the department. Flynn’s firm was not compensated directly by the Turkish government. Flynn Intel had a contract with a Dutch firm, Inovo BV, a Dutch firm owned by a prominent Turkish businessman Kamil Ekim Alptekin. Alptekin, the chair of the semi-official Turkish-American Business Council helped organize Turkish President Recep Erdogan’s 2015 visit to Washington. In an email to CNN, Alptekin said that his firm works to strengthen “the transatlantic relationship and Turkey’s future in that alliance.” McClatchy newspapers was first to report that Flynn opposed the military operation to the Obama administration after recently lobbying for a Turkish owned firm. The decision to arm Syrian Kurds was something even the Obama administration struggled with in order to save the fragile US-Turkey relationship. Two Kurdish allies of the US — the YPG and the Syrian Democratic Forces — are enemies of Turkey. The Pentagon finally announced last week that Trump had authorized the limited arming of Syrian Kurds to help in the fight against ISIS in Raqqa, despite strong opposition from US NATO ally Turkey. A current senior defense official told CNN there was no delay in the military planning or operations to isolate Raqqa and continue to train local fighters. The official did not speak to Flynn’s actions.

Leukert added that SAP is breaking down the barriers that hinder innovation by delivering an open, integrated and secure technology stack with SAP HANA as the stable core, proven cloud applications on SAP S/4HANA, and the new SAP Leonardo portfolio to intelligently connect people, things and processes. “The power of innovation is based on a modular feed of open, best-in-class cloud applications. SAP Leonardo is the next-generation digital innovation engine that empowers you to rapidly innovate at scale, reinvent processes and redefine your business,” said Leukert. “It’s fully integrated as only SAP can do. In this new world, technology becomes central and decisive for our economy, your business and society. Let’s invent, build, run and win together!” Speaking before a capacity crowd at the annual SAPPHIRE NOW + ASUG Annual Conference, Leukert demonstrated exactly how SAP is fundamentally embracing openness that delivers greater value to customers by accelerating innovation. “Openness is the game-changer, driving new business value,” he said. “Openness in every part of the company allows you to reach completely new levels of business process excellence. You can inject data and derive insights across every layer of your company, like traffic and other data into logistics, machine learning data into maintenance plans, and social data from your customer profiles.” Fast Access to Data that Turns into Action Emphasizing the importance of cloud-based computing to take full advantage of the digital business opportunity, Leukert punctuated his talk with a series of proof points demonstrating SAP’s innovation leadership. “Now is the time to run ERP in the cloud. SAP S/4HANA is a modern system that is always up-to-date and scales as you grow your business,” said Leukert. “It’s autonomous and intelligent, which makes for faster innovation. We are also opening up our cloud applications using APIs in a micro services architecture for seamless connectivity across business processes. We’ve developed machine learning innovations that are changing industries, like invoicing matching and SAP CoPilot, our digital assistant that’s fully aware of the user the business context. Thousands of partners are already innovating on the SAP Cloud Platform, building enterprise-grade applications that are using big data to extract insights for real-time business.” Leukert invited Diane Bryant, Group President, Data Center Group at Intel on stage, who projected 60 percent performance increases for SAP HANA workloads using the next generation Intel Xeon Processor. Diane Greene, Head of Google Cloud, Member of the Board of Directors at Alphabet, Inc., provided an update on results from the partnership between Google and SAP, showcasing Sovanta, the first shared customer using SAP S/4HANA hosted on the Google Cloud Platform. Dr. Wladimir Klitschko, Entrepreneur and Initiator of Challenge Management, brought an entirely new dimension to the conversation, reminding everyone that people are what matter most, and it’s possible to turn frustrations into positive outcomes. “It’s complicated ─we have to digitalize ourselves and our business,” he said. “You need to have a goal, understand the consequences if you don’t take the challenge, imagine how successful you’ll be when you reach your goal, and be obsessed with your goal. Obsession is love, and when you love something you’ll do anything to reach your goal.” SAP Transformation Navigator Delivers Road Map to Cloud Leukert reinforced SAP’s commitment to empathy, showing how the company has doubled down on innovation that supports the customer experience. Case in point was the launch of SAP Transformation Navigator which answers the most burning questions customers have about the fastest way to move to the cloud.  This new tool provides product and license recommendations based on a customer’s current SAP investments and unique business value requirements, offering services as well as a complete road map to the cloud. Machine Learning Changes Industries Ian Kimbell of SAP came on stage for two mind-bending demonstrations of the power of SAP Leonardo. The first showed how a power tool rental company could disrupt its business model. Kimbell turned on a connected drill that collected and analyzed live digital data from its sensors, helping the company better manage maintenance, extend the lifetime of these assets, and improve the customer experience with personalized services. The second demonstration brought virtual windmills from Norway on stage, calling up real-time data using SAP CoPilot to literally see where problems are, and through integration with SAP S/4HANA, locate and hire available technicians to fix it. It’s Easy to Get Started Sam Yen, chief design officer at SAP, explained how using SAP Leonardo Services, customers can move from vision to blueprint in just weeks. Design thinking identifies end-user needs, and predesigned templates with visualized feedback “heat maps” help even non-developers rapidly create prototypes and iterate solutions. “SAP Leonardo Services dramatically reduce the time it takes to make your digital transformation real with SAP,” said Yen. “Design Thinking and Leonardo Build break down the barriers between business users and developers, significantly lowering the cost of implementation,” said Yen.

By Matt Levy May 18, 2017 14 Print Article Qualcomm was once known as a major innovator, one of the prime developers of modern cellular technology. Now Qualcomm has become the Snidely Whiplash of the patent world, holding much of the telecommunications industry hostage to Qualcomm’s aging patent portfolio. Well, Qualcomm may finally be getting its just deserts. Already in trouble in Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and Europe for its anti-competitive practices, Qualcomm is now facing the Federal Trade Commission in U.S. District Court. Recently the FTC filed a legal brief arguing against Qualcomm’s motion to dismiss the FTC’s case. Unusually, the Court also received amicus briefs opposing Qualcomm’s motion and supporting the FTC’s case moving forward. These briefs came from a diverse group of associations and companies, including ACT | The App Association, the American Antitrust Institute, Intel, and Samsung. In the 1990’s, Qualcomm was the major developer of Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology. It pushed hard to get CDMA adopted by vendors. As CDMA was largely Qualcomm’s proprietary technology, it eventually had to agree to create a standard, and it agreed to license its CDMA patents on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms. (A FRAND commitment means that the patent owner agrees to license to anyone and won’t take advantage of its position in setting prices.) A large industry was built based on Qualcomm’s promises, as CDMA was widely adopted. Based on a growing body of evidence included in the FTC’s filings, as well as findings by the Korean Fair Trade Commission, it seems that Qualcomm hasn’t kept those promises. As CDMA has largely been supplanted by 3G and 4G, the once-great Qualcomm now makes the bulk of its profits by abusing its patents instead of being at the forefront of modern telecommunications innovation. The FTC laid out Qualcomm’s predatory licensing tactics in its complaint. Instead of treating all companies the same, Qualcomm refuses to license to other chip makers so that it has a virtual monopoly on CDMA chips. And instead of licensing on FRAND terms, Qualcomm forces its customers to buy licenses they don’t need and massively overcharges them for those licenses. Qualcomm charges a percentage of the price of the entire device as the royalty, regardless of the device. In practice, this means that say, Apple pays far more for each new iPhone 7 than it pays for the iPhone 5, even though Apple licenses the exact same technology and the same chips from Qualcomm. How does Qualcomm get away with this? Why would the market allow this? Qualcomm continues to take advantage of the fact that not all cell phone networks have been upgraded to 3G or better, meaning there are still many CDMA-only areas around the country. As a result, cell phones need to be backwards-compatible to work with CDMA networks. In short, Qualcomm is using patents on technology that is over two decades old to extract billions of dollars from innovating companies every year. Last year alone, Qualcomm made $6 billion in profit on licensing, most of which came from Qualcomm’s CDMA patents. Qualcomm has become like a former high school football star, using its past glories to justify its loutish behavior. Except that instead of just getting loudly drunk and boring people with old football stories, Qualcomm is ignoring its commitments and extracting billions of dollars that could otherwise be used by today’s innovators. The American Antitrust Institute echoed this point in its brief, noting that Qualcomm’s actions as charged by the FTC impair Qualcomm’s rivals by raising their costs in order to protect and enhance Qualcomm’s monopoly power. No one denies Qualcomm’s place in telecommunications history, but Qualcomm has been paid many times over at this point. Enough is enough. Qualcomm shows no intention of acting responsibly; it is up to the FTC and the courts to bring Qualcomm in line to protect innovation and fair access to technology. The Author Matt Levy is the former Patent Counsel at the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), where he handled legal, policy advocacy, and regulatory matters related to patents and wrote the Patent Progress blog. He is now a consultant on patent policy issues and patent litigation.

The head cheerleader for “Infringers-R-Us” complains because phone companies are still using Qualcomm’s technology and they have to pay a license for that technology. In short, Qualcomm is using patents on technology that is over two decades old to extract billions of dollars from innovating companies every year. The ire of you and your infringing buddies should be directed at the NETWORKS. If they upgraded all of their services from CDMA to 3G and 4G, there wouldn’t be this issue. Patents have a term that is 20 years from filing. As such, there is going to be some “almost” two decade old technology that could be subject to existing problems. The 20 years of patent coverage is part of the TRIPS agreement, which the U.S. agreed signed onto in 1995. As such EVERYBODY knew that these patents would be in effect for 20 years. This should not have surprised anybody. Ultimately, there is a really easy way not to pay a license to Qualcomm — don’t use their technology. Article I, Section 8, Clause 8, of the United States Constitution grants Congress the power “To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.” Qualcomm is exercising their exclusive right to their technology for the limited time of 20 years. I’m sorry infringer lobby — that’s just the way it is. BTW — I have absolutely zero relationship with Qualcomm. Night Writer May 18, 2017 8:50 am What is this? An advertisement for litigation work? 1) Qualcomm continues to spend large amounts on research (much more than Google relatively). 2) The only thing that you are arguing that has any merit is that Qualcomm is abusing their patents by not licencing to chip manufacturers and/or not under FRAND for CDMA patents. OK. Maybe this has merit. 3) Qualcomm continues to be at forefront of technology in 3G and 4G technology. 4) So, because they are old patents they shouldn’t be asserted? What a bunch of nonsense. 5) Your writing is always good for a good belly laugh (and cry when I realize most of Capital Hill believes people like you.) Night Writer May 18, 2017 8:53 am @1 Curious It is good to read this guy’s writing so we see what Google gets for their money. Basically, this guy has no regard for fair play–just misrepresent whatever you want and drag anyone through the mud that asserts a patent. I still bet that Levy could not sit down and write an essay about how patents are used in modern tech companies. He appears to be completely ignorant of reality or is being paid to lie. Night Writer May 18, 2017 8:58 am You have to wonder how much he is getting paid for writing this kind of stuff and by whom. Valuationguy May 18, 2017 9:19 am Matt, Obvious PR attempt….no real attempt to evaluate the contributions Qualcomm makes to CURRENT standards (i.e 4G iterations) which may or may not justify their royalties. Repeating allegations loudly enough does have an effect on politically driven investigations however so you are certainly earning your consulting pay. The bigger question is why Gene agreed to provide a soapbox for Matt. Bemused May 18, 2017 9:20 am Matt, I don’t agree with much (well, actually any) of your positions on patent litigation, patent “reform”, etc. But I will give you props for having the cojones to post on this blog (and props to Gene for allowing authors with a different perspective to post on here). Now, I’m reasonably sure that some Qualcomm folks read this blog and who might have a somewhat different perspective on Matt’s take on their company’s licensing practices… Anon May 18, 2017 9:30 am This (generously) tripe is not even a good PR attempt. Matt, I suggest that you self edit and remove all emotion-laden buzzwords and legal mischaracterizations from your article. Forget the click bait and try to tell a meaningful story in relation to the ongoing efforts against Qualcomm. There may be smoke with the actions against Qualcomm, but there is no fire in the worn out and plainly emotion-button-pushing words you have thrown together. In other words, start from scratch. This article is not in a forum of patent-illiterate lemmings. You insult us with such claptrap and more so, you insult yourself. Night Writer May 18, 2017 10:07 am Is Qualcomm beating you up with patents? Is it too expensive to upgrade your network to get rid of CDMA? Better Call Matt! I’ll take Qualcomm to the FTC! Better Call Matt! I’ll show Qualcomm what they can do with those old crippled patents! Better Call Matt! Judge Rich's Ghost May 18, 2017 10:12 am Two points. First, Levy was recently hired by Wiley Rein, but he’s not listed on the WR website now. Is he still at Wiley Rein? (It’s important to understand an author’s affiliations.) Second, the post lacks any connection to the controlling law. Levy complains that Qualcomm is getting paid for old technology. What does that mean? Pharmaceutical companies routinely get paid for technologies that they developed years ago. Levy also asserts that “Qualcomm has been paid many times over at this point.” What does that mean? Where in Title 15 or 35 does it say that being “paid many times over” is a legal basis to diminish a property right? Independent Inventor May 18, 2017 12:06 pm Denigrating patents because they’re “old” in the IP realm … is akin to denigrating people in the human realm because they’re “old.” Both are abhorrent. H2H May 18, 2017 1:42 pm Help me understand: Does Q have to license to a competitor if Q licenses the competitor’s customers? Would it be against FRAND to require a royalty from every party in the supply chain? Is there something inherently wrong with bundling SEPs with non-SEPS as long as there is an option to license the SEPs separately? Presumably Q has a lot of patents that are not SEPs, but, on a case-by-case basis would be applicable to a specific licensee. Wouldn’t a licensee want all of the patents in Q’s portfolio relevant to the licensed products SEP and non-SEP? Valuationguy May 18, 2017 3:20 pm H2H, By the currently accepted (by the courts) definition of FRAND, Qualcomm is ‘nominally’ required to offer a license to EVERYONE who wants one….even Apple and even if all of Apple’s suppliers have a license already. This is a fight over the RATE….not necessarily SEP v non-SEP standard patents. Apple is trying to position it as a SEP v non-SEP because then it makes Qualcomm’s rates/offers for SEP only patent to be too high. Because the court system has moved the goalposts from what FRAND and SEP v non-SEP meant when QUALCOMM made its initial FRAND committments….Apple is trying to take advantage of the unsteady state of the law to get a much lower rate. H2H May 18, 2017 5:50 pm @Valuationguy – that’s a great explanation. Thanks. Ternary May 18, 2017 11:54 pm “…the once-great Qualcomm now makes the bulk of its profits by abusing its patents instead of being at the forefront of modern telecommunications innovation.” The teachings by the anti-patent crowd in a nutshell: you are allowed to invent and to patent but not to enforce your patents. The article ends with “…it is up to the FTC and the courts to bring Qualcomm in line to protect innovation …” And how do the courts protect innovation? By invalidating patents in any which way they can. And that is exactly what infringers, who do not invent or innovate in CDMA because it is old technology as proclaimed by Matt, want and are looking for. Not much luck with IPRs against Qualcomm it seems. So try the courts and the FTC. Post a Comment Respectfully add to the discussion.

(Vetr) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) shares are down 8.4 percent Wednesday after investors were disappointed with the company’s Analyst Day event after the close Tuesday. Several Wall Street analysts have commented on AMD following the event. Here’s a look at key themes they discussed. Competition Heats Up Competition from rivals NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) will serve as an earnings headwind for AMD in coming years, said Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore. “While we are encouraged by AMD’s new product launch execution and its willingness to invest in a long-term roadmap, we note the competitive response from INTC/NVDA is always a risk, making EPS growth driven by AMD’s mix/ASPs/GM significantly more difficult,” Seymore said. Disappointing Guidance The market was clearly not impressed by management’s long-term earnings guidance, but the conservative outlook sets a low bar for future updates. “While there is likely going to be some disappointment with the $0.75 EPS target the company laid out for the longer term (2020), our sense is that the company is not going over its skis and [is] trying to set a target that seems more reasonable at this stage,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Ambrish Srivastova said in a note. Uncertain Markets Still, reliance on high-end products such as Ryzen, Vega and Naples to drive growth is a risky proposition. “We view these products as addressing essentially new markets for AMD,” Oppenheimer analyst Rick Shafer said in a note. “Given uncertain demand, particularly for Vega and Naples, we remain in wait-and-see mode before modeling significant sustainable profitability.” No Intel Deal Finally, investors were disappointed that AMD management made no mention of a potential GPU licensing deal that had been reported by Fudzilla on Tuesday. Related Link: Intel Has Reportedly Ditched Nvidia For Advanced Micro Devices “We believe with Intel having 106,000 employees vs. AMD’s 8,200 (as of December 2016) and rights in perpetuity (i.e. forever) to use every one of Nvidia’s GPU patents up to January 2017 that Intel does not need AMD’s GPU IP and think it’s very unlikely Intel will strike a licensing deal with AMD,” Loop Capital analyst Betsy Van Hees said in a note. Overall, Wall Street remains on the fence about AMD stock: Oppenheimer maintains a Perform rating. BMO maintains an Outperform rating and $15 price target. Loop Capital has downgraded AMD from Buy to Hold but maintains its $13 price target. Deutsche Bank maintains a Hold rating and $10 price target.

Pexels We all know the good life means more than money…but none of us is exactly sure what those other things are or how to get them. Let’s face it: money’s pretty easy to count and it consistently brings some happiness for at least a short period of time. We all know love and friends and other stuff are important too…but they’re a heck of a lot more complicated and we can’t just have them delivered to our house by Amazon Prime. Evaluating life by one metric turns out to be a key problem. We can’t use just one yardstick to measure a successful life. In Just Enough the authors refer to it as a “collapsing strategy”— collapsing everything into one barometer of whether or not our life is on track. Most of us find it easy to focus just on money and say “Make the number go up.” Convenient, simple…and dead wrong. The insanely successful people the authors spoke to often felt they were missing out in another area of life, like their relationships. When we try to collapse everything into one metric we inevitably get frustrated. The researchers realized multiple yardsticks for life were necessary. For instance, to have a good relationship with your family you need to spend time with them. So hours spent together is one way to measure. But if that time is spent screaming at each other, that’s not good either. So you need to measure quantity and quality. The study came up with four metrics that matter most: HAPPINESS: having feelings of pleasure or contentment in and about your life ACHIEVEMENT: achieving accomplishments that compare favorably against similar goals others have strived for SIGNIFICANCE: having a positive impact on people you care about LEGACY: establishing your values or accomplishments in ways that help others find future success They also came up with a simple way to interpret the feelings these four need to provide in your life: Happiness = Enjoying Achievement = Winning Significance = Counting (to others) Legacy = Extending How much of each metric do you need to feel like a success? It can be intimidating to have to determine, right now, what balance of these four will provide what you need for the rest of your life. You don’t need to go that far. What made you feel fulfilled at age ten isn’t true at twenty and won’t be true at eighty. Things will change and that’s okay. Specifics will shift, but your values probably won’t move nearly as much. You want to be contributing to the four needs on a regular basis. Here’s how. TRACK YOUR TIME You cannot balance your time if you don’t know where it’s going. Former Intel CEO Andy Grove once said, “To understand a company’s strategy, look at what they actually do rather than what they say they will do.” Write down where each hour goes as it happens. Don’t rely on your fallible memory. Do this for a week. Where are your activities taking you? Is it where you want to go? Note: this will be depressing. I assure you, you’re wasting more time than you think. Beyond that, note which hours are contributing to which of the big four (happiness, achievement, significance, legacy). Or is that hour going in the “None of the above” bucket? To improve how you use your time, take a lesson from criminology. To reduce crime in a city, tracking people isn’t nearly as effective as looking at geography. Researchers discovered that half of crimes happen in just 5 percent of the city. This is called “hot spot” policing. Giving those few areas twice the number of police patrols cut crime in half in the hot spots and reduced citywide emergency calls by 6 to 13 percent. So look for hot spots in your schedule. When do you waste the most time? When do you overdo one of the big four at the expense of another? You’ll get more bang for your buck changing your routines around these hot spots than by a vague notion of “working less” or “trying to spend more time with the family.” By the same token, look for trends that are working. When do you get disproportionate results? Early morning or late evening? At home or at the office? Try to make those moments more consistent. Remember, you cannot maximize two things that are both dependent on the same resource: time. You also don’t want to eliminate any categories with a sequencing or collapsing strategy. You want the balance of the big four that works for you. Make a decision on how much time you want to allot to each per week. You can revise it later, but you need an answer now. Once you hit the number of hours in one category, address the hot spots in another. As we talked about in the grit chapter, turning things into a game can make tricky problems more fun and engaging. Renowned venture capitalist Vinod Khosla certainly stays on top of how well his investments are doing, but he also has had his assistant record how many times a month he has dinner with his family. Coming up with a clever metric that works for you can make all the difference. Kevin Bolen, managing director of Strategic Investments and Growth Initiatives at KPMG, wanted more time with his wife and two sons. His main hot spot was traveling for work. So he focused on losing his platinum status on all his frequent-flier accounts. That became his goal. He got fewer free flights and perks, but it became a great barometer for how successful his work–life balance efforts were. TALK TO YOUR BOSS Some will say they just don’t have the latitude to make big changes. Their boss won’t let them. If you really want a better work– life balance, don’t make assumptions. Sit down with your boss and actually discuss it. No, you don’t say “Hey, I want to work less.” Ask your boss for a clear idea of your role and their expectations, and whether this or that change would really be an issue. You’ll probably be surprised by the answer, especially if you think about their needs and try to make it a win-win. Ask for an estimate of how much time they want you doing “shallow work,” like responding to emails and sitting in meetings, and how much they want you cranking on “deep work” that really produces results. Just having this conversation can drop your stress levels. A study in the Journal of Occupational Health Psychology showed that getting more clarity about what you’re expected to do reduces strain when work demands are high. It’s easier to make the right decisions and not worry. This chat will be good for the boss too, whether they realize it or not. The Harvard Business Review detailed a strategy called “active partnering” in which employees and managers disclosed what they wanted to achieve personally and professionally. A study of 473 executives showed that after a year of active partnering, 62 who wanted to leave the firm decided to stick around. A number of them even got promoted. You’ll want to have more of these conversations over time as you tweak your plan, but in all likelihood your boss will appreciate it. Proactive employees who have plans, ask about priorities, and try to head off problems are valuable. The people the boss has to come to after the fact to correct errors are the real difficult ones. And when you produce results, you’ll get more latitude. More latitude means more freedom and control to execute your plan. Handle it right and it’s an upward spiral for everyone. You know your troublesome hot spots and what gets you disproportionate results. You’re allotting hours to all of the big four, and you’ve gotten direction and approval from your boss. Now you can really make a difference… TO-DO LISTS ARE EVIL. SCHEDULE EVERYTHING. Georgetown University professor Cal Newport is the Genghis Khan of productivity. And Cal thinks to-do lists are the devil’s work. Because the lists don’t give any consideration to time. Ever wonder why you never seem to get to the bottom of that list? You can easily list twenty-eight hours worth of activities for a twenty- four-hour day. You need to be realistic about what you can get done in the time you have. The only way to do that is to schedule things on a calendar instead of making an endless list. Decide when you want to leave work and you’ll know how many hours you have. Slot in what you need to get done by priority. Cal calls this “fixed schedule productivity.” You need boundaries if you want work–life balance. This forces you to be efficient. By setting a deadline of six p.m. and then scheduling tasks, you can get control over that hurricane of duties, and you can be realistic instead of shocked by what is never going to happen. Most of us use our calendars all wrong: we don’t schedule work; we schedule interruptions. Meetings get scheduled. Phone calls get scheduled. Doctor appointments get scheduled. You know what often doesn’t get scheduled? Real work. All those other things are distractions. Often, they’re other people’s work. But they get dedicated blocks of time and your real work becomes an orphan. If real work is the stuff that affects the bottom line, the stuff that gets you noticed, the thing that earns you raises and gets you singled out for promotion, well, let me utter blasphemy and suggest that maybe it deserves a little dedicated time too. Also, at least an hour a day, preferably in the morning, needs to be “protected time.” This is an hour every day when you get real work done without interruption. Approach this concept as if it were a religious ritual. This hour is inviolate. Emails, meetings, and phone calls are often just “shallow work.” You want to use this hour for what Cal calls “deep work.” One hour when you will actually move things forward instead of just treading water. Shallow work stops you from getting fired—but deep work is what gets you promoted. And you don’t want this at the end of the day when it may get bumped. You want to be able to bring your full brainpower to the tasks that matter. Research shows that two and a half to four hours after waking is when your brain is sharpest. Do you want to waste that on a conference call or a staff meeting? What if you’re totally overwhelmed at work? If you never get a break from interruptions, then do your protected time at home for an hour before work. Peter Drucker cites a Swedish study of twelve executives that showed they literally could not work twenty minutes without being interrupted. The only one who was able to make thoughtful decisions was the one who spent ninety minutes working from home before entering the maelstrom of the office. Planning out every day so rigorously is a pain at first but it works. For extra credit, you may want to start planning out your free time too. Before you recoil in horror at the thought, I’ve got some data for you. A study of 403 people in the Journal of Happiness Studies showed that managing your free time is associated with higher quality of life. What was fascinating was that increasing people’s free time had no effect on their happiness, but scheduling that time in advance made all the difference. As we discussed earlier, we often don’t use our time off wisely—we do what is easy instead of what makes us happy. By taking some time to plan, you can make it much more likely you’ll really have fun instead of being a couch potato. So scheduling everything and using protected time can make sure the important stuff gets done. But I know what you’re thinking: all that shallow work isn’t going away. A good way to deal with the busy work is in “batches.” Rather than reactively living in your inbox, schedule a few intervals when you process emails, return phone calls, and shuffle the papers that need shuffling. After that session is over, turn off notifications, silence the phone, and get back to important stuff. Three batches a day works for me, but a job that requires frequent interaction may need more. The point is to be able to control and schedule these periods as much as possible so they don’t creep into the time you’re doing deep work. We got to the moon and built the pyramids without email and Facebook. You can go a couple of hours without checking them. What if your boss demands quick replies? Set up an email filter so you only get notifications from the head honcho or whoever else really matters. The rest can wait. There’s one more scheduling item you need to keep in mind to make sure you don’t undo all the good you’ve accomplished so far: learn to say no. If you get rid of unnecessary activities, schedule everything, use protected time, and batch busy work but you can’t stop people from piling unimportant tasks on your desk, you’ll forever be mired in the shallows. You have your priorities from your boss and you’ll align your tasks with how many hours you actually have in the day. If something doesn’t have priority and there’s just not time for it, you need to say no. To quote Warren Buffett, “The difference between successful people and very successful people is that very successful people say no to almost everything.” CONTROL YOUR CONTEXT It matters. More than you think. It influences your decisions even when you don’t realize it. When I spoke to Duke professor Dan Ariely he said: One of the big lessons from social science in the last forty years is that environment matters. If you go to a buffet and the buffet is organized in one way, you will eat one thing. If it’s organized in a different way, you’ll eat different things. We think that we make decisions on our own, but the environment influences us to a great degree. Because of that we need to think about how to change our environment. We can’t control our environment everywhere we go, of course, but we have more control than we usually choose to exercise. Distractions literally make you stupid. Students whose classroom was situated near a noisy railroad line ended up academically a full year behind students with a quiet classroom. When the noise was dampened, the performance difference vanished. Offices aren’t much different. Research shows that the most productive computer programmers have one thing in common. It’s not experience, salary, or hours spent on a project. They had employers who gave them an environment free from distraction. This is where you can actually use being reactive to your advantage. Shawn Achor recommends the “twenty second rule.” Make the things you should do twenty seconds easier to start and make the things you shouldn’t be doing twenty seconds harder. Sounds tiny but it makes a big difference. By rearranging your workspace so temptations aren’t visible, you can trick yourself into making better choices. Ariely told me of a simple study done at Google’s New York office. Instead of putting M&M’s out in the open, they put them in containers. No big deal. What was the result? People ate three million fewer of them in a single month. So close that web browser. Charge your phone on the other side of the room. I know controlling your environment can be hard. Shared work-spaces, open-plan offices, chatty colleagues, and bosses that look over your shoulder. This is why I recommend a simple solution for at least part of the day: hide. Book a conference room and work from there. Not only will you be distraction-free, but you’ll probably be more creative. Stanford professors Jeffrey Pfeffer and Bob Sutton note that “a large body of research shows that the more that authority figures hang around, the more questions they ask, and especially the more feedback they give their people, the less creative the work will be. Why? Because doing creative work entails constant setbacks and failure, and people want to succeed when the boss is watching—which means doing proven, less creative things that are sure to work.” END THE DAY RIGHT—AND ON TIME You used “fixed schedule productivity,” right? You decided when you wanted to leave work and arranged your schedule around that. Good, because Leslie Perlow said the key to getting those work– life balance results is to impose a “strict time-off mechanism.” You want to know when you’re leaving the office so you can make sure you’re adding to the buckets of enjoying, winning, counting, and extending—not just working, working, and working. Unless you want to hate your job, how you end the day matters a lot more than you might think. To explain, I need to talk to you about getting things shoved in your butt. Yes, literally getting things shoved in your butt. Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman and Daniel Redelmeier looked at how much pain people remembered after colonoscopies. It turns out that how long the procedures lasted and the average amount of pain didn’t influence people’s recollections. What really seemed to matter was the peak amount of discomfort and how it ended. A longer colonoscopy with a higher average amount of pain but a low peak and a gentle ending was remembered as less uncomfortable. Meanwhile, a quick one with a low average but a sharp peak and an unpleasant conclusion was remembered as being far worse. Whether it’s arguments with your spouse or the last lines of a Hollywood movie, endings matter. So take the time to end the day well. Those last moments at the office every day loom large in terms of how you feel about your job. Cal Newport recommends a “shutdown ritual” in which you take the time to close out the day’s business and prepare for tomorrow. Research shows that writing down the things you need to take care of tomorrow can settle your brain and help you relax. As neuroscientist Daniel J. Levitin explains, when you’re concerned about something and your grey matter is afraid you may forget, it engages a cluster of brain regions referred to as the “rehearsal loop.” And you keep worrying and worrying. Writing your thoughts down and making a plan for tomorrow switches this off. Then get yourself some downtime. What are the best ways to de- stress? It’s far better to engage in a hobby or spend time with friends. Research shows that weekends are great because it’s the extra time with the people you care about. You get an average of 1.7 extra hours of friend time on the weekend, and this creates a happiness boost. And don’t neglect sleep. You don’t want to start hallucinating that you’re a football star. Now that you have your rough plan, write it down. Research by Roy Baumeister shows this not only can this help you achieve your goals but it also stops your brain from continuing to obsess about stuff when it’s time to relax. Your plan won’t be perfect right out of the gate. You’ll screw up. It’s okay. Don’t forget the self-compassion. Forgiving yourself both makes you feel better and prevents procrastination. A study of 119 students showed that those who forgave themselves for procrastinating on studying for one test subsequently procrastinated less on a second test. They felt better, and rather than beating themselves up, they were able to move on and perform better. As you see what works and what doesn’t, tweak your plan. Which of the big four isn’t getting enough hours? Adjust until you’re closer to the balance you want. This method of tracking, reviewing, and improving is how Peter Drucker says you can get where you want to go. A plan will move you a lot closer to all-around life success. Steven Jay Ross, who helped build the TimeWarner corporation, put it best: There are three categories of people—the person who goes into the office, puts his feet up on his desk, and dreams for twelve hours; the person who arrives at five a.m. and works sixteen hours, never once stopping to dream; and the person who puts his feet up, dreams for one hour, then does something about those dreams.

Bernd Leukert Tells Customers at SAPPHIRE NOW: Software Is Strategy to “Run and Win” Feature Article | May 18, 2017 by Susan Galer May 18, 2017 by Susan Galer 255 In a sharp detour from the past when strategy became software, Bernd Leukert, member of the Executive Board of SAP SE, Products & Innovation, said that software has now become every company’s strategy to win. Leukert added that SAP is breaking down the barriers that hinder innovation by delivering an open, integrated and secure technology stack with SAP HANA as the stable core, proven cloud applications on SAP S/4HANA, and the new SAP Leonardo portfolio to intelligently connect people, things and processes. “The power of innovation is based on a modular feed of open, best-in-class cloud applications. SAP Leonardo is the next-generation digital innovation engine that empowers you to rapidly innovate at scale, reinvent processes and redefine your business,” said Leukert. “It’s fully integrated as only SAP can do. In this new world, technology becomes central and decisive for our economy, your business and society. Let’s invent, build, run and win together!” Speaking before a capacity crowd at the annual SAPPHIRE NOW + ASUG Annual Conference, Leukert demonstrated exactly how SAP is fundamentally embracing openness that delivers greater value to customers by accelerating innovation. “Openness is the game-changer, driving new business value,” he said. “Openness in every part of the company allows you to reach completely new levels of business process excellence. You can inject data and derive insights across every layer of your company, like traffic and other data into logistics, machine learning data into maintenance plans, and social data from your customer profiles.” Fast Access to Data that Turns into Action Emphasizing the importance of cloud-based computing to take full advantage of the digital business opportunity, Leukert punctuated his talk with a series of proof points demonstrating SAP’s innovation leadership. “Now is the time to run ERP in the cloud. SAP S/4HANA is a modern system that is always up-to-date and scales as you grow your business,” said Leukert. “It’s autonomous and intelligent, which makes for faster innovation. We are also opening up our cloud applications using APIs in a micro services architecture for seamless connectivity across business processes. We’ve developed machine learning innovations that are changing industries, like invoicing matching and SAP CoPilot, our digital assistant that’s fully aware of the user and business context. Thousands of partners are already innovating on the SAP Cloud Platform, building enterprise-grade applications that are using big data to extract insights for real-time business.” Leukert invited Diane Bryant, Group President, Data Center Group at Intel, on stage, who projected 60 percent performance increases for SAP HANA workloads using the next-generation Intel Xeon Processor. Diane Greene, Head of Google Cloud, Member of the Board of Directors at Alphabet, Inc., provided an update on results from the partnership between Google and SAP, showcasing Sovanta, the first shared customer using SAP S/4HANA hosted on the Google Cloud Platform. Dr. Wladimir Klitschko, Entrepreneur and Initiator of Challenge Management, brought an entirely new dimension to the conversation, reminding everyone that people are what matter most, and it’s possible to turn frustrations into positive outcomes. “It’s complicated ─ we have to digitalize ourselves and our business,” he said. “You need to have a goal, understand the consequences if you don’t take the challenge, imagine how successful you’ll be when you reach your goal, and be obsessed with your goal. Obsession is love, and when you love something you’ll do anything to reach your goal.” SAP Transformation Navigator Delivers Road Map to Cloud Leukert reinforced SAP’s commitment to empathy, showing how the company has doubled-down on innovation that supports the customer experience. Case in point was the launch of SAP Transformation Navigator, which answers the most burning questions customers have about the fastest way to move to the cloud.  This new tool provides product and license recommendations based on a customer’s current SAP investments and unique business value requirements, offering services as well as a complete road map to the cloud. Machine Learning Changes Industries Ian Kimbell of SAP came on stage for two mind-bending demonstrations of the power of SAP Leonardo. The first showed how a power tool rental company could disrupt its business model. Kimbell turned on a connected drill that collected and analyzed live digital data from its sensors, helping the company better manage maintenance, extend the lifetime of these assets, and improve the customer experience with personalized services. The second demonstration brought virtual windmills from Norway on stage, calling up real-time data using SAP CoPilot to literally see where problems are, and through integration with SAP S/4HANA, locate and hire available technicians to fix it. It’s Easy to Get Started Sam Yen, chief design officer at SAP, explained how customers can use SAP Leonardo Services to move from vision to blueprint in just weeks. Design thinking identifies end-user needs, and pre-designed templates with visualized feedback “heat maps” help even non-developers rapidly create prototypes and iterate solutions. “SAP Leonardo Services dramatically reduce the time it takes to make your digital transformation real with SAP,” said Yen. “Design Thinking and Leonardo Build break down the barriers between business users and developers, significantly lowering the cost of implementation.” Follow me @smgaler Tags: AI, Analytics, big data, innovation, IoT, machine learning, predictive analytics, SAP Cloud Platform, SAP Leonardo, SAP S/4HANA, SAPPHIRE NOW Related Intelligent Cloud, Analytics Demonstrate SAP’s Vision for Tomorrow’s Business Related Flexibility, Scalability, Speed Accelerated: An Update on the SAP and Google Partnership Related SAP Unveils Live Business, Expands Google Partnership and Bolsters SAP Cloud Platform at SAPPHIRE NOW Add a comment Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

In the U.S., T-Mobile is eyeing nationwide 5G deployed in the 600 MHz band, while many other global trials have focused on high-band millimeter wave spectrum. The wide range of frequencies in play creates a lot of opportunities for the next generation of mobile networks, but could also serve to fragment the global market creating problems around interoperability and seamless service delivery. To get ahead of this problem, the GSA (Global mobile Suppliers Association), a nonprofit trade group, is working to build global consensus around 5G spectrum harmonization. This week GSA announced that South Korean electronics powerhouse Samsung has joined Huawei, Ericsson, Nokia, Intel and Qualcomm as a member of GSA’s executive board. In its announcement, GSA said the entrance of Samsung comes at a pivotal moment as the industry evolves from LTE. Samsung VP and Head of Standards and Technology Sungho Choi said the company will actively work in GSA’s Spectrum Group, which he described as “excellent,” and “delivering a strong view of harmonized spectrum needs on both a global and regional level.” GSA President and executive board member Joe Barrett addressed the need for a global approach to 5G spectrum policies in a recent blog post that provided comparative analysis of spectral regulatory policy in a number of key 5G markets. Based on the explosive growth in the volume and type of mobile data traffic, as well as the ongoing number of connections coming from the internet of things, Barrett said the need for more, and higher frequency spectrum, is an fundamental to 5G. “GSA member companies are investing heavily in research and developments in relation to 5G technologies and networks. Results of these efforts are underway on a global basis in response to national and regional strategic initiatives. Therefore, it is regarded as essential for policy makers to lay down rules while supporting early access to radio frequency spectrum resources with the aim of providing necessary clarity for deployments of terrestrial 5G systems, which are already on the way in some countries and are emerging in others.” Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Related Posts Related Posts 4G LTE 5G GSA millimeter wave spectrum Spectrum About Author Sean Kinney Managing EditorSean Kinney focuses on multiple subject areas including DAS, small cells, cloud computing, 5G and Internet of Things vertical applications.

More than 100 new business models from the world over  The presence of international enterprises has been given particular impetus this year with the inclusion of pavilions from countries like Sweden - which is also the DES2017 guest country - Belgium and Israel, which has returned after being the guest country in the first edition. Sweden, guest country  Sweden is one of the world's most innovative countries. "It is clear that digitalization brings enormous opportunities for the sustainable development of various business sectors, and it is also a prerequisite for making sure your company, public institution or country is competitive and an attractive business associate," commented Malin Svensson, Sweden's Business Advisor in Spain and Director of Business Sweden Spain and Portugal. According to the British magazine Wired, Sweden is the world's most connected and digital economy. Sweden's success story has been driven by a climate that favours the innovation of tomorrow and the improvements in productivity made by the Swedish economy, boosted by digitalisation since the 1990s, are testament to this. Proof can be found in the Swedish industry and its companies, some of which will be present in DES 2017. Stand-out partners include Ericsson and ABB who - together with other excellent examples such as Telenor Connexion, Aptilo Networks, Bambwa, CombiQ, Evothings Labs, H&D Wireless, Imagimob, Infracontrol, LumenRadio, Näktergal, Springworks, Things and WOK-World of Knowledge  - all contribute to the digital business fabric with innovative and cutting-edge solutions. The AReality exhibition, produced and presented together with the Swedish Institute in DES 2017, will display examples of pioneering innovation and industrial design through Augmented Reality. Magnus Melander, IoT (Internet of Things) guru, consultant and evangelist at THINGS Stockholm will lead the "Connected Business by Sweden" conference in the Masterminds Congress programme, together with representatives that will inspire by highlighting real life examples of the Swedish success story. He will also show how Sweden has created this climate of innovation through collaborations between large corporations and small companies, with truly close cooperation between the business fabric, public administration and the academic world.   ICEX will also be present in DES2017  Spain will also be present in DES2017 through the ICEX Spain Export and Investment Pavilion, in which 20 firms will participate. Key Spanish representatives include cyber security start-ups, grouped together by the INCIBE (National Institute of Cyber security), such as Randed, Electronic Identification, Formavolucion, Acerodocs, and Continuum Security. The Spanish Pavilion will also host a wide variety of technologies related to digital transformation including Cloud Computing, with the presence of Gigas and Capside;EdTech (training) with collaborative training platform, BluebottleBiz, and ISDI; FinTech with Innsomnia, Spain's first specialist FinTech incubator; MarTech (marketing) with Marketeer; networks with Ayscom and Quobis; and Big Data thanks to the presence of Carto, specialist in the analysis of geolocation data as a business development asset. Wallonia (Belgium) in DES2017  Through the Agency for Foreign Trade of the Walloon region (AWEX) and Digital Wallonia, a technological Hub that unites all the key players of the IT sector of Wallonia (Belgium) in a collaborative ecosystem, the pavilion of Wallonia (Belgium) will include the participation of companies dedicated to consultancy and management of digital transformation from strategy creation to implementation and management of the process, such as ACTORIS and I.R.I.S.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | May 17, 2017 -- 17:21 GMT (10:21 PDT) | Topic: Hardware The Google Cloud TPU delivers up to 180 teraflops of computing power. At the Google I/O conference Wednesday, Google unveiled the next generation of its custom-built Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), a chip designed for machine learning. The first generation of TPUs, revealed at last year's I/O, were designed to run already-trained machine learning models. This new chip, delivering an impressive 180 teraflops of computing power, both trains and runs such models. Called the Cloud TPU, the second-generation chip will be available to anyone through the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Developers on GCP are still free to design with traditional like Intel's Skylake or GPUs like Nvidia's Volta. The Cloud TPU is the latest example of how Google's using its cutting-edge technology to set itself apart from its public cloud competitors. "We want Google Cloud to be the best cloud for machine learning," Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in the I/O keynote address. "This lays the foundation for significant progress." special feature How to Implement AI and Machine Learning The next wave of IT innovation will be powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning. We look at the ways companies can take advantage of it and how to get started. Read More To ramp up computing power even further, Google has built a custom, ultra-high speed network to connect 64 TPUs into a machine-learning supercomputer. Called a TPU pod, it can deliver up 11.5 petaflops (or 11,500 teraflops) of compute to train either a single large machine learning model or many smaller ones. To illustrate the power of a TPU pod, Google said that to train its new, large-scale language translation model, it would take a full day using 32 of the world's best commercially available GPUs. By contrast, one-eighth of a TPU pod can train the model in just six hours. Both the individual Cloud TPUs and the full TPU pods were designed to be programmed using high-level abstractions expressed using the Tensorflow machine learning system -- the open sourced system developed by Google. The first-generation TPUs were deployed internally at Google two years ago and are used on Google producuts such as Search, the new neural machine translation system for Google Translate, Google speech recognition and Google Photos. Jeff Dean, a senior fellow for Google Brain, told reporters this week that Google is still using CPUs and GPUs to train some machine learning models. However, he expects that over time, Google will increasingly use TPUs.

The researchers must be willing to openly publish the results of their research and potentially open source the code associated with their research. Google's making the Research Cloud available to accelerate the pace of machine learning research and plans to share it with entities like Harvard Medical School. For those involved in proprietary research, Google plans to launch the Cloud TPU Alpha program.

View All Posts On Wednesday, May 17, a broader risk-off wind blew through global risk assets, leading the broader U.S. equity indices to drop anywhere from 1.8% to 2.6% on the day. A segment of notable weakness was large-cap tech, including semiconductor stocks such as Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). INTC stock dropped about 2% on the day to slightly underperform the broader market. More importantly, though: Intel snapped a technically crucial area of support and now looks to have enough momentum to tumble another 5% before it hits a well-defined area of support. Over the past few weeks in this column, I have repeatedly voiced my concern for the low-volatility rise in large-cap tech stocks, as represented by the PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF) (NASDAQ:QQQ). While I believe in the growth story of these tech heavyweights, history has taught us that such low-vol environments usually end with a bang. As such, INTC stock helped lead the tech sector lower on Wednesday, as the QQQ ETF erased the past 13 sessions of gains — all in one day — in an important mean-reversion move. Boom! On the first chart below of the Market Vectors Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:SMH), we see that while the broader trend is very well-defined and pointing higher, Wednesday’s move came as this market was trading at the very upper end of its range. Click to Enlarge Thus, from this angle, there is no reason just yet for larger concern. But there’s plenty of room for more mean-reversion lower, and for these stocks to take a breather. INTC Stock Charts On the multiyear weekly chart, we see that the drop in Intel thus far this week has led it to break below the black multiyear support line, as well as well as the yellow 50-week simple moving average. Click to Enlarge From this angle, I see plenty more downside for mean reversion. A next better area of horizontal support comes in closer to the $32-$33 area with the blue 100-week simple moving average.

The first Ryzen processors were released by AMD earlier this year, and were seen a major leap forward for the company’s CPU offerings that actually managed to offer meaningful competition for Intel’s popular Core i5 and i7 models when it came to both price and performance. Ryzen laptops are coming later this year The mobile Ryzen line, codenamed “Raven Ridge,” will be what AMD calls an APU — an “accelerated processing unit,” which combines a CPU and an integrated GPU into a single chip (similar to how Intel CPUs offer integrated Intel HD graphics). Like the desktop Ryzen processors, the mobile CPU components will be four-core, 8-thread chips based on the same “Zen” architecture. AMD expects to see the mobile Ryzen APUs in a variety of laptop form factors, ranging from ultraportables to gaming machines in the second half of 2017. At the other end of the spectrum is the upcoming Ryzen Threadripper, set to release in the summer. It still has the same Zen architecture as the rest of the Ryzen line, but the Threadripper will be a CPU with up to 16-cores and 32-threads — for comparison, the high end Ryzen 7 offers has eight cores and 16 threads. There’s no word on price yet for the Threadripper, but given the high-end nature of the processor, it probably won’t be cheap. Lastly, AMD confirmed that the budget Ryzen 3 processors are still planned for later in 2017. The Ryzen 3 is meant to fill in the lower end of the product lineup, and compete with Intel’s Core i3 chips — much as the Ryzen 5 is meant to compete with Intel’s Core i5 models, and the Ryzen 7 to compete with Core i7 processors.

Spanning the Ryzen 7, 5 and 3 range, the product line has been praised for its performance and price. In any event, AMD isn’t stopping there, announcing a new processor for the “extreme desktop” market, called Threadripper. The new processor features up to 16 cores and 32 threads, going head to head against Intel’s own super-premium consumer chips. Threadripper launches in summer 2017, the chipmaker added. Speaking of chip availability, AMD added that the Ryzen 3 range would be launching in Q3 2017. AMD and its Threadripper CPU promises to take the fight to Intel’s enthusiast level silicon On the hunt for a Ryzen-powered laptop? Well, AMD says that Ryzen mobile APUs, dubbed Raven Ridge, would be launching in the second half of the year. The APU integrates Vega graphics with a quad-core, eight thread Zen-based CPU. How powerful is the new mobile APU then? The company claims “an expected 50 percent increase in CPU performance and over 40 percent better graphics performance, at half the power of its previous generation”. Otherwise, expect these APUs in “premium two in ones”, gaming devices and “ultraportables”. The company also reiterated its roadmap for its next generation of products, saying that Zen 2 and Zen 3 CPU families (built on a 7nm process) will follow on this year’s crop of Zen chips. The company will also follow up its Vega GPU tech with Navi, also using a 7nm process.

Rosenstein, along with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, recommended that Trump dismiss Comey, citing his controversial handling of the investigation into former secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. The unusual, all-senators briefing comes as Trump and his administration grapple with the fallout from explosive revelations earlier this week that Comey kept notes of a February meeting indicating Trump asked him to close the agency's investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, and that Trump shared sensitive intelligence information with the Russians.

USA TODAY U.N. identifies world's all-time deadliest storms A 1970 tropical cyclone that killed 300,000 people in East Pakistan — now Bangladesh — has officially been declared the world's all-time deadliest weather event, the World Meteorological Organization announced Thursday. The United Nations agency also identified which tornado, lightning strike and hailstorm resulted in the highest death tolls. The horrific death toll in the 1970 disaster was mostly due to a storm surge that overwhelmed the islands and tidal flats along the shores of the Bay of Bengal. The deadliest tornado — a mile-wide twister in 1989 that killed 1,300 — was also in Bangladesh, the report said. Trump meets with Colombia's Juan Manuel Santos at the White House President Trump will welcome Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos to the White House on Thursday to discuss a wide range of bilateral issues. Both leaders are expected to address Colombia's historic peace deal with the leftist rebel group, Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC), which helped put an end to the longest-running armed conflict in the Western Hemisphere. More than 220,000 Colombians have been killed in the war that has spanned five decades, while 360,000 have been forced to flee the country. Other topics, including the concerning political situation in Venezuela, will also be addressed in the meeting, according to the White House.

Net Neutrality heads for a vote at FCC  Protests are planned Thursday morning outside the Federal Communications Commission in Washington, where its three-member commission is expected to pass a controversial measure which ultimately would overturn the net neutrality rules passed by the FCC in 2015. If passed, it would remove the rules prohibiting Internet providers such as Comcast, Spectrum and Verizon from blocking and throttling content or from prioritizing some , possibly for payment. Many online have voiced their opposition to a reversal of the current rules, with the movement given a recent boost after John Oliver put a spotlight on the issue in a recent episode of his HBO show, Last Week Tonight. A rally is planned by opposing groups, including organizations like the Color of Change, Credo Action, Demand Progress, Electronic Frontier Foundation and Free Press.

News 363 0 0 May 17, 2017 Vladimir Putin Willing To Release Transcript Of Meeting With Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Louis Babcock It seems like every day there is a new accusation of a scandal developing within Donald Trump’s presidency. The latest accusation claims that President Trump illegally shared classified information with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. The Trump administration, along with Russia, has denied the accusation. A report by CNN states that Vladimir Putin is willing to release a copy of the transcript from the meeting between Trump and Lavrov in order to put a stop to the claims. According to Putin, this latest accusation against Trump is “political schizophrenia.” “If the US administration finds it necessary, we are ready to provide the record of the conversation between Trump and Lavrov to the Senate and Congress.” If Vladimir Putin sticks to his word and releases his copy of the transcript from the meeting, pressure could mount that forces the Trump administration to release their copy of the same meeting. Both transcripts would need to match up in order for the public to believe they are authentic. Vladimir Putin: Russia Can Prove Donald Trump Did Not Give Classified Intel to Diplomats https://t.co/cZXhcfRQHC pic.twitter.com/jjPlwRLv66 — Jim Eastridge (@jimEastridge1) May 17, 2017 Another report by CNN states that the Senate intelligence committee has put in a request to be told what was said during the meeting between Trump and Lavrov. Two members of the Senate intelligence committee, Senator Richard Burr and Senator Mark Warner, commented on the Senate’s request. “Once Mark and I have an opportunity to talk to individuals that were in the meeting, that will either confirm our confidence or possibly shake our confidence. We’re trying to go the extra mile — we owe the White House the chance to present us with the information, present us with the truth. We want to know from people in the room, also want to know if there are these supposed transcripts.” As president, Donald Trump has the ability to declassify any classified information. Senator Burr went on to discuss this ability. “This is probably a good time to take a breath, and understand the President has the ability and the right to talk about intelligence. There is a point that you cut that off with foreign leaders, especially when sources and methods are involved, so it’s crucial that we talk to individuals to find out exactly what was said not necessarily what was not said.” The idea that Donald Trump illegally shared classified information with Lavrov came from a report by the Washington Post. The story from the Washington Post used an anonymous source in their report. H.R. McMaster was present in the Oval Office when the meeting took place and commented on the information that was discussed. “The president and the foreign minister reviewed common threats from terrorist organizations to include threats to aviation. At no time were any intelligence sources or methods discussed, and no military operations were disclosed that were not already known publicly.” Vladimir Putin rushes to defend Trump amid calls for his impeachment https://t.co/0Xad86BINs pic.twitter.com/JmtHYozCHi — HuffPost UK Politics (@HuffPostUKPol) May 17, 2017 This latest scandal has caused talks of impeachment to ramp up. It used to be believed that these talks of impeachment were just democrats who were angry but now the impeachment talks have crossed party lines. A report by News Max is stating that Representative Justin Amash, republican from Michigan, says Trump should be impeached if it is discovered that he tampered with the FBI investigation into Michael Flynn by asking James Comey to stop the investigation. This would be considered obstruction of justice which is an impeachable offense. Related Article Impeachment Process: What Steps Need To Happen To Remove The President From Office?

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 18 May 2017 | MYT 2:17 PM Google to offer new AI ‘supercomputer’ chip via Cloud Google plans more chips like this, and sees the components as essential for success in the cloud – a key part of Alphabet’s push to make money beyond digital advertising. — Reuters At the I/O developer conference last year, Google debuted its first chip. The company kept the component mostly for internal artificial intelligence needs. Today, version two arrived – and Google is selling this one.  Chief executive officer Sundar Pichai announced the new chip on May 17 during a keynote address at the Alphabet Inc unit’s annual I/O event. Normally, the gathering focuses on mobile software. This year’s spotlight on hardware underscores Pichai’s effort to transform the search giant into an “AI-first” company and a real cloud-computing contender.  Companies will be able to purchase the hardware, called Cloud Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), through a Google Cloud service. Google hopes it will quicken the pace of AI advancements. And despite official statements to the contrary, it may also threaten Intel Corp and Nvidia Corp, the main suppliers of powerful semiconductors that run large processing tasks.  ”This is basically a supercomputer for machine learning,” Urs Holzle, Google’s veteran technical chief, said. Machine learning, a method for deciphering patterns in reams of data, is behind Google’s recent progress on voice recognition, text translation and search rankings. But the approach cost a lot, and sucked up computing time in Google’s datacentres. The latest chip was designed to address these issues, and executives said they saw dramatic improvements after putting the component to work on these internal tasks.  Google wouldn’t divulge the chip’s price, what company manufactures it, or when the related cloud service goes on sale. Google still purchases processors from Intel and Nvidia. But by relying more on in-house designs, Google could trim its multi-billion-dollar annual computing bill.  Google plans more chips like this, and sees the components as essential for success in the cloud – a key part of Alphabet’s push to make money beyond digital advertising. Other non-advertising announcements from the conference included new voice-based commerce features for Google’s digital Assistant and physical photo books selling for US$9.99 (RM43) or more.  ”The field is rapidly evolving," Holzle said. “For us, it’s very important to advance machine learning for our own purposes and to be the best cloud.”  During his morning keynote, Pichai also introduced a flurry of machine learning updates for Google products, and unveiled a new web portal housing all of the company’s AI efforts.  Google’s cloud business grew by more than 80% last year, according to estimates from Synergy Research Group. But Amazon Web Services still has over 40% of the public cloud market, and continues to expand at a steady clip. Google is third, according to industry estimates.   To gain share, Google is leaning on its AI prowess. The Cloud TPU chip won’t be sold to Dell Inc. and other makers of servers that power traditional corporate datacentres. To get the benefits, customers will have to sign up for a Google cloud service and run their software tasks and store their data on Google’s equipment. If companies get on board, Google insists, they can plumb their own data for unseen efficiency gains and profit.   AWS and no. 2 player Microsoft Corp, make similar cases. So Google’s pitch stresses performance. A single Cloud TPU device, composed of four chips, is nearly 12,000 times faster than IBM’S Deep Blue supercomputer, the famous chess victor from 1997, Holzle said. Google is stringing 64 of the devices into “pods” that sit in its datacentres.  Google unveiled its chip at last year’s I/O conference, so why does it need another? First, the company is going up against rivals that develop and deliver faster processors on an annual cadence. To lock in customers, it must match that pace.  In addition, the original chip only worked for “inference,” processing data that’s already packaged in mathematical models. It’s akin to compressing large photos into tiny digital formats. For instance, a company could turn an algorithm for voice recognition into an app using inference chips.   To create an algorithm from just raw voices, you need lots of data to train AI software. That takes massive computing power, forcing coders to wait days or weeks to see results. Google’s second chip speeds up the training process. In internal tests, it cut the time in half compared to commercially available graphic processing units, known as GPUs.  Nvidia, the dominant GPU manufacturer, recently announced a new chip, called Volta, that handles training data like Google’s Cloud TPU. An eight-chip Volta module will sell for US$149,000 (RM644,648) starting in the third quarter.  Google is less experienced at selling chips, so it’s being cautious about commercial deployment. “When you have something that’s really new, some of the tools occasionally break. You want to reach a certain level of maturity," Holzle said. “We’re probably going to have a lot more demand than we can satisfy.”  Excessive demand inspired the creation of TPUs in the first place, according to company lore. Six years ago, Google saw an uptick in voice searches on phones. Just three minutes of conversation a day, per Android phone user, would have doubled the number of datacentres Google needed, based on its technology at the time. TPUs were designed to handle the extra volume more efficiently.  The second-generation chip accelerated Google’s own research. For its translation efforts, Google previously ignored more than 80% of its data at the training stage, according to Jeff Dean, who leads a Google AI research unit called Brain. With its new chip, they can use all the information. That means better trained and potentially more accurate AI software.  The new chip may let researchers use image data that currently sits unused because of high computing costs, according to Fei-Fei Li, an AI expert who runs a machine learning group inside Google’s Cloud business division. Image classification is one of the machine learning tools Li’s team is offering cloud clients, and the new chip will make this more accessible and usable.  eBay Inc used Google’s cloud to develop ShopBot software that identifies items snapped on smartphone cameras. Today’s image-recognition systems have around 10% accuracy, said R.J. Pittman, eBay’s chief product officer. The new Cloud TPU, which eBay has not yet tested, could eventually increase accuracy to more than 90%, he added.  Companies like EBay want AI to tag every physical good in existence. Li imagines businesses that may want to map every square inch on earth or each minute part of a human cell.  Amazon and Microsoft have their own AI-powered cloud services too though, and both have committed to buy Nvidia’s Volta chips. “Nvidia is not standing still,” said Pittman from eBay, which also buys Nvidia GPUs.  Holzle dismissed a direct rivalry. Nvidia’s chips are built for more general-purpose tasks, he said, while Google’s focus solely on machine learning.  That won’t calm Intel and Nvidia investors, who worry about in-house chipmaking efforts by their largest customers – datacentre operators like Google. Analysts are concerned that revenue and profitability at the two companies, both at historically high levels, may be dented. Even if Google doesn’t succeed in commercialising its own chips, it’s in a better position to negotiate on price.  Google isn’t restricting cloud customers to its own chips. It has Intel and Nvidia processors running inside its datacentres. Google’s pushing a Lego-like model – corporate customers can chose their combination of software and hardware, and rent storage and computing power by the minute. It has to be flexible if it’s going to catch AWS and Microsoft.  ”Down the road, we make actually pick the hardware for you that minimizes your cost or maximises your turnaround time or whatever you tell us is important to you,” Holzle said. “It becomes invisible to you.” — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Qualcomm sues four Apple contract manufacturers WannaCry ransomware: should users pay the ransom money?

While the company usually takes that opportunity to showcase new advancements in its software platforms and tools for app developers, it’s expected to additionally unveil three updated MacBook models. That’s according to sources who told Bloomberg that the Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pro will get a faster Intel 7th-gen Core (Kaby Lake) processors, while the 12-inch MacBook and the older 13-inch MacBook Air are also slated to get a speed boost by way of faster Intel CPUs. LIVE AT It’s worth noting that these are merely just upgrades meant to keep Apple’s laptop lineup alive: all three machines are expected to look the same as their predecessors with updates restricted to the internal components – so don’t expect to be be able to tell the new launches apart from previous models. The company will likely announce updates to MacOS as well, which will certainly be worth following WWDC for. Apple has been catching flak for neglecting its desktop platform lately, and it’ll be interesting to see if it can reinvigorate users’ interest in the OS – particularly when Microsoft is advancing in leaps and bounds with Windows 10.

The newspaper suggested that the president-elect knew about the investigation, which probed the Flynn Intel Group’s contract with a Dutch firm owned by a Turkish businessman to run a campaign to allegedly discredit US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, blamed by Ankara for staging the 2016 failed coup. Flynn was forced to resign after only 24 days in office. He has since been at the center of accusations against Trump over his campaign’s alleged ties to Russia after he purportedly discussed US sanctions on Russia with its envoy to the United States, Sergey Kislyak. Last week, Trump fired FBI director James Comey, raising claims of a cover-up. An explosive report emerged in the New York Times this Tuesday suggesting the US president had asked Comey to close the probe into Flynn’s links to Russia. Russia has repeatedly denied US claims that it meddled in the 2016 presidential vote, calling such allegations absurd. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said Moscow did not have official contacts with Trump's team during the campaign. ...

Promote your Business on Economictimes.com for free and reach out to millions of potential Customers List Your Business Find Service Near You At the I/O developer conference last year, Google debuted its first chip. The company kept the component mostly for internal artificial intelligence needs. Today, version two arrived -- and Google is selling this one. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai announced the new chip on Wednesday during a keynote address at the Alphabet Inc. unit’s annual I/O event. Normally, the gathering focuses on mobile software. This year’s spotlight on hardware underscores Pichai’s effort to transform the search giant into an "AI-first" company and a real cloud-computing contender. Companies will be able to purchase the hardware, called Cloud Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), through a Google Cloud service. Google hopes it will quicken the pace of AI advancements. And despite official statements to the contrary, it may also threaten Intel Corp. and Nvidia Corp., the main suppliers of powerful semiconductors that run large processing tasks. "This is basically a supercomputer for machine learning," Urs Hölzle, Google’s veteran technical chief, said. Machine learning, a method for deciphering patterns in reams of data, is behind Google’s recent progress on voice recognition, text translation and search rankings. But the approach cost a lot, and sucked up computing time in Google’s data centers. The latest chip was designed to address these issues, and executives said they saw dramatic improvements after putting the component to work on these internal tasks. Google wouldn’t divulge the chip’s price, what company manufactures it, or when the related cloud service goes on sale. Google still purchases processors from Intel and Nvidia. But by relying more on in-house designs, Google could trim its multi-billion-dollar annual computing bill. Google plans more chips like this, and sees the components as essential for success in the cloud -- a key part of Alphabet’s push to make money beyond digital advertising. Other non-advertising announcements from the conference included new voice-based commerce features for Google’s digital Assistant and physical photo books selling for $9.99 or more. "The field is rapidly evolving," Hölzle said. "For us, it’s very important to advance machine learning for our own purposes and to be the best cloud." During his morning keynote, Pichai also introduced a flurry of machine learning updates for Google products, and unveiled a new web portal housing all of the company’s AI efforts. Google’s cloud business grew by more than 80 percent last year, according to estimates from Synergy Research Group. But Amazon Web Services still has over 40 percent of the public cloud market, and continues to expand at a steady clip. Google is third, according to industry estimates. To gain share, Google is leaning on its AI prowess. The Cloud TPU chip won’t be sold to Dell Inc. and other makers of servers that power traditional corporate data centers. To get the benefits, customers will have to sign up for a Google cloud service and run their software tasks and store their data on Google’s equipment. If companies get on board, Google insists, they can plumb their own data for unseen efficiency gains and profit. AWS and no. 2 player Microsoft Corp., make similar cases. So Google’s pitch stresses performance. A single Cloud TPU device, composed of four chips, is nearly 12,000 times faster than IBM’S Deep Blue supercomputer, the famous chess victor from 1997, Hölzle said. Google is stringing 64 of the devices into "pods" that sit in its data centers. Google unveiled its chip at last year’s I/O conference, so why does it need another? First, the company is going up against rivals that develop and deliver faster processors on an annual cadence. To lock in customers, it must match that pace. In addition, the original chip only worked for "inference," processing data that’s already packaged in mathematical models. It’s akin to compressing large photos into tiny digital formats. For instance, a company could turn an algorithm for voice recognition into an app using inference chips. To create an algorithm from just raw voices, you need lots of data to train AI software. That takes massive computing power, forcing coders to wait days or weeks to see results. Google’s second chip speeds up the training process. In internal tests, it cut the time in half compared to commercially available graphic processing units, known as GPUs. Nvidia, the dominant GPU manufacturer, recently announced a new chip, called Volta, that handles training data like Google’s Cloud TPU. An eight-chip Volta module will sell for $149,000 starting in the third quarter. Google is less experienced at selling chips, so it’s being cautious about commercial deployment. "When you have something that’s really new, some of the tools occasionally break. You want to reach a certain level of maturity," Hölzle said. "We’re probably going to have a lot more demand than we can satisfy." Excessive demand inspired the creation of TPUs in the first place, according to company lore. Six years ago, Google saw an uptick in voice searches on phones. Just three minutes of conversation a day, per Android phone user, would have doubled the number of data centers Google needed, based on its technology at the time. TPUs were designed to handle the extra volume more efficiently. The second-generation chip accelerated Google’s own research. For its translation efforts, Google previously ignored more than eighty percent of its data at the training stage, according to Jeff Dean, who leads a Google AI research unit called Brain. With its new chip, they can use all the information. That means better trained and potentially more accurate AI software. The new chip may let researchers use image data that currently sits unused because of high computing costs, according to Fei-Fei Li, an AI expert who runs a machine learning group inside Google’s Cloud business division. Image classification is one of the machine learning tools Li’s team is offering cloud clients, and the new chip will make this more accessible and usable. EBay Inc. used Google’s cloud to develop ShopBot software that identifies items snapped on smartphone cameras. Today’s image-recognition systems have around ten percent accuracy, said R.J. Pittman, EBay’s Chief Product Officer. The new Cloud TPU, which EBay has not yet tested, could eventually increase accuracy to more than 90 percent, he added. Companies like EBay want AI to tag every physical good in existence. Li imagines businesses that may want to map every square inch on earth or each minute part of a human cell. Amazon and Microsoft have their own AI-powered cloud services too though, and both have committed to buy Nvidia’s Volta chips. "Nvidia is not standing still," said Pittman from EBay, which also buys Nvidia GPUs. Hölzle dismissed a direct rivalry. Nvidia’s chips are built for more general-purpose tasks, he said, while Google’s focus solely on machine learning. That won’t calm Intel and Nvidia investors, who worry about in-house chipmaking efforts by their largest customers -- data center operators like Google. Analysts are concerned that revenue and profitability at the two companies, both at historically high levels, may be dented. Even if Google doesn’t succeed in commercializing its own chips, it’s in a better position to negotiate on price. Google isn’t restricting cloud customers to its own chips. It has Intel and Nvidia processors running inside its data centers. Google’s pushing a Lego-like model -- corporate customers can chose their combination of software and hardware, and rent storage and computing power by the minute. It has to be flexible if it’s going to catch AWS and Microsoft. "Down the road, we make actually pick the hardware for you that minimizes your cost or maximizes your turnaround time or whatever you tell us is important to you," Hölzle said. "It becomes invisible to you."

MacBook Pro aficionados did not like the decision that Apple took to have a Skylake chip running under the hood of the new laptop. This decision probably prevented many Mac users to upgrade to the new 2016 model of the MacBook Pro. However, it seems like the moment that everybody is waiting for is finally coming very soon. Rumor has it that Apple might launch the updated MacBook Pro as early as next month. According to Bloomberg, Apple is expected to release a slew of hardware products during the upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, CA. The event, which is normally used for software-related announcements, will be held from June 5 to 9. Among the products to be unveiled is the MacBook Pro 2017. While the new laptop will not include any aesthetic changes, most of the updates will happen inside. Chief of which is the change from Skylake to Kaby Lake processors from Intel. MacBook Pro 2016 (via apple.com) In addition to the MacBook Pro, the event will also introduce a new MacBook as well as the MacBook Air. This would probably come as a surprise to everyone as Apple somewhat alienated the MacBook Air last year when it released the MacBook Pro. At the time, the company wanted consumers to choose the basic MacBook Pro as a replacement for the ultra-light laptop. However, it only led to more orders for the MacBook Air. So, instead of getting rid of the model altogether, it has decided to thrown in a few upgrades to the MacBook Air as well. As mentioned, readers should note that the upgrades will not be anything major. The most that Apple will do is update the processor and memory across its range of laptops. The only reason that Apple is releasing upgraded MacBooks is to regain interests in response to increasing demands for Microsoft products. Also, Apple wants consumers to realize that the company is still invested in its range of computer products. For more updates on the MacBook Pro 2017, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

The New York Times reports that Flynn and his legal team informed Donald McGahn, the current White House counsel, about the investigation on Jan. 4. In August, while he was advising the Trump campaign, Flynn signed a contract with Inovo BV, a Dutch consulting firm linked to the Turkish government. The Daily Caller first reported the relationship on Nov. 11, just days after Trump won the election. (RELATED: Michael Flynn Is Lobbying For Turkish Businessman Connected To Government) On that same day, hours before Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton, Flynn published an op-ed at The Hill calling for the extradition of Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based Muslim cleric. It was a strange position for Flynn to stake out, but one which was heavily supported by the Turkish government and its president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. On Nov. 18, Trump chose Flynn as his national security adviser. According to The Times, Flynn’s lobbying work is the subject of a grand jury subpoena signed by Dana Boente, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia and the acting attorney general for DOJ’s National Security Division. The subpoena, which The Times reviewed, asks for records of Flynn’s consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, and several of its associates, including Ekim Alptekin, the owner of Inovo BV. Alptekin serves as chairman of the Turkey-U.S. Business Council, a trade group controlled by the Turkish government. As part of the contract between Flynn and Alptekin, Flynn agreed to investigate Gulen using an investigative team comprised of former intelligence community officials. Flynn’s team met with Alptekin and two top Turkish government ministers in New York City on Sept. 19. The Justice Department first notified Flynn of its interest in his lobbying activities on Nov. 30. (RELATED: New Disclosures Reveal The Next Scandal That Would Have Hit Michael Flynn) “In light of that editorial and reports in the media about potential ties between Lt. Gen. Flynn and others who might be acting on behalf of the government of Turkey, on Nov. 30, NSD requested additional information from Lt. Gen. Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc.,” reads the DOJ memo, a readout of which was provided to TheDC in March. (RELATED: What Prompted Michael Flynn To Register As A Foreign Agent Of Turkey) Flynn hired a lawyer weeks after being contacted by DOJ. The attorney, Robert Kelner, informed McGahn of the investigation on Jan. 4. A week later he responded to the Justice Department and informed the agency that Flynn would likely be registering as a foreign agent of Turkey. Flynn did so only on March 8, nearly three weeks after Trump fired him for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about phone calls he had with Russia’s ambassador. It is unclear how the investigation into Flynn’s work for the Turkish government factors into the ongoing investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government. Flynn is said to be one of the subjects of that investigation.

Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ... * The President's legislative and policy agenda will be diluted and delayed * Sell stocks as risk is underpriced * Buy gold as a protective strategy and for diversification purposes "News broke late Tuesday of Mr. Comey's contemporaneous notes that Mr. Trump asked him in February to "let this go," referring to the FBI probe of axed National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. The White House denied that account of the conversation, but that would be more credible if its previous statements were more reliable. Mr. Trump's strife and insults with the intelligence community were also bound to invite blowback. The Post report is sourced to "current and former U.S. officials," which raises the question of how former officials are privy to "code word" information, defined as anything that could be expected to cause "exceptionally grave damage" to national security if disclosed. In that case the public leaks about Mr. Trump's actions, if true, will do more damage than whatever he said in private. Mr. Trump is considering a White House shakeup, including cleaning out many of his top aides, but the White House always reflects the President's governing style. If Mr. Trump can't discipline himself, then no Jim Baker ex machina will make much difference. Mr. Trump needs to appreciate how close he is to losing the Republicans he needs to pass the agenda that will determine if he is successful. Weeks of pointless melodrama and undisciplined comments have depleted public and Capitol Hill attention from health care and tax reform, and exhaustion is setting in. America holds elections every two years, and Mr. Trump's policy allies in Congress will drift away if he looks like a liability. Millions of Americans recognized Mr. Trump's flaws but decided he was a risk worth taking. They assumed, or at least hoped, that he'd rise to the occasion and the demands of the job. If he cannot, he'll betray their hopes as his Presidency sinks before his eyes." - Wall Street Journal, "Loose Lips Sinks Presidencies: The Russian Intel Story Shows the Price of Trump's Lost Credibility" It is growing increasingly clear that, at best, the Trump administration's policy initiatives -- tax and regulatory reform and various fiscal endeavors, including infrastructure spending and cash repatriation -- probably will be delayed and diluted. At worst, the decline of Trump's presidency is now coming into focus. Over the last few weeks the descent in the president's fortunes has accelerated, owing in part to the following events and paths: * FBI Director Mike Comey was fired in the middle of a Russian investigation. This followed the canning of former U.S. Attorney Preet Bahrara and former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, the former of whom was embarking on his own investigation of Trump's campaign team and Russian officials and the other had objected to the administration's immigration policy as well as Michael Flynn's background. * President Trump warned former FBI Director Comey of tapes of their private conversation. * President Trump apparently revealed classified information to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador. * Finally, it was recently claimed that a Comey memo reveals that the president attempted ("I hope you get let this go") to shut down the FBI probe of Flynn, raising the flames of possible obstruction of justice. I expressed concern about six months ago in my 15 Surprises for 2017 that we'd see fighting, internal chaos and a president increasingly isolated, enraged, unable to be contained and out of touch with the requirements of the presidency. When Presidents Nixon and Clinton (and others) ran afoul, their minions circled the wagons. By contrast and in a break with history, Donald Trump is much like the day trader who essentially operates by himself. As such, the vulnerability, and even demise, of the administration may be closer at hand than many realize. And the associated uncertainties may not be market-friendly. Jim "El Capitan" Cramer, in "Selling on Trump Presidency Troubles? Are You Kidding Me?," believes one shouldn't panic and sell stocks based on a presidential spiral. I respectfully disagree as it is my view that the cumulative impact of Trump's actions finally may take hold on an overvalued market (most valuation metrics are in the 95% decile) in which risk is underpriced and where stock prices have been overly inflated by the explosion in ETF popularity and quant strategies that are agnostic to balance sheets and income statements and that worship at the altar of price momentum, and in a overall market in which leadership is narrowing and showing other technical weaknesses. In the near term, all of the administration's economic initiatives likely will come to a stop in a collision course of credibility. I started today's missive with yesterday's Wall Street Journal editorial, which followed an earlier late-March editorial, "A President's Credibility": "Falsehoods are eroding public trust, at home and abroad... If President Trump announces that North Korea launched a missile that landed within 100 miles of Hawaii, would most Americans believe him? Would the rest of the world? We're not sure, which speaks to the damage that Mr. Trump is doing to his Presidency with his seemingly endless stream of exaggerations, evidence-free accusations, implausible denials and other falsehoods... Yet the President clings to his assertion like a drunk to an empty gin bottle, rolling out his press spokesman to make more dubious claims... Two months into his Presidency, Gallup has Mr. Trump's approval rating at 39%. No doubt Mr. Trump considers that fake news, but if he doesn't show more respect for the truth, most Americans may conclude he's a fake President." Donald Trump, as I initially feared in my 15 Surprises for 2017, appears to be continually obsessed by the media, doesn't seem capable of restraining himself and his administration is disorganized. The president, under the guise of trying to be seen as a strong leader, continues to raise more questions than answers in both the domestic and foreign arenas. I am sticking with Surprise #4: Surprise #4: "The Unartful Deal" -- President Trump's Popularity Quickly Fades as "The Dude (Doesn't ) Abide." And based on what we have witnessed in the administration's first few months I will also stick with Surprise #5: Surprise #5: Trump Grows Restless After Some Failed Initiatives and Loss of Support. He Begins to Lose Interest in His Job After He Finds Out How Hard It Is to Get Anything Done and Becomes The First Part-Time President in History. Bottom Line The President's legislative and policy agenda is now likely on hold. As Tom Brokaw said recently on " Morning Joe": " There are burning fuses everywhere (in the Trump administration). They are not small ... I have talked to numerous business people in the last few days and they are appalled." The markets have risen on the assumption that the new president would be successful in his bold agenda of regulatory and tax reform and aggressive fiscal policy programs. With housing, retail and autos all peaking, I reject the notion put forward by some that the rate of growth in the domestic economy is reaccelerating and that this trumps the success of the administration's agenda. Meanwhile, rising gold (up $11 this morning), a contained 10-year U.S. note yield (2.29% this morning) and sinking commodities markets (the price of oil has fallen to close to October 2016 lows) seem to be negative economic and market "tells" that up to recently had been ignored. The first few months of the Trump administration have been a test of the president's business acumen. Can his "art of the business deal" be translated into the "art of the political deal" in Washington, D.C.? Arguably, the body of evidence is that the administration has not been successful -- to some, it is failing spectacularly. From my perch, the markets are overvalued and risk remains (perhaps dramatically) underpriced. Given recent White House developments, the " hockey stick" projections and consensus of rapid profit growth in 2017 and 2018 seems to now be "pie in the sky." What is dangerous is that consensus sentiment, political, profit and economic expectations are inflated at a time in which many valuation metrics are in the 95% decile. Moreover, as the Divine Ms. M writes this morning, the technical are eroding: *Breadth is lagging as leadership narrows *The put/call ratio for equities is under 60% for the third consecutive day By my gauge, the market's downside risk substantially exceeds the upside reward -- perhaps by as much as 4:1. As I said back in late 2016 , Donald Trump will make market volatility and economic and profit uncertainty great again. The market seas are growing more turbulent as The Orange Swan looms ever closer. T.I.N.A. (there is no alternative) is B.S. C .I.T.A. (cash is the alternative) should be considered. Be less concerned about return on capital and more concerned with return of capital. Sell stocks, buy gold. Doug Kass is president of Seabreeze Partners Management Inc.

Read: Trump Says He Had an 'Absolute Right' to Give Classified Intel to Russia “The markets were on track for their largest daily declines in nearly two months,” according to Market Watch. By the closing bell at 3:30 on Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial fell 310 points and the S&P 500 dropped 1.6 percent, with financials tumbling 3.1 percent to lead decliners.   The drop grows due to the political turmoil in Washington following news of a memo from former FBI Director James Comey, in which he describes a meeting in the Oval Office where Trump allegedly asked him to drop the investigation of ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn. "I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go." the Comey memo quotes Trump as saying. “He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go." Comey writes that he replied to the president: "I agree he is a good guy." The White House issued a flat-out denial declaring, "This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation." Meanwhile, Trump's mood "has become sour and dark" and he has unleashed his fury on his staff, including son-in-law Jared Kushner — calling them "incompetent," The New York Times reported.  During a GOP dinner Tuesday night, Arizona Senator John McCain said Trump’s scandals have reached "Watergate size and scale." Many have called for the president to be impeached, including Rep. Al Green (D-Texas), who asked for the action Wednesday morning on the House floor. Trump left Washington Wednesday morning and headed to New London, Conn., where he will give the commencement address at The Coast Guard Academy. Read: Speculation Grows About Sean Spicer's Ouster After Melissa McCarthy Reprises Role on 'SNL' Following a bombshell report in The Washington Post that Trump shared classified intelligence with Russia on the battle against ISIS, Vladimir Putin has spoken out on Trump’s troubles, calling them "political schizophrenia." "This is the only thing I can think of when I hear allegations saying that the president has revealed some secrets to [Russian Foreign Minister Sergey] Lavrov," Putin said. Putin added that he was ready to provide recordings of the exchange that took place in the Oval Office last Wednesday.

Gaming 4 0 0 May 19, 2017 ‘Destiny 2’ PC Impressions: Gameplay, Graphics, Controls, Battle.net Exclusivity, And A Later Release? Scott Grill Destiny 2 made its debut on PC during Bungie’s gameplay reveal event Thursday at the Jet Center in Los Angeles, California. The shooter franchise spent the first three years of its life on PlayStation and Xbox consoles. However, Bungie and Activision are attempting to extend the game’s community to a broader audience and they are not holding back. I was able to go hands-on with both the PC and PlayStation 4 Pro during the Destiny 2 gameplay reveal event. The brand new Crucible mode, Countdown, was available to play on the PC along with the first mission, titled “Homecoming.” Battle.net Exclusivity As big as Destiny 2 coming to PC is, exclusivity to Battle.net is even bigger. As previously covered, this gives Bungie instant access to Blizzard’s wealth of networking tools for multiplayer matchmaking and anti-cheat. It’s not perfect, but it is excellent and far better than the level of support the game would have received on Steam, where Bungie would be one of hundreds of clients for Valve. A big one, but competing for attention none the less. Blizzard will continue to manage the network services while Bungie maintains the servers. The downside is any potential for cross-play and cross-save is currently a non-starter. No Dedicated Servers On the subject of servers, it is with great disappointment that it has been confirmed Destiny 2 will not support dedicated servers. Would it have been the solution to all of the problems the original game faced with DDoS attacks and lag-switch cheaters? Possibly not, but we’ll never know. Hopefully, Bungie will be able to address these issues through other changes. [Image by Bungie / Activision] Gorgeous Graphics In all honesty, Destiny 2 looks astounding on the PC. The 4K resolution and uncapped framerate serve the game well in both PvE and PvP. Textures on the PlayStation 4 Pro version looked compressed by comparison with the occasionally anti-aliasing issue. The console version still looks and runs great and is a huge step up from Destiny currently. The difference between the two platforms was just obvious switching between the two because PC looks that good. The 4K resolution and uncapped framerate will come with a cost, however. Destiny 2 was running on PCs sporting Intel i7-7700k processors, NVidia GTX 1080 Ti graphics processors, and 16GB of RAM. How mid-range PCs might look and run is certainly up for debate. If you have a 4K monitor, you can check out two 4K screenshots of Destiny 2 on NVidia’s GeForce website. Gameplay Destiny 2 makes the switch from controller to mouse and keyboard rather effortlessly. I found the default settings to be too twitchy during my time playing, but the required mouse sensitivity settings are there to adjust the speed of the mouse movements. One thing that I did miss playing on PC is the rumble feedback in the controller. This is one area that Bungie got right over many other shooters and I found the absence almost jarring after playing Destiny for three years. Otherwise, the gameplay feel in Destiny 2 is much the same that exists in Destiny today. Still, it will be interesting to see how the mouse and keyboard affects the level of competition in Destiny. Headshots can be pulled off with aplomb on consoles thanks to aim assist, but not quite the same as with the PC’s default controls. Will this cause differences by favoring accuracy dependent weapons like scout rifles, hand cannons, and sniper rifles? That remains to be seen. [Image by Bungie / Activision] All the Options Games released across PC and console platforms have a bad reputation of shorting the PC platform when it comes to options. Destiny 2 does not fall into that trap yet, as the initial customization options are plentiful and include keyboard remapping, text chat, support for ultra widescreen (21:9) monitors, Field of View slider, and other “detailed PC adjustments,” per the press materials provided by Activision. A Later Release While Destiny 2 on the PC is very promising at this early date, there is one piece of news potential fans will find disappointing. Bungie is currently listing it as “Coming Soon,” with a release likely to come sometime after the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. That’s not terribly surprising as consoles are likely the lead platform for Destiny 2 with one of Bungie’s partner studios – Vicarious Visions or High Moon Studios – responsible for porting the game to PC. How much of a delay between the console and PC release will be something to watch, however.

Carolyn Kaster AP Vice President Mike Pence and National Security Adviser Michael Flynn shook hands before a news conference featuring President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the White House Feb. 10. Carolyn Kaster AP Politics & Government May 18, 2017 8:02 PM How could Trump, Pence not have known Flynn was lobbying for Turkey? By Vera Bergengruen vbergengruen@mcclatchydc.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON As questions mounted Thursday about whether Michael Flynn used his position as Donald Trump’s No. 1 foreign policy adviser to benefit foreign countries he’d been paid to represent, it became increasingly clear that the Trump administration had been warned about his secretive lobbying ties. The White House has maintained that President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence did not know that Flynn was acting as a foreign agent until he registered with the Justice Department in March. But Trump officials were alerted on at least three separate occasions that the incoming national security adviser was being paid to represent Turkish interests. Despite those warnings, Flynn was allowed to attend classified intelligence briefings after August, first as an adviser to candidate Trump, and then as the president’s national security adviser. [READ MORE: Flynn stopped military plan Turkey opposed – after being paid as its agent] Flynn retroactively registered as a foreign agent on March 7, filing paperwork with the Justice Department that showed he received more than $530,000 for work that “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.” He disclosed in that same filing that he secretly met in a New York hotel with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and energy minister Berat Albayrak, who is President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s son-in-law. There’s nothing nefarious about doing anything that’s legal as long as the proper paperwork if filed. White House press secretary Sean Spicer on March 9 Trump fired Flynn on Feb. 13 for misleading Pence about his conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the United States. But neither Pence nor Trump have acknowledged they knowing anything before then about Flynn’s foreign connections. Pence’s office reiterated that stand on Thursday. “The Vice President stands by his comments in March upon first hearing the news regarding General Flynn’s ties to Turkey and fully supports the president’s decision to ask for General Flynn’s resignation,” his office said in a statement. But there are reasons to doubt those assertions. Nov. 18 Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., was among the first to warn the Trump team of Flynn’s ties to Turkey, writing a letter on Nov. 18 to Pence, who was then hearing Trump’s transition team, that Flynn was lobbying on behalf of a Turkey-linked Dutch company. Trump had announced his intention to name Flynn national security adviser on the previous day. Cummings also warned that under U.S. regulations, Flynn was ineligible to receive classified briefings, which he’d been receiving since August, because of his role as a foreign agent. [READ MORE: Trump transition was told of Flynn’s lobbying, congressman’s letter to Pence shows] Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, warned Pence that Flynn was “receiving classified briefings during the presidential campaign while his consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, Inc., was being paid to lobby the U.S. Government on behalf of a foreign government’s interests.” He also asked for information and statements regarding potential conflicts of interests. “If the vice president had heeded my warnings, it’s clear now he could have prevented the problems that occurred with Lt. Gen. Flynn,” Cummings said when Flynn’s disclosures came out. The letter, a copy of which was shared with McClatchy in March, would seem to contradict the White House’s claims that neither Pence nor Trump knew of Flynn’s lobbying until his Justice Department filing. “Hearing that story today was the first I’d heard of it,” Pence told Fox News after Flynn filed the disclosures, a statement he repeated twice. White House press secreetary Sean Spicer also declared in March that Trump was unaware that Flynn was acting as a foreign agent when he appointed him to be his national security adviser. “He didn’t file until two days ago, so therefore, nobody would have known that because he hadn’t filed as a foreign agent until two days ago,” Spicer insisted on March 10. He deflected reporters’ questions on why Cummings’ letter did not raise red flags by pointing out the retired lieutenant general’s “impeccable credentials.” Jan. 4 An opinion piece Flynn wrote for The Hill the day of the election, titled “Our ally Turkey is in crisis and needs our support,” which made the case for some of the Turkish government’s top priorities, raised suspicions at the Justice Department that Flynn was working as a foreign agent. Soon after, they notified Flynn that they were looking into his lobbying ties. Flynn’s lawyer disclosed that investigation to Trump’s transition team on Jan. 4, The New York Times reported Wednesday. On Thursday, the White House pushed back on the New York Times report, calling it “flat wrong.” “Neither Michael Flynn nor his attorneys told Transition Counsel that he was under federal investigation for secretly working as a paid lobbyist for Turkey during the campaign,” a White House spokesman told NBC. Early January In January, Flynn’s personal lawyer reportedly spoke to Trump officials, including incoming White House counsel Don McGahn, to let them know that Flynn might register as a foreign agent and seeking their guidance. Spicer all but confirmed that this had happened. At a press briefing in March, he asserted that Flynn’s lawyer “was instructed that that wasn’t the role of the transition, and that it was up to the personal lawyer to work with the appropriate authorities” to determine whether Flynn must register. “It’s not something that would be appropriate for a government entity to give someone guidance on when they should file as an individual -- as a private citizen,” Spicer said. That answer confirms that Flynn’s lawyer raised the topic. Contacted Thursday, the White House did not respond to McClatchy’s request for comment on why that information was not shared with the president and vice president. After Jan. 20 Sometime after the inauguration, according to a report by the Associated Press, Flynn’s representatives had a second conversation with Trump’s lawyers and told them that Flynn had decided to register with the Justice Department. But that conversation apparently did not trigger any alarm or find its way to either Pence or Trump. Flynn continued to participate in the president’s daily intelligence briefings and took part in his exchanges with foreign leaders, including Russian President Valdimir Putin, until he was fired Feb. 13.

Now @evleaks has posted images of the device and also said that it will just be called the Surface Pro, and not the Surface Pro 5. In a recent interview to CNET Microsoft’s devices chief, Panos Panay said that  “You’ll see that same meaningful impact when Pro 5, or Pro Next hits the market, and there’s no such thing as a Pro 5.” Looks like he meant the Surface Pro 5 name. According to images this looks similar to the predecessor. Even the placement of slots, including the Surface power connector and the Type Cover looks similar. It also comes with the Surface Pen in different colors. We expect to see refresh in hardware with Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processors offering improved performance.

Pressure for the appointment had been mounting since President Trump fired the last FBI chief James Comey last week. The FBI and Congress are already investigating possible links between the president’s campaign team and Russia over the election; US intelligence agencies believe Moscow tried to influence the outcome in Trump’s favour. “A thorough investigation will confirm what we already know – there was no collusion between my campaign and any foreign entity,” the president said in a statement. Republicans and Democrats in Congress have welcomed Mueller’s appointment, which was made by the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. “To bring in someone like Robert Mueller that has already worked within the FBI that it looks like he’s going to work within the FBI process, you’ve got a prime decision maker they’re working within the process. It’s a good hybrid to be able to keep the career folks at FBI and to be able to make sure they can continue their job. But you have an independent person as the final decision maker in the direction,” said Republican Senator James Lankford. Robert Mueller as #SpecialCounsel for DOJ's Russia probe is positive news. Mueller & Intel Cmte will both follow the facts wherever it leads— Sen. James Lankford (@SenatorLankford) May 18, 2017 “I was very, very pleased, first that he was appointed, and second that it was Bob Mueller who is a terrific guy with unimpeachable integrity. So I was very pleased to see that,” said Democratic Congressman Jim Himes. “I think it’s a good start in the right direction. This administration with the new president has been in crisis from week to week. One thing after the other,” added another Democrat, John Conyers. In an otherwise sordid week, I am very pleased w/the appointment of Bob Mueller as special prosecutor. Great integrity, deep respect at FBI.— Jim Himes (@jahimes) May 17, 2017 The appointment follows a week of turmoil for the White House. There have been allegations that Trump disclosed classified information to senior Russian officials in a meeting at the White House. Earlier this week it was claimed that former FBI director James Comey, who was fired by Trump, wrote in a memo that the president had asked him to end an investigation into ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn’s ties with Russia. The reports raise questions about whether the president improperly tried to interfere with a federal investigation. It’s thought the investigations now to be led by Mueller could last for several years – threatening to cast a long shadow over the Trump presidency.

The company had been widely expected to announce its new Surface Pro 5 at that event, replacing the Surface Pro 4, which is now over 18 months old. Recent reports suggested that the new tablet would be a modest evolution of its predecessor, with only a handful of minor changes. Today, serial leakster Evan Blass (better known as @evleaks) published images on VentureBeat purporting to show the device with the new Surface Arc Mouse, which Microsoft revealed alongside the Surface Laptop. You'll probably have a tough time spotting the differences between the new tablet and the Pro 4, though. Indeed, the new Windows 10 tablet appears virtually identical to the existing device, including the same 3.5mm headphone jack, Mini DisplayPort and USB Type-A port as the Pro 4, with no new-generation USB-C ports. Microsoft also excluded USB-C ports from the Surface Laptop, despite having tested prototypes with two of those ports built in. Evan - who has an excellent reputation when it comes to revealing devices before they're officially announced - referred to the new model as the 'Surface Pro 4 refresh', but in a separate tweet, he also revealed that the device won't be referred to by that name, nor will it be called the Surface Pro 5. Instead, it seems that Microsoft will release the new tablet as the 'Surface Pro' - the same name as its Windows 8 Pro machine that went on sale in February 2013. FYI, it's now known as simply the Surface Pro #4nomore — Evan Blass (@evleaks) May 19, 2017 Notably, Microsoft's Panos Panay said last week that "there's no such thing as a Surface Pro 5". While the device may not differ much externally from its predecessor, it will feature some upgraded specs, including Intel's latest seventh-generation Kaby Lake processors. According to Evan, the new Surface Pro tablet will have new Pen and Type Cover color options too, which are said to be "similar - but not identical - to the recently-launched Surface Laptop's palette": Microsoft is not expected to announce a new Surface Book at the May 23 event; the company only released its refreshed Surface Book with Performance Base models in 13 new markets a few weeks ago, after unveiling them in October. In addition to the new Surface Pro tablet, we also know that Microsoft will officially launch its HoloLens mixed reality headset in China at the same event, with shipping due to begin on the following day.

At the Tizen Developer Conference (TDC) in San Francisco, Samsung Electronics announced version 4.0 of its Tizen Linux distribution, which for the first time includes functional variants of Tizen for different use cases. The first of these is a Tizen RT distribution designed for IoT devices, ranging from “high-end products such as TVs and mobile devices as well as low-end products such as thermostats, scales, bulbs, and more,” says Samsung. Artik 053 Tizen RT offers Linux-like tools and middleware elements, but is at heart a Nuttx-based RTOS. It’s initially available in a Cortex-R4 based, WiFi-enabled Samsung Artik 053 computer-on-module. (Tizen RT is detailed below, and the Artik 053 is covered in our separate Artik story.) Tizen 4.0 has added support for the Microsoft .NET and Xamarin UI frameworks, enabling C# based applications to be developed in Microsoft’s Visual Studio. Starting with version 4.0, Tizen will be made more accessible to third party device makers, which can “create their own IoT devices using the PDK (Platform Development Kit) based on Configurable Tizen,” said Hyogun Lee, EVP of Samsung Electronics and Chair of the Tizen Technical Steering Group, in a Samsung Q&A. Tizen 4.0 device makers will be able to update their IoT devices using a new Tizen Update Service, as well as connect their devices to an “OCF-Ready IoT Cloud like Samsung Connect,” Lee added. (The Open Connectivity Foundation is behind the Linux Foundation’s IoTivity framework, which is supported by Tizen RT.) Samsung revealed a partnership with Broadlink in China to add Tizen hooks in their processors, and said it was collaborating with smart home device manufacturer Commax in its home country of Korea. Samsung also revealed a Tizen-related collaboration with the location-based service provider Glympse in the U.S. Beyond that, there were few details on version 4.0 aside from the Tizen RT variant covered farther below.   Samsung Z4 Samsung Z4 Samsung announced its 4th gen Samsung Z4 smartphone, which is now shipping with Tizen 3.0, but will upgrade to 4.0 later in the year. Like earlier Tizen-based Samsung Zx phones, the Z4 is destined primarily for India, but will also follow its forebears to Russia, China, and a few other Asian countries. At TDC, Samsung Tizen Director, Hokyu Choi, announced an expansion into additional markets. Later this year, the Z4 and “other Tizen smartphones” will launch throughout Africa, as well as in Iran, Egypt, Pakistan, Bolivia, and Peru. The Samsung Z4 is several years behind cutting edge Samsung Android phones like the omnipresent Samsung Galaxy S7 and the new Galaxy S8, which runs Android 7.0 on Qualcomm’s 10nm, octa-core Snapdragon 835. Clearly, Samsung is not yet ready to give up the Android gravy train for a major push of its Tizen phones. However, it appears to be maneuvering Tizen into position in case it needs to make the switch., The Samsung Z4 has a quad-core, Spreadtrum 1.5GHz SoC with 1GB RAM and a 4.5-inch screen with lowly 800 x 480 resolution. The phone offers front and rear 5-megapixel cameras and wireless features led by a 4G LTE Cat 4. In other TDC news, Samsung announced some new Tizen 3.0 features that are available on the Z4. The company also announced that CalMAN with AutoCal autocalibration software is shipping on its 2017 QLED TVs, and revealed new voice recognition features and upcoming .NET integration in its Tizen 3.0-based Smart TVs.   Tizen RT Samsung first announced Tizen RT (Tizen Real Time) back in November, and has recently added more extensive documentation. The platform is designed for “Cortex-M/R processors with MPU, less than 2MB RAM, and less than 16MB Flash,” says Tizen.org’s Tizen RT wiki. The new Artik 053 module sits near the high end of Tizen RT’s range. Tizen RT architecture (click image to enlarge) Tizen RT competes directly with other new-age, wireless savvy RTOSes such as Intel’s Zephyr and ARM’s mBed. It’s built on a compact “TinyAra” RTOS, which in turn is derived from Nuttx, an open source RTOS commonly found on PixHawk-based drones. TinyAra has evolved into Tizen RT by adding Linux-like features such as an IPv4/IPv6 network stack, a SmartFS file system, a virtual file system (VFS), and a device monitor. The RTOS “adopts Linux-style development environments including POSIX API, BSD Socket API, Shell, and Kconfig build configuration,” says the wiki. Later this year, Tizen RT will add a JavaScript environment comprised of the lightweight JerryScript JavaScript engine for MCUs, as well as the JerryScript powered IoT.js framework. Other features include support for the IoTivity framework, including a lightweight database called AraStorage that can work with IoTivity to store sensor data. In addition, Tizen RT is adding support for the Lightweight Machine-to-machine (LWM2M) protocol. Tizen RT currently requires Samsung’s proprietary software update mechanism, but later this year will move to LWM2M’s open source OMA lightweight M2M FOTA updates. Tizen RT will soon add a microkernel architecture that keeps more peripheral kernel modules like file system, device drivers, and network stacks isolated from core kernel modules like scheduling, task, memory, and IPC. In addition, a service manager will offer self-healing recovery features. Build configurable options in Tien RT (left) and JavaScript architecture (click images to enlarge) Finally, Tizen RT is said to be build configurable, making it easier to set up stacks with different components depending on device capabilities and usage, as shown in the first diagram above. The diagram on the right, which shows the JerryScript architecture, lists the base level as being (RTOS/Linux). This suggests the architecture may eventually be ported to Samsung’s Linux-based Tizen devices, such as its higher end Artik modules.   The most successful Linux embedded OS in the world? At TDC, Samsung claimed that Tizen “has become the OS for nearly all of Samsung’s products” and has “proven itself as the most successful Linux-based embedded OS in the world.” Both statements are questionable, considering most Samsung’s smartphones — and smartphones in general — run the Linux-based Android. Tizen is much more like mainstream Linux, however, so if you exclude Android, the claims have more merit. Samsung Smart TV It is true that Samsung has added Tizen-run embedded computers to many its consumer electronics products, including its Smart TVs, its Family Hub smart refrigerators, a few cameras, and some other appliances. In the “near future,” Tizen will appear in more home appliances “such as our Robot Cleaner, washing machines, air conditioners, and network speakers,” stated Samsung’s Hyogun Lee. Tizen 3.0 is now available for download on Samsung’s octa-core Cortex-A53 Artik 710, dual-core -A7 Artik 520, and quad-core -A9 Artik 530 module. However, the default installation is still Fedora Linux, and Ubuntu Core is available, as well.   Tizen smartwatches beat out Android Wear Tizen has perhaps found its greatest success in its Samsung Gear smartwatches. Tizen Experts recently revealed a Strategy Analytics report that estimated that Tizen smartwatches (i.e., Samsung Gear watches) took 19 percent of the smartwatch market in Q1 2017 for second place compared to 18 percent for all Android Wear watches combined. The Apple Watch led with 57 percent share. Gear S3 Tizen phones, however, have yet to make a major impact on the smartphone market outside of India, and Tizen is almost never seen in non-Samsung products. The Linux Foundation hosts the Tizen project, and Intel is still experimenting with the OS, but so far it remains a Samsung-dominated platform. Samsung is still struggling to get app developers to write for the platform, and the app library is still limited. Porting apps will be essential for taking on Android and iOS directly in the high-end mobile market. As noted, Samsung says it will make Tizen 4.0 more accessible to third party device developers. To do that, the company must convince them no only that Tizen has apps, but that it’s secure against malware attacks. The Tizen community was shaken last month by a Kaspersky Lab Security Analyst Summit presentation by security researcher Amihai Neiderman that claimed that Tizen was full of security flaws, including 40 previously unknown zero-day vulnerabilities. “It may be the worst code I’ve ever seen,” Neiderman told Motherboard. “Everything you can do wrong there, they do it.” Neiderman’s claims were published several weeks after WikiLeaks published CIA documents suggesting the agency can monitor people using their Tizen-based Smart TVs. This followed earlier reports that smart TV vendors like Samsung, LG (WebOS), and Vizio have been collecting information on their users’ viewing habits for marketing purposes. At TDC, Samsung made no major announcements regarding Tizen’s security. However, the Artik platform has added security features, especially in the new Artik 053. In addition, Samsung’s Lee stated said his company is using static code analysis tools, tightening code review, and continuously monitoring the security vulnerabilities of Tizen and related open source software and patching them regularly.” Lee went on to add: “Some of these patches will be tightly coupled with the Tizen code review system, with our aim to prevent vulnerable code from being merged into the Tizen code base at the first step of development.”   Further information More information on Samsung’s Tizen Developer Conference announcements may be found in the Samsung newsroom.
