Home About vMotion Publications @frankdenneman frankdenneman.nl CPU / Deep Dive NUMA Deep Dive Part 1: From UMA to NUMA by Frank Denneman · Published July 7, 2016 · Updated August 22, 2016 Non-uniform memory access (NUMA) is a shared memory architecture used in today's multiprocessing systems. Each CPU is assigned its own local memory and can access memory from other CPUs in the system. Local memory access provides a low latency - high bandwidth performance. While accessing memory owned by the other CPU has higher latency and lower bandwidth performance. Modern applications and operating systems such as ESXi support NUMA by default, yet to provide the best performance, virtual machine configuration should be done with the NUMA architecture in mind. If incorrect designed, inconsequent behavior or overall performance degradation occurs for that particular virtual machine or in worst case scenario for all VMs running on that ESXi host. This series aims to provide insights of the CPU architecture, the memory subsystem and the ESXi CPU and memory scheduler. Allowing you in creating a high performing platform that lays the foundation for the higher services and increased consolidating ratios. Before we arrive at modern compute architectures, it's helpful to review the history of shared-memory multiprocessor architectures to understand why we are using NUMA systems today. The evolution of shared-memory multiprocessors architecture in the last decades It seems that an architecture called Uniform Memory Access would be a better fit when designing a consistent low latency, high bandwidth platform. Yet modern system architectures will restrict it from being truly uniform. To understand the reason behind this we need to go back in history to identify the key drivers of parallel computing. With the introduction of relational databases in the early seventies the need for systems that could service multiple concurrent user operations and excessive data generation became mainstream. Despite the impressive rate of uniprocessor performance, multiprocessor systems were better equipped to handle this workload. In order to provide a cost-effective system, shared memory address space became the focus of research. Early on, systems using a crossbar switch were advocated, however with this design complexity scaled along with the increase of processors, which made the bus-based system more attractive. Processors in a bus system are allowed to access the entire memory space by sending requests on the bus, a very cost effective way to use the available memory as optimally as possible. However, bus-based systems have their own scalability problems. The main issue is the limited amount of bandwidth, this restrains the number of processors the bus can accommodate. Adding CPUs to the system introduces two major areas of concern: The available bandwidth per node decreases as each CPU added. The bus length increases when adding more processors, thereby increasing latency. The performance growth of CPU and specifically the speed gap between the processor and the memory performance was, and actually still is, devastating for multiprocessors. Since the memory gap between processor and memory was expected to increase, a lot of effort went into developing effective strategies to manage the memory systems. One of these strategies was adding memory cache, which introduced a multitude of challenges. Solving these challenges is still the main focus of today for CPU design teams, a lot of research is done on caching structures and sophisticated algorithms to avoid cache misses. Introduction of caching snoop protocols Attaching a cache to each CPU increases performance in many ways. Bringing memory closer to the CPU reduces the average memory access time and at the same time reducing the bandwidth load on the memory bus. The challenge with adding cache to each CPU in a shared memory architecture is that it allows multiple copies of a memory block to exist. This is called the cache-coherency problem. To solve this, caching snoop protocols were invented attempting to create a model that provided the correct data while not trying to eat up all the bandwidth on the bus. The most popular protocol, write invalidate, erases all other copies of data before writing the local cache. Any subsequent read of this data by other processors will detect a cache miss in their local cache and will be serviced from the cache of another CPU containing the most recently modified data. This model saved a lot of bus bandwidth and allowed for Uniform Memory Access systems to emerge in the early 1990s. Modern cache coherency protocols are covered in more detail by part 3. Uniform Memory Access Architecture Processors of Bus-based multiprocessors that experience the same - uniform - access time to any memory module in the system are often referred to as Uniform Memory Access (UMA) systems or Symmetric Multi-Processors (SMPs). With UMA systems, the CPUs are connected via a system bus (Front-Side Bus) to the Northbridge. The Northbridge contains the memory controller and all communication to and from memory must pass through the Northbridge. The I/O controller, responsible for managing I/O to all devices, is connected to the Northbridge. Therefore, every I/O has to go through the Northbridge to reach the CPU. Multiple buses and memory channels are used to double the available bandwidth and reduce the bottleneck of the Northbridge. To increase the memory bandwidth even further some systems connected external memory controllers to the Northbridge, improving bandwidth and support of more memory. However due the internal bandwidth of the Northbridge and the broadcasting nature of early snoopy cache protocols, UMA was considered to have a limited scalability. With today's use of high-speed flash devices, pushing hundreds of thousands of IO's per second, they were absolutely right that this architecture would not scale for future workloads. Non-Uniform Memory Access Architecture To improve scalability and performance three critical changes are made to the shared-memory multiprocessors architecture; Non-Uniform Memory Access organization Point-to-Point interconnect topology Scalable cache coherence solutions 1: Non-Uniform Memory Access organization NUMA moves away from a centralized pool of memory and introduces topological properties. By classifying memory location bases on signal path length from the processor to the memory, latency and bandwidth bottlenecks can be avoided. This is done by redesigning the whole system of processor and chipset. NUMA architectures gained popularity at the end of the 90's when it was used on SGI supercomputers such as the Cray Origin 2000. NUMA helped to identify the location of the memory, in this case of these systems, they had to wonder which memory region in which chassis was holding the memory bits. In the first half of the millennium decade, AMD brought NUMA to the enterprise landscape where UMA systems reigned supreme. In 2003 the AMD Opteron family was introduced, featuring integrated memory controllers with each CPU owning designated memory banks. Each CPU has now its own memory address space. A NUMA optimized operating system such as ESXi allows workload to consume memory from both memory addresses spaces while optimizing for local memory access. Let's use an example of a two CPU system to clarify the distinction between local and remote memory access within a single system. The memory connected to the memory controller of the CPU1 is considered to be local memory. Memory connected to another CPU socket (CPU2)is considered to be foreign or remote for CPU1. Remote memory access has additional latency overhead to local memory access, as it has to traverse an interconnect (point-to-point link) and connect to the remote memory controller. As a result of the different memory locations, this system experiences “non-uniform” memory access time. 2: Point-to-Point interconnect AMD introduced their point-to-point connection HyperTransport with the AMD Opteron microarchitecture. Intel moved away from their dual independent bus architecture in 2007 by introducing the QuickPath Architecture in their Nehalem Processor family design. The Nehalem architecture was a significant design change within the Intel microarchitecture and is considered the first true generation of the Intel Core series. The current Broadwell architecture is the 4th generation of the Intel Core brand (Intel Xeon E5 v4), the last paragraph contains more information on the microarchitecture generations. Within the QuickPath architecture, the memory controllers moved to the CPU and introduced the QuickPath point-to-point Interconnect (QPI) as data-links between CPUs in the system. The Nehalem microarchitecture not only replaced the legacy front-side bus but reorganized the entire sub-system into a modular design for server CPU. This modular design was introduced as the "Uncore" and creates a building block library for caching and interconnect speeds. Removing the front-side bus improves bandwidth scalability issues, yet intra- and inter-processor communication have to be solved when dealing with enormous amounts of memory capacity and bandwidth. Both the integrated memory controller and the QuickPath Interconnects are a part of the Uncore and are Model Specific Registers (MSR) ). They connect to a MSR that provides the intra- and inter-processor communication. The modularity of the Uncore also allows Intel to offer different QPI speeds, at the time of writing the Intel Broadwell-EP microarchitecture (2016) offers 6.4 Giga-transfers per second (GT/s), 8.0 GT/s and 9.6 GT/s. Respectively providing a theoretical maximum bandwidth of 25.6 GB/s, 32 GB/s and 38.4 GB/s between the CPUs. To put this in perspective, the last used front-side bus provided 1.6 GT/s or 12.8 GB/s of platform bandwidth. When introducing Sandy Bridge Intel rebranded Uncore into System Agent, yet the term Uncore is still used in current documentation. You can find more about QuickPath and the Uncore in part 2. 3: Scalable Cache Coherence Each core had a private path to the L3 cache. Each path consisted of a thousand wires and you can imagine this doesn't scale well if you want to decrease the nanometer manufacturing process while also increasing the cores that want to access the cache. In order to be able to scale, the Sandy Bridge Architecture moved the L3 cache out of the Uncore and introduced the scalable ring on-die Interconnect. This allowed Intel to partition and distribute the L3 cache in equal slices. This provides higher bandwidth and associativity. Each slice is 2.5 MB and one slice is associated with each core. The ring allows each core to access every other slice as well. Pictured below is the die configuration of a Low Core Count (LCC) Xeon CPU of the Broadwell Microarchitecture (v4) (2016). This caching architecture requires a snooping protocol that incorporates both distributed local cache as well as the other processors in the system to ensure cache coherency. With the addition of more cores in the system, the amount of snoop traffic grows, since each core has its own steady stream of cache misses. This affects the consumption of the QPI links and last level caches, requiring ongoing development in snoop coherency protocols. An in-depth view of the Uncore, scalable ring on-Die Interconnect and the importance of caching snoop protocols on NUMA performance will be included in part 3. Non-interleaved enabled NUMA = SUMA Physical memory is distributed across the motherboard, however, the system can provide a single memory address space by interleaving the memory between the two NUMA nodes. This is called Node-interleaving (setting is covered in part 2). When node interleaving is enabled, the system becomes a Sufficiently Uniform Memory Architecture (SUMA). Instead of relaying the topology info and nature of the processors and memory in the system to the operating system, the system breaks down the entire memory range into 4KB addressable regions and maps them in a round robin fashion from each node. This provides an 'interleaved' memory structure where the memory address space is distributed across the nodes. When ESXi assigns memory to virtual machine it allocates physical memory located from two different nodes when the physical CPU located in Node 0 needs to fetch the memory from Node 1, the memory will traverse the QPI links. The interesting thing is that the SUMA system provides a uniform memory access time. Only not the most optimal one and heavily depends on contention levels in the QPI architecture. Intel Memory Latency Checker was used to demonstrate the differences between NUMA and SUMA configuration on the same system. This test measures the idle latencies (in nanoseconds) from each socket to the other socket in the system. The latency reported of Memory Node 0 by Socket 0 is local memory access, memory access from socket 0 of memory node 1 is remote memory access in the system configured as NUMA. NUMA Memory Node 0 Memory Node 1 - SUMA Memory Node 0 Memory Node 1 Socket 0 75.7 132.0 - Socket 0 105.5 106.4 Socket 1 131.9 75.8 - Socket 1 106.0 104.6 As expected interleaving is impacted by constant traversing the QPI links. The idle memory test is the best case scenario, a more interesting test is measuring loaded latencies. It would have been a bad investment if your ESXi servers are idling, therefor you can assume that an ESXi system is processing data. Measuring loaded latencies provides a better insight on how the system will perform under normal load. During the test the load injection delays are automatically changed every 2 seconds and both the bandwidth and the corresponding latency is measured at that level. This test uses 100% read traffic.NUMA test results on the left, SUMA test results on the right. The reported bandwidth for the SUMA system is lower while maintaining a higher latency than the system configured as NUMA. Therefore, the focus should be on optimizing the VM size to leverage the NUMA characteristics of the system. Nehalem & Core microarchitecture overview With the introduction of the Nehalem microarchitecture in 2008, Intel moved away from the Netburst architecture. The Nehalem microarchitecture introduced Intel customers to NUMA. Along the years Intel introduced new microarchitectures and optimizations, according to its famous Tick-Tock model. With every Tick, optimization takes place, shrinking the process technology and with every Tock a new microarchitecture is introduced. Even though Intel provides a consistent branding model since 2012, people tend to Intel architecture codenames to discuss the CPU tick and tock generations. Even the EVC baselines lists these internal Intel codenames, both branding names and architecture codenames will be used throughout this series: Microarchitecture DP servers Branding Year Cores LLC (MB) QPI Speed (GT/s) Memory Frequency Architectural change Fabrication Process Nehalem x55xx 10-2008 4 8 6.4 3xDDR3-1333 Tock 45nm Westmere x56xx 01-2010 6 12 6.4 3xDDR3-1333 Tick 32nm Sandy Bridge E5-26xx v1 03-2012 8 20 8.0 4xDDR3-1600 Tock 32nm Ivy Bridge E5-26xx v2 09-2013 12 30 8.0 4xDDR3-1866 Tick 22 nm Haswell E5-26xx v3 09-2014 18 45 9.6 4xDDR3-2133 Tock 22nm Broadwell E5-26xx v4 03-2016 22 55 9.6 4xDDR3-2400 Tick 14 nm Up next, Part 2: System Architecture The 2016 NUMA Deep Dive Series: Part 0: Introduction NUMA Deep Dive Series Part 1: From UMA to NUMA Part 2: System Architecture Part 3: Cache Coherency Part 4: Local Memory Optimization Part 5: ESXi VMkernel NUMA Constructs Part 6: NUMA Initial Placement and Load Balancing Operations Part 7: From NUMA to UMA Share on your social network: Twitter Reddit Google LinkedIn Facebook Pinterest Frank Denneman Follow me on Twitter, visit the facebook fanpage of FrankDenneman.nl, or add me to your Linkedin network 9 Responses Comments9 Pingbacks0 awesome says: July 7, 2016 at 16:49 you just fucked my brain with this amazing post.. now i feel i am relaxed Askar Kopbayev says: July 8, 2016 at 03:34 I thought I knew pretty much about NUMA, but turns out I knew nothing. Awesome deep dive, Thanks a lot. Question - how does SUMA manage to provide a uniform memory access time? I thought the access time difference between NUMA and SUMA was a physical characteristic difference due to number of hops between cores and memory banks and due to different bandwidth/latency specs of local memory channels vs QPI. And thanks for tick&tock explanation - that was pretty interesting. Phil Morris says: July 8, 2016 at 11:28 @Askar As Frank as explained - the logical memory addressing in sequence is interleaved or round robin-ed between the physical memory locations(nodes). Eg: Assuming a two CPU system (2 nodes) Logical memory address 0 - on node 0 Logical memory address 1 - on node 1 Logical memory address 3 - on node 0 Logical memory address 4 - on node 1 .... So the law of averages - some address will be super quick and some not as the requested memory location as to mapped to the physical location (node). If you use the table frank provides - Socket 0 memory 0 = 75.7 memory 1 = 132.0 (memory 0 is local, 1 remote) 75.7 + 132.0 = 207.7 / 2 == 103.85 very close the the SUMA score of 105.5 & 106.4. Hope this help explains it. Phil @the_vMonkey Askar Kopbayev says: July 8, 2016 at 12:09 Hi Phil, yes, that makes sense. I think I got confused by the table with SUMA nodes memory access latency numbers. The table looks like even with node interleaving enabled each core was testing local and remote access separately, however, the core was actually accessing two different memory banks in round-robin fashion. Thanks for the explanation. 4c74356b41 says: July 8, 2016 at 13:44 @askar Well, they are using 2 CPU system, so effectively, you place half the memory on one CPU and half on the other (we are talking about memory we are utilizing, not the RAM itself). So your application accesses memory from CPU1 as equally as memory from CPU2 (well, if its truly random). At least that's how I understood it. I might be wrong. Phil Morris says: July 8, 2016 at 16:35 The point been made is that SUMA is like a 'lazy' admins fix or if the Operating system does not understand NUMA and it underlying CPU/RAM infrastructure. If using NUMA and don't take not of it you could have a case of two VMs - that have total different performance - eg VM 1 as its confg mapped to a single node - thus ram is local. Another might have ram that is split across nodes. Eric Singer says: July 20, 2016 at 18:58 Great post, thanks for sharing. I've never thought of it before, but it almost tells a story of why HCI *may* be the future. That is HCI = NUMA and shared storage = UMA. I don't think the bandwidth and latency limitations are any where near as constrained in storage as they are in a CPU, but an interesting similarity none the less.

Lays Rodrigues QString("C'est la vie"); Menu About Me Search for: Cross-Compile: Configure QtCreator for Intel Edison A few months ago a new friend gave to me an Intel Edison board to play =) When I got back home I mounted the board and start to configure. Download from Intel the environment necessary to programming using Node.Js and others frameworks. Since the Intel XDK environment is too heavy, and I like to use QtCreator, I will configure the Cross-Compile environment to use QtCreator like my editor. I will try in the future write Qt Applications and run them on the Edison, but that is a subject for an another post. So in the Intel Forum, I found a tutorial in how to build the cross-platform environment for QtCreator on your machine to build apps for the board. Is a tutorial from 2015, but I will replicate in my way. =) For this tutorial I assuming that you know what is: QtCreator, CMake, GDB, and ssh access. #1 You need to download the Cross Compiling tool from the Intel site, you can find the list of operational systems and the right SDK  Tools here. #2 Extract the files in your personal folder. And execute the script to install the libraries. #2 Fail This is the same error that I found when I was trying to install the package of Intel Edison board in Arduino IDE. Is a parameter that isn’t written like +111 anymore. You need to open the script file and change it to /111. After that run the script again: sudo ./install_script.sh I didn’t execute the script in sudo mode. And that made all the installation in my local folder. That would be a problem if I delete the folder for example. Even running the script in sudo mode, didn’t installed the files in the right folders. Apparently don’t have any settings to install in /opt/poky-Edison. After one hour testing, me and a friend of mine conclude that the install script is awful. It has an environment variable to the default folder: DEFAULT_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/poky-edison/1.6.1 And the target dir is empty: target_sdk_dir=”” In the line 61 it sets: target_sdk_dir=$(pwd) To run some commands that use others files in the i686 folders. So if I change, to the DEFAULT_INSTALL_DIR, it brokes and the scripts end with an error. In any other place in the script, have an attribution of the DEFAULT_INSTALL_DIR in the target_sdk_dir. I don’t have much knowledge with Shell Script to fix the install script. So I will leave like that and hope that I don’t delete this folder for some reason. If you want to check the script click here. #3 Now you need to open QtCreator. After that go in Tools -> Options -> Devices Click Add… to add a new device. Select the option of a New Generic Linux Device: After that configure you need to configure the access for your Edison: Click to finish the Wizard, and QtCreator will try to open an ssh connection to your Edison. If return Success, you are set up, else you need to discover the issue and solve it. =) #4 Now you need to add a new Kit in QtCreator, this Kit will lead to you to compile the source code to your Intel Edison. Go to Tools -> Options -> Build and Run Open the Tab Compilers. You need to add a new GCC compiler for the Intel Edison device, so you need to search where on your system the file: i685-poky-linux-g++ In my case is here: “/home/lays/Downloads/i686/sysroots/x86_64-pokysdk-linux/usr/bin/i586-poky-linux/i685-poky-linux-g++” Now you need to set up the Kit, go to the tab Kits, and click to add a new Kit. Set the Sysroot path to: Important #1! On the Device Type you will choose the Generic Linux Device, and on the Device option bellow should appear your Edison automatically. Important #2! You need to setup the Cmake Tool because is the tool that will manage the Cross Compile and the project. Important #3! Select the Qt version for None. Well, click Ok and now you finish your setup of your Kit for the Edison board. #5 Now we need to setup one CMake Configuration file to tell the Edison what’s need to be done. Were put the deploy files, what compile, flags to use, and so on. You can name the file to Edison.cmake, this file can be general for any project that you want to do. But if you need something more specific you need to edit for your necessity. You can access my version of the Edison.cmake here. #6 Well, now you only need to create a new project, using a CMakeLists.txt to make the library and build control adding this flag: #This is where all the settings to compile for the Edison are stored. INCLUDE(${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/Edison.cmake Now you have all your environment for Cross Compile projects to your Intel Edison from your QtCreator. If you need more info, you can access the base post here. In the next post, I will make my test, and maybe include some Qt code and see what happens. But for now… That’s all folks!

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Re-examining the unusual frame time results in our Radeon RX 470 review by Jeff Kampman  1:33 PM on August 12, 2016 It's never fun to admit a mistake, but we made a big one while writing our recent Radeon RX 470 review. That piece was our first time out on a new test rig that included an Intel Core i7-6700K CPU and an ASRock Z170 Extreme7+ motherboard. Once we got that system up and running, it delivered some weird-looking frame time numbers with some games. For example, the spikiness of the frame-time plot below didn't match any test data we had ever gathered before for Grand Theft Auto V, and we puzzled over those strange results for some time. We decided to go ahead and publish them anyway after doing some extended troubleshooting without seeing any improvement. Compare that to a more typical GTA V result from our Radeon RX 480 review, as demonstrated by three GeForce cards running on an X99 testbed: The spikiness caused by what turned out to be high deferred procedure call (or DPC) latency didn't seem to affect average framerates much (save one major exception), but it did worsen our 99th-percentile frame time numbers considerably. Given how much we use those 99th-percentile numbers in formulating other parts of our conclusions, especially value plots, the error introduced this way had considerable negative effects on the accuracy of several key parts of our review. The net effect of this error led us to wrongly conclude that the Radeon RX 480 8GB and the Radeon RX 470 were closely matched in performance, when in fact they're quite different. Upon reflection, we should have stopped the RX 470 review at that point to try and figure out exactly what was going on, but the pressure of deadlines got the better of us. When these weird frame-time plots appeared once more in the preliminary testing work for our review of the Radeon RX 460, however, we had to acknowlege that something unusual was going on. Of course, that also meant that our published RX 470 review had problems that we had to deal with. We believe that in the interest of full transparency, it's important to explain exactly what happened, be clear about how we messed up, and resolve not to make the same mistakes in the future. The issue While I was testing the Radeon RX 460 and tearing my hair out over the wild frame time plots our cards were generating, TR code wizard Bruno "morphine" Ferreira brought the possibility of high DPC latency to my attention. DPC latency is usually of interest to musicians running digital audio workstations, where consistently minimal input lag is critical. Bruno pointed me to the LatencyMon app, which keeps an eye on DPC performance and warns of any issues, as a way of figuring out whether DPC latency was the root cause of this problem. LatencyMon thinks something is up with my main desktop. I'll have to look into it soon. I didn't capture any screenshots during my frenzied troubleshooting, but LatencyMon did show that our test rig wasn't servicing DPC requests promptly. Wireless networking drivers are generally considered the first place to look when troubleshooting DPC issues, and I use an Intel Wireless-N 6205 card in our test system. Oops. Even after disabling that wireless card, however, the issue persisted. After killing every potential bit of software that might have been causing the problem without getting any improvements, I took Bruno's suggestion of updating our motherboard's firmware. "The BIOS can't possibly be the cause!" I thought to myself smugly. Pride goeth before a fall, of course, and the DPC latency issue vanished with the new ASRock firmware installed. The frame-time plots for GTA V began to resemble the flat, tight lines we've come to expect with modern hardware. I had to quash the urge to drive over the motherboard a few times and burn the remains before coming to grips with the fact that I would have to throw out large amounts of testing data. So what happened? You see, ASRock sent us its Z170 Extreme7+ board during a brief period in which the company was promoting its ability to overclock locked Intel CPUs with a beta BIOS. I had hoped to explore that possibility with some ASRock motherboards and cheap CPUs, but Intel swiftly put the kibosh on the concept. We got busy with other work, and the beta firmware remained on the motherboard through our first attempts to test graphics cards with it. I don't know precisely what was wrong with this beta firmware that was causing it to wreak havoc on DPC latency, but updating the firmware did fix it, so Occam's razor suggests something weird was going on. The fallout Having solved the underlying problem, I now had to contend with the fact that I had published a very public and widely-read review that contained what seemed like reams of contaminated data. To see just how wrong I had been in my conclusions, I retested every title we had slated for our RX 470 and RX 460 reviews on our ASRock test rig, using the same settings we had initially chosen for our reviews. As it turns out, high DPC latency doesn't affect every game equally, or at least not in a way that shows up in our frame-time numbers. While GTA V, Hitman, and Rise of the Tomb Raider all showed significant changes in average FPS and 99th-percentile frame times after a retest on the updated hardware,  Doom, Crysis 3, and The Witcher 3 did not. That second trio of games certainly felt more responsive to input after the critical firmware update, but the data they generated wasn't meaningfully different. We're talking fractions of milliseconds of difference in before-and-after testing, and those deltas are almost certainly imperceptible in real-life gaming. Given that behavior, we're confident that the numbers we generated for Doom, Crysis 3, and The Witcher 3 are representative of the performance of the Radeon RX 460, the Radeon RX 470, and the other cards we tested in those reviews.  The resolution Given the large differences in performance we saw with GTA V, Hitman, and RoTR, the only acceptable way to fix our mistake was to retest all of the cards in our Radeon RX 470 review from the ground up with those games. We've done that now, and as a bonus, we did that retesting with the same data-collection methods we just premiered in our RX 460 review. As a result, we now have Doom Vulkan and OpenGL numbers for the RX 470 and RX 480, plus DirectX 12 numbers for Rise of the Tomb Raider and Hitman. We've also extensively re-written the conclusion of our Radeon RX 470 review to account for this new data, much in the same way that we crunched our results for the Radeon RX 460 and friends. We've accounted for the differences in our results there, so I'd encourage you to go read up on what changed. If you read our original Radeon RX 470 review, we're deeply sorry to have misinformed you. We also extend our sincerest apologies to everybody at AMD and Nvidia for presenting incorrect information and misguided conclusions about their products. In the future, we'll strive to be both correct and swift with our reviews, but we also won't hesitate to delay a piece when clear warning flags are evident. We hope this clarification reinforces your trust in The Tech Report's reporting. If you have any questions or concerns, please leave a comment below or email me directly.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: HP More like this Intel's Kaby Lake chips will include integrated 4K graphics processors Kaby Lake starts strong as Intel retools PC strategy Move over Skylake: An Asus PC with Intel's Kaby Lake chip is coming in Q3 Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles HP may have tried, but it couldn't hold the secrets of Intel's unreleased Kaby Lake and Apollo Lake CPU chips close to its chest. Some details on the new chips were unintentionally shared by HP in the maintenance documents of an unannounced PC, the Pavilion x360 m1. PCs with Kaby Lake -- called 7th Generation Core chips -- are expected to ship this quarter. It is a highly anticipated successor to Intel's Skylake chips, with performance and multimedia improvements. Asus announced the Transformer 3 tablet PC with Kaby Lake in June but didn't share specific chip details. Lenovo and Acer will announce new Kaby Lake PCs at the IFA trade show starting at the end of the month. The Pavilion x360 m1 convertible PC  -- which means it can be a laptop or tablet -- can be configured with the dual-core Core i3-7100U running at 2.40GHz. The chip draws 15 watts of power and has 3MB of cache. The Core i3-7100U chip details provide basic insight into the capabilities of other Kaby Lake chips. The chip has an HD Graphics 620 processor, which is capable of DirectX 12 gaming, and has high-definition video decoding built in. Intel has already said Kaby Lake chips will be capable of running 4K video. The Pavilion x360 m1 can also be configured with an upcoming Pentium or Celeron chip code-named Apollo Lake. Both the Apollo Lake chips are surprisingly power-efficient and draw only six watts of power, which means long battery life. The Apollo Lake chips are based on the Goldmont architecture, which was originally designed for Atom chips. The Apollo Lake chip options for the Pavilion x360 m1 include Pentium N4200, which runs at 1.1GHz, but can go up to 2.5GHz, or the Celeron N3350, which can go up to 2.4GHz. The chips have 2MB of L2 cache. Other specifications point the Pavilion x360 m1 to being a low-cost PC. It will have an 11.6-inch screen that displays images at 1366 x 768-pixel resolution, and will support DDR4 and DDR3 DRAM, depending on the chipset. It will support hard drives or SSDs. Surprisingly, it'll include only 802.11n Wi-Fi, not the latest 802.11ac. It will have USB 3.0 and 2.0 slots, not a Type-C port.

View Latest Posts >>> Core Edicts of the Khazarian Mafia (Part IV) By Preston James, Ph.D on August 12, 2016 Your mind is always the main target of the Top Command of the Khazarian Mafia, then your assets and then your very life... Your Brain interfacing with Wifi (Artist’s representation) by Preston James Without the Earth shattering disclosures made by Gordon Duff at the International Counterterrorism Conference in 2014, you would never be reading about the Khazarian Mafia by name anywhere on the Internet, even here. Gordon Duff representing the US delegation final report at the Damascus counter terrorism conference… Dec 02. 2014 It was VT Chairman Gordon Duff that first disclosed that the root cause of so-called “world terrorism” was actually the world’s largest organized crime syndicate. Gordon Duff did not specifically name this world’s largest organized crime syndicate in the first part of his speech which was unclassified and made public. Within minutes of its delivery, this historical ground-breaking speech was scrutinized by every major government and Intel agency, and sent shock-waves around the world. A short time later it was VT’s Financial Editor and Talk Show host Mike Harris that named this world’s largest organized crime syndicate publicly for the first time ever, and referred to it specifically by its proper name as the Khazarian Mafia.  Without these bold first-time disclosures of Gordon Duff and Mike Harris, VT readers would not have been able to connect the dots and begin to understand what the Khazarian Mafia (KM) is or how it has parasitized America and most of the world. Nor would they be able to understand what the KM has done to rise to such world power and where it is within striking distance to take down the whole world and complete its evil Globalist NWO one-world agenda. And without these bold disclosures you would continue seeing and feeling the negative effects of this world’s largest organized crime syndicate the KM everywhere in your daily life, but you would not know its name, its history, its composition, what empowers it. Nor would you understand what the overall agenda of this world’s largest organized crime syndicate is. And this syndicate’s agenda just happens to be asset stripping, induced death, war and destruction for profit, power, and world domination, all intended to produce Globalist NWO one-world government end-state run by this world’s largest organized crime syndicate. And it is now pretty clear that without the emergence of some very high level, very informed and very disgusted Intel Cowboys from all over the world, there would be no major leaks of the secret evil that the Khazarian Mafia (KM) has been perpetrating all over the world and in America, their home economic and military base. The KM has always known that if various renegade Intel disclosed their secret evil this could be a serious threat to their syndicate’s power. That is why they set up so many advanced procedures to compartmentalize all areas of Intel — the higher you go, the more narrow the scope. Mike Harris, host of the radio show “The Short End of the Stick,” on the Freedom Slips radio network, is interviewed by Syrian TV This has all been done in an effort to keep high ranking Intel from connecting the dots and understanding that they are working as part of system to destroy their own nation, their own families and humankind itself. Because when some Intel gain too much information about the KM crimes committed under the cover of invoked “national security” a certain percentage will secretly rebel. That secret rebellion can take the form of sandbagging (working hard but producing little) or leaking damaging information through various complex means. In recent years Intel Cowboys from all over the world have rebelled because they could not accept the big picture they discovered in their jobs. Some have organized into groups which have become such powerful factions that are able to openly speak out and resist the evils of the KM. It is now known beyond any shadow of a doubt that the KM Top Chieftains who sit at the top of the pyramidal Establishment Hierarchy are the top policy-makers in America and maintain a set of Core Edicts upon which they base their policy mandates on. These are reflected in USG Laws and most large corporate policies. Part I, Part II, & Part III have disclosed many of their Core Edicts. It’s a fact that the Top Chieftains of the KM control the CIA and other Intel agencies and use so-called “National Security” as cover for their crimes. You can read about Bohemian Grove anywhere now The KM cannot continue to exist without their ability to maintain abject secrecy and everyday the Internet, the world’s New Gutenberg Press is eroding that secrecy. Use of National Security as cover for these serious RICO and International crimes by the KM is itself a most serious crime against the USA, We The People and the World. The KM is the biggest RICO crime syndicate in America and commits the most serious US and International crimes ever. Some of these crimes are so serious that they are almost unimaginable such as engineered staged wars with millions of dead and wounded with many are innocent civilians, women and children. Right now the main Intel agency used by the KM inside America is the Central Intelligence Agency. The CIA is bifurcated and employs many innocent analysts and agents who collect Intel by various means but do not engage in evil, anti-human covert operations. But there is an evil covert part of the CIA which engages in frequent wetwork, abroad and inside the USA, massive mind-kontrol operations against We The People using super high tech Psychotronics, working with the US Military to traffick in trillions of dollars of illegal narcotics and weapons to raise “off the books” black ops money. Limitless off-the-books Black Ops money underwrites synthetic terror and advances fascistic agendas But the most important function that the CIA and the other Intel agencies that are completely controlled by the KM are the covert operations deployed to create synthetic terror, fake enemies, which are needed to start wars and justify huge military deployments. Mercenaries are hired for this, but there are even more sinister methods used. Saudi Arabia has always provided a great deal of funding to pick up young orphans off the street and place them in special schools to raise them and mind-kontrol them to function as crazed, suicidal terrorist bombers, painted as Islamic extremists. These mind-kontrolled subjects can then be triggered anytime they are needed to sacrifice themselves and produce the mass terror needed to start wars and justify more and more centralization of KM power exhibited as invisible Secret Shadow Government (SSG) power and visible USG power. The KM Top Chieftains love to consolidate institutions, and industries in order centralize power and make it much easier for themselves to exert control over the USG and We The People. That is why they used their Gladio-style, inside-job false-flag attack on America on 9-11-01 as an excuse to consolidate all American Alphabets and Law Enforcement into one centralized hierarchy they labelled Homeland Security (DHS). The name “Homeland Security” itself a mockery of the US Constitution and everything our Founding Fathers fought for in the Revolutionary War. This new Centralized hierarchical control of all such agencies by the KM’s Top Chieftains makes it easy for the KM to implement their Core Edicts as USG policies (many remaining secret, some made public). These Top Chieftains of course installed perverted, deeply compromised doofuses at the head of DHS to run it, soulless dupes who will do whatever the KM Top Chieftains mandate, no matter the US Constitution and common decency. Anyone who crosses them significantly gets whacked by their soulless wetboy teams, usually “arkencided”, a term that arose because of all the Dixie Mafia murders for the CIA surrounding the Mena operation and the Clintons. The term “arkencide” is when the CIA wetboys murder a whistle-blower or someone deemed as a potential threat for knowing too much that they could become an unnecessary risk later on, or someone who has stepped outside allowed parameters. Jesse Ventura interview on Youtube with Dr. Robert Duncan, mind control expert In the typical arkencide, it is customary for local police to stand-down at the request of Intel and for a crooked coroner and mortuary to be used. Absurd circumstances are knowingly created to serve as a warning message to anyone else who might be tempted to step outside of allowed parameters. Here is the bottom line of the Core Edicts of the KM Top Chieftains: To foment large criminal operations to make vast fortunes by which they plan to buy up the whole world and run it themselves, step by step. These operations include: massive counterfeiting (their own private Fiat Currency rented out to the American users); massive illegal drug trafficking; massive illegal and legal arms trafficking; massive money laundering; bust out schemes against the American People using color of law like the S&L scam, the Enron Scam, the Mortgage Bubble/MERS scam, and the “Bailouts”; Wall Street Plunge Protection Street scam where the USG has acquired about 1/2 of all US stocks through proprietaries, thus driving the stock prices up synthetically; sophisticated eugenics programs to promote obesity, disease and mass death in order to thin the herd by 90%; a secret space war program and secret alliances with certain Alien ET groups; electronic weather control and warfare; and last but the most important operation, large scale psychotronic mind-kontrol. This Jesse Ventura interview with Dr. Robert Duncan can not be embedded in this article, but for the time being can be watched here. _________ Conclusion The bottom line is that the KM is driven by an unimaginably evil inter-generational Globalist NWO Agenda to create a one-world government run by them alone. Their power is gained and exercised through their counterfeit FIAT Money Power. They have been able to capture most of the world in their spider web of fake money which is nothing but printed and issued debt notes. And the rest of the world is now catching on, especially the Russian Federation and China. Khadafy caught on, and the KM murdered him and plundered his nation through US Dept. of State doofus Cutouts. Assad and Syria have caught on and the KM is working overtime trying to depose Assad and destroy Syria’s infrastructure and Putin and the Russian Federation have now completely checkmated the KM in Syria and have decimated the KM/Israeli/USG created ISIS mercenaries. Iran has caught on and you can bet that the Russian Federation will also protect this ally from KM destruction like they have Syria. The whole world is now closing in on the KM, and it’s going to be a battle to the end; the KM is going to go down hard, but it will go down. The KM’s game has always been to take over the whole world and rule it themselves as kings running a feudal kingdom, with everyone else their serfs and slaves – at least those remaining 10% who have not all been mass murdered by the time they plan to exercise complete world control. To complete their evil Globalist NWO one-world Agenda, the KM must continue creating massive wars and running large scale international organized crime scams. They must control the lives and hearts and minds of We The People and convince us that our serfdom is desirable, or at least we are powerless to do anything about it. Every day the KM’s control is waning, as more and more of their Colossal lies are revealed. We are now all in a race to the finish point, there is only room for one victor, We the People or the Top Chieftains of the Khazarian Mafia. You can be sure of this one thing however. If the KM wins and complete their agenda they will whack all their doofus Cutouts because they will no longer need them. None of these folks will ever expect such a result, but it’s a given if the KM wins this battle for Planet earth. Yes, it’s now a major race between the KM’s efforts to control the American People and the American People’s public activism to expose these large scale KM crimes and stop them before they mass-murder most of us. If We The People lose this battle, darkness will descend completely over America and the rest of the world. Putin and the Russian Federation and the Chinese are now hip to this KM evil Agenda and have created a major financial firewall against the KM consisting of the BRICS Nations, the AIIB and new Chinese money wire system and the coming silk road railway and commerce lanes. In time, this will likely produce an end to the US Petro Dollar as the world’s exchange currency, and may push America over a financial cliff. That alone could mean the end of the KM hegemony. How much better it would be if We The People rose up at every level and organized to take control of our government before that happens. — Diane Birch is an up and comer well on her way to becoming a superstar.

This person is an astounding lady, a fearless truth warrior supreme. nawlins  August 16, 2016 at 7:29 am Let there be no misunderstanding. If the KM loses, they will destroy the planet. They are already doing it, but before they go they will literally lay waste to the earth. This attitude is actually quite common among criminals in power, to destroy that which they cannot control. The samson option is no joke, and no bluff. These “people” are truly evil on a level that is difficult for a rational mind to comprehend. The very idea makes the senses reel. Log in to Reply Dave Johnson  August 14, 2016 at 6:15 pm The KM relies on the continued acceptance of the military-alien complex.

But this of course is a closely guarded secret. Like I keep saying, VT readers are bright, insightful and remarkably well informed. They are aware of how things really are, far beyond most Members of Congress and the CMMM who are Cutouts and bought and owned dupes and live by engendered illusions dictated by the KM Top Chieftains. ayelyahbenjamin  August 14, 2016 at 5:15 pm altering the course of a History pre-written for our destruction… resting in the best of men, standing up, stepping forward and taking lies by the throat, squeezing hard…. they dropped in full view of the world, represented there in Dec 2014 Counter Terrorism Conference in Damascus … eyes opened along with a new path, as new vision emerged of a better future for all humanity, with all the means in our hands and hearts to materialize Log in to Reply darrelld  August 14, 2016 at 5:13 pm Dr James would have more credibility if he left out the E.T.- alien rubbish. UFOs are not occupied by E.T.s, they are preternatural manifestations by demons from hell and are meant to confuse us and weaken our faith in Jesus Christ and in the Church he founded, which happens to be the Catholic Church – despite all its warts and wrinkles and having been infiltrated by jews and freemasons who seek to destroy it from without and from within. Log in to Reply jensingr  August 15, 2016 at 4:32 pm Darelld, It is a very complex area to comprehend and even harder to write about. Preston James does a tremendous job trying to present an explanation of these beings and their agenda. Either way, the demonic world and the negative ET’s are working together to bring down civilization as we know it. I agree with you about the Catholic Church being infiltrated with those who seek to destroy it from within. Preston James, Ph.D  August 16, 2016 at 5:42 am In the past I used to think this Alien ET stuff was psyops thus fake and used as a cover for many new US secret defense projects and new high tech weapon systems. And that was true to a large extent. However when someone has a real witnessed encounter with a real Alien ET then this changes everything. Many including myself have had such encounters which are witnessed by at least one other person and cannot be written off as fantasy or psyops/false cover. When that happens it changes one’s mindset and one can then seek out others who have dealt with these matters inside certain sectors of Intel who are willing to disclose. Jade  August 14, 2016 at 11:46 am Dr. James and all that can see this, I’ve personally been working on a project, partially inspired by your work, that solves A LOT of the problems with the KM et al. end game.

Lisa Sperling  August 14, 2016 at 10:47 am Please read BEHIND THE DICTATORS by Leo Lehmann. The Jesuit Society, which runs the Roman Catholic Church/Holy See/SS and the entire fiat money system worldwide: the IMF, all central banks, BIS, IMF, has been behind the Nazis and the Ustachi, and all murderous regimes. In 1873, their “devout” Catholic Renan publicized the Khazar accusation. The great evil behind the world system is central banking. And central banking is controlled by the Jesuits for the RCC. Log in to Reply darrelld  August 14, 2016 at 5:00 pm It’s amazing how often one hears the absurd claim that the Jesuits control this and that and are behind all these evils in the world. Such claims have their origin in Jewish, Freemasonic, as well as Protestant sources. In reality, the Jesuits are not very powerful, and are, since the 1960s after Vatican II, by and large non-Catholic in their thinking and serve the interests of the diabolical ruling elite (KM), and when historically they did have a lot of influence, as in the 16th-18th C., they were probably the principal force opposing The Jewish Revolutionary Spirit (see E Michael Jones’s magisterial book of that title) and did more good for Europe and the Americas and beyond than we can ever imagine. Keep in mind who writes the history books. Go to alternative sources such as Warren Carroll’s “History of Christendom.” jonnbrown  August 13, 2016 at 4:55 pm GREAT article as always Dr. James. Thanks. Log in to Reply jensingr  August 13, 2016 at 12:57 pm It seems right after Gordon Duff and members of the U.S delegation revealed the true “organized crime syndicate” at the counter terrorism conference in Damascus…. they started hatching a plan to take down Assad. Log in to Reply eileenkuch  August 13, 2016 at 11:06 pm Thank God, Gordon Duff and the members of the US delegation revealed the true “organized crime syndicate” at the counter-terrorism conference in Damascus. The KM had just started hatching a plan to take down Bashar al-Assad when these revelations were made. Furthermore, thank God you’ve been informing many of us through your writings the evil plans and deeds of this most evil syndicate in world history – both in the VT website and in the VT magazine, Professor James. You have been a light within the darkness, awakening millions of people worldwide. The Internet isn’t known as the new Gutenberg Press for nothing. Just as the Gutenberg Press did for Europe’s population back in the early 16th Century, the Internet is doing for the world’s population. You and your colleagues at VT are a Godsend; and without your articles, none of us would’ve been able to connect the dots. Thank you so very much. Spiritual Warrior  August 14, 2016 at 7:15 am They visited Syria in 2014..the fake “civil war” started in 2011. jensingr  August 16, 2016 at 4:38 pm “the fake civil war started in 2011”, and there has always been a plan to cause the destruction of that country… order out of chaos, so that the Israeli’s can go in and take over. They want all the land around them. They create the turmoil in every country. They want Christians fighting Muslims, and killing each other so they don’t have to do it. They did however, step up the plan to get rid of Assad aggressively after the meeting in Damascus and used the CMMM to do their bidding and get Americans behind it. The military wasn’t having it. jensingr  August 13, 2016 at 12:39 pm “Bohemian Grove” – now a household phrase! Everyone lets meet there next year for family vacations… show up by the thousands and camp all around the area and do a little “disrupting”! btw, Is that Bush getting 30 lashes from Jesus?

I mean it they can put a program in somebody that activates say twenty years later, it is pretty daunting stuff that could become like a pandemic in years to come as subliminal a get all the more sophisticated down to minute details.

Trakkath  August 13, 2016 at 8:17 am Lately they shot one of this CIA-chemtrail planes down near the chinese border with containers of bird-flu. Must look for the link of that story. Trakkath  August 13, 2016 at 8:19 am Yes, Israel has them too and has also protests against them by normal people in Israel. Most of them are hostage taken by the RKM as human shield.

Why would any particular country be exempt from chemtrails? This is not human against human warfare. It’s non-human against human. jensingr  August 13, 2016 at 12:29 pm right CG… the filth they are spraying including lithium which triggers violent behavior in some, nano-filament fibers which cause morgellons and various flu viruses along with all the other chemical poisons toxic to humans, plants and water, is meant to kill us ALL off. Hybrids will be immune to the toxins. This is what the stupid NWO psychopaths don’t get! They will be terminated when their usefullness is dissipated. Trakkath  August 14, 2016 at 10:18 am @jensingr as far as I remember is that lithium is core element of most tranquillizers so no wonder none wants to rebell against this system and fell asleep instead. jensingr  August 15, 2016 at 4:21 pm Trakkath: yes, they have been using lithium to treat bipolar disorder, manic depression, aggression, rushed speech, and many other conditions. However, if anyone is like me, it would have the opposite effect and CAUSE these symptoms. ( If any cold medication says it will make me sleepy, it makes me stay awake and vice versa. ) I absolutely do not even feel nitrous oxide at the dentist. I have heard of some studies with people who have bipolar or depression that wanted to get off of celexa, or cymbalta, etc that were given lithium to help with the withdrawals. Then the lithium actually caused very negative reactions in these case studies. So they of course know this from their studies and started dropping it on the population knowing that certain people will react violently. jensingr  August 15, 2016 at 4:46 pm Trakkath: yes, they have been using lithium to treat bipolar disorder, manic depression, aggression, rushed speech, and many other conditions. However, if anyone is like me, it would have the opposite effect and CAUSE these symptoms. ( If any cold medication says it will make me sleepy, it makes me stay awake and vice versa. ) I absolutely do not even feel nitrous oxide at the dentist.

The studio has hired a huge Quality Assurance team to help iron out these bugs, and rolled out a new Experimental Branch PC patch that promises to help enable max frame rates, boost performance on CPUs with 4 threads or fewer, and the frame rate stutters caused by inefficient GPU shader caching.   Sadly the game still runs awkwardly on AMD Phenom processors--"Thousands of lines of assembly have been rewritten overnight to support AMD CPUs," says Sean Murray--NVIDIA G-Sync has been disabled by default, and the game will likely never run on Intel GPUs. For the time being, Hello Games suggests trying the current workarounds to see if they fix your problem or opting in to the Experimental Branch beta update. Check the full patch notes below, and the Steam discussions board for more info.   On the off chance your copy of No Man's Sky is working perfectly, be sure to check out our startup guide for tips and tricks to make the best of your journey.     Experimental patch adds the following optimizations:   Improved AMD Phenom Support Thousands of lines of assembly have been rewritten overnight to support AMD CPUs. Unfortunately whilst the game code no longer relies on anything above SSE 2, Havok Physics still requires "Supplemental SSE 3", which was not supported until "Bobcat" and above. We're discussing with Havok.   Alt-Tab has improved Some systems/configs were crashing or not pausing correctly on Alt Tab. This should now be resolved.   Shader Caching Framerate was initially stuttering due to shaders not being correctly cached by the GPU on some systems. We have replaced the GPU caching system. You may notice some stutter during the Galactic Map intro to the game (the very first time you run), but it should be smoother from then on (this will be fixed in future). This is particularly true on ATI cards   Mouse Jitter Smoothing on mouse movement has been improved to prevent hitching or stuttering, and is now adjustable through the Options menu in "Mouse Smoothing".   Max FPS Cap On some CPU/GPU configurations, setting Max FPS to 60 or 30 was not giving 60 or 30 FPS (causing stuttering). This has been improved.   Improved Performance On CPUs with 4 threads or fewer, performance has been improved.   Intel GPUs The game will now let you know if you are trying to run with an unsupported GPU. This will hopefully flag for some users that their high-end GPU has not been selected.   Gsync Gsync has been disabled by default, which was causing an issue for some users   Here is how you access it   To access the Experimental branch right-click on the game from the library page and select "Properties". Among the available tabs will be the "BETAS" tab.   Code: 3xperimental   Your new branch should be listed in the dropdown menu under "Select the beta you would like to opt into:" NEWS SOURCES:Madeforgaming.com, Steamcommunity.com Recommended for You Samuria Shodown VI compatible for PS4, avaliable Nov...

Kutraleeshwaran. It was on this date that Kutraleeshwaran -- one of the youngest Arjuna Award receipients -- swam across the English Channel in 1994. "I wanted to cross the Channel on August 15," the Guiness World Record holder for swimming six channels in a single year told IANS on Sunday. As a 13-year-old boy, he achieved that feat and on August 14 and 15 of every year Kutraleeshwaran muses about that swim across the English Channel. "While I was practicing at the English Channel, other swimmers would come and tell me to go back to India and that crossing the channel was an impossible task. But the same people came back on August 16 and told me that I had proved them wrong," Kutraleeshwaran reminisced. Wanting to set the records straight, he said the Tamil Nadu government helped him fully in achieving the Guiness World Record and that the central government funded participation in one of the international competitions. "My quitting professional swimming when I was in Class 12 was a conscious and practical decision. In the 1990s, there were no corporate sponsorhips for swimmers. I had also seen great sportspersons doing odd jobs for their livelihood," Kutraleeshwaran said. "The only option for a middle-class person then was to focus on studies and come up in life, which I did. I do not have any regrets," he added. Today, the Intel engineer-turned-investment banker at Barclays Capital and Citibank has returned to India after working abroad for over a decade. Queried about his decision to quit as Vice President, Corporate and Investment Bank, Citi, Kutraleeshwaran said: "It may look irrational, but that is the way I am. I do not have any back-up plan. It may be risky but that is the way of life. When there is no back-up plan, one will focus on the goal and achieve it." He said he wanted to get a management degree and quit Intel and joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technlogy-Sloan School of Management. According to him, his sporting achievement certainly added value to his resume. "A professional athelete competing in global arena implicitly conveys that he is a hard worker, dedicated and disciplined," Kutraleeshwaran said. "I came back to India nearly a month ago. I am yet to finalise my entrepreneurial plans, which can also be related to swimming as a sport," Kutraleeshwaran remarked. "Swimming should be like walking. Every Indian should know how to swim. If swimming is taught in all the schools, then the sample size will grow bigger, thus paving the way for more talented swimming champions," he said. Kutraleeshwaran said corporates could sponsor this under CSR (corporate social responsibility), a new way to build brand equity and also get a return on investment. Looking back upon his swimming career, Kutraleeshwaran said: "I started swimming in traditional pools. But I found swimming in the sea with friends more interesting and challenging." Then the coach suggested participation in the five-km sea swimming competition here and Kutraleeshwaran came fourth. After this, he participated in long-distance swimming competitions across the country, bagged medals, and set his eyes on crossing the English Channel. "It was the swimming coach K.S. Illangovan who spotted Kutraleeshwaran's talent in long-distance swimming. Further, then Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa decided to provide the needed support. And late T.V. Gnanavelu, Secretary, Tamil Nadu Aquatics Association, then suggested crossing the Palk Strait first," S.V. Ramesh, advocate and Kutraleeshwaran's father, told IANS. "We are indebted to these three persons for Kutraleeshwaran's achievements," Ramesh added. In 1994, he first crossed the Palk Strait between India and Sri Lanka. It was then that his father came to know about Mihir Sen's achievement of swimming across five channels in a single calendar year and wanted Kutraleeshwaran to break that 30-year record. After the English Channel, Kutraleeshwaran crossed Rottnest Channel in Australia, the Straits of Messina and Zannone Circeo, both in Italy, and finally the Ten Degree Channel between Little Andaman and Car Nicobar in the Bay of Bengal -- all with the help of the Tamil Nadu government. Asked about the precautions taken before a long-distance sea swimming event, Kutraleeshwaran said: "To protect the skin as I would be in salt water for several hours, petroleum jelly will be applied on the whole body." "But nothing can be done about the mouth and there will be blisters on the lips and even on the tongue. For at least two days after an event, I would be on liquid diet. One can't even eat a chocolate due to the blisters," he said. Asked about his name, Kutraleeshwaran said it is the name of the deity in a temple in Kutralam in Tamil Nadu. "My grandfather insisted that I was named like this as it was part of fulfilling his vow," he said. "It is a unique name. On seeing the name in my passport many immigration officials immediately recognise the name and wish me," he remarked. Many Indians abroad, on hearing my name, used to tell me that there was a boy in India, a popular long-distance swimmer, with identical name. I used to tell them the boy was me," he said.

Asked about the precautions taken before a long-distance sea swimming event, Kutraleeshwaran said: "To protect the skin as I would be in salt water for several hours, petroleum jelly will be applied on the whole body." "But nothing can be done about the mouth and there will be blisters on the lips and even on the tongue. For at least two days after an event, I would be on liquid diet. One can't even eat a chocolate due to the blisters," he said. Asked about his name, Kutraleeshwaran said it is the name of the deity in a temple in Kutralam in Tamil Nadu. "My grandfather insisted that I was named like this as it was part of fulfilling his vow," he said. "It is a unique name. On seeing the name in my passport many immigration officials immediately recognise the name and wish me," he remarked. Many Indians abroad, on hearing my name, used to tell me that there was a boy in India, a popular long-distance swimmer, with identical name. I used to tell them the boy was me," he said.

CHUWI HiBook (Windows 10 and Android) 2-in-1 Review GO The most affordable Windows 10 and Android 2-in-1 right now Aug 14, 2016 07:51 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  INTRODUCTION DESIGN HARDWARE CONCLUSIONS CHUWI isn’t exactly a premium device manufacturer, but it’s certainly improving, so while the fact that it’s based in China could more or less impact its sales, holding one of their devices in hand makes you reconsider your options. On paper, CHUWI builds products that are surprising, to say the least, as they follow the recipe of Chinese manufacturers and offer pretty much everything you’d expect from a modern computing device, but without compromising quality and performance. This is what CHUWI promises, and we hearing about this, the HiBook 2-in-1 device certainly seems compelling, mostly because it mixes two different operating systems and promises to do good in the hardware department too. The CHUWI HiBook 2-in-1 “ultrabook tablet PC,” as the manufacturer calls it, isn’t quite an expensive device and can be purchased for just $195 from GearBest (Update, September 12, 2016: Pricing drops to $190.99 with coupon code PediaHibook). For an extra $40, you also get a keyboard, which, in our opinion, is a must-have if you really want to make the most of this device, especially when using it with Windows 10. Since it all sounds too good to be true, we wanted to find out what this is all about on our own, so we took the CHUWI HiBook for a test. Read on to find out what we think about the device. CHUWI HiBook design DESIGN If the first impression is important to you, then you’re going to like the CHUWI HiBook. At first glance, it looks like a really premium device, and the metal casing gives it a shiny appearance that you rarely find on such affordable models. The screen, or the tablet if you wish, measures 26.20 x 16.75 x 0.85 cm / 10.31 x 6.59 x 0.33 inches, and according to the official specs, it weighs 0.5 kilos. And yet, you’ll certainly feel it heavier than that, and you’ll be shocked when you first hold it in your hand, especially if a keyboard is attached. The keyboard itself also adds some 0.5 kg, so the 2-in-1 device tips the scales at approximately 1+ kilograms (2.2 pounds). The design of the screen is nothing unusual, and it’s just the typical tablet that you find these days. It’s full of ports on one side and the other, including TF card, USB Type-C (used for connectivity and charging), micro USB, micro HDMI, headphone jack, and a magnetic port for the keyboard. “Heavier than you think.” The screen measures 10.1 inches and has a resolution of 1920x1200 pixels, which is pretty decent for the price you have to pay, but also for its size. The keyboard, on the other hand, looks surprisingly good and feels nice to the touch, although the mechanism used to attach it to the screen isn’t really the best we’ve seen. Of course, we’re not going to compare it with the Microsoft Surface, which is one of the most expensive premium devices on the market, but there’s still plenty of room for improvement, and you’re going to feel it when trying to detach or connect the keyboard for the first time. While the latching system looks perfectly alright, you need to pull the screen and the keyboard apart very hard, and a kid might really have a hard time doing it. Everything could get a bit loose over time, but during our test, the exact same thing happened over and over again. The keyboard seems nice to the touch, although the plasticky feel of the keys doesn’t quite align with the impression you get when looking at it. It works fine, but nothing out of the ordinary. We’ve heard many people complaining about the position of the screen on the keyboard, and some said the “laptop” could easily get flimsy, but we experienced exactly the opposite. Everything was strongly kept in place, and we could adjust the angle just as we wanted - sometimes, it was even very hard to open the lid, given that extra strength was needed. Other than that, the CHUWI HiBook looks good, and it is, indeed, a little bit too heavy, it remains the kind of device that you won’t feel embarrassed to show up with in a room full of people. HARDWARE #CPU, GPU, storage If you were considering buying the CHUWI HiBook to play games, think again. The device comes with an Intel Cherry Trail Z8300 64-bit quad-core clocked at 1.44GHz and reaching 1.84 GHz in turbo mode, which is coupled with 4GB of RAM and Intel HD eight-generation GPU. At first glance, this configuration seems powerful enough to deal with the majority of activities you perform every day on your PCs, but when actually using it, things are entirely different. The CPU was launched in the second quarter of 2015 and is based on the 14nm architecture, with a 2MB cache and 4 cores. It’s a processor specifically designed for low-cost devices where pricing is the main thing to have in mind, so it won’t be able to handle more than regular web browsing, video, and music playback. If you’re the type of user who browses the web with just one tab open, then you’re safe, but whenever multitasking is involved, the CHUWI HiBook really struggles. We’ve tried to use it with Microsoft Edge in Windows 10 Anniversary Update, and while it performs smoothly with just one tab, it’s getting slower as you open more. “Gaming? Nope. Solitaire? For sure!” We’ve discovered Android (our sample unit is a dual-boot model) is a bit more resource-friendly, and everything seems to be running more smoothly, mostly because it’s an operating system that’s more appropriate for tablets. Microsoft worked hard to make Windows 10 a better OS on such devices, but it’s still slow on budget configurations. For gaming, the CHUWI HiBook won’t be able to deal with anything else beyond Solitaire and old games, such as Starcraft, but it’s not even supposed to. The 10.1-inch IPS screen with 1920x1200 pixels resolution is more appropriate for casual browsing and movie watching than for playing games, but it still does a decent job if you want to play poker or things like that. What’s important to have in mind is that, while some people claim this is Retina display, it is certainly not. It offers average quality and nothing beyond that, and you really can’t compare a Retina display with the screen available on the HiBook. But the difference in price between this display and Retina is huge, so you’ll be fine with CHUWI’s choice anyway. #Keyboard, touch, and trackpad Thanks to the fact that it’s a 2-in-1 device, the HiBook is both a tablet and a laptop, so it comes with a detachable keyboard that can be reattached whenever you need to type faster. The touchscreen is just like you’d expect it to be, and it’s quite responsive, providing pretty good value for the money. You can use it in both portrait and landscape modes, and thanks to optimizations made in Windows 10, the display reacts very fast to touch input. The keyboard, on the other hand, feels nice to the touch, but it loses important points when you look at the HiBook as to a regular laptop. The big weight of the tablet makes it pretty difficult for the keyboard to hold it in place, and there are moments when the HiBook can’t stay on the desk in the typical laptop position because it falls over. CHUWI HiBook magnetic port The magnetic connector that should help recognize when the keyboard is attached and removed works well at first, but after a few days, you might need to clean it up a little bit because otherwise a connection might not be detected. The touchpad, unfortunately, is quite awful, and not only is it small (it can’t be otherwise, given the size of the device), but it’s also super unresponsive. There are moments when you click something by mistake, but there are also cases when you browse the web, and it doesn’t recognize a click, so it’s up to how lucky you are to get a better or worse experience. #Battery life As far as the battery is concerned, the CHUWI HiBook comes with a 6,600 mAh battery that can provide you with 5 to 6 hours of average use. The experience we had here was pretty mixed. First of all, if you want to use the HiBook for the typical stuff, such as browsing the web, chatting, or working on a document, you can really reach those 6 hours of battery life. On the other hand, if you want to watch movies on the HiBook, expect no more than somewhere between 3 and 3 and a half hours of autonomy, also depending on the quality of the video. The recharging process takes place via a USB Type-C port, and the CHUWI device is super handy in this regard. You don’t even have to carry a charger with you all the time, and a Type-C cable is enough - and with more manufacturers adopting this standard, USB Type-C cables will soon be everywhere. It doesn’t take more than one hour and a half to fully recharge the battery, and this is also partially thanks to the Type-C port. Without a doubt, the Chinese manufacturer made the right choice here. #Other features And because it’s a tablet manufactured by a Chinese company, it comes with everything you’d ever want on a modern laptop. It runs both Android 5.1 and Windows 10, it comes with a USB Type-C port, it also features 64GB of eMMC storage, but also boasts a TF card port if you want more space. Micro HDMI is also available if you want to connect it to an external screen, and so are Bluetooth 4.0 and Wi-Fi. There are also two cameras for photos and videos calls, and the front-facing one comes with 2 megapixels while the rear one features 5 megapixels. And that’s not all. The CHUWI HiBook features a microUSB slot, a 3.5mm headphone jack (heard that, Apple?), as well as two speakers - the quality of the sound, however, isn’t really impressive, and we’ve found ourselves using the headphones more often just because of the poor quality. CHUWI HiBook side view THE BOTTOM LINE In the end, CHUWI HiBook is living proof that the Chinese are no longer building just cheap devices that offer terrible quality and products leaving a lot to be desired. The HiBook is an interesting combination of premium look and decent hardware, and when you add an affordable price, the result is compelling, to say the least. Truth be told, the HiBook can’t really be a productivity machine, and this is only because the hardware doesn’t meet expectations, and at certain times, Windows 10 becomes painfully slow. In Android, the device runs everything more smoothly, but there’s no other option than Windows 10 if you really want to be productive on the go (we’re pretty sure that many of you won’t agree with us here, but when it comes to working, Windows is clearly a better option than Android). The HiBook, on the other hand, can be used as an occasional device that lets you perform certain things, such as browsing or chatting, more quickly while on the go, but nothing beyond that. Fortunately for those who hoped CHUWI HiBook would not be the typical Chinese product, the old saying claiming that what you pay is what you get isn’t entirely valid right now, and for the price of this 2-in-1, you actually get plenty of stuff. Obviously, this doesn’t necessarily mean that everyone should buy it, but it shows that Chinese products are improving. It’s not yet the revolution, but it’s a good place to start.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (20 Images) #CHUWI#Windows 10#Windows 10 laptop#laptop review#Android laptop subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it CHUWI HiBook (20 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Microsoft Band 2 vs. Samsung Gear Fit 2: Battle of the Bands Microsoft Band 2 Now Super Cheap in the US As Third Generation Debut Nears The Free Upgrade Brought Windows 10 on 20 Percent of the PCs in the World Microsoft Confirms Surface Pro 3 Battery Issues, Promises Fix Donald Trump, Tim Cook Discuss Building iPhones in the United States iPhone 8 to Feature Traditional Wireless Charging like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Lenovo Builds a New Microsoft Surface Clone and It Looks Fabulous Anonymous Hackers Want McAfee to Be Trump’s Security Adviser, Call for March HTC Desire 650 Announced, a Low Mid-End Smartphone for the Masses Glossy Black Galaxy S7 edge Leaks in Live Pictures Download Windows 10 64-bit Drivers for Acer’s Aspire TC-710 Desktop Model Intel Rolls Out Several New BIOS Versions for Its NUC Kits and Compute Sticks 20 photos    CHUWI HiBook running Windows 10 New Apps Farbar Recovery Scan Tool: Lightweight and efficient application that was designed to help you scan your computer for malware damage and resolve encountered issues Seymour: Browse through, edit, convert and arrange your photo collection in categories based on the author with this user-friendly application Your Freedom: A all-in-one VPN tunneling, firewall and proxy bypassing, anonymization and anti-censorship solution that enables you to browse the Internet in a secure way Dopamine Portable: Seamlessly organize your music collection and find your favorite tracks based on title, artists, genres, albums or playlists with this software solution Dopamine: Keep your music collection neatly organized based on albums, genre, playlists or tracks so you easily find tracks using this music player Vectorworks: Designed for professionals, this application enables you to create architectural designs, landscapes, theatrical productions and more Portable PhotoLine: A simple to use application bundled with photo editing functions that allows you to enhance, distort, as well as paint over an opened picture Reader comments Load old comments   Huawei Honor (MediaPad) X2 Review more on: Huawei i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

And the developments are timely, as some European countries - Spain for example - are drawing up lists of guidelines on restrictions that over-65s may face on their driving licences in the not-to-distance future. These include limits on mileage per journey, speed, driving on motorways and driving at night depending on medical condition. A fully trained car could come to the rescue. Scientists are working on deep-learning frameworks which will evolve today's semi-autonomous cars into self-driving vehicles that can handle all traffic scenarios, in all environments, by learning from experience rather than being pre-programmed for every eventuality. Deep-learning frameworks is a form of artificial intelligence, which scientists plan to build into on-board computers which can learn to make big calls, like choosing between hitting a bus queue or a stray dog. The deep-learning frameworks technology gets computers to mimic neurons (cells in the human body specialised in carrying messages through an electrochemical process - the human brain has approximately 100bn neurons) by creating artificial neural networks to quickly absorb and pass on information on road and traffic conditions. Toyota has invested $1bn into its Toyota Research Institute which has autonomous vehicles as a priority and Intel has acquired Altera, a maker of programmable logic devices with automotive applications for $1.6bn. Experts at both companies are developing autonomous cars that not only adhere to set protocols like keeping between white lines, but react to unpredictable scenarios too. Toyota research expert Dr Gill Pratt says that part of the Institute work is to focus on augmenting machine learning and measuring the robustness of systems for all types of scenarios, while Altera's partner in the UK, i-Abra, is developing deep-learning frameworks for autonomous cars. "Ultimately you are trying to replace human sense and action with artificial intelligence by acting on data collected from the car's sensors, cameras, radar and maybe audio," says managing director Ian Taylor. "If bricks fall off a truck the idea is to stop the car as quickly as possible," he says. "The car can learn from experience and then share the experience across a fleet that is constantly connected. The moral maze is presented every day to humans - do you hit the deer or the tree? If a human can make the decision, a computer can too." Taylor admits that machines are fallible but far less so than humans. "The fully autonomous car would not only have more experience than a 17-year-old driver, but also his father. Autonomous cars will also save fuel, cut journey times and save lives," he argues.

Players have reported problems that include crashing upon launch, heavy stuttering and frame rate drops.  ( Hello Games | Steam ) Advertisement Gamers who patiently waited for the PC version of space exploration game No Man's Sky to be released are now extremely disappointed, as the title comes with performance issues right upon its launch. No Man's Sky for PC, released Aug. 12 on Steam and GOG for $59.99, has not been living up to expectations, with a variety of issues that are preventing players from starting their space exploration adventure. On the game's Steam page as of this writing, No Man's Sky has already garnered nearly 5,000 negative reviews, compared with over 3,000 positive reviews. Players have reported issues that include crashing every time they launch the game, heavy stuttering and frame rate drops. As detailed on the same page, the minimum system requirements for the title are 64-bit versions of Windows 7, Windows 8.1 or Windows 10; an Intel Core i3 processor with at least 8 GB of RAM; a GPU equivalent to Nvidia GTX 480 or AMD Radeon 7870; and 10 GB of available storage. However, despite players using computers that far exceed these system requirements, they are still experiencing the game's reported performance issues. In its tests of the game, Ars Technica reported that there has been inconsistency in frame rates and instances of freezing, despite the two PCs they are using boasting specifications of Nvidia GTX 980Ti cards, 16 GB of RAM and either a Haswell i7 or Skylake i5 Intel processor, with Windows 10 and fully-updated drivers. No Man's Sky for the PC defaults to a cap of 30 frames per second, which can be disabled in the game's options. When the setting is turned on, the title keeps dropping to 20 frames per second, but when the cap is removed, frame rate reaches 60 frames per second. However, the frame rate randomly keeps dropping down to 30 frames per second. Kotaku, using a PC powered by a 4.2 GHz Intel i7 processor and an Nvidia GTX 1080 GPU, is also experiencing performance issues of hitching and stuttering that happens from the loading screen and continues into gameplay. The confusing thing is that No Man's Sky runs well on the PlayStation 4, despite the gaming console packing relatively weaker processing power compared with some of the PCs that are experiencing performance issues. A lengthy thread on the PC version's performance issues has spawned on the subreddit for No Man's Sky, where it has been determined that most of the problems are due to the game itself and not players' hardware. One of the reasons for the issues has been pinpointed to be the lack of SSE4.1 support, which is something that players can fix but is something that is the fault of developer Hello Games. No Man's Sky director Sean Murray has acknowledged the PC performance issues on his Twitter account, through which he provided possible solutions. Murray promised that Hello Games will try to solve the issues as soon as possible, with a patch already uploaded within minutes of the game's launch. The patch, however, did not seem to help. PC users who have been excited to dive into No Man's Sky are now forced to wait for a fix to be applied to the title, which is a letdown as most were expecting a smooth experience similar to what PlayStation 4 gamers have had so far.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Health Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Games 'No Man's Sky' PC Support: Performance issues hamper play, developer identifies bugs and promises fixes "No Man's Sky" was released on Aug. 12 for PC. Aditya Bhat   August 13, 2016 15:20 IST "No Man's Sky" is currently available on PS4 and PC.Twitter/PlayStation Europe The release of the PC version of "No Man's Sky" on Aug. 12 has been beset with performance issues. PC players of "No Man's Sky" were plagued by framerate issues as systems are unable to run the game at a steady pace. Players have reported stuttering issues with some players being unable to even launch the game. Why advertise with us? Related Developer is aware of issues and these are the workarounds it suggested for 'No Man's Sky' "No Man's Sky" is expected to be released on Aug. 9. Other issues that has affected the game include sound problems, an issue where the game asks players to restart when playing and crashes.  The developer has noted that it is aware of these issue. Sean Murray, the co-founder of Hello Games, the company that developed it, noted on Twitter, "99% appear to be up and running on our servers. We'll begin trying to resolve asap for those who are having issues."  Hello Games has released day one patch for PC version of the game.  He also noted that one of the biggest issues that was reported by players was that they do not have Visual C++ Redist 2010, and requested they install the first day patch and restart the system. He also noted that the other issue is those having outdated GFX drivers or those who do not have one. So he requested players to install the latest from either AMD or nVidia. He also requested that the GFX card be above the minimum specification. Here is the minimum specs of the game: OS: Windows 7/8.1/10 (64-bit versions) Processor: Intel Core i3 Memory: 8 GB RAM Graphics: nVidia GTX 480, AMD Radeon 7870 Storage: 10 GB available space *Requires OpenGL 4.5, Intel cards are not supported. *Core 2 CPUs and below are not supported It also shared links to update the GFX card – AMD and nVidia He assured affected players that the company was working on resolving key issues and noted that they are also working on the crashes. He asked players to check for following issues: Running the game with an Intel card. This is not supported No Man's Sky is an OpenGL 4.5 game, and requires latest drivers on most cards, please update VC++ Redist 2010 was not included by default. We have updated in a patch, please restart Further, it would be deploying hot fixes for the following issues: Shader Cache issue – means that framerate is initially stuttering on some cards. Whilst it resolves itself over time (~1 hour of play), we will fix this issue in a patch. SSE 4 – for CPUs that do not support SSE 4, it is causing the game to crash on boot (some of these area technically below min spec, but we don't want it to crash!) Mouse controls jitter on foot – this caused by a combination of certain resolution and GFX card. A fix is in progress. We can expect more fixes dropping to players and platforms in the coming days. The developers at Hello Games are a small team and had earlier reported of hiring more people into QA. "No Man's Sky" is a procedurally generated universe that allows players to explore, trade, combat and survive the massive universe. It was earlier released for PS4 on Aug. 9. Whilst many people are enjoying No Man's Sky PC, we are tracking several issues, and working hard to resolve them:https://t.co/LfLWv6qwEC— Sean Murray (@NoMansSky) August 13, 2016 Also read 'No Man's Sky' on PC will see a delayed release 'No Man's Sky' goes gold Post Comment IBT TV Close Russia: Police detain robot for attending political rally Why advertise with us?

Almost a year ago with the availability of support for VSAN to support an All-Flash (AF) configuration, I updated my lab when I could to ditch the spinning disks and move to an all flash model. I thought I was set and was good to go, but like most things you can’t leave good enough alone.  The last few months a made a few tweaks and changes to the lab, added Intel PCIe Flash devices for the write cache tier and moved from using USB drives for ESXi install to SATADOM’s on the hosts. First things first, everyone seems to care about IOP numbers, so we will start with PCIe flash. After doing some research/digging on PCIe cards I settled on using the Intel 750 series card. In an effort not to break the bank and also not needing a large write tier I went with the 400GB cards for each of my three VSAN hosts. While the more expensive big brother of 750 series is on the VSAN HCL ( Intel P3xxx series), these cards worked without issue right out of the box. One thing of note, I did update the inbox driver to a driver provided by Intel that Pete Koehler (blog / twitter) recommended for overall performance gains. With the drivers updated and a quick reconfiguration of the VSAN Datastore it was time to do some testing. For a testing model I leveraged three VM’s, one on each ESXi host in the cluster, and IOmeter to generate a workload. While synthetic workloads are the best method truly getting “real world” performance numbers, for the details I was wanting to capture IOmeter met those needs. For a workload metric I leveraged a configuration file that was based on 32K block size, 50% read and 50% write. I ran the workload three times on each VM at the same time and the table below details the averages: Read the entire article here, VSAN Upgrades–NVMe & SATADOM via the fine folks at VMware!

They reported mixed results -- some wins and some losses for FreeBSD -- using a clean install with the default package/settings on the x86_64/amd64 version for each operating system. FreeBSD 11.0 showed the fastest compile times, and "With the SQLite benchmark, the BSDs came out ahead of Linux [and] trailed slightly behind DragonFlyBSD 4.6 with HAMMER. The 11.0-BETA4 performance does appear to regress slightly for SQLite compared to FreeBSD 10.3...

Photo / Alicja Grocz After 13 years in the digital business space and surviving the 2009 global financial crisis, Method Studio owners Sam Ramlu and Euge Eastlake know a thing or two about adapting to changing markets - and therefore changing times. Managing director Sam Ramlu sheds some light on Method Studios. What does your business do? We're a digital agency with a new-tech focus. What that means is we work on online, interactive and digital projects, anything from websites and games to currently augmented and virtual reality. What are the augmented and virtual reality projects Method Studios works on? At the moment we have one virtual reality project that we launched last year for UniTec and that was really an integrated experience. With augmented reality we've got a couple of things we're working on at the moment, but I probably can't say too much as they are at the prototype stages. Is the business owned by you and your partner? Yes. I look after the strategy and client side, and manage the business, and my partner is the creative and technical director. What gave you the idea for business? We initially set up because we saw a real market opportunity for really experienced-based websites. Continued below. Related Content Kiwi coconut milk startup expanding to Australia and US Small business: Catering to the gluten-free market Small business: BeezThingz For us it has always been about making the online experience engaging and interactive. At that point we had seen a lot of cookie-cutter websites and we wanted to make sure that people got the most out of their online experience. It is somewhere you spend a lot more time than you would in any traditional media so we saw real opportunities there. As the industry has changed in the last 13 years, digitally, we have grown with it and always aim to be at the fore-front of the market. Back then we were doing amazing experience-based Flash websites and then when mobile came in to play we moved along with that and when HTML was big and now this new virtual and augmented reality space. Method Studios' team. Photo / Alicja Grocz Along the way we have always worked with new technologies, but not just tech for tech sake. We've made sure there's been an actual reason to have it and that there is value compositions for it as well... and that actually brings to life the product of the story we are trying to sell or push. What big client names have you worked with? A lot of the projects we have done have had the agency name against them. We've done work for Intel, Microsoft, BayCorp, Harrison Grierson, Panuku Development Auckland which includes Wynyard Quarter, Bell Tea and Coffee Company, Unitec, Moccona, Honda, TVNZ, Dot Kiwi - a varied range of industries. What are the biggest challenges you have faced? I don't know if it is a challenge of sort, but one of things is keeping up with changing technologies. One of the things for us was that we were really big on Flash websites so when Flash started dying off we had to change the way we worked and the people we had working with us because it meant a whole new skill base. We found 2009 was really difficult for us with the Global Financial Crisis because we found that instead of people going in to digital and spending less money doing similar marketing, they did not want to take the risk with doing stuff online. In New Zealand specifically they were sticking to things they knew as they did not want to risk their dollars on something they were not sure about, so that was quite difficult for us. What has been the best thing you've done? The best thing we have done to date has been the work we have done for Heart Kids. Euge and I are partners, life partners as well. We had our son a couple of years ago and he was born with a congenital heart defect, had to undergo open heart surgery - it was massive - but eight weeks after that Heart Kids were looking for an agency and we sort of put our hands up and said, 'look we'll help you out'. We ended up being their agency for everything and last year we worked with them on their August Awareness month campaign (which is on again now) and did an amazing website for them which was first of all great for us to be able to give back and do something for a charity and it also allowed us to use our creative license a little bit. A little bit of help along the way is only going to help grow your business. Sam Ramlu The site has kind of gone accolade after accolade. We won a few online awards last year, we were up for a Webby last year and we have just found out that we're up for a Best Award as well. The work we have done through that and raising awareness for Heart Kids has probably been some of my proudest moments and our team's, just really proud of the work they did as well, sort of helping us because they know it is something close to our hearts. What advice would you give to other small business operators? I think getting the right team around you is important. We've had to wear a lot of hats so as quickly as you can you should try and expand your team, even if it's being a little bit smart about it. Recently we offered some unpaid internships just to get people in and getting them working on stuff before they became full-timers. It sounds really cliché but sometimes you have to spend a bit of money to get a little bit known out there. We've always been the type that has tried to do it all ourselves, but it can be really hard as a small business. A little bit of help along the way is only going to help grow your business. We did 12 years really hard and then thought 'well, we should actually be making the most of some of these opportunities and use them to our advantage.' - NZ Herald By Aimee Shaw Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Creative Commons Zero A few weeks ago, Citrix and Bitdefender launched XenServer 7 and Bitdefender Hypervisor Introspection, which together compose the first commercial application of the Xen Project Hypervisor’s Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) infrastructure. In this article, we will cover why this technology is revolutionary and how members of the Xen Project Community and open source projects that were early adopters of VMI (most notably LibVMI and DRAKVUF) collaborated to enable this technology. Evolving Security Challenges in Virtual Environments Today, malware executes in the same context and with the same privileges as anti-malware software. This is an increasing problem, too. The Walking Dead analogy I introduced in this Linux.com article is again helpful. Let’s see how traditional anti-malware software fits into the picture and whether our analogy applies to anti-malware software. In the Walking Dead universe, Walkers have taken over the earth, feasting on the remaining humans. Walkers are active all the time, and attracted by sound, eventually forming a herd that may overrun your defences. They are strong, but are essentially dumb. As we explored in that Linux.com article, people make mistakes, so we can’t always keep Walkers out of our habitat. For this analogy, let’s equate Walkers with malware. Let’s assume our virtualized host is a village, consisting of individual houses (VMs) while the Hypervisor and network provides the infrastructure (streets, fences, electricity, …) that bind the village together. Enter the world of anti-malware software: assume the remaining humans have survived for a while and re-developed technology to identify Walkers fast, destroy them quickly and fix any damage caused. This is the equivalent of patrols, CCTV, alarmed doors/windows and other security equipment, troops to fight Walkers once discovered and a clean-up crew to fix any damage. Unfortunately, the reality of traditional malware security technology can only be deployed within individual houses (aka VMs) and not on the streets of our village. To make matters worse, until recently malware was relatively dumb. However, this has changed dramatically in the last few years. Our Walkers have evolved into Wayward Pine’s Abbies, which are faster, stronger and more intelligent than Walkers. In other words, malware is now capable of evading or disabling our security mechanisms. What we need is the equivalent of satellite surveillance to observe the entire village, and laser beams to remotely destroy attackers when they try and enter our houses. We can of course also use this newfound capability to quickly deploy ground troops and clean-up personnel as needed. In essence that is the promise that Virtual Machine Introspection gives us. It allows us to address security issues from outside the guest OS without relying on functionality that can be rendered unreliable from the ground. More on that topic later. From VMI in Xen to the First Commercial Application: A Tale of Collaboration The idea of Virtual Machine Introspection for the Xen Project Hypervisor hatched at Georgia Tech in 2007, building on research by Tal Garfinkel and Mendel Rosenblum in 2003. The technology was first incorporated into the Xen Project Hypervisor via the XenAccess and mem-events APIs in 2009. To some degree, this was a response to VMware’s VMsafe technology, which was introduced in 2008 and deprecated in 2012, as the technology had significant limitations at scale. VMSafe was replaced by vShield, which is an agent-based, hypervisor-facilitated, file-system anti-virus solution that is effectively a subset of VMsafe. Within the Xen Project software however, Virtual Machine Introspection technology lived on due to strong research interests and specialist security applications where trading off performance against security was acceptable. This eventually led to the creation of LibVMI (2010), which made these APIs more accessible. This provided an abstraction that eventually allowed exposure of a subset of Xen’s VMI functionality to other open source virtualization technologies such as KVM and QEMU. In May 2013, Intel launched its Haswell generation of CPUs, which is capable of maintaining up to 512 EPT pointers from the VMCS via the #VE and VMFUNC extensions. This proved to be a potential game-changer for VMI, enabling hypervisor controlled and hardware enforced strong isolation between VMs with lower than previous overheads, which led to a collaboration of security researchers and developers from Bitdefender, Cisco, Intel, Novetta, TU Munich and Zentific. From 2014 to 2015, the XenAccess and mem-events APIs have been re-architected into the Xen Project Hypervisor’s new VMI subsystem, alt2pm and other hardware capabilities have been added, as well as support for ARM CPUs and a baseline that was production ready has been released in Xen 4.6. Citrix and Bitdefender collaborated to bring VMI technology to market: XenServer 7.0 introduced its Direct Inspect APIs built on the Xen Projects VMI interface. It securely exposes the introspection capabilities to security appliances, as implemented by Bitdefender HVI. What Can Actually Be Done Today? Coming back to our analogy: what we need is the equivalent of satellite surveillance to observe the entire village. Does VMI deliver? In theory, yes: VMI makes it possible to observe the state of any virtual machine (house and its surroundings in the village), including memory and CPU state and to receive events when the state of the virtual machine changes (aka if there is any movement). In practice, the performance overhead of doing this is far too high, despite using hardware capabilities. In our imagined world that is overrun by Walkers and Abbies, this is equivalent to not having the manpower to monitor everything, which means we have to use our resources to focus on high value areas. In other words, we need to focus on the suspicious activity on system perimeters (the immediate area surrounding each of our houses). This focus is executed by monitoring sensitive memory areas for suspicious activity. When malicious activity is detected, a solution can take corrective actions on the process state (block, kill) or VM state (pause, shutdown) while collecting and reporting forensic details directly from a running VM. Think of a laser beam on our satellite that is activated whenever an Abbie or Walker approaches our house. In technical terms, the satellite and laser infrastructure maps to XenServer’s Direct Inspect API, while the software which controls and monitors our data maps onto Bitdefenders Hypervisor Introspection. It is important to stress that monitoring and remedial action takes place from the outside, using the hypervisor to provide hardware-enforced isolation. This means that our attackers cannot disable surveillance nor laser beams. Of course, no security solution is perfect. This monitoring software may not always detect all suspicious activity, if that activity does not impact VM memory. This does not diminish the role of file-system-based security; we must still be vigilant, and there is no perfect defense. In our village analogy, we could also be attacked through underground infrastructure such as tunnels and canalisation. In essence this means we have to use VMI together with traditional anti-malware software. How does VMI compare to traditional hypervisor-facilitated anti-virus solutions such as vShield? In our analogy, these solutions require central management of all surveillance equipment that is installed in our houses (CCTV, alarmed doors/windows, …) while the monitoring of events is centralized very much like a security control centre in our village hall. Albeit such an approach significantly simplifies monitoring and managing of what goes on within virtual machines, it does not deliver the extra protection that introspection provides. You can find more information (including some demos) about VMI, XenServer Direct Inspect API and BitDefender Hypervisor Introspection here: Xen Project Virtual Machine Introspection XenServer Direct Inspect API Bitdefender Hypervisor Introspection Conclusion The development of VMI and its first open source and commercial applications show how the Xen Project community is innovating in novel ways, and is capable of bringing revolutionary technologies to market. The freedom to see the code, to learn from it, to ask questions and offer improvements has enabled security researchers and vendors such as Citrix and Bitdefender to bring new solutions to market. It is also worth pointing out that hardware-enabled security technology is moving very fast: only a subset of Intel's #VE and VMFUNC extensions are currently being deployed in VMI. Making use of more hardware extensions carries the promise of combining the protection of out-of-guest tools with the performance of in-guest tools. What is even more encouraging is that other vendors such as A1Logic, Star Lab and Zentific are working on new Xen Project-based security solutions. In addition, the security focused, Xen-based OpenXT project has started to work more closely with the Xen Project community, which promises further security innovation. A few of these topics will be discussed in more detail during Xen Project Developer Summit happening in Toronto, CA from August 25 - 26, 2016. You learn more about the event here.

As more devices get connected to the Internet and to one another, the magnitude of threat to our data too increases. Mobile phones were once considered safe in comparison to PCs. But not any more. India ranked the highest among 10 countries for total number of unique infections, according to the McAfee Labs Threats Report, June 2016. John Giamatteo, Corporate V-P, Intel Security Group, spoke to B. Pradeep Nair on emerging threats. Excerpts: What are the new challenges in the security landscape? One of the biggest challenges is the vast number of connected devices. The access points for bad guys have increased, making it easier for them to infiltrate. The number of IoT (Internet of Things) devices is expected to grow from three billion to 13 billion in the next four years. That means there are going to be 13 billion access points for the bad guys. Every hour more than 4.3 million attempts were made (via emails, browser searches, etc.) to entice our customers into connecting to risky URLs in Q1, according to the McAfee Labs Threats Report. The bad guys are more sophisticated than they have ever been. They are also better funded than they have ever been. What are the top security threats? The number one threat, in terms of growth and complexity of attack, is ransomware. While on PCs, it tends to encrypt files and demand money to unlock them, on Android devices, the trend is to lock the user out until a fee is paid. Miscreants also tend to make bogus legal threats to frighten users into paying up. There are also password breaches. The threat is so high that we built our own biometric solution. We have a product called True Key. It is a cross-platform application that uses facial features, the devices you own, like a phone, tablet or computer; fingerprint etc for flexible multi-factor protection. How vulnerable are our mobile devices? Very vulnerable. Especially in markets like India, where more and more people are skipping the PC stage and directly using the mobile devices for accessing Internet. So, mobile protection is one of our strategic initiatives. And we have made it very easy to get the solution cover all your devices. Now with IoT, we are extending the protection to wearables as well. We will soon introduce more device coverage. Our philosophy is security as a service that protects all your digital life, irrespective of which device you are on. We have partnerships with Samsung and LG, wherein our solution comes embedded in the device. Apps are driving mobile usage, but how safe are they? It’s major point of vulnerability. As many as 37 million devices were affected by malware coming from mobile app stores in the last six months, with mobile malware samples up 24 per cent in Q4 of 2015 itself. Our products are designed such that they constantly scan apps. We also tell what data is shared with the app, like location. There is also now the new trend of ‘mobile app collusion’. Here, different apps, that don’t pose a threat individually, in combination become dangerous. One of them could access local information, and it could transfer data to another app using channels for inter-app communication. The second app would then transfer the data to an outside device. What are the new ways ensuring the safety of consumers? We are employing new algorithms and other technologies, like machine-learning and cloud-based infrastructure. In June 2015, we had 100 million users; today, we protect 190 million users. With more users, we get more samples and all that data is fed into the Global Threat Intelligence system making the technology smarter. Another area we are looking at is the ‘home gateway’, or the Wi-Fi router. A heightened level of protection for Wi-Fi users could be compelling for telecom companies. This is a new and emerging category. More In: Industry | Business Tweet Please Wait while comments are loading... This article is closed for comments.

The goal, you see, is not to make one object shine, but to make the objects bleed together in synergy to make the entire effect shine.      PHOTO 1 2 3 4 Naoto Fukusawa’s deceptively simple Papilio chair 1 2 3 4 “My... work is to draw the line between substance and air... We have to design for intangible things.” -- furniture designer Naoto Fukusawa 1 2 3 4 Designer Naoto Fukusawa gave a lecture on his design philosophy as part of the 50th anniversary of Italian furniture company B&B Italia, with which Mr. Fukusawa has worked with since 2005. 1 2 3 4 The Titikaka resort bench, made of aluminum and teak, was inspired by the waves on a lake, and looks to some like an unfurled piece of fabric.    RELATED STORIES An unusual palette for fall A P200,000 mattress Personalizing one’s kitchen Dual purpose furniture for condos A good mattress means a good night’s sleep This, in a nutshell, was the point made at a talk given by designer Naoto Fukusawa, hailed in Bloomberg Businessweek as one of the world’s most influential designers. The magazine cites him as inspiring Apple and Intel in the 1990s. As for his personal oeuvre, he’s better known for creating more mundane objects such as a humidifier, mobile phones, and -- one of his best known works -- a CD player for Japanese home goods store MUJI. Mr. Fukusawa flew in to the Philippines for the 50th anniversary of Italian furniture company B&B Italia, distributed in the Philippines by Focus Global, Inc. Mr. Fukusawa has worked with B&B Italia since 2005, creating furniture which can well be described by the word “masterpiece”: think his Papilio chair, named after the butterfly, inspired by a butterfly spreading its wings. At first glance, it looks merely like a rounded blob forming the outline of a chair, with soft flares against its extremities suggesting the mere whisper of design. But ah! The rounded shape cradles the back and posterior, as if you were born for such a chair. Thanks to its popularity, the Papilio line has extended to include armchairs, and even a bed. For its 50th anniversary, B&B Italia released the chair covered in plush sheepskin. Mr. Fukusawa gave a talk called “The Outline of Things,” expressing the value and values of a line -- it sounds awfully simplistic, but Mr. Fukusawa’s deceptively simple design philosophies extend far beyond the chairs, the beds; integrating itself into life: as is the goal. “My... work is to draw the line between substance and air,” said Mr. Fukusawa, expressing the almost-mystical line in businesslike tones. “We have to design for intangible things.” By intangible things, Mr. Fukusawa focuses on air, light, smell -- the minor details that create the character in a room, more than the things in it. “It does not only show the object; it’s more kind of giving you a hint to live in a... [a certain] quality of life.” “You should see more [of the] ambient, not really focus too much... [on an] individual piece].” “I think, you have to be careful to make an exact line to fit into the life you already have.” The exact line, and life, draws from things such as a shared culture, history, and memory, among other things. “A designer is a road to making the things embodied, which we already share... in [the hidden] mind,” he said. “You and me, [we] share already some sort... of the images. I just embody it... to show you... those are the things [you like]. “How do you know? Because we all already share already the lifestyle background. That’s why, I know you... and I can make it... I can describe your soul in this way. “Design is a communication like that.” After his lecture, he explained to BusinessWorld what he needs to design. “I have to feel as someone else feels,” he said. “That is my kind of attitude... if I am happy, people should be happy.” His other pieces, although possessive of a simplicity of form, are not what he would call minimal, or minimalist: “This is not minimalist at all! This is quite radical.” See, for example, the Titikaka resort bench, made of aluminum and teak, inspired by the waves on a lake, looking to some like an unfurled piece of fabric. In any case, he credits the Japanese love of most things that are simple to a simple step. “Following nature... human beings are a part of nature... learn from nature, as harmony,” he said. “Nature means, not just nature, the environment. It’s nature as a kind of, human behavior...” As he told BusinessWorld: “It’s harmony. I think it’s not just to simplify. Minimalism is [more of matching] the surround[ings]. That’s why radical expression sometimes [needs] to be minimal.” Mr. Fukusawa then warns about the presence of ego in design; and how he frames it makes anything else other than the search for true form almost selfish. Many designers, he said, use design to try “to express the personalities, and the ego, or [a] message, or whatever.” “Design the things just for making your life better.” As he elaborated after the lecture: “Design is two parts: one is, expression of the artist. The other one is just to be of function; for use. A designer is just making the things as functional, not [just] for the part of expression of the maker.” The transcendence then, of design as mere expression, but a contribution to simplify lives, imbues a piece with the immortal, and leaves a lesson: “If people love... without ego, they keep loving forever. But once ego [is] detailed in it, they might be... bored of that.” The simple forms, bereft of ornamentation, can sometimes seem bland. But in stripping down to the essentials -- or the mere outline -- does minimal expression become boring? “No. Because life [is never] simple enough.” -- Joseph L.

Thread: Dual Titan X and Thunderbolt with Asus X99 Deluxe II? Page 1 of 2 12 Last Jump to page: Results 1 to 10 of 16 Thread Tools  Thread Tools Show Printable Version Email this Page… Subscribe to this Thread… Display  Display Linear Mode Switch to Hybrid Mode Switch to Threaded Mode #1 Dual Titan X and Thunderbolt with Asus X99 Deluxe II?  Ryan Canon View Profile View Forum Posts Private Message Visit Homepage Senior Member Join Date Jul 2008 Posts 138 08-14-2016, 10:39 AM I emailed ASUS support with this on Wednesday, and haven't received any guidance... This recent build was working very well, first with GTX1080, then with a single Titan X Pascal I bought from a reviewer on eBay a couple of weeks ago. I went ahead and got a second Titan X to see if there was any appreciable improvement. System Details: ASUS X99 Deluxe II Intel 6950 M2 Samsung 950 Boot SSD 64gb RAM GTX 10 series Titan X (Pascal) Slot 1 Second Titan Slot 3 ASUS Thunderbolt 3 EX Card in Slot 5 I've been using this system with a single GPU without issue, but adding a second GPU triggered some kind of failure loop at power on, and a string of error codes repeatedly: 25, 41, 6F, 60, 68, 70, 79, 91, 95 I reset the CMOS, and the system will post, enter bios, and shows both GPU in the system manager. Because I'm using an M2 SSD, bios correctly shows X16/X8 lane configuration. After I enable the Thunderbolt card in BIOS, then restart, the system is again unable to POST - putting it back into a failure loop. Right now I've just disabled the Thunderbolt card while I play with the dual GPU setup, but if this is a long term solution I'd like to get both working at the same time.     #2   Ryan Canon View Profile View Forum Posts Private Message Visit Homepage Senior Member Join Date Jul 2008 Posts 138 08-14-2016, 10:46 AM I'm happy to share some performance feedback, if anyone has any requests. So far performance feels about the same in real world playback, with 8K full debayer playing back a bit better with both GPU. The single Titan X with half debayer is pretty great to work with on its own, though. I haven't done any transcoding tests, feedback so far is purely subjective.     #3   Andrei Goaga View Profile View Forum Posts Private Message Senior Member Join Date Jan 2015 Posts 255 08-14-2016, 01:22 PM Are you overcloking the CPU multiplier, or the BCLK?     #4   Ryan Canon View Profile View Forum Posts Private Message Visit Homepage Senior Member Join Date Jul 2008 Posts 138 08-14-2016, 06:37 PM With one GPU the system is stable at 4ghz.

Same string of error codes that resulted in continuous boot loop. Asus customer service was no help.     #6   Daniel Dash View Profile View Forum Posts Private Message Visit Homepage Junior Member Join Date Jan 2016 Location Marbella/Spain Posts 26 08-15-2016, 04:41 AM Whats your power supply?

There are more reports of this, going back a year on other forums. I've seen another reference to dual GPU and Thunderbolt working with the Rampage board in this post, and that will probably be what I try next unless I receive any direction from the Asus support team.     #9   Maik Müller View Profile View Forum Posts Private Message Visit Homepage Senior Member Join Date Oct 2009 Location Dresden, Germany Posts 1,973 08-16-2016, 12:30 PM Did you try to set the board to 3way sli to force it into a different split of PCIe lanes? It sounds like the board is assigning all the available lanes to the slots with the titans, then M.2 and ends up without having free lanes for the thunderbolt card... Just an idea.

I can't put a Titan in slot 5 because it interferes with the USB headers. I assume I could try 1 & 4 - I haven't done that yet. I could also try 5, and pulling the USB cables while I test. I'm also considering changing to a U.2 boot drive to get the SSD off of the lanes shared with PCIE Slot 3, and trying it in U.2_1 (which shares lanes with PCIE Slot 5). I'm not sure if this will make a difference, but I'm not sure what else to do.     Page 1 of 2 12 Last Jump to page: Quick Navigation Post-Production HARDWARE Top Site Areas Settings Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home Forums Red Digital Cinema Recon NAB 2016 DRAGON WEAPON RAVEN RED DISCUSSION Crucial Ordnance EPIC-M OWNERS The DSMC System EPIC RED ONE SCARLET REDLINK DEVELOPERS .

Maximilian Doemling, senior manager for highly automated driving at BMW Group, says the self-driving car will hit roads five years from now. “If you’re expecting autonomous function where you can be on the highway, pressing the button and the car is doing everything for you, like lane changing and driving and that stuff, and you can play with smartphone, and you’re always safe, I mean we had the big announcement with Intel and Mobileye that we will have the iNext in 2021.” Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Harald Krüger, said that the iNEXT will be, “our new innovation driver, with autonomous driving, digital connectivity, intelligent lightweight design, a totally new interior and ultimately bringing the next generation of electro-mobility to the road.” The new model is the centerpiece of BMW’s effort to defend its position in the luxury-car market as consumers’ preferences are changing and shifting towards electric and self-driving automobiles. BMW is responding to pressure from Tesla and traditional rivals like Mercedes as well as the potential iCar by Apple. IHS Automotive estimates self-driving vehicles will account for around 10 percent of the global auto market in 2035. However, it’s been suggested by analysts there is still a long way to go to manufacture a completely reliable driverless car.

But the exact nature of that change will be determined by the social, political, and business choices we make. A digital platform economy is emerging. Companies such as Amazon, Etsy, Facebook, Google, Salesforce, and Uber are creating online structures that enable a wide range of human activities. This opens the way for radical changes in how we work, socialize, create value in the economy, and compete for the resulting profits. Their effects are distinct and identifiable, though certainly not the only part of the rapidly reorganizing global economy. As the work by Michael Cusumano, Annabelle Gawer, and Peter Evans has shown, these digital platforms are multisided digital frameworks that shape the terms on which participants interact with one another. The initial powerful information technology (IT) transformation of services emerged with the Internet and was, in part, a strategy response to intense price-based competition among producers of relatively similar products. IT-enabled services transformation, as our colleagues Stuart Feldman, Kenji Kushida, Jonathan Murray, and Niels Christian Nielsen have argued in other venues, was based on the application of an array of computable algorithms to myriad activities, from consumption and leisure to services and manufacturing. The movement of these algorithms to the cloud, where they can be easily accessed, created the infrastructure on which, and out of which, entire platform-based markets and ecosystems operate. Platforms and the cloud, an essential part of what has been called the “third globalization,” reconfigure globalization itself. These digital platforms are diverse in function and structure. Google and Facebook are digital platforms that offer search and social media, but they also provide an infrastructure on which other platforms are built. Amazon is a marketplace, as are Etsy and eBay. Amazon Web Services provides infrastructure and tools with which others can build yet more platforms. Airbnb and Uber use these newly available cloud tools to force deep changes in a variety of incumbent businesses. Together they are provoking reorganization of a wide variety of markets, work arrangements, and ultimately value creation and capture. This digitally based new economy has been given a variety of names derived from some of its perceived attributes. How we label this transformation matters because the labels influence how we study, use, and regulate these digital platforms. Its boosters have called it the Creative Economy or the Sharing Economy, whereas those less convinced of its beneficence have dubbed it the Gig Economy, the Precariat, or the 1099 Economy, focusing on its impact on workers and how they are compensated. And there are wide variations within these labels. Consider the Shared Economy. Examples include Uber and Airbnb, which are very distant from the visions of Wikipedia, with its communal construction of knowledge; from Napster, which shared music regardless of whether it was legal; or from open source software creations such as Linux and Apache. Despite the attractive label and the entrepreneurial successes, Uber, Airbnb, and Facebook are not based on “sharing”; rather, they monetize human effort and consumer assets. Indeed, the advantage of platform-based companies often rests on an arbitrage between the practices adopted by platform firms and the rules by which established companies operate, which are intended to protect customers, communities, workers, and markets. Lyft and Airbnb are entrepreneurial initiatives that facilitate the conversion of consumption goods such as automobiles and apartments into goods that are monetized. This “sharing” has a more than passing resemblance to the putting-out economy that existed before factories, when companies would ship materials to people to assemble items such as shoes, clothing, or firearms in their homes. In the current manifestation of putting out, the platform operator has unprecedented control over the compensation for and organization of work, while still claiming to be only an intermediary. On the other hand, the rapidly growing mobile phone app stores and user-generated content platforms such as YouTube and Instagram are structured as digital consignment industries, borrowing from the way artists sell their work through galleries. We are in the midst of a reorganization of our economy in which the platform owners are seemingly developing power that may be even more formidable than was that of the factory owners in the early industrial revolution. We prefer the term “platform economy,” or “digital platform economy,” a more neutral term that encompasses a growing number of digitally enabled activities in business, politics, and social interaction. If the industrial revolution was organized around the factory, today’s changes are organized around these digital platforms, loosely defined. Indeed, we are in the midst of a reorganization of our economy in which the platform owners are seemingly developing power that may be even more formidable than was that of the factory owners in the early industrial revolution. The proliferation of labels is simply a reflection of the recognition that platforms are already having powerful consequences for society, markets, and firms, and that we are unclear about their dynamics and directions. Whatever we call the transformation, the consequences are dramatic. Utopia or dystopia The debate about the impact of the platform economy is an extension of a discussion that began in the early days of the IT revolution, when figures such as Robert Noyce, Bill Gates, and Steve Jobs claimed that they were creating a future that would open the world to new possibilities and prospects. Optimists still abound, and San Francisco is now experiencing what may be its biggest gold rush yet, with investors, entrepreneurs, and data scientists working furiously to create “disruptive” new businesses. For investors, inherently optimists, the question is how to build platforms, attract users, and then capture the value that is generated from the emerging ecosystem. Regardless of the platform, all of them are based on mobilizing human beings to contribute. Whether it is Google monetizing our searches, Facebook monetizing our social networks, LinkedIn monetizing our professional networks, or Uber monetizing our cars, they all depend on the digitization of value-creating human activities. The optimistic version of the emerging techno-economic system suggests that society can be reconstituted with producers becoming proto-entrepreneurs able to work on flexible schedules and benefit from these platforms. And this certainly will be the case for many. Similarly, the utopians argue that platforms, such as the car-sharing services Uber and Lyft, can unlock the commercial value in underused personal assets; other platforms, such as Airbnb, promote the notion that vacant rooms in one’s house or apartment can become sources of income whether technically hotel rooms or not. Advocates believe that all of this can occur for the greater social good without negative consequences. But can we really foresee all the repercussions of these new economic arrangements? For example, platform businesses matching workers and tasks may make labor markets more efficient, but if they become pervasive and organize a significant portion of the work, they are at the same time likely to generate fragmented work schedules and increasing levels of part-time work without the employment-related benefits that previously characterized much employer-based full-time work. For now, it is not clear whether these digital platforms are simply introducing digital intermediaries or actually increasing the extent of gig or contract work. Even as the digital era unfolded in its utopian phase in the 1970s, there were skeptics who feared that the new technologies would result in unanticipated and undesirable consequences. Perhaps most prescient was Kurt Vonnegut’s 1952 novel Player Piano, which even gave a bit part to the great mathematician Norbert Weiner. Vonnegut envisioned a digital future of material abundance—albeit a digital future of machines built with tubes, not semiconductors—with a radical social division between a highly credentialed and creatively employed elite and an underclass. His dystopian vision is now finding full expression in the fear that digital machines, artificial intelligence, robots, and the like will displace work for a vast swath of the population. Bill Davidow, once at Intel and then at his own Silicon Valley venture capital firm, expressed this in his Harvard Business Review article “What Happens to Society When Robots Replace Workers?” The MIT economists Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee explore this trend in more detail in their book The Second Machine Age. The impact on employment and the character of work is certainly one element in assessing whether we will have a utopia or dystopia. In our view, that outcome is yet to be determined. As a society we will have to make choices about how to deploy new technologies, choices that will be critical in shaping the ultimate impact. The questions are really: what balance will there be among jobs created as the digital wave flows through our economy and society, and which workers will be displaced? Certainly it is feasible to catalogue existing work, particularly work that is routine, as likely to be replaced or reconfigured by digital tools, and perhaps, as some have tried, to estimate the numbers of such existing jobs that will be digitized away. By contrast, the new kinds of work that are now being created and the existing jobs that will be redefined and reorganized in the future are more difficult to forecast, so we can only speculate. Algorithms and databases are automating some kinds of work, but even as this occurs other value-creating opportunities are appearing. There will be new products and services as well as new production and service processes, which are likely to be design and creativity intensive, as well as algorithm-enabled. Some of the early indicators of the new or transformed work can be enumerated, but certainly not exhaustively counted. Moreover, existing jobs will be redefined and reorganized in the future. The character of some existing work—how much or how little, we cannot know—will be reframed but not eliminated by digital technology. Uber, Airbnb, TaskRabbit, Handy, and other platform firms are transforming industries by connecting “producers” with customers in new ways. In some cases, this is displacing or threatening existing, often regulated, service providers, such as taxis and hotels. In other cases, it is formalizing previously less organized or locally organized work. Still other platforms, such as app stores and YouTube, are creating entirely new value-creating activities that are formalizing into what can be seen as precarious careers, such as a YouTube producer or smartphone app developer. Finally, existing organizations are creating new digital and social media marketing departments and jobs. The question in these cases is what system of control and value capture will be in place. Our sense is not necessarily that there will be less work, but that for a growing number of jobs, the relationship with an employer will be more tenuous than ever. These changes are not likely to result in the workerless society. One possibility is a society in which the preponderance of the work and value creation is more dispersed than ever before, even as the platform owners centralize the transactions and capture their value. Indeed, we may, unless policy rules lock in the position of the emerging incumbent, see another round of innovation and job creation. The use of digital automation presents a classic dilemma: anything that can be characterized sufficiently to become computable can be copied, as our colleague Niels Christian Nielsen has argued elsewhere. At that point, another round of innovation and imagination will be required. Can automation innovate itself? More likely, teams of people and digital tools working together will be required to be competitive. The Turing test might be able to establish that a digital machine can imitate intelligence, but the test does not establish consciousness or consider whether human consciousness in all its diversity differs in fundamental ways from current algorithmic tools. The debate over jobs created or destroyed is useful and worth continuing, but we should be clear that it has no end, and there will be no definitive answer. For now, there are only indicators and traces to suggest an outcome. And that outcome, we emphasize and repeat, will be shaped by choices about technology deployment that turn on entrepreneurial initiative, corporate strategies, and public policies. As in the discussion of what is being called the Internet of Things or the digitally based reorganization of manufacturing, in our research with colleagues at the Research Institute for the Finnish Economy, we find significant differences among national emphasis and investments. German policy is directed toward maintaining its competitive position in manufacturing built on a base of skills and with a fabric of small and mid-sized companies even as the foundations of production evolve. The U.S. emphasis seems to be on developing and applying high-end sophisticated tooling for aerospace and military applications. On the consumer side, some communities have simply banned Uber and Lyft, whereas others welcomed it. Which communities, this leads us to ask, are most likely to be the sources and beneficiaries of the emerging platform economy? Which are most likely to be discomfited? Although technologies may not dictate our future, they frame the choices to be made and the questions to be answered. Will the platform economy, and the reorganization it portends, catalyze economic growth and a surge in productivity driven by a new generation of entrepreneurs? Or will the algorithmically driven reorganization concentrate substantially all of the gains in the hands of those who build the platforms? Will it spark a wave of entrepreneurial possibilities, unleash unimagined creativity, free workers from oppressive work schedules, or unleash an avalanche of dispossessed workers who are trying to make a living with gigs and temporary contracts? If we do not interrogate these technological trajectories, we risk becoming unwitting victims of their outcomes. What questions should we be asking? The key technologies The algorithmic revolution and cloud computing are the foundations of the platform economy. But computing power is only the beginning of the story. That computing power is converted into economic tools using algorithms operating on the raw material of data. The software layer that stretches across and is interwoven with the economy is a fabric of algorithms. That software layer, that algorithmic fabric, is being extended to cover manufacturing, giving birth to the Internet of Things, the Internet of Everything, or the Industrial Internet, with its implied webs of sensor networks. It is no exaggeration to say that software was formerly embedded in things, but now things—services as well as physical objects—are woven into software-based network fabrics. This software layer extends the availability and lowers the cost of access to digital tools and traditional tools accessed by and controlled by digital processes. Moreover, costs drop through the use of open-source software, cloud storage and computing, and physical spaces such as those provided by TechShops that enable individuals to work with advanced industrial-scale equipment. Among other consequences, this certainly lowers the cost of entry for newcomers. Cloud computing rests on the virtualization and abstraction of computing processes. One of us (Zysman) has examined the character, emergence, and deployment of cloud computing in work with Jonathan Murray, Kenji Kushida, Patrick Scaglia, and Rick McGeer. Although the details of how it works do not matter for this essay, the consequences do. For the providers of cloud services, scale matters enormously. For users—individuals, small- and mid-size enterprises, startups, and corporations—the consequence is a radical reduction in the cost of computing resources and information and communication technology tools, a radical reduction in barriers to usage. Users can rent resources as they require them rather than having to own or build entire computing systems. Computing and the applications and platforms it facilitates are now available as an operating expense rather than a capital expense. Digital platforms are complicated mixtures of software, hardware, operations, and networks. The key aspect is that they provide a set of shared techniques, technologies, and interfaces to a broad set of users who can build what they want on a stable substrate. Android and IOS are platforms. Although they somewhat restrict the applications that one can build or sell, they are, in general, open to app builders. Android is also a platform for hardware (handset and other device makers) because the code is open, not just the interfaces. Indeed, platforms can grow on platforms. Many of the current Internet platform firms use Amazon Web Services. Many of these platforms attract a myriad of other contributors that, when sufficiently rich, can result in the formation of an ecosystem. For example, in the case of the apps stores, complementary businesses are emerging. AppAnnie is a firm that ranks the revenue generated by apps; there are advertising agencies that analyze YouTube ad buying; TubeMogul classifies YouTube “stars” and measures their reach; and there has been a proliferation of agencies that cultivate new YouTubers. These “complementors” are powerful allies in building and maintaining the lock-in for the master platform. Of course, building a platform is work, but platforms themselves then generate or organize the work of others by providing the digital locations for the connections that organize work and other activities. A looser definition of a platform, as noted previously, is one in which social and economic interactions are mediated online, often by apps. For example, Uber, so far as we know, does not yet provide a platform upon which others can establish businesses, such as organizing a pizza delivery fleet. Nevertheless, as an algorithmic structure providing a digital market and potentially an ecosystem, albeit one it controls, Uber should be considered as a firm operating a platform. Digital platforms facilitated by key technologies such as the cloud, including digital marketplaces such as Amazon and Internet firms such as Google and Facebook, are restructuring ever more parts of the economy. The discussion is complicated because, as noted, there is not yet a clear definition of digital platforms that allows us to specify precisely what is in and out of the category. The term “platform” simply points to a set of online digital arrangements whose algorithms serve to organize and structure economic and social activity. In the IT world, the term means a set of shared techniques, technologies, and interfaces that are open to a broad set of users who can build what they want on a stable substrate. As used more widely, and by us in this essay, the term also points to a set of digital frameworks for social and marketplace interactions. Speculations aside, while there is a rich and emerging literature, at the moment there is no real theory of the effect of these diverse platforms on the overall economy. To sense the scope of the market and regulatory impact of the loosely labeled platform economy, let us consider some of the most salient types of digital platforms. In all these examples, across all the categories, the algorithmic underpinnings of the online activity are most evident. For example, Lyft connects drivers with customers algorithmically. The algorithms integrate mapping software, real-time road conditions, and the availability of drivers to provide a price estimate. Drivers are vetted through online checks, which, of course, work only as well as the data they have. Payment is made by credit card information that is on file. Economic consequences What we do know is that these platforms are in many cases disrupting the existing organization of economic activity by resetting entry barriers, changing the logic of value creation and value capture, playing regulatory arbitrage, repackaging work, or repositioning power in the economic system. As a starting place for discussion, we might ask the following questions about each platform or type of platform. How is value created? The platform economy comprises a distinctly new set of economic relations that depend on the Internet, computation, and data. The ecosystem created by each platform is a source of value and sets the terms by which users can participate. Who captures the value? Indeed, what is the distribution of risks and rewards for the platform users? There are a variety of mechanisms with various implications for gains distribution. Some platforms allow the owner to “tax” all transactions, whereas others monetize their services through advertising. Platforms can transform work previously done by traditional employees into tasks performed by contractors, consigners, or quid pro quo workers—or create entirely new categories of work. There are also what Gina Neff calls “venture laborers,” that is, the people who work at the platform firms. They receive high wages, and if the firm is successful, the value of the platform is capitalized in the stock market, resulting in remarkable amounts of wealth for the firm’s direct employees and entrepreneurs. If the firm falters or fails, these individuals must find new employment. There is also a growing cohort of what some call “mini-entrepreneurs” and others call “consignment workers,” who provide goods—usually but not necessarily “virtually”—for platforms such as app stores, YouTube, or Amazon Self-Publishing. Although the vast majority of them are unsuccessful or marginally profitable, some can be enormously successful, and despite the fact that this phenomenon is as yet unmeasured, it is clearly creating many new opportunities for entrepreneurship. In certain cases, particularly in apps, those in the consignment economy sometimes grow so large that venture capitalists will invest in the entrepreneur/firm, and the employees become venture labor. Some of these apps can become platforms themselves. Put differently, the consignment model has significant upside for participants, but it is accompanied by high risk. Who owns or controls the platform? The answer varies by platform, and the differences are important. The distribution of benefits differs considerably, for example, at these platforms: Wikipedia, where the network is managed by a consensus set of rules; the Danish Agricultural Cooperative platform, in which participant owners know one another and there are clear boundaries between inside owners and others; and Uber, in which the platform is owned by a small group of entrepreneurs and their venture capitalists and where the value will eventually be capitalized by the sale of a controlling interest through either acquisition or a stock offering. How is work packaged and value created, and what percentage of work is now organized in these radically new ways? What happens to the organizational forms of work? Certainly, some workers, such as those employed by Microsoft, Google, LinkedIn, and Facebook, retain traditional employment relationships. Although these firms expect long working hours, they also provide considerable scheduling flexibility as well as a variety of free food, drinks, transportation, and other benefits that can make them appear to be corporate paradises. By comparison, those who obtain work as gigs, consignments, or contracts through digital platforms have radically different experiences. Although they have control of their work hours, they rarely receive any other employee benefits. Conceptually, if not literally, Uber converts taxi company employees or former medallion owners into contractors, whose access to income is through the Uber platform, while removing government from the rate-setting equation. Are these contractors mini-entrepreneurs, employees in all but name, or yet something else? Further, what is the proper employment category for individuals who hope to be one of the winners by producing apps, YouTube videos, or self-published books on Amazon? In these activities, there is a power law of returns by which a few big winners are remunerated by advertising, product placement payments, personal appearance fees, and even crowd-funding campaigns, while a very long tail of producers are creating the vast bulk of consigned content without monetary return. Many are now concerned that rather than creating a new source of productivity we are legitimating a new form of putting out. Can Uber drivers be self-supporting contractors in a 1099 economy rather than stable workers in an employment economy, or are they just extremely vulnerable gig workers? And, more broadly, as Ruth Collier asks, what will be the consequences for mass politics and political structures? Are we generating labor market flexibility, or a precariat that resembles a cyberized Downton Abbey replete with a small elite composed of the platform owners and a new and sizable underclass? Making choices What sort of an economy and society will we create in the transition to digital platforms and the accompanying reorganization of significant portions of the global economy? And importantly, what choices will we have? Before we turn to the long list of issues, with each issue opening an array of questions and debates, two points need to be made. First, Larry Lessig famously claimed that code is law; that is, code represents binding restrictions on behavior. Algorithms and platforms structure and constrain behavior; the law in the books is often difficult to apply or enforce in the digital world where action is possible only if it conforms to frameworks expressed in the code that shapes and directs behavior. Consider the fight between the Justice Department and Apple; the warrant has no meaning if it cannot be executed in code; for the warrant to be implemented, the code would have to be modified. Platform entrepreneurs increasingly believe that if they possess a first-mover advantage, they can, in fact, remake existing law by creating new practices on their platforms that essentially establish new norms of behavior. It is often said in Silicon Valley, “Don’t ask permission; ask forgiveness,” as, perhaps, was the case with Volkswagen’s “fix” for “clean” diesel engines. Of course, this forces two sets of questions. First, who writes the code, and whose values are expressed in code? The code writers, taking Uber as an example, have already reshaped social behavior. Government rules will influence how the new technologies are deployed and their consequences, but in a platform economy, government decisions may be constrained by the “facts” in the software. Second, although public policies are obviously important, corporate strategies also have far-reaching effects. Do companies view workers only as costs to be contained or as assets—even in an era of algorithms, data, and robots—to be developed and promoted? And equally important, are those assets directly tied to the firm? Who should bear the costs of their retention and upgrading? Acknowledging the constraints of code and the centrality of company choice in shaping outcomes, our platform future, the character of market, and the social logic established will depend on an array of policy choices. What market and social rules are appropriate for a platform economy and society? Our old labels and categories, not just old rules, are being thrown into disarray. To begin sorting this out, let us start with the firm. In the late nineteenth century, the corporation emerged as a means of orchestrating economic activity and organizing markets. In the twenty-first century, we speculate that these functions will be taken on by the platform in the cloud. Take Google, the platform economy giant, which, despite its 2014 revenues of $66 billion, has only 50,000 employees. Uber has only about 1,500 employees and is already a global business. What policy and political issues arise when the orchestrators of economic activity are relatively small firms, rather than organizations as large as Ford Motor Company, General Electric, or General Motors—all of whom also require sophisticated supplier and distribution networks? It is evident that platforms open up many entrepreneurial opportunities. Some entrepreneurs, such as Robin Chase at Zipcar, envisioned an alternative social, not just economic, model because digitally enabled car sharing could dramatically reduce the incentive to own a car. If that model spread widely, it might result in a drop in overall demand for auto production. This may or may not disrupt Hertz (Zipcar was sold to Avis), but it might dramatically affect automakers. Indeed, automakers responded by developing partnerships with Uber and Lyft. In other words, such “sharing” solutions could have unforeseen ripple effects on entire market ecosystems, as encyclopedia and book publishers are discovering to their dismay. But many platforms by their very nature prove to be winner-take-all markets, in which only one or two companies survive, and the platform owner is able to appropriate a generous portion of the entire value created by all the users on the platform. More important, however, is that as the power is centralized, the platform owner can become a virtual monopolist. In that case, the platform owner can squeeze the platform community—the drivers or customers on Lyft or Uber, the content providers, the consigners, the customers, essentially any of the participants in the ecosystem who are instrumental in creating the value in the first place. Perhaps competition among platforms in a similar domain, Uber and Lyft for example, might mute the consequences of the power inside the platform. In any case, a monopoly position or even a strong oligopoly might inhibit, or sharply constrain, further entrepreneurial efforts. Indeed, the appropriate market rules for competition/antitrust, labor market, and intellectual property among many others are becoming increasingly difficult to specify and legislate. Policy and political interests among the players, even among the winners, are far from uniform. Consider such domains as antitrust policy, where the European Commission has done battle with U.S. tech companies; intellectual property, where the interests among information and communications technology firms and platform firms are less consistent than it might seem at first glance; network policy, where carriers such as AT&T have radically different interests from Netflix or Google; and labor market policies. Indeed, the wireless carriers have announced they will start blocking advertisements on smartphones, thereby directly attacking the Google and Facebook business models. As we have shown with Bryan Pon, the turbulent environment in the smartphone ecosystem is leading to complex competitive strategies that have technical, social, and political ramifications. The question of outcomes goes beyond the question of whether digital platforms spawn entrepreneurs or monopolists. We need to ask whether a society organized around platform owners servicing mini-entrepreneurs, contractors, and gig workers portends an even more unequal society. Does the answer depend on the character of platforms or on the policies and politics of the platform economy? The issues of entrepreneurship and those of work organization that we discussed earlier are tightly interwoven. The policies that we adopt now might determine the balances achieved later. If we want an entrepreneurial spirit to infuse the platform world, then we want risk-taking entrepreneurs, whether they are forming the platforms or seeking advantage as contractors or consigners within it. But what encourages risk? Fear, or a safety-net certainty that if a gamble fails, one can always play again? Similarly, if we want workers to accept the new arrangements, how do we assure them that if they accept the flexibility, they will not be the victims but rather the beneficiaries of the ever-greater social value and wealth that is being created? All studies of technology adoption have shown that those who believe they will be victims will resist; if they believe they will be beneficiaries, they may help facilitate the shift. Of course, the largest group consists of those in the middle who are joining the platform economy because they have no choice and do not feel empowered to resist. Balancing the need to sustain initiative while cushioning the consequences of significant socioeconomic transformation leads us to a focus on social policy, not just market policy. Social policy, sometimes called welfare, shapes the risks that workers and entrepreneurs take and their evaluation of whether to support or resist change. In the United States, benefits such as pensions and health-care coverage (the latter, until the passage of the Affordable Care Act) have been tightly tied to employment. Lose your employment, lose the protections. The U.S. debate often assumes that expanded welfare protections dampen initiative, pointing to Europe as an example of how investing in social protections limits economic dynamism. Aside from whether this was, in fact, ever the case in Europe, the question is whether social protection will inherently discourage initiative now. In our view, the real issue is never the fact of protections themselves—and indeed we believe that facilitating social and economic adjustment by easing the burdens of those dislocated is both a social obligation and an economic necessity—but how social policy is paid for and organized. The emerging platform economy, with expanding contract work and gig employment, has encouraged many to look at the Nordic social policy model. The Danish flexible security model suggests that social protections can lubricate the engines of change. Simply put, many social benefits in that model are associated with citizenship, and the notion of flexible security gives employers extensive rights to adjust their workforce as needed while still providing workers with social protections in the form of training, job placement, and basic income. Certainly, this is no panacea, and indeed the Nordics are themselves reopening and intensely debating the character of their social policies. But we must consider whether addressing the downside risks of entrepreneurial efforts while providing worker flexibility with broader social safety nets as social rights can make the platform economy a source of sustainable growth. What assurances of social safety do we want to give to risk takers? The debate over policy will not be straightforward or simple. As with all economic transformations, the disruptions will create winners and losers. Who will decide how the results of increased productivity are distributed? The reality is that the winners and losers in markets depend on who can participate and on what terms. There are no markets, and no market platforms, without rules, but what happens to the politics if important market rules are made unchallenged by the platform owners? Many political struggles will be waged over these rules, and those fights will be part of defining the market and society in a platform era. Political fights will break out over protections for communities, clients, and workers as markets are disrupted. Some of those fights will be about business models that are playing a game of policy arbitrage, whereas others may be about rules for the consignment platforms. In any case, how many instances of disruption will there be? Should we view these disruptions as creating a flood of viable entrepreneurial possibilities or as destroying the security of employment relations for many? Can they create new sources of income and reasonably compensated work? Can policy encourage labor market arrangements that facilitate innovation, provide protection for workers, are efficient, and promote decent, sustainable lives for citizens? In the platform world, is there a Henry Ford who recognizes that everyone in the ecosystem requires a reasonable income in order to buy his products? This will not be a straightforward process. The reorganization of the economy around platforms will inevitably change the very configuration of the interest groups that influence how the law tries to shape the code. In sum, these battles, often engaged in isolation from each other, will interweave to reshape our communities and social life, as José van Djick has shown, as well as the character of markets and market competition. In the era of the platform, the future remains open. Answers to crucial questions are for the moment unknowable. The answers depend on our choices, not just on the technology. For example, will cloud technologies and the platform-driven economic reorganization they cause drive the productivity growth on which sustained real income improvement occurs? Will these reorganizations destroy jobs or reduce the required skill levels? The technologies—the cloud, big data, algorithms, and platforms—will not dictate our future. How we deploy and use these technologies will. When we look at the history of innovations such as electric utility grids, call centers, and the adoption of technology standards, we find that the market and social outcomes of using new technologies vary across countries. Once we start on a technology path, it frames our choices, but the technology does not determine in the first place exactly which trajectory we will follow. We will be making choices in an inherently fluid and ever-changing environment shaped to some degree by unpredictable technical change and social reactions to these changes. Ultimately, the results will depend on how we believe markets should be structured—who gains and who can compete; how we innovate; what we value in society; how we protect our communities, our workers, and the clients and users of these technologies; and how we channel the enormous opportunities created by these sociotechnical changes. It is up to us to sidestep a dystopia and to create, if not a utopia, at least a world of ever greater benefit for communities and citizens.

More recently its Douglas Rushkoff chiming in here with a critical view of digital platforms. From his blog and his book Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus, he warns that the promise of the digital age is being hijacked by a rampant form of old-style capitalism, a modus operandi akin to that of the robber-barons of the 19th century. ‘These platforms don’t exist to help people exchange with one another,’ he says. ‘They really are scorched-earth efforts at achieving monopolies in particular industries, not in order to serve those industries or even sustain them or grow them, but in order to hop over into another industry altogether. Has rampant capitalism hijacked the promise of the digital age? University of Maryland legal academic Frank Pasquale, who focuses on the ethical, legal and social implications of information technology, calls them the ‘Silicon Valley oligarchs’. ‘I think the fundamental problem is that people don’t like to face up to the reality of monopolisation,’ says Pasquale, speaking about the global rise of Uber, Airbnb and other so-called sharing economy companies. ‘It’s much more convenient to believe the comforting myth that these markets are always contestable. ‘A firm like Uber is an appeal to venture capitalists—speculative capital—that wants to see massive returns via monopolisation. Let’s not mistake the business model here. The model here is for one of these firms to come in and to take over various aspects of commerce, to take over the rides that are in an area, to take over availability of non-hotel rooms to sleep in, et cetera. I think that this is really a perversion of the original aspirations of the sharing economy.’ http://www.rushkoff.com/rampant-capitalism-hijacked-promise-digital-age/ Reply ↓ Robin Farrell May 28, 2016 at 6:24 am An excellent multi-faceted article. The rise of global (and more localised) platforms has far reaching implications for current socioeconomic and governance infrastructures. Transitions that might historically have taken decades might now occur in years (and without the same degree of localised investment). These will no doubt be accompanied by complementary developments in property rights and governance frameworks, to better suit the emergence of these new constructs and technologies. We can expect to see further innovations in alternative forms of societal / common rights, alongside the development of automated governance / self-regulated platforms, to better suit the increasing instancy and interdependence of the networked world. Reply ↓ Robin Farrell May 28, 2016 at 6:54 am How the socioeconomic evolution might occur is to be explored further. Probably more a systems evolution issue than one of choice / policy e.g. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245024299_Evolutionary_drive_New_understanding_of_change_in_socio-economic_systems Reply ↓ Rudolf Olah August 14, 2016 at 4:09 pm Very surprised that there is no mention of rent-seeking especially when Uber is mentioned. Many of these platforms are based on lock-in and rent-seeking. I will always remember how Twitter and Facebook cracked down on 3rd party applications using their API and especially how Twitter has bought out or shut down 3rd party apps. Uber is notorious for burning through venture capital and artificially lowering taxi rates. Taxi drivers and UberX drivers are already making less and less thanks to Uber’s profit increases.

The open-source OS could run on PCs, mobile devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets. Meanwhile, the Google OS features user modes and support for advanced graphics and 64-bit Intel PCs, and uses the Alphabet company's in-house Dart programming language.     Advertisement Like Us on Facebook Google will release Android Nougat in less than one month. However, the new OS spotted at the GitHub hosting service shows that the company is making plans beyond its mobile OS.   The OS at the Git storage space is probably brand new. Its description tells visitors to pick purple, which is not a color that represents Chrome OS or Android. The new OS kernel includes many high-end OS features. They include a capability-based security model and user modes.   Fuchsia can also support ARM architecture, which is a group of computer processor designs introduced in 1985. The new OS is powered by the Magenta and LK kernel. Magenta targets high-tech smartphones and PCs with fast processors, while LK targets small systems.   Google's Fuchsia OS can be tested on a PC or virtual machine. Travis Geiselbrecht is a Google software engineer and has worked on several other OS projects. He explained that Fuchsia will soon run on the mini CPU Raspberry Pi 3, according to Engadget. It is not unequivocal that the new OS will replace Android or Chrome OS, and Google has not made any official statements about the matter. It is now just an experiment that could be part of bigger projects. Google recently unveiled its smart speaker Google Home to challenge Amazon Echo. The new OS could provide more power and flexibility than Brillo for IoT devices, but fewer features than Android. In related news, Russia has fined Google $6.75 million for pre-installing apps on Android mobile devices, according to The Verge. Last year local search engine company Yandex filed a complaint against the United States-based company. Most Russian smartphones and tablets run on Android.       The small fine is the amount of money Google makes in one hour. However, it shows that the tech giant is facing more hatred in Europe.  Here's a Google Nougat preview: Advertisement Tags:google fuchsia google fuchsia operating system new google os Google News google non linux os google OS Copyright 2015 en.yibada.com All rights reserved.

Early Benchmarks Of FreeBSD 11.0 vs. DragonFlyBSD 4.6 vs. Linux Distributions Written by Michael Larabel in Operating Systems on 14 August 2016. Page 1 of 5. 16 Comments Following last week's DragonFlyBSD 4.6 benchmarks I carried out a fresh comparison of FreeBSD 10.3 vs. FreeBSD 11.0 (Beta 4 at the time) along with the DragonFlyBSD results and a few of the popular Linux distributions. Here are those numbers. Tested for this comparison were DragonFlyBSD 4.4.3, DragonFlyBSD 4.6.0, FreeBSD 10.3, FreeBSD 11.0-BETA4, Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS, Ubuntu 16.10 in its current development state, Intel Clear Linux, and CentOS Linux 7. The x86_64/amd64 version of each OS was tested on a clean install each time using the same system hardware and each OS left to its default settings/packages. The system used for testing had an Intel Xeon E5-2687W v3 Haswell CPU (3.1GHz base, 3.5GHz turbo), MSI X99S SLI PLUS motherboard, 16GB of RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770, and PNY CS1211 120GB SATA 3.0 SSD. All of the Linux and BSD operating systems were benchmarked in a fully-automated and reproducible manner using the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software.

Experts tell scalability have contributed to the country's us how to stem the rot and stop their inexorable march to the graveyard of ideas.Mumbai Mirror | Aug 14, 2016, 03.25 PM IST -By Nitindra Bandyopadhyay and Aparna Anil Copycat ideas, poor strategy and a lack of ailing startup ecosystem. Experts tell scalability have contributed to the country's us how to stem the rot and stop their inexorable march to the graveyard of ideas. SpoonJoy, Fashionara, PepperTap, LocalBanya and iTiffin are among the approximately 15 startups that launched with fanfare only to shut shop this year. Others, such as Grofers and Snapdeal have been forced to scale down operations, failing to raise enough funding to sustain themselves in a competitive market. It's an ominous time for the startup dream in India, so far chugging along on dreams of billion-dollar valuations and hopes of disrupting the market. Not anymore. The valuation bubble is coming to an end and some market experts are even predicting that it is the end of an era for a few unicorns that have failed to prove disruptive. Typically in India, the focus was on e-commerce, food-tech and grocery startups, which ruled the roost in the service sector. This is the industry that is now facing the first onslaught of the valuation markdown. As a result, a deadpool list made by market analyser Tracxn shows that around 753 startups have shut shop since 2011. Of these, around 76 had robust rounds of funding before they went down. An amount of around $50 million went down the drain as a result of startup failure in India. By the end of 2015, over 16 startups closed shop that had raised Series-A funding. What gives? The boom Impetus for the word 'startup' got a shot in the arm in 2013. "By the end of that year, India had around 76 million smartphone users and by December 2014, a quarter of the country's population — which is around 302 million — was using the internet," says Bharath Jatangi, co-founder of Pace Wisdom that provides tech support to startups. A growing domestic market coupled with a unique ecosystem of young and reasonably well-trained professionals paved the way for India's startup boom, with e-commerce ruling the roost. Most e-commerce startups saw India as a burgeoning market because of its 1.3 billion population base. Companies were betting big on the nation's exponentially rising number of internet users. According to NASSCOM, 2015 saw investments of over $5 billion flowing into startups, compared to $3 billion in 2014. India moved up by one position to become the third-fastest growing base of startups worldwide, with the number of startups crossing 4,200 by the end of 2015, registering a growth of 40 per cent year-over-year, according to the 2015 report. The year 2015 was like a gold rush with two to three startups opening every day. Take Trevo, a startup co-founded in 2015 by Nikhil Vij that was scouting for $10 million Series-A funding (it shut shop the same year) and Lumos, started by Yash Kotak (shut despite having seed funding and an angel investor). In Bengaluru, India's own Silicon Valley, there was a mad rush among techies who were leaving their jobs to become entrepreneurs. Success stories such as that of Flipkart and Ola lent credence to every graduate wanting to become the next startup CEO, explains Sharat Satyanarayana, a startup enthusiast and advisor to online startup Campus Dairy. The buoyant market saw many startups getting the attention of angel investors and some were even able to raise Series-A funding from venture capitalists. The Indian market saw the rise of Snapdeal, Ola, Housing and TaxiforSure in 2014, with funding coming in from venture firms such as Tiger Global, Softbank and Intel Capital, among others. The hiccup But the dream was too good to last. Putting the cart before the horse, many startups began a race of creating valuation ahead of value creation. This, by offering heavy discounts to first attract customers, and then planning to scale up profits. Venture capitalist firms too are to be blamed for the slowdown in the startup ecosystem. Many VC firms have invested in startups over the years, but in India none of the companies really scaled up enough to get an IPO exit. "Traditionally, VCs play the role of nurturer — guiding a company before exiting after taking a cut of their profit. They then return the money to their limited partners (LPs)," says Jithu Niruthambath, founder and CEO at Atoll Solutions Pvt Ltd. But in India, the other way out was to morph the startup into an overvalued product, sell it and make an exit. Business to customer startups, which were burning money on discounts to scale up their valuation, became the biggest casualties of this strategy. READ ALSO: Department of Science and Technology launches Rs 100 crore programme for startups "The process of calculating valuation ahead of value creation burnt a hole in the pockets of many startups. The global decline of interest value and the Chinese market hiccup resulted in a slowdown by the end of 2015 itself - ironically, the year the startup ecosystem saw most funds flowing in," says TV Mohandas Pai, Chairman of Manipal Global Education. Still, 2015 witnessed massive funding in the grocery tech landscape in India, attracting $281 million over 26 rounds as recorded by Tracxn. Over 615 grocery tech companies have been incorporated from 2010, of which over 315 companies were founded in 2015. The death knell However, by December 2015, this sector began to cave in. Big names such as Peppertap and LocalBanya began stutting down. Others such as Bigbasket have been able to raise funds, but are under constant pressure to scale up their business and add value to it. Navneet Singh, one of the founder members of Peppertap, gave an insight into why this happened in an earlier interview: "As we forayed into smaller cities, delivery networks got more fragmented and lethargic. This needed to be researched more and understood better." But insiders say the company was trying to scale up fast by diversifying its business without gaining a stronghold in an already existing market. In the 18 months of its existence, the company had raised around $51 million. Everything's not lost It's not, however, all doom and gloom. Jatangi says that despite the shutdowns and layoffs, employees still have something to look forward to. "The market is still young and has a lot of opportunities. If a startup shuts shop the skilled employees get hired easily as there is a demand for experienced hands. Also, India is seeing a spike in acqui-hires (wherein the staff at the startup is absorbed by the acquiring firm) which mitigates risks for employees who are laid off. However, unskilled employees like delivery boys do face some problems in finding a new job as they are not aware of how or whom to approach for a new job. Currently, even this workforce is being absorbed as the demand exists." Copycats abound One of the biggest reasons for the implosion in the startup ecosystem is the profusion of 'me-toos'. Simply put, there isn't enough innovation in the startup ecosystem. Rajat Tandon, senior director, NASSCOM 10000 start-ups, says as much. "If there is no uniqueness in the product and you are building the sixth me-too product in the market, that is not a great approach." Venkat Raju, CEO of Kyron, a city-based startup accelerator, agrees, "It is primarily due to lack of differentiation (technology, product, IP), poor business models (unit economics) and an inability to scale effectively," he says. Niruthambath is on the same page, explaining how following the herd, bodes ill even for venture capitalists. "In India, we have seen this in e-commerce, ultra-local startups (delivery sector) and so on," he says. "A lot of venture capitalists invest without looking at the originality or impact of the business. When herd investments come in, the startups assume they will continue to invest. Copycat companies come up thus without any strategic or business plans. They then blow up a major chunk of the money on marketing or through discounts." In this market, being valuable is more important than being visible, as DD Mishra, research director, Gartner, an American research and advisory firm providing information technology-related insight. Scalability and traction Simply put, you have to create a product or offer a service that people want. Or as Steve Jobs said, create something and make customers, who often 'don't know what they want until we show them', want it. If not, you're out. Sumanth Raghavendra, founder of Deck App Technologies, a Bengalurubased startup, certainly thinks so. "If you don't have a product that people want and are ready to pay for, then the startup is bound to fail," he says. It is also a function of time and place — and the most successful ones are those that offer value across both. "Size of success is determined by for how long you can guarantee value. Your failure is determined by your inability to provide value." Vinod Shankar, COO of Global Incubation Services (Ginserv), a Bengaurubased incubator also feels the same way. A lack of scalability — the ability to transcend geological markets — causes competition to emerge and kill the startup. The right team Then there is the need to market well, which requires the right skill set. Shankar points out that for startups to succeed, the founders should be adept in sales and marketing. "Say one co-founder is a techie, the other person should be a sales and marketing expert." A point also made by Pai, who believes that most startups by techies fail because they do not know how to sell. "They are good at product development and make very good apps, but do not know how to sell," he says. Not having the best technology could also cost them dearly. In all, a good idea, good tech and a good team enable fundraising. High rate of failure Unlike Silicon Valley, support for risk-taking is low in India, according to Niruthambath. In such a case, we cannot expect a success rate of more than five percent. Most failures happen at the ideation stage — 95-97 per cent. In the prototype state the rate of failure is around 90 percent. "Post that the risk of failures also becomes less," he says. Raju adds that even in mature, sophisticated ecosystems such as Silicon Valley, the failure rate is very high. "Not for a lack of quality founders/ideas, lack of funding or ecosystem support. But risk is inherent in such ventures," he says. "Trust me, even in the bleakest of conditions, good startups with traction will get funding," he says. But there is a caveat - the failure rate will still be high. That is the nature of the beast. However... ..all is not lost. Silicon Valley, regarded as the mecca of startups, has already been through this phase of inflated valuation and consolidations that has added impetus to mergers, acquihire and complete shutdowns. Comparatively, the Indian startup industry is still in its nascent phase and is witnessing this phenomenon for the first time. There are ample opportunities for startups in the coming days. A spate of technology and e-commerce startups such as Zoho, Inmobi and Pepperfry are attracting some of the best talent across leading campuses in India and many Indian IT companies are also either partnering with or incubating startups. According to research by Gartner (2016), 64% of the world's 25 largest insurance companies have already invested directly or indirectly via their venture capital arms in insurance technology (insuretech) startups which also includes Indian companies. To survive, startups need to focus on outcomes rather than density, and move out of metro sectors, as Bharat Matrimony, Redbus, Stayzilla, Newshunt and Enterprise Tech have done. The focus should be on capital-efficient entrepreneurs, especially the ones utilising their own resources to scale up rather than depending on VC money. Sharad Sharma, co-founder iSpirt and an active technology angel investor says, "The funding should be done on an idea which is disruptive. We should not go down the path of the Japanese Zaitech bubble, where cheap capital is perceived to be more important than the effectiveness of the core business. Focus should be on sustainable value creation than valuation." Eventually, if startups are able to differentiate themselves in terms of "technology, operations, commercial, cultural and messaging, they get the opportunity. We will see more and more organisations deal with smaller and nimbler businesses as they bring the distinct advantage of flexibility, agility and innovation," says Mishra.

Problem with CPU is, you cant just lower settings and expect better performance. I try to to run dota at 96fps, but my 2500k just cant keep steady frames without overclock. You need modern intel(high performance) 4 core CPU for dota. Regarding GPU, 470 should be good for 1080p.

What concerns me is the amount of RAM your system has, 4GB is relatively low, even in my q6600 system I had 8GB of ram at 1060MHz, it's more likely your bottleneck is the RAM. However, with all this said, take this with a pinch of salt as sverek has pointed out, the engine Dota2 is running on has been updated to source 2 which could very well be much more cpu intensive however, I don't believe this to be a case for concern as achieving the same graphical fidelity and frame rate performance should be possible, if not better (I'd likely say, that previous dota2 max settings will likely now be medium settings in reborn).     Only Intruder View Public Profile Find all posts by Only Intruder   (#9) nz3777 Maha Guru     Videocard: Evga Gtx 780 Acx Sc Processor: Fx 8320 E @ 4ghz Mainboard: Gigabyte Z97 X Gaming7 Memory: 8gb 1600mhz/Ballistic Soundcard: SoundBlaster Recon 3d PSU: Corsair Hx 850 08-18-2016, 21:09 | posts: 1,283 | Location: Willowbrook ill.

The Linux Rain Linux General/Gaming News, Reviews and Tutorials Toggle navigation Home About Contact Submit Tip/Article Categories Reviews News Tutorials Editorials Announcements Previews Upcoming Advocacy Overviews Finding unmatched braces (brackets) By Bob Mesibov, published 13/08/2016 Recently I was checking for unmatched braces in a big text file with nearly half a million lines (300+ MB). Was there a closing brace for every opening brace? The text file was called 'beetle' and was actually a tab-separated table with each line divided into 77 fields. What I wanted to do was find any lines in which unmatched braces appeared within fields. Here's the command I used: awk -F"\t" '{for (i=1;i<=NF;i++) if (split($i,a,"(") != split($i,b,")")) {print NR": "$0; next}}' beetle > unmatched The command took 1 minute 13 seconds to execute, which isn't bad for an operation that checked 36,036,077 data fields (with an Intel i3 dual core processor and 4 GB of RAM). To explain how the command works, I'll use a small tab-separated table called 'demo' with 3 fields: AWK has a 'split' function which takes 3 or 4 arguments. The first argument is the string to be split and the third is the character or characters on which to do the splitting. The second argument is the name of an array into which the split-out bits will be stored, and the fourth (optional) argument is an array containing the separators. What 'split' returns is the number of split-out items in the array. In the command below, each line in 'demo' is split using '(' as a separator and the number of split-out items is printed for each line: Note that AWK found 4 split-out items in the first line, namely a, aaa)[tab]bbbb[tab], cccc plus an empty item separated from the rest by '('. In other words, the number of items put into an array by 'split' will always be just 1 more than the number of separators. Note also that AWK emptied the array 'a' before splitting the next line. Repeating the command with ')' as separator and loading an array 'b', we get: Now to see whether the number of opening and closing braces is the same in each line. In the following command, AWK is asked to check whether the same number of split-out items is found for each brace type, and if not, then the line number is printed followed by the whole line: That worked well, but note that line 2 only has matching braces as a whole line. Fields 2 and 3 in line 2 both have unmatched braces. To look within fields, the full command above uses a for loop to do the checking on each field in turn. If unmatched braces are found in any field, AWK prints out the line number and the whole line, then jumps to the next line following the 'next' instruction. The full command isn't perfect because it won't find a line in which a field has braces matched 'backwards', like this: aa)aaa(a. I checked that possibility with another AWK command using a rather complicated regex. Here the command is looking at 'demo_new' with an added line including 'backwards' braces: There were no such lines in 'beetle', but the command at the beginning of this article did find 35 lines in 'beetle' containing fields with unmatched braces. I checked the 35 lines individually to see what the problem was (typo? truncated string?), then fixed each one with sed. For example: I repeated this process for unmatched square brackets ([]), curly brackets ({}) and greater-than/less-than arrows (<>). A fiddly proofreading job, made easier on this monster file with AWK! About the Author Bob Mesibov is Tasmanian, retired and a keen Linux tinkerer.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     New MacBook Pro With Touch ID Sensor Expected To Release Soon Posted: Aug 13 2016, 1:04pm CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, Updated: Aug 13 2016, 1:07pm CDT, in Rumors | Apple   Macbook Concept By Martin Haek   We will be seeing a revamped MacBook Pro any time now if we are to believe the word of Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The new 13 inch and 15 inch retina display laptops by Apple will have a bunch of new features which include a Touch ID sensor and an OLED mini screen above the keyboard. How To: Find Hatchimals In Stock It seems like Gurman’s report is pretty much in line with all other reports we have received about the new MacBook Pro. He seems to agree with both Ming Chi Kuo from KGI securities and 9to5mac that the reveal of the new laptop is going to be a pretty big event. The new laptops are going to weigh less and are thinner in design than other MacBook’s released by Apples. The new MacBook Pro will not resemble the MacBook Air which is good news for all those MacBook users who want more than one port on their laptop. Users should expect better performance and improved battery consumption due to the Intel Skylake processors which will power the new MacBook Pros. The stand out feature about this new MacBook however remains the OLED mini screen that is expected to be situated above the keyboard keys. It will most likely serve as a replacement of the physical function keys. We still aren’t quite sure how Apple plans on using this screen. It could use it to control basic functions such as volume or media buttons, or it could take a step further and display shortcuts as well as information about the app that might be in use on the laptop. These new MacBook’s are going to more secure than any other Macs available for two reasons. Firstly the Touch ID sensor that has been incorporated into these new machines and secondly the secure enclave that these laptops will ship with. The updated features should settle the complaints made by MacBook pro users that the laptops are quite outdates and have received no upgrades since June 2012. But Apple has not made a habit of upgrading its laptops too often if you follow the trend set by the company. According to Gurman the new MacBook Pros will be released sometime in October and will not be part of the iPhone 7 launch in September.

That is the first of ten home games this season (ideally more with the playoffs!), and given past issues, the team is continuing to try and figure out ways to improve the inbound and outbound traffic. It’s had some solid moments, but it’s a bit inconsistent at times, so any additional help is welcome. This year, the team has arranged deals with Uber and the Valley Transportation Authority to help folks out. Here’s a quick look at each, along with some of my own thoughts given my experience with both. Uber The 49ers and Uber have partnered up to create an “exclusive Uber Zone” at the stadium. The press releases says it will “provid[e] guests with a seamless pickup and drop-off experience for all 49ers home games and third-party stadium events.” Here’s how they describe it: Guests using Uber pre-event for curbside drop-off will be let out in the newly designated Uber Zone, located in the northwest corner of the Tasman Drive and Great America Parkway intersection. Guests using Uber for post-event pick-up will exit out of Intel Gate A. Returning to the same designated Uber Zone, located in the northwest corner of the Tasman Drive and Great America Parkway intersection, guests will request a ride via the Uber app. Event staff will be onsite to assist guests meeting drivers and securing rides. Uber is offering $15 off a ride to Levi’s Stadium for first-time users who enter the promo code 49ERS. And while this is an improvement over nothing, you’re probably gonna need that promo code. Uber has something called “surge” pricing, which increases the cost of travel when there is high demand. The surge pricing multiplies the base fare and the per mile charge (or whatever specific distance is charged by Uber) by X amount. The busier Uber drivers are, the more the surge. I would think surge pricing will be high for a trip to or from Levi’s Stadium. I’m guessing this will be an option for people who live near Santa Clara in the South Bay. VTA The South Bay offers a light rail service called the VTA. It goes all around the Santa Clara Valley, and is what you connect to if you take Caltrain down from San Francisco. This year, the VTA will offer new season and single-game light rail passes. The passes will allow the purchaser round-trip service on VTA’s new express light rail trains from the Great Mall, Santa Teresa, Diridon, and Mountain View light rail stations. Pass holders will have priority departure and exclusive use of express trains for their return trip. The pass is $149 for the season, or $20 per game. You can purchase them online at VTA.org/49ersExpress, at the Levi’s Stadium box office, and at VTA retail locations. The VTA is really solid, although there are long lines after the game. The upside is that the lines actually move at a pretty decent speed, so it’s not too awful. But taking advantage of an express option would add some convenience, albeit for a little more money. For those of you that take BART to the Fremont station and bus over, this does not apply. You will use that particular service like you normally do.

Microsoft has decided to reverse its decision to cut support early for PCs running Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. This policy change primarily applies to commercial devices and is intended to accommodate organizations not yet ready to transition to Windows 10. In January, Microsoft issued an update to its support policy in an effort to accelerate Windows 10 upgrades among enterprise users. Its intent was to limit support to new processors and chipsets running Windows 10 on the computer systems. This move would have had the greatest effect on businesses that planned to buy new computers running Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 with the intention of eventually migrating those devices to Windows 10. [Read: Microsoft Leaks Secure Boot Key, Raises Security Concerns.] As part of its January announcement, Redmond explained that, in its view, the newest generations of silicon would require the latest Windows platform. This would allow Microsoft to focus on integrating Windows with silicon while staying compatible with earlier generations of both. The exceptions to its policy change included consumer and enterprise users running PCs and tablets with Intel Skylake chips. The company would continue to support Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 on these devices through July 17, 2017. Users would have to upgrade to Windows 10 during this support window, because after July 17, 2017, only the most critical Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 security updates would be provided. This gave about 18 months for businesses with Skylake-equipped devices to upgrade to Windows 10. Now Microsoft has announced it will wait before terminating support for 6th-generation Skylake devices, acknowledging most organizations won't upgrade in such a short amount of time. "Enterprise customers are moving to Windows 10 faster than any version of Windows," Shad Larsen, director of Windows Business Planning, wrote in an Aug. 11 blog post. "At the same time, we recognize that, in some instances, customers have a few systems that require longer deployment timeframes." To support these customers, Microsoft is extending its support date to the end of support dates for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. The tech giant will provide all necessary security updates for Skylake devices within that time period. So how long do enterprise users have to upgrade their Skylake machines to Windows 10? It depends on which version of the OS is currently running. (Image: Michal Krakowiak/iStockphoto) Windows 7 is currently in extended support, which will end on January 14, 2020. Support for Windows 8.1 will end on January 10, 2023. Despite the newly extended support period, Microsoft urges business users to upgrade to Windows 10 as soon as possible. Earlier this year Microsoft announced future silicon platforms, like the upcoming 7th-generation Intel Core Kaby Lake processor and the AMD 7th-generation processors, will only be supported on Windows 10. All future silicon editions will require the newest version of Windows 10, the company emphasized. Microsoft recently released the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, which was purposefully updated with business-friendly features to give organizations motivation to upgrade. However, research indicates the update isn't pushing businesses to make the jump. A survey recently released by Adaptiva discovered 63% of businesses plan to wait at least six months to upgrade to Windows 10. Slightly more than three-quarters (76%) said the Anniversary Update is not increasing their urgency to upgrade. Kelly is an associate editor for InformationWeek.

Share story This week, let’s look at the state in the Pacific Northwest with one of the nation’s best economies, where its biggest city is seeing the country’s fastest housing-price appreciation — and no, this is not about Washington. Welcome to Oregon, 2016. With its dependence on durable-goods manufacturing and housing, Oregon suffered in the Great Recession. In May 2009, the unemployment rate nearly touched 12 percent, a high not seen since the nasty downturn of the early 1980s. Fast forward to this year. In May its unemployment rate was 4.5 percent, the lowest since modern record keeping began in the 1970s. June’s rate ticked up 0.3 points, a modest rise signaling discouraged workers re-entering the rising labor force.

By contrast, Washington’s June unemployment rate stood at a seasonally adjusted 5.8 percent. Nationally, unemployment was 4.9 percent in June. Other yardsticks are impressive, too. The state’s labor force is at a record high and jobs are keeping pace with population growth. Real gross domestic product rebounded early past its pre-recession peaks and has reached new records, too. It grew by 3.9 percent in the first quarter, tied with Washington and Arkansas for the fastest growth in the nation. According to the Census Bureau, real median household income shot up to $58,875 in 2014, the latest year for which data are available. That’s just shy of Washington’s number. It’s a convergence not seen since the end of the 1990s boom; historically Oregon trailed Washington. Nationally, median household income was $53,657. It’s also worth noting that while income for Oregonians hit a record in 2014, Washington was down nearly $9,800 from its peak in 1998. The epicenter of the Oregon boom is Portland, which has seen the hottest housing market in the nation for months. Last year, 11 percent of the metropolitan workforce was in advanced industries, the 15th strongest out of 100 metros nationally. This is no longer simply “the city where young people go to retire,” if it ever was. I don’t want to compare apples and cattle. Washington and Oregon share many characteristics but are not economic twins. Oregon is less populous, 4 million in 2015, vs. 7.1 million for Washington. Although Portland is nearly as large as the city of Seattle (632,309 vs. 684,451 in 2015), metro Seattle is much larger. The Seattle area also boasts two of the most valuable companies in the country, Amazon and Microsoft, as well as such major headquarters as Starbucks, Nordstrom, Weyerhaeuser and Expedia. It is home to one of the nation’s leading public universities, a major biomedical cluster and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. And don’t forget Boeing and the aerospace sector. Portland lost container shipping service while Seattle and Tacoma remain major seaports. Beyond Nike and Columbia Sportswear, PDX’s headquarters are less well known. Its big deal is semiconductor engineering and manufacturing, especially with Intel and its approximately 19,500 workers. But this undersells a shift in Silicon Forest to a constellation of younger homegrown tech companies, according to a 2014 report in The Oregonian. Like Seattle, Portland has also been a beneficiary of Silicon Valley companies opening outposts there. It’s more affordable than the Bay Area, but growth and rapidly rising house prices are causing local angst (sound familiar?). The housing-cost problem is made worse by the little new construction seen after the recession. So, what’s driving Oregon’s economy? Population growth is a big factor, especially of college-educated young people. Job increases are broad-based, but especially in health care, business and professional services, and leisure and hospitality. Still, the state has a history of volatility, especially in construction and manufacturing jobs, including those connected to chipmaking. In May, Intel warned employees they could see more layoffs if enough don’t take buyouts. Which state has the better wine? That’s beyond my tippling expertise: I enjoy both. Like all states, Oregon shows sharp differences among its regions, especially between metro and rural areas. For example, nonmetro areas in southern Oregon “still have a long way to go to regain all of their lost jobs,” according to Josh Lehner, an economist in the Oregon Office of Economic Analysis, who writes an illuminating blog on the state economy. Most of rural Oregon is growing again but still suffers from the decline of the timber industry that started in the 1980s. The population is older and less likely to be of prime working age. On the other hand, nearly all of the state’s counties have seen population growth. The resort-retirement area of Bend, savaged by the housing crash, is booming again. Without the cushion of the Puget Sound aerospace cluster, Oregon manufacturing remains weak. Among its head winds are loss of demand for material in the Oil Patch because of falling petroleum prices and a strong dollar. Job polarization — the loss of middle-wage jobs — is another common problem found in Oregon. For example, factory employment remains well below pre-recession levels. The workforce in accommodations and food services, which typically pays less, has been at record highs. Lehner told me the state’s fast growth should ease off as it reaches close to full employment. “The problem is the economy does not typically then transition down to something sustainable,” he said. “It slams down into recession and you start the cycle over. But we are approaching full employment and there aren’t too many worrisome things on the horizon at the moment.” You may reach Jon Talton atjtalton@seattletimes.com Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

But this 2-in-1 device was much more than that. When the first version was unveiled last October, it was warmly accepted. Many users loved the concept of the detachable screen, but on the other hand, the Surface Pen disappointed. Well here we are going to talk about the next version, Microsoft Surface Book 2, sadly not much has been leaked about this upcoming device. Let me sum up the expected specs, features and release date of the much-anticipated Microsoft Surface Book 2. Microsoft Surface Book 2: Expected specs, features, and release date Processor As per the rumors, we can expect Surface book 2 to be powered by Intel's Skylake processor. Operating system The Surface Book 2 is expected to run on the Redstone 2 update of Windows 10 OS. Microsoft further trims smartphone division jobs San Francisco, July 29, 2016 (AFP) -Microsoft is cutting more jobs from its smartphone hardware and global sales divisions by shedding an additional 2,850 positions, the company said Thursday. The news came in a corporate annual report filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Display According to Yibada, the Microsoft Surface Book 2 device will feature a 4K pixel resolution. This will enable users to stream 4K video content. Rechargeable stylus According to Yibada, the Redmond-based tech giant has filed a patent for a rechargeable stylus which will reportedly debut on Surface Pro 5. As per few leaked images, the unproven Surface Pen is expected to feature an on/off button, an indicator light, a built-in rechargeable battery and terminals for charging. The charging terminals are expected to be placed on the stylus' housing and will be in a form of a ring which wraps around the upper portion of the pen. Now you can buy the Microsoft HoloLens for Rs 2 lakhs Microsoft HoloLens is a complete wireless independent headset in itself. Users are not required to attach it to a smartphone or PC to enter VR mode. Battery The new device is expected to pack an improved battery life. Earlier Microsoft had promised 9 hours of playback last time; therefore, it may go up to 7 hours of battery life. Microsoft Surface Book 2 launch date According to news sources, the Surface Book 2 is expected to be launched either in June or October this year. Microsoft's Surface Book has been able to impress the users in many ways, and this is the reason why many are eagerly waiting for the all new Microsoft Surface Book 2. Due to the huge popularity of the Surface Book, Microsoft is quite obviously now burdened to work consistently in improving the specs and features of the next generation device.

For many in this classroom, this is the first time they have touched an iPad.

(Photo: Jessica Guynn, USA TODAY) 5368 CONNECTTWEET 192 LINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE OAKLAND — On a sunny morning, kids bounce in their chairs and rock their heads rhythmically to infectious beats their classmates are mixing on GarageBand software. "Give her a thumbs up for her beat," exhorts instructor Jeffrei Pettaway and an enthusiastic sea of hands juts into the air. For many in this classroom, this is the first time they have touched an iPad. This six-week, hands-on summer class exposes kids ages 7 to 12 to technology — and the 21st century skills that come with it. With a few swipes, the tablets on the tables in front of them — a gift from technology giant Apple — open up worlds miles away from this hardened stretch of East Oakland, Calif. The kids have ventured on virtual scavenger hunts in Africa and researched what life is like in India, each project making them more familiar and at ease with the software that is transporting them. "This is bringing a whole new world inside their backyard in a way that's safe for them to explore," Regina Jackson says as she watches the students absorb the morning lessons. Jackson is president of the East Oakland Youth Development Center. Equal parts sanctuary and springboard, it was founded nearly four decades ago by former Clorox CEO Robert Shetterly to lift the fortunes of a neighborhood overburdened by sky-high rates of poverty, crime and violence. Of the students in this class, about 90% qualify for free lunch and live within blocks of the center. They come here for rare access to opportunity in the form of free after-school tutoring, college preparation courses, music and arts lessons, health and wellness education programs and the hardwood that such NBA greats as Gary Payton and Jason Kidd once played on. The community center's goal: to give children the same shot at success they would have in wealthier parts of the city. Increasingly, that means the digital literacy they will need to successfully navigate the world. Apple's donation of iPads helped expose 180 kids at the East Oakland Youth Development Center to the technology that will shape their lives and careers.  (Photo: Jessica Guynn, USA TODAY) Low-income youth in East Oakland are among "the most technologically disconnected demographic groups in the United States," Jackson says. Four out of 10 students in Oakland public schools do not have access to a computer at home, and Jackson estimates 70% of the students at her community center do not have a computer at home with parents relying instead on smartphones. USA TODAY Intel pilots $5 million 'scholars' program in Oakland, Calif. schools Jackson installed computer labs to connect more kids to technology and offer year-round computer classes. And, this summer, she teamed with Apple, which is reaching across the digital divide into Oakland, starting with this donation of 40 iPads to expose 180 kids to the technology that will shape their lives and careers. The East Oakland Youth Development Center eventually wants to teach coding classes to help youth develop the skills they would need to work at a company such as Apple. "We know how transformative technology can be in education and throughout communities," said Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, who first visited the East Oakland Youth Development Center in June. "Every child deserves the right to a great education. These students are working on everything from learning to code to writing résumés, and we can’t wait to see what they will do in the world.” A student at the East Oakland Youth Development Center plays with software on the iPad.  (Photo: Jessica Guynn, USA TODAY) Silicon Valley, the high-tech corridor that stretches between San Francisco and San Jose, has come under broad criticism that its outreach efforts have overlooked Oakland, a diverse city across the Bay where African Americans and Latinos make up more than half of residents. No critic has been more vocal than Rev. Jesse Jackson, the civil rights leader who has led the campaign for Silicon Valley to hire more African Americans and Latinos, two groups sharply underrepresented in Silicon Valley tech companies. His advocacy led to Intel forming a five-year partnership with the Oakland Unified School District designed to touch the lives of 2,300 students and graduate 600 students in computer science and engineering programs at two high schools. Apple CEO Tim Cook  (Photo: Gabrielle Lurie, AFP/Getty Images) Jackson says he proposed to CEO Tim Cook that Apple invest in Oakland after an Apple shareholder meeting. Apple's workforce is 9% African American and 12% Hispanic, a single-percentage point increase from last year. It's pushing to make progress. Out of a U.S. workforce of 80,000, 27% of new hires in the last year were underrepresented minorities, according to the company. Apple is far from alone. Tech companies in Silicon Valley have made pledges to do better, but their numbers have barely budged. Apple is more diverse than some tech companies because of lower-paid workers in its retail stores, though it did post a 1% increase in African Americans in technical jobs. Rev. Jesse Jackson  (Photo: Mark J. Terrill, Associated Press) " 'Tim, all these companies say they can't find talent,' " Rev. Jackson recalls telling Cook. " 'Oakland is the most multiracial, multiethnic, multicultural city on the West Coast. It's within shouting distance of most of these tech companies. They say 'we can't find them,' Well, they aren't looking in the right places. Come to Oakland. You'll find one of the most creative, innovative, spirited talent bases right in the backyard of Silicon Valley.' " USA TODAY Oakland tech hub fights for diversity This summer, Apple staffers came to the East Oakland Youth Development Center to set up the equipment and offer training on the iPads and use of Apple software such as Keynote and GarageBand. Already, the program is sparking imaginations and ambitions. Tyrese Jackson, 9, dreams of one day making gaming apps like the pair of seventh-grade girls on the Nickelodeon sit-com Game Shakers. Building games is on Raul Sanchez's bucket list, too. The 9-year-old wants to add a third Super Marios brother to the classic video game. "For most of these kids, this is the first time ever being around an iPad," says Pettaway, their 17-year-old college-bound instructor. "What I am trying to do is start their digital footprints early."

Okay, I understand Learn more Latest Internet Society: Five Steps to Improve Trust Online Deliveroo Under Fire After Hungry Hackers Defraud Firm Two-thirds of London Councils Suffered Breach in Past Four Years ESET Announces Raft of Security Additions in Version 10 Release Malware Gambit Uses Facebook, Google Chrome and SVG Images   News Topics Features Webinars White Papers Events & Conferences Directory Search Infosecurity Magazine Home » News » Facebook Awards $100K for 2016 Internet Defense Prize 12 Aug 2016 News Facebook Awards $100K for 2016 Internet Defense Prize Tara Seals US/North America News Reporter, Infosecurity Magazine Email Tara The 2016 Internet Defense Prize and $100,000 from Facebook has been awarded to an international team that has proposed new parameters for providing post-quantum security for TLS. Building on a previously proposed instantiation presented by researchers at IEEE Security & Privacy 2015, the winning research identified a better suited error distribution and reconciliation mechanism, analyzed the scheme's hardness against attacks by quantum computers, and identified a possible defense against backdoors and all-for-the-price-of-one attacks. Using these measures—and for the same lattice dimension—they were able to increase the security parameter by more than 100%, reduce the communication overhead by more than half, and significantly increase computation speed in portable C implementation and current Intel CPUs, all while protecting against timing attacks. The work has already led to concrete use in Chrome and planned usage in TOR.  The prize, which is a partnership of Facebook and USENIX, goes to Erdem Alkim (Department of Mathemathics, Ege University, Turkey), Léo Ducas (Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), Thomas Pöppelmann (Infineon Technologies AG, Munich, Germany), and Peter Schwabe (Digital Security Group, Radboud University, The Netherlands). Their paper is entitled, “Post-Quantum Key Exchange — A New Hope.” The Internet Defense Prize recognizes and rewards research that meaningfully makes the internet more secure. Created in 2014, the award is funded by Facebook and offered in partnership with USENIX to celebrate contributions to the protection and defense of the Internet. “Security research is in a race against time to innovate faster than adversaries,” said Nektarios Leontiadis, a threat research scientist on the Facebook Security team, in a post announcing the winners. “The last year has seen multiple high-visibility vulnerability disclosures for every major platform. The industry has a history of over-rotating toward offensive work that has little direct impact on most people's lives. Much of the attention still goes to research that celebrates ‘owning’ rather than finding practical solutions for protecting people in the real world. At Facebook, we believe these incentives need to change.” Two additional projects were named as finalists: One is DROWN, a dangerous attack against TLS that uses a server supporting SSLv2 as an oracle to decrypt modern TLS connections. SSLv2, an ancestor of TLS, has been obsolete for 20 years, but about a third of all TLS servers still support it for backwards compatibility. DROWN demonstrates, through several attack scenarios, that SSLv2 is not only weak, but actively harmful to the TLS ecosystem. “The protocol flaws that DROWN exploits are an unanticipated side-effect of US government regulations from the 1990s, which limited the strength of cryptography that could be exported in order to ensure that intelligence agencies could circumvent it,” said Leontiadis. “Decades after these export restrictions were relaxed, they nonetheless contributed to widespread security problems. The authors argue that the attack provides an important historical perspective on how deliberately weakened cryptography can create risks for global Internet security, with implications for current law enforcement demands for backdoor access to encrypted devices and data.” The other is an exploit for a subtle, yet serious, side channel vulnerability (CVE-2016-5696) introduced in a recent TCP specification. The vulnerability allows a blind off-path attacker to infer if any two arbitrary hosts on the Internet are communicating using a TCP connection, and ultimately terminate that connection and perform data injection attacks. This can be used to disrupt or degrade the privacy guarantees of an anonymity network such as Tor, and perform web connection hijacking. The authors also proposed changes to both the TCP specification and implementation to eliminate the root cause of the problem.

The OS that’s causing a huge noise in the online world is an open source, and it is dubbed as Fuchsia. With its existence coming into light, there is now one big question that needs to be answered: Is Google replacing its Chrome OS and Androi?  It may seem too early to tell at this point, but Android Police did not rule out this possibility when it stated that Google could be hoping to replace the Chrome OS and even the hugely popular Android OS with Fuchsia someday. The tech site also indicated that there is also the possibility of Google using Fuchsia as a lightweight OS for devices like Google Home and the OnHub router, just like what Samsung does to its Tizen OS for its Gear smartwatches.  Google’s Fuchsia OS is making headlines because it is not Linux kernel-based unlike the multinational company’s other operating systems, such as the Chrome OS, Android and Chromecasts, among others. Thus, this means the Fuchsia OS could run on almost anything — from PCs, Chromebooks, phones and Internet of Things devices.  Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 110.95 -0.85 -0.76% Eli Lilly and Co LLY ▼ 67.98 -8.01 -10.54% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 778.83 -6.50 -0.83% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▼ 60.34 -0.78 -1.28% Fuchsia OS originally surfaced from the project’s GitHub page, where it is simply called “a new Operating System.” Part of the operating system’s documentation states that it has support for 32-bit and 64-bit ARM CPUs and 64-bit Intel-based PCs. Also, it uses Google’s Dart programming language, according to Engadget.  For now, the Fuchsia OS is just seen as another experiment from Google, and it is far from being officially released anytime soon. Google could be planning on using it for something bigger than what it has now. Nothing’s really been confirmed about Google’s new operating system’s use as of late. The only thing known about what Google has in store for it in the near future is, it could be running the Raspberry Pi 3, Trusted Reviews has learned.  For interested techies, you can check out the project on its official site, but you must know that only limited information about the operating system is found there at present.

Paul C Dwyer, an internationally recognised information security expert for 25 years, said there is a significant cyber-crime threat in Ireland. The president of the International Cyber Threat Task Force (ICTTF) said “vulnerable” prisoners in Ireland and throughout Europe are being targeted by sophisticated ISIS cyber-recruiters. Mr Dwyer said: “It’s not just Irish prisons. “They’re working across Europe to recruit what they feel are disenfranchised and disaffected people who are more vulnerable to them. “What’s interesting is we’re seeing a parallel to the techniques they’re using that paedophiles and criminals would use to attract vulnerable children. “So they will bring them in from if you like the surface web on open social media and then bring them into more enclosed, encrypted types of communication links.” Secrets of ISIS revealed (Photo: Sky) Read More More than 4,000 people will be denied entry to Ireland in 2016 Mr Dwyer said prisoners in Ireland could be attracted by ISIS for a number of reasons. He said: “In some ways it can be egos, in some ways it can be actually money. “These guys are involved in organised crime, it’s not all idealogically based. “So the blurred lines between cyber terrorism and cyber-crime are getting more and more blurred all the time and how these guys actually interact with each other, how they communicate and how they exchange funds.” Speaking about ISIS and criminals who prey on vulnerable people online the internationally-respected cyber expert said by sharing information about scams and techniques, the flood can be stopped. He added: “The guards are under-resourced and like most law-enforcement agencies around the world they’re behind the curve in relation to how threat factors like ISIS will operate.” Read More Gardai and Army increase their monitoring of terrorist sympathisers in Ireland as threat increases Mr Dwyer has worked closely with law-enforcement, military and enterprises in combating cyber-threats for 25 years and he said the ICTTF have noticed a lot of common themes. He said: “We saw that there was a commonality that all the bad guys were working together and essentially exchanging information, Intel and helping each other for their various gain and whatever they wanted to do. “So we decided to form a group that was the opposite of that so good people around the world could work together. “And very quickly it was founded in Ireland and we had over 100 countries involved and over 4,000 members exchanging [information] and helping each other to deal with these types of cyber threats. Mr Dwyer said he has experienced everything from protecting organisations and their own data assets to working with protecting children. He said: “I work closely with the ISPCC, wherever those threat factors are we will give it time, give it energy and give our experience to stop them actually developing and progressing across. Mr Dwyer told RTÉ’s Marian Finucane Show children and teenagers are also being targeted and manipulated by ISIS and other criminal groups. He said: “The inquisitive child that takes a toy apart and puts it back together can often be seen as a hacker and unfortunately in society we lock up these brilliant children”. “A lot of them we’re finding have aspergers or are on the edge of autism and they’re the ones that get locked up. “If you look at any of the statistics on this it’s these children with brilliant brains that are being manipulated by criminals to become part of the criminal enterprise. “And then effectively you’re put into criminal university i.e prison and then they are part of that system and they’re used by the bad guys.” Read More Today's top stories McGregor could join WWE Abduction attempt of child in Donegal Joe O'Reilly "will never admit" murder Maynooth student 'may know her attacker' Like us on

(Reuters/Gene Blevins) Share Written by Alex McKinnon Obsession Rio 2016 August 14, 2016 With every Olympics comes a renewed focus on how little money most Olympians actually make throughout their athletic lives. While a few newly made superstars (such as US gymnast Simone Biles) will strike it lucky by attracting the attention of sponsors, the vast majority of competitors at Rio will struggle to break even—let alone make a living off their talents. Nearly 150 athletes from the US team had to set up GoFundMe pages to cover their costs this year, and when it’s not Olympics season, many professional athletes in sports such as rowing, swimming, and javelin live on or below the poverty line. Maybe they should try running around in virtual worlds instead of real ones. If athletes played video games such as Call of Duty, League of Legends, Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, or StarCraft II instead of pushing the limits of their physical bodies, they’d be making bank. While names like Sebastian Engwall and Min-Liang Tan might be even less recognizable to the public than a country’s table tennis squad in a non-Olympics year, professional gaming (or “eSports”) offers far more opportunities to make a steady buck than the Olympics and many other major sporting tournaments. For example, The International 2016 is a five-day Defence of the Ancients 2 (often abbreviated to Dota) championship tournament currently underway in Seattle’s 17,000-seat KeyArena. With a roster of 90 players and coaches from 22 countries, it’s dwarfed by the Olympics in every respect save one: the prize money. Based on their performance and ranking, the 16 teams competing will share in a gargantuan prize pool of over $20 million, which is largely derived from the proceeds of in-game sales from Dota’s millions of casual online players. The eventual champions will pocket almost $9 million split between the team of five (or six, if they have a coach) players, and even the lowest-placing teams will still take home $101,395 in consolation prize money. Placed side by side, the disparity between how much Olympic champions and eSports tournament winners earn for their victories is stark. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) doesn’t actually pay anyone who competes in the Games, leaving the winners’ countries to set their own monetary benchmarks. It’s true that there are several countries that lavish extravagant cash prizes on their rare medal winners, including Singapore, Azerbaijan, and Indonesia, and the United States. But even the US—by far the most prolific medal collector of any nation—only offers $25,000 for winning gold, $15,000 for silver, and $10,000 for bronze. This means that Simone Manuel, who just took home the gold in the women’s 100-meter freestyle, will be awarded $25,000 by the US Olympic Committee. But at Blizzard Entertainment’s annual BlizzCon event last November, Swedish eSports player Sebastian “Ostkaka” Engwall took home $100,000 for winning the Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft World Championship. So did Korean gamer Kim “sOs” Yoo Jin after winning the Starcraft II World Championship Series. And the same goes for Olympics teams: The US women’s 4×200-meter freestyle relay team, which also won gold this week, will take home $100,000 between them, whereas the team of five who clinched first prize at the Epicenter Dota 2 tournament in Moscow back in May won $250,000. Like the road to Olympic glory, the path to championships like The International can also be long and expensive. Most competitors at top-tier eSports tournaments have to win regional qualifiers in the Americas, China, Europe, Southeast Asia, or the Pacific before advancing. This process can consume months at a time and involve significant costs with no prize money offered to the losers. But unlike athletes, some of whom may only get one Olympic shot every four years, eSports players have many more opportunities to compete. Tournaments of The International’s size come around far more often than the Olympics. Valve, the company that makes the Dota franchise, recently rolled out three more major annual Dota 2 championships in Manila, Frankfurt, and Shanghai, all with prize pools of $3 million. And that’s to say nothing of the myriad lower-tier tournaments hosted by organizations like DreamLeague, ESL One, America’s Major League Gaming, DreamHack, Blizzard, Activision, and others that routinely offer up prize pools in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. While gaming has long had the reputation as an individual pastime, the social aspect is becoming more and more prevalent. Many of the best pro gamers sign with pro gaming teams such as OpTic Gaming, FaZe Clan, Fnatic, and Enemy. These kinds of squads sign players to contracts in much the same way as pro football and baseball teams. For pros reluctant to sign with a team (or simply looking to bolster their income in tournament offseasons), there’s always another option: going it alone as “streamers” (short for “live-streamers”). High-profile eSports personalities such as summit1g and Mohamed “mOE” Assad have built huge standalone followings using nothing but social media and livestreams of them playing their games with running commentary. YouTube and streaming platform Twitch, whose staggering growth over the last few years has matched that of eSports, have provided pro gamers with an easy and effective means of gathering millions of followers. This enables them to build a brand, solicit donations, sponsorships and paid subscriptions, and sell their own merchandise and ad space. Like IRL athletes, the biggest and most entertaining gaming teams also attract lucrative sponsorship deals with the likes of Coca-Cola, Intel, Nissan, and Doritos. Teams also have their own clothing and accessory lines and can make celebrities out of their most successful and charismatic signees—or trade them away at will. In January, FaZe Clan signed a five-person lineup of Counter-Strike players from rival team G2 Esports for $700,000, potentially the largest such deal in the game’s history. But unlike Olympic athletes, who often have to foot their own bill as they bounce from qualifier to qualifier, most professional eSports players have their travel, accommodation, entry fees, and hardware costs covered by their teams or sponsors. While it’s still quite rare, some of the biggest organizations also pay their players a salary. Members of North American-based team Ember, for example, earn between $57,500 and $65,000 in base salary, with up to $27,000 in performance and signing bonuses on top. Riot Games, which owns League of Legends, pays players in its Championship Series a base salary that amounts to roughly $12,500 for three month’s worth of work. None of this is to say that the pro eSports circuit isn’t beset by the same problems facing other lucrative sports. Numerous events and teams have been fined and banned from major tournaments for refusing to honor contracts or pay players on time, while other teams have disbanded in protest at underpayment. Some events have been censured for failing to pay prize money, and America’s infamous vulture capitalist Martin Shkreli—the guy who’s made headlines for everything from price-gouging lifesaving HIV and cancer medications to being arrested on securities fraud charges —still owes around $75,000 to players and coaches ensnared in his short-lived and ill-fated foray into the pro League of Legends scene last year. There is also one huge caveat to all the moneymaking: gender. While women in pro sports frequently score less prize money than their male counterparts, in competitive eSports, they barely get a foot in the door in the first place—especially at the top level. Many eSports tournaments and championships are still segregated by gender, which is a policy the International e-Sports Federation claims is necessary to “improve female representation” in the professional scene and combat the boys-club mentality that pervades the heavily male-skewed industry. Some high-profile female pro gamers accept that rationale as a temporary means towards creating a more welcoming culture, which is currently filled with abuse, sexual harassment, and the general filth that is routinely hurled at female streamers and gamers. Outside of the co-ed sphere, however, all-female tournaments only attract only a fraction of the coverage and industry dollars of male championships. For example, the all-female Intel Challenge in Katowice, Poland offered a total prize pool of just $30,000 for its 2016 championship—a sum “never before seen” on the female circuit. How (or even if) the eSports industry deals with these issues over the next few years will be interesting to watch. But with the pro gaming scene set to continue its explosive growth, the players who make it so profitable are probably better placed financially than the athletes sweating it out in Rio right now. When the Olympics come to an end, thousands of world-class athletes will recede from the spotlight—and any real chance of making serious money for another lengthy period of time. The 16th-placed team at The International, meanwhile, can shrug, pocket their cool $20,000 each, and start prepping for the next major tournament in a few months’ time.

Design TL;DR Artist Rafael Varona crams magical stories into tiny GIFs By Andrew Webster on August 14, 2016 08:37 am 6 Tweet Share Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share Two years ago, artist Rafael Varona caught the world’s attention with a series of animated GIFs that depicted magical worlds trapped inside tiny glass bottles. The success of the “Impossible Bottles” series led to a number of new illustration gigs, and Varona eventually moved from Berlin to Amsterdam to focus on animation. But he never stopped thinking about those tiny glass bottles. “It was clear that I always had to do a second part,” he says. “In between jobs I finally sat down and took some weeks off to concentrate on what I want to put into my bottles this time. Out came an insane robot and a naked giant golden goddess.” "It saved my life." The second edition of "Impossible Bottles" features miniature worlds that are even more dense with detail than the originals. One bottle shows a mad scientist powering his home with a massive, lumbering robot underground. Another features a group of foreign explorers apparently enslaving the local population, while unbeknownst to them, a massive living statue rests just beneath the surface. Despite their small stature, each animated GIF manages to tell a story — and that’s exactly what Varona is aiming for. "It's a journey for me as well as for the viewer," he says of his process. "I almost never know what the illustration is going to look like when I start drawing, so steps up to the final work are visible. I'm trying to add as much scenery and life as possible, chaotic with a sense of order, a lot of contrasts and as much fun as possible. Color and composition are very important to me. Also, sometimes if you want to and take some time you can find a little story that I mixed in." Outside of personal work like "Impossible Bottles," he’s also done illustration and design work for clients ranging from Intel to The Washington Post to German eyewear firm Mykita. He’s been passionate about art since a young age, to the point that as a kid he would often fall asleep with a pen still in his hand. "When I found out about graphic design as a study, and that you can earn money with it, it saved my life," says Varona. He cites British painter David Hockney and French comic artist Blexbolex as some of his biggest influences. As for what’s next, Varona is currently taking the "Impossible Bottles" series in an unexpected direction: he’s working with Berlin-based Honig Studios to turn the robot GIF into a mobile game. "Now a bunch of professionals are showing me the endless possibilities of interactions and levels," he says. It’s just about a dream project for him, though he can think of at least one other he’d love to do in the future. "An animated music video for MF DOOM, though…" You can find more of his work on his site.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Fuchsia is Google’s new OS project – here’s what we know Adam Westlake - Aug 14, 2016 9 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit When it comes to creating its own platforms, Google like to keep busy. There’s Android, Chrome OS, Chromecast, and several more. But yet another open source operating system from the company has been discovered, this one dubbed “Fuchsia.” Now, this is far from a finalized product, mind you, it’s just a new project that’s appeared on GitHub with the description “Pink + Purple == Fuchsia (a new Operating System).” Right from the start, the most obvious difference between Fuchsia and Google’s other OSes is that it’s not based on the Linux kernel. Instead, it uses the new Magenta kernel, which is designed to power Internet of Things (IoT) platforms. As Android Police notes, this makes it a rival to other embedded OSes like FreeRTOS and ThreadX. However, Magenta is also designed to scale up all the way to things like smartphones and even desktop PCs. It includes features like user modes, a capability-based security model, and support for both ARM CPUs and 64-bit Intel-based PCs. And because it uses Google’s own Dart programming language along with Flutter, Fuchsia could easily support the Material Design user interface. There’s no guarantee at this point that Google is planning to take Fuchsia beyond anything but IoT devices, but there’s a possibility that down the road it could be used to replace Chrome OS and Android. In the mean time, it’s more likely we’ll see Fuchsia used on future IoT devices like Google Home and OnHub; hardware that doesn’t need to run Android. While we wait to see what Google does with this latest project, you can play around and check out the details on Fuchsia on its GitHub page and on Google Git, and it looks like it will soon support the Raspberry Pi 3.

The game was released yesterday and almost immediately, issues with crashing past the loading screen, frame-rate drops and more were reported. Yesterday, Hello Games founder Sean Murray offered tips on how players could make the game run better. Suggestions included updating the video card drivers, making sure the card was “above the min specs,” and checking to see if Visual C++ Redist 2010 was installed. The first PC patch was released alongside the game, and another is currently in the works. Murray said on Twitter today the team was “currently testing fixes for older AMD Phenom CPUs + more.” An update on the game’s Steam page, provides more information on what’s in the pot, noting that tickets have been filed “for everyone who mailed support,” and the team will respond them in turn. It seems many who filed a ticket “were trying to run the game significantly below” the minimum specs. The post also mentions that Intel cards aren’t supported. Bug reports brought to the team’s attention key issues which they are working to resolve. An “experimental branch with hot fixes” for the most common issues will be released. Issues currently being addressed in the hot fix include: shader cache issues, SSE 4 for CPUs which don’t support it, and jittery mouse controls when the player is on foot. Some players who have filed a support ticket will directed to the experimental branch while the solutions are tested. Hello Games further stated that if users were experiencing issues not addressed in the Steam post, to contact support.

provided by Research and Markets Aug 12, 2016, 15:10 ET Share this article DUBLIN, August 12, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of SNS Research's new report "The Private LTE Network Ecosystem: 2016 - 2030 - Opportunities, Challenges, Strategies, Industry Verticals & Forecasts" to their offering. Expected to surpass $800 Million in global investments by the end of 2016, private LTE networks are increasingly becoming the preferred approach to deliver mobile broadband services in the critical communications industry. Fueled by large-scale rollouts in the public safety, energy and other sectors, the market is further expected to grow at a CAGR of 32% between 2016 and 2020. The Private LTE Network Ecosystem: 2016 - 2030 - Opportunities, Challenges, Strategies, Industry Verticals & Forecasts report presents an in-depth assessment of the private LTE network ecosystem including technology, architectural components, operational models, key trends, market drivers, challenges, vertical market opportunities, applications, deployment case studies, spectrum allocation, standardization, regulatory landscape, future roadmap, value chain, ecosystem player profiles and strategies. The report also presents forecasts for private LTE network infrastructure investments from 2016 till 2030. The forecasts cover 3 submarkets, 5 vertical markets and 6 regions. The report provides answers to the following key questions: - How big is the private LTE network opportunity? - What trends, challenges and barriers are influencing its growth? - How is the ecosystem evolving by segment and region? - What will the market size be in 2020 and at what rate will it grow? - Which submarkets will see the highest percentage of growth? - How does standardization impact the adoption of LTE for critical communications? - When will MCPTT (Mission-Critical Push-to-Talk) and proximity services see large-scale proliferation? - What opportunities exist for commercial mobile operators in the private LTE network ecosystem? - Will LTE replace GSM-R and other legacy technologies for railway communications and applications? - Which spectrum band will be the most dominant choice for private LTE network deployments? - What are the prospects of rapidly deployable tactical LTE networks in the military and public safety sectors? - Who are the key market players and what are their strategies? - What strategies should system integrators and vendors adopt to remain competitive? The report has the following key findings: - Expected to surpass $800 Million in global investments by the end of 2016, private LTE networks are increasingly becoming the preferred approach to deliver mobile broadband services in the critical communications industry. Fueled by large-scale rollouts in the public safety, energy and other sectors, the market is further expected to grow at a CAGR of 32% between 2016 and 2020. - By the end of 2020, the North America region will account for over 35% of all private LTE investments worldwide. However, largely driven by South Korea's rollout plans for public safety, railway and maritime LTE networks, the Asia Pacific region will continue to retain a strong position in the market. - Several companies, such as TEN (Texas Energy Network) and INET (Infrastructure Networks) in the United States, have strategically deployed private LTE networks in remote, oil-rich areas, to exclusively provide mobile broadband services to energy companies. - To alleviate large-scale infrastructure investments, several European countries are pairing dedicated private mobile core platforms with commercial LTE networks to deliver prioritized mobile broadband services to public safety subscribers. - Conventional LMR industry players are leveraging partnerships with established LTE infrastructure OEMs such as Ericsson, Nokia, Huawei and Samsung, to offer end-to-end private LTE network solutions.

They need to have a filesystem that detects corruption, while regular RAID is good for the case where a disk gives read errors it doesn’t cover the case where a disk returns bad data and claims it to be good (which I’ve witnessed in BTRFS and ZFS systems). BTRFS is good for the case of a single disk or a RAID-1 array but I believe that the RAID-5 code for BTRFS is not sufficiently tested for business use. ZFS doesn’t perform very well due to the checksums on data and metadata requiring multiple writes for a single change which also causes more fragmentation. This isn’t a criticism of ZFS, it’s just an engineering trade-off for the data integrity features. ZFS supports read-caching on a SSD (the L2ARC) and write-back caching (ZIL). To get the best benefit of L2ARC and ZIL you need fast SSD storage. So now with my client investigating 10 gigabit Ethernet I have to investigate SSD. For some time SSDs have been in the same price range as hard drives, starting at prices well below $100. Now there are some SSDs on sale for as little as $50. One issue with SATA for server use is that SATA 3.0 (which was released in 2009 and is most commonly used nowadays) is limited to 600MB/s. That isn’t nearly adequate if you want to serve files over 10 gigabit Ethernet. SATA 3.2 was released in 2013 and supports 1969MB/s but I doubt that there’s much hardware supporting that. See the SATA Wikipedia page for more information. Another problem with SATA is getting the devices physically installed. My client has a new Dell server that has plenty of spare PCIe slots but no spare SATA connectors or SATA power connectors. I could have removed the DVD drive (as I did for some tests before deploying the server) but that’s ugly and only gives 1 device while you need 2 devices in a RAID-1 configuration for ZIL. M.2 M.2 is a new standard for expansion cards, it supports SATA and PCIe interfaces (and USB but that isn’t useful at this time). The wikipedia page for M.2 is interesting to read for background knowledge but isn’t helpful if you are about to buy hardware. The first M.2 card I bought had a SATA interface, then I was unable to find a local company that could sell a SATA M.2 host adapter. So I bought a M.2 to SATA adapter which made it work like a regular 2.5″ SATA device. That’s working well in one of my home PCs but isn’t what I wanted. Apparently systems that have a M.2 socket on the motherboard will usually take either SATA or NVMe devices. The most important thing I learned is to buy the SSD storage device and the host adapter from the same place then you are entitled to a refund if they don’t work together. The alternative to the SATA (AHCI) interface on an M.2 device is known as NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express), see the Wikipedia page for NVMe for details. NVMe not only gives a higher throughput but it gives more command queues and more commands per queue which should give significant performance benefits for a device with multiple banks of NVRAM. This is what you want for server use. Eventually I got a M.2 NVMe device and a PCIe card for it. A quick test showed sustained transfer speeds of around 1500MB/s which should permit saturating a 10 gigabit Ethernet link in some situations. One annoyance is that the M.2 devices have a different naming convention to regular hard drives. I have devices /dev/nvme0n1 and /dev/nvme1n1, apparently that is to support multiple storage devices on one NVMe interface. Partitions have device names like /dev/nvme0n1p1 and /dev/nvme0n1p2. Power Use I recently upgraded my Thinkpad T420 from a 320G hard drive to a 500G SSD which made it faster but also surprisingly quieter – you never realise how noisy hard drives are until they go away. My laptop seemed to feel cooler, but that might be my imagination. The i5-2520M CPU in my Thinkpad has a TDP of 35W but uses a lot less than that as I almost never have 4 cores in use. The z7k320 320G hard drive is listed as having 0.8W “low power idle” and 1.8W for read-write, maybe Linux wasn’t putting it in the “low power idle” mode. The Samsung 500G 850 EVO SSD is listed as taking 0.4W when idle and up to 3.5W when active (which would not be sustained for long on a laptop). If my CPU is taking an average of 10W then replacing the hard drive with a SSD might have reduced the power use of the non-screen part by 10%, but I doubt that I could notice such a small difference. I’ve read some articles about power use on the net which can be summarised as “SSDs can draw more power than laptop hard drives but if you do the same amount of work then the SSD will be idle most of the time and not use much power”. I wonder if the SSD being slightly thicker than the HDD it replaced has affected the airflow inside my Thinkpad. From reading some of the reviews it seems that there are M.2 storage devices drawing over 7W! That’s going to create some cooling issues on desktop PCs but should be OK in a server. For laptop use they will hopefully release M.2 devices designed for low power consumption. The Future M.2 is an ideal format for laptops due to being much smaller and lighter than 2.5″ SSDs. Spinning media doesn’t belong in a modern laptop and using a SATA SSD is an ugly hack when compared to M.2 support on the motherboard. Intel has released the X99 chipset with M.2 support (see the Wikipedia page for Intel X99) so it should be commonly available on desktops in the near future. For most desktop systems an M.2 device would provide all the storage that is needed (or 2*M.2 in a RAID-1 configuration for a workstation). That would give all the benefits of reduced noise and increased performance that regular SSDs provide, but with better performance and fewer cables inside the PC. For a corporate desktop PC I think the ideal design would have only M.2 internal storage and no support for 3.5″ disks or a DVD drive. That would allow a design that is much smaller than a current SFF PC. Related posts: Breaking SATA Connectors I’ve just broken my second SATA connector. This isn’t a...

But the PCIe M.2 SSDs do not (and also have the added benefit of just showing up under /dev like all other drives). There are some performance differences, NVMe are better but the PCIe ones are often easier to deal with.

As for booting Linux with older BIOS it’s not a problem as there are lots of other ways to boot. You could have a USB stick as /boot, server class motherboards typically have an internal USB socket on the motherboard for this purpose. You could have a boot loader on a CD-ROM that chain loads to the NVMe device. Making a NVMe device Windows C: is apparently a difficult task at this time. But there are people who report success.

A researcher showed methods for unlocking “high security” consumer electronic safes without leaving any evidence of the attack, Oracle’s payment system Micros (which is used at roughly 330,000 cash registers around the world) was hacked, and a Windows vulnerability served as a reminder of why putting backdoors in secure processes doesn’t make sense. WIRED reported on vulnerabilities in the keyless entry systems of roughly 100 million Volkswagens, open Internet advocates are petitioning to keep web access unfettered in Brazil, and hacking newswires to get embargoed press releases is actually a decent way to do insider trading. Oh, and a hardware vulnerability exposed 900 million Android devices. Casual. But there’s more: Each Saturday we round up the news stories that we didn’t break or cover in depth at WIRED, but which deserve your attention nonetheless. As always, click on the headlines to read the full story in each link posted. And stay safe out there. Scope of the DNC Hack Is Larger Than Officials Originally Thought On top of breaching the Democratic National Committee and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, investigators say that Russian hackers targeted and compromised personal email accounts and the accounts of other organizations related to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. The evidence is strong enough that officials have been notifying people associated with the Clinton campaign that their email data may have been compromised. Information about who was actually hacked is trickling out slowly. For example, Democrats feared that the Democratic Governors’ Association had been breached, but so far the group says it doesn’t see evidence that its networks were affected. Law enforcement officials say they’re confident Russia was behind the attacks, but it’s still unclear whether Moscow was doing routine surveillance or actively looking to impact the US presidential election. Meanwhile, White House Weighs Imposing Sanctions on Russia Over DNC Hack White House officials are considering using economic sanctions against Russia as retaliation for the DNC hack. That action would require the US to definitively accuse Russia of orchestrating the attacks. So far investigators and lawmakers say they are very confident about the attribution, but the White House hasn’t made any such allegations. The move has some recent precedents: In January of last year, President Obama issued economic sanctions against North Korea in response to the Sony Pictures hack. Then in April of the same year, he signed an executive order expanding the government’s ability to impose sanctions against international hackers. The U.S. government tends to tolerate a certain amount of foreign espionage, given that the US itself participates in digital surveillance and information-gathering. In this case, however, White House may decide that it needs to respond, since the DNC breach involved a trove of information that was released publicly. On the other hand, the US already has sanctions in place against some Russian groups because of the country’s invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea, and officials could decide it’s too problematic to strain the relationship further. Powerful ‘Project Sauron’ Malware Lurked Undetected for Five Years If that wasn’t enough state-sponsored hacking news for your week, researchers at Kaspersky Lab and Symantec reported that they’d discovered a previously unknown type of malware that’s so sophisticated it was most likely developed by state-sponsored hackers. Dubbed “Project Sauron” by Kaspersky Lab and “Remsec” by Symantec, the malware has been around since 2011 (if not earlier) and has now been identified on dozens of systems. And the program’s stealthy enough that it seems likely to have infected many more. Both groups of researchers say that the malware targets sensitive data on computers used by international government and military groups, financial organizations, and infrastructure companies like airlines and telecoms. Project Sauron has shown up in Russia, China, Sweden, Belgium, Iran, and Rwanda so far. It can even infect computers that aren’t and have never been connected to the Internet through USB drives. The malware hides on flash drives, undetectable by Windows and virus scanners, and then probably exploits a zero day vulnerability to infiltrate its targets. Project Sauron is aimed at collecting IP addresses, passwords, encryption keys and network details. It’s sophisticated enough that it was likely built by a group of specialists with millions of dollars in backing, which points to a nation state (or states) as the likely sponsor. Given Sauron’s targets, plenty of experts are pointing fingers at the NSA and American allies. Forum Data Breach Compromises 3,000 Login Credentials Including Those of Apple, Google, Samsung, Intel Employees Hackers accessed the login credentials of a popular developer forum, exposing 2,955 accounts, many of which are used by programmers from tech companies like Apple and Google. The data came from the Khronos Group, which runs a popular application programming interface for rendering graphics called OpenGL. The breach revealed usernames and passwords, but also email addresses and the IP address users were on when they signed up for their accounts. It could be a potentially problematic data trove in the hands of bad actors since so many of the accounts are for tech company employees who could have valuable access and privileges inside their companies’ networks.

First Click: How old is your computer? Friday, 5 August 2016 Yesterday my colleague Sam Byford beefed about Apple’s habit of selling outdated laptops and desktops, some of which haven’t had spec bumps in years despite the availability of faster components like CPUs and GPUs. That got me to wondering: how old is your primary laptop or desktop computer? There was a time that I would never consider using a laptop or desktop that was more than a few years old. I’m talking back in the days when Macs were used primarily as digital hubs in the home and workplace PCs needed new Intel or AMD processors just to keep pace with the latest versions of Windows and Office. » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: FOX 47 News Michigan - on August 4, 2016< > Embed Old computer system causes election problems 02:13 Getting election results takes so long because the equipment many local communities use is outdated, but clerks can't buy new computers any time soon.
