Single page Print Intel gives hard drives a boost with Optane Memory Taking another crack at storage caching by Jeff Kampman  11:00 AM on March 27, 2017 Intel's Optane SSD DC P4800X and its underlying 3D Xpoint memory technology seem poised to bridge a performance gap between NAND density and DRAM performance in certain types of datacenter workloads, but that $1520 device isn't meant for the average PC builder in the least. Intel still has ambitions for Optane in client PCs, but competing with NAND SSDs on both a speed and capacity basis would prove prohibitively expensive given Optane's roughly $4-per-gigabyte cost right now. Instead, Intel is taking a different tack for the moment: improving the performance of hard-drive-only systems for a reasonable cost. The company says that people considering desktop PCs want three things above all: performance, security, and storage capacity. Right now, hard drives tick the capacity box, but anybody who's used an SSD knows that spinning rust doesn't perform anything like flash. Hard drives still make up the vast majority of storage devices shipping in today's PCs, however, and Intel anticipates that'll continue to be the case for the foreseeable future. Enter Optane Memory. Intel's first client Optane product uses a hardware-and-software stack that purports to cache a user's most commonly accessed files on a fast slice of PCIe 3.0 x4-connected storage. Its reliance on newer tech aside, Optane Memory as a whole sounds similar in principle to what Apple does with its Fusion Drive-equipped iMacs. It also sounds similar in principle to Intel's own Turbo Memory technology, a small slice of NAND on a riser card that did basically nothing for system performance when it debuted in some notebooks back in 2005. Given Intel's history with elaborate solid-state caching layers, I was skeptical about the prospects of another take on the idea. Optane has some fundamental differences that promise a better showing this time around, however. For one, Optane doesn't need a large number of dies to achieve maximum performance like most NAND devices do, so one Optane die (as one will find on Intel's 16GB Optane Memory device) or two dies (as found on the 32GB gumstick) should offer enough parallelism to deliver a performance increase over devices with small amounts of NAND on board, like SSHDs. Even more importantly, Optane Memory devices enjoy the same class of high QD1 performance that the SSD DC P4800X does, so they can offer maximum performance at the low queue depths typical of desktop workloads. For its part, Intel thinks Optane Memory will boost system responsiveness above all—the major beef with hard-drive-only PCs. Using the Sysmark benchmarking suite, the company claims only minor increases in application performance, but the suite's responsiveness test comes away with twice the performance of a system with a hard drive alone. To bolster the point that QD1 performance matters most for desktop users and that Optane is ideally suited to boosting system responsiveness, Intel shared some internal data about the read and write queue depths for the synthetic PCMark Vantage benchmark and some demo workloads from its labs. Intel also performed trace analysis for the launch performance demands of several commonly-used applications one might find in the typical workplace. Finally, Intel collected application traces from a number of its employees' PCs to show the queue depth demands of more productivity-focused workloads. The point of these graphs is clear: most random desktop workloads level off at about QD4, and the majority of accesses happen at QD1 or QD2. Given those characteristics, Optane Memory seems ideally suited to speed up application launches and perhaps to lessen the wait for commonly-accessed files, at least so long as those accesses are primarily random. Presuming that's the case, Optane Memory seems much better poised to offer some kind of speedup to a user's commonly-used applications than a small NAND cache like Turbo Memory might have. Optane Memory isn't much good without its companion software, an unobtrusive utility that sits in the system tray. Intel says this application will render the Optane cache transparent to the user experience. The only storage device that should show up with an Optane Memory system is the user's primary system drive (along with any other non-Optane Memory storage devices that may be installed). There's a lot of black-boxiness to how the app's caching algorithm works, but Intel suggests Optane Memory won't be caching entire applications like games on the Optane device itself, simply because they'd often be too large to fit in 16GB or 32GB of space. Instead, I got the impression that the Optane Memory app will look for common files (like shared libraries and operating system files) that are often accessed by many programs and cache those instead.

After years of being relegated to the budget segment due to poor performance, is AMD finally offering Intel serious competition again? Basically, yes. The reviews (Ars Technica, PC Gamer, PC World, AnandTech,Tom's Hardware) are mostly positive, with a big caveat: The gaming performance is significantly lower than would otherwise be expected based on the CPU's performance in other areas. In the days and weeks following the launch, speculation raged as to the cause of the lackluster gaming performance. AMD themselves debunked a number of fan theories, before announcing a few weeks later optimizations for DOTA 2 and Ashes of the Singularity that boost frame rates in those particular games. Ryzen is based on AMD's all-new "Zen" microarchitecture, replacing their earlier "Bulldozer" microarchitecture, which was widely regarded as underperforming and even led to AMD being sued over the definition of a "core." For those interested in CPU architectures, David Kanter of Real World Technologies has written a very nice overview of the Zen microarchitecture and gave a wide-ranging interview to PC Perspective discussing Zen prior to the launch. This launch comes as PC sales saw their fifth consecutive year of decline after peaking back in 2011. Eyeing the server market, where Intel has >99% market share, AMD has announced their Zen-based "Naples" line of 32-core server processors, positioned to compete against Intel's Xeon line of server CPUs. AMD desperately needs Zen-based products to succeed in the marketplace after posting losses of $660 million in 2015 and $497 million in 2016. Those numbers are a big deal to a company of AMD's size, which "only" took in $4.3 billion in revenue in 2016, compared to Intel's $59.4 billion. posted by jcreigh (2 comments total) 2 users marked this as a favorite   As "exciting" as Ryzen is, it's coming at a time when CPU computing power seems to be fading to irrelevance. The biggest advance in CPU power came with the Sandy Bridge generation in 2011. Ever since then, every annual release has barely eked out an incremental 5% in compute speed. You could say that it's because Intel had no competition, or they had hit the limits of Moore's law, or that there was simply no need for faster compute speed for the majority of users, but the reality is that an i5-2500K from 6 years ago is a perfectly usable CPU for almost any kind of gaming you want to do nowadays. Ryzen has "caught up" to Intel, but even Intel users are looking at something like a 5 year upgrade cycle (instead of the 3 year upgrade cycle in the past). Contrast that to how fast GPUs are advancing - a single generation, say the GTX 980 to the GTX 1080 in the span of 18 months, has nearly doubled its graphics processing power from 4 to 8 teraflops. Arguably, most of the decline in PC sales would be on the lower end machines, which have never generated much revenue for manufacturers in the first place. Gamers building their own PCs don't get counted here, because they buy parts piece-meal! NVIDIA revenues jumped from 4.5 billion in 2014 to 7 billion in 2016. Intel revenues are flatter, but still an increase from 56 billion to 59 billion over the same period. Part of this I believe is linked to the much faster pace of improvement in GPUs which encourages users to get on a 3 year upgrade cycle (you can get 100% performance increase every generation, about 18 months, so buying upgrades is compelling) and a slower one on CPUs (which only gives you a 5% performance increase each generation which is 12-18 months, no one is running to the store to buy the latest CPU) posted by xdvesper at 11:41 PM on March 30 I just built a new computer based around the 1800X, and I've been happy with it - though to be fair, I haven't really pushed it hard yet. As for the whole "controversy" over gaming performance, the reality is that it will perform quite well on modern games - it just won't beat Intel's offerings aimed directly at gamers. But in exchage, you get a chip that can compete with Intel's $1000 workstation offerings at half the price. posted by NoxAeternum at 11:47 PM on March 30 « Older Mona You are not currently logged in.

More videos PM's embarrassing China backflip Malcolm Turnbull scraps plans to ratify the extradition treaty with China after opposition from all sides of politics on human rights grounds. She accused those dozen MPs - including Eric Abetz, Kevin Andrews, Andrew Hastie, Trent Zimmerman, James Paterson, Dean Smith and Tim Wilson - of effectively not trusting Australia's own legal and political system to block extradition to China when a person set to be sent there faced, for example, torture or the death penalty. Mr Abbott on Friday intervened in the debate over the treaty, which has been shelved, much to the embarrassment of the Turnbull government, providing News Corp details of a briefing note from his former Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, dated December 19, 2014. Related Content Julie Bishop condemns colleagues over China extradition treaty collapse Turnbull pulls plug on China treaty under pressure from Labor The note stated that Australia should not ratify the treaty because of problems with China's legal system, Mr Abbott claimed, and that China would be notified by Australia that ratification could not proceed. Ms Bishop and Justice Minister Michael Keenan had also agreed, in September and October 2014 respectively, that Australia would not move to ratify. In his most pointed comments since losing the prime ministership, Mr Abbott said he released the document to "set the record straight" after senior government sources claimed he had backflipped on previous support for the treaty.

"There was plenty of official advice that we should not do this."  SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The Turnbull and Abbott forces are at war, again; this time it's over China. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen Mr Abbott added: "The job of government is to solve people's problems, the job of government is to explain why the policies of the government are right and necessary. "It's not to go around trashing colleagues.  "Hopefully they will finally learn the lesson that briefing against colleagues - that cowardly anonymous briefing against colleagues - is very destructive to a team and very counterproductive to a government." Mr Abbott's decision to release details of a high-level briefing note has prompted an immediate, furious response from high-level sources in the Turnbull government, underscoring the still-lingering tensions over the leadership. "What Mr Abbott has omitted to mention is that there was subsequent advice in May 2015 from the Department of Foreign Affairs that recommend the government ratify the treaty. That advice was supported by [then ambassador to China] Frances Adamson," the source said. After a delay because of the leadership change [in September 2015] the Foreign Minister and Justice Minister wrote to the Prime Minister and provided this advice. The government then moved to ratify the treaty. The intervention from Mr Abbott and response from within government, means that - unusually - high-level bureaucratic advice that normally remains confidential has now been placed on the public record. The tit-for-tat leaking of information from supporters and opponents of ratification has, effectively, become a proxy war for internal supporters and opponents of Mr Turnbull and Mr Abbott. Senator Abetz, one of the government members who threatened to cross the floor, told Fairfax Media that Ms Bishop - and all other MPs - should show respect over such a sensitive issue. " In matter such as this, it's important to have mutual respect and I would advise those in government who don't share our views, to treat me and other colleagues with respect," he said, pointing to the plight of Professor Chongyi Feng, who is currently being held in China. "Men and women of good faith can come to different conclusions on the same matter." " I have great confidence in our judicial system; it's the Chinese system that concerns me." Labor's deputy chair of Treaties Committee, Michael Danby, said the Foreign Minister was "bullying her colleagues to pass this extradition treaty" and that that "shows she doesn't understand widespread Australian concern, including those in her own party, about the 99.6 per cent conviction rate in China or about its human rights record".

The Gravy Equations → Sundance Untangles the Roots Posted on March 28, 2017 by Bill QuickMarch 28, 2017   First, this for background: The Case Against FBI Director Comey Grows – Intel Committee Chair Devin Nunes Explains Need for White House SCIF Visit… | The Last Refuge All intelligence information is viewed within a SCIF, a Sensitive Compartmented  Information Facility.  The originating entity for the intel information is the proprietary host for their intelligence within their database.  The databases are not connected.  The SCIF in congress does not contain the same information as the SCIF in the executive (or any other intelligence community). The congressional oversight committee asks each Intel Agency to transmit their originating intel to the congressional SCIF.  The NSA has been cooperative in complying with the Intel Committee’s requests to share the NSA database of their information.  The FBI has NOT been cooperative in sending their proprietary originating intelligence information to Congress or the Intel Committee. Obviously the information Nunes needed to see (Eisenhower building SCIF) related to the executive office (Obama administration) and their coordination with the FBI (Dept. of Justice).  Hence, only the executive office SCIF database would hold the information because the FBI was/is refusing to send it to the House Intel Committee. Then the meat of the matter: Occam’s Razor – If You Listen To Every Nunes Public Statement in Sequence… | The Last Refuge The “tipster” source is unknown. However, the actual intelligence report(s) he reviewed, which contained the unmasked surveillance information, was simply President Obama’s daily intelligence Briefing(s). It appears, most likely, someone (aka mysterious tipster), simply told Nunes which dates to review.  Hence the Executive Branch SCIF was utilized.  The ACTUAL intelligence product itself was the Executive Office Presidential Daily Intelligence Briefing. Most likely a Clapper (ODNI), Rogers (NSA), Comey (FBI Counter Intel), and Brennan (CIA) work product.  Remember, President Obama preferred written intel briefings which he reviewed from his secure iPad. Reconciling the intelligence report that Nunes reviewed was actually the Presidential Daily Briefing (intel work product) also explains all the variant political concern angles. Which means that the Trump White House probably already knows where the unmasking was done.

John Rosevear (TMFMarlowe) Mar 30, 2017 at 7:07PM Tech analysts will tell you that chip giant Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is a mixed bag. On the one hand, it's a big player in personal computers, which isn't exactly a growth market. And it has been seen as lagging rivals in the emerging artificial-intelligence space.  But it took a huge step into autonomous vehicles when it announced a $15.3 billion deal to acquire Mobileye N.V. (NYSE:MBLY) earlier this month. I think that makes it worth a closer look. Here's why. Mobileye's co-founder, Amnon Shashua, announcing a partnership with Intel and BMW last year. Image source: Mobileye N.V. Why Intel paid a fortune for Mobileye Intel is paying $15.3 billion for Mobileye, seemingly a huge price for a company that generated just over $358 million-with-an-m in revenue last year. Why?  The key is that Mobileye is the closest thing to a pure play in self-driving vehicles, at least among public companies. Mobileye makes chips and software that process images and that are designed from the ground up to be used in cars. They're already critical components of today's advanced driver-assist systems, and they'll be critical to tomorrow's self-driving vehicles as well. Put another way, Mobileye has proven technology that will have an important role in the autonomous vehicles of the near future. It also has something else, which might be just as valuable: Credibility with automakers. Mobileye's current client list includes nearly all of the world's automakers.  That's important because the auto industry can be a tough market for a technology company to crack. But Intel won't have to crack it, because Mobileye has already done so. And rather than folding Mobileye into Intel, the chip giant plans to go the other way, keeping Mobileye's sales force and management team intact while expanding its range of offerings to include Intel's products.  Mobileye opens up a huge new market for Intel So how big is the opportunity for Intel here? As Intel sees it, it's huge. CEO Brian Krzanich thinks of self-driving cars as "data centers on wheels," with good reason. The computer processing power that will be required in cars with the most basic Level 4 self-driving systems is roughly a hundred times the computing power in today's most advanced cars, Krzanich said in a recent presentation.  How Intel's CEO sees the growth opportunity from self-driving cars. Image source: Intel Corporation. That's a big opportunity for Intel to sell additional hardware to Mobileye's established client list. How big? Krzanich thinks the total addressable market for vehicle systems will be over $20 billion a year by 2020, and could be $70 billion a year by 2030.  On top of that, Krzanich sees a second, related opportunity in the actual data centers that will be needed to provide the "cloud" for all of these interconnected self-driving cars. That won't be a big new market soon, but it could be up around $40 billion a year by 2030. Whatever its other flaws, Intel is now in a prime position to grab a big piece of that. What Mobileye does for Intel as an investment These new autonomous-vehicle markets could represent substantial top-line growth for Intel. Consider that the chip giant generated $59.4 billion in revenue in 2016. If the markets materialize as Krzanich anticipates, and Intel can take even a third of them...then the $15.3 billion that Intel is paying for Mobileye might look like a bargain in time.  As plenty of analysts have pointed out, Intel's fundamentals today aren't very exciting. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio is just over 12, with a forward dividend yield of 3.1% and a payout ratio of 49%. That's all decent but not exceptional.  What might be exceptional about Intel is that it's buying itself a gateway to significant future growth. That's worth a closer look.

Some have queried whether it was maybe a little too thus. For example the anecdote in Rolling Stone that Pence calls his wife "mother," and the story that before Pence proposed Karen carried around a gold cross in her handbag with the word 'yes,' engraved on it. Oh and that they have twin treadmills so that they can workout together.   Now a certain anecdote about the Pence marriage has resurfaced in a profile of Karen about how Mike Pence never eats alone with any woman other than his wife, and that he won't attend events with alcohol without his wife by his side.

"If there's alcohol being served and people are being loose, I want to have the best-looking brunette in the room standing next to me." Related Content Beside the vice president, a 'prayer warrior' stands The comments, which are embedded into a profile that looks at Karen's influence on her husband and the tightness of their union ("You can't get a dime between them," says Ken Blackwell, a senior fellow at the Family Research Council and a senior domestic policy adviser on the Trump transition team) have stoked comment on social media. Some, such as conservative blogger Matt Walsh, thought the idea to be perfectly sound. Advertisement Seriously what's the appropriate reason for a married person to go out for a meal alone with a member of the other sex (outside of family)?— Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) March 30, 2017 The response to Walsh was swift, with commenters offering up reasons for dining with a member of the other sex including because they were hungry, questioning whether soup was akin to adultery and others straight-up making fun of the situation.

That is - people still think it's a bit weird for men to dine with female co-workers, that many business deals are made on the golf course among blokes, that women are so often told that they're wearing the wrong thing or acting the wrong way (too little, too much) and so it's best they stay at home out of trouble, that women are either an ambitious temptress or a good wife and that men are impossibly easy to sway. This isn't about mocking Pence for his lifestyle, it's about women being denied access to professional opportunities powerful men control.— Faine Greenwood (@faineg) March 29, 2017 The revolting thing about Pence's no-meals-with-women rule isn't prudishness. It's that he's limiting key professional opportunities to men.— Ian Millhiser (@imillhiser) March 30, 2017 As Jill Filipovic noted on Cosmopolitan, "If Pence can't eat alone with a woman – which also implies he's not allowed to be alone with a woman – the end result is that he's going to work with, mentor, and promote men over women. In politics, after-work dinners and drinks are where meetings are routinely held, strategies are hashed out, career advice is doled out, information is shared, and relationships are built. If men like Pence won't engage with women one-on-one in informal settings, it's the women who miss out – because it's still men who run the show. It would be awfully hard for a woman in any high-powered industry to have a same-sex-only dining rule, because there are simply so few women at the top of their fields in politics, business, technology, and law. Ladies-only lunching (or dining of any kind) would mean the inability to meet individually and informally with the overwhelming majority of leaders in your field." So who are we to judge a man that's committed to his marriage, who does a "gut check" with his wife on all decisions and shares a mutual faith in something? Well, none of us. But it's right to question a blanket rule that perpetuates stereotypes about both sexes and in doing so, holds everyone back. It may be true that there's no such thing as a free lunch, but sometimes, well, lunch is just lunch.  Advertisement Most Popular Sylvia Jeffreys and Peter Stefanovic to tie the knot, but all eyes are on Karl Sustainable Style: What happens to the clothes you donate to opshops?

Newly arrived from Sydney, I found it startling. This was how far the Chinese consumer had catapulted into the digital future. When I last signed an apartment lease in Beijing, over a decade ago, cash was king.  House hunters were forced to act like gangsters, clutching bags stashed with ridiculously thick wads of money to pay the standard deposit of three month's rent up front to secure somewhere to live. The deal was signed with an ancient tradition – the red-ink seal. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The smartphone simply offered convenience, which had been badly lacking in a society long bound up in red tape and rules. Photo: AP But that burdensome cash society is fast disappearing. Queuing for groceries at the supermarket this week, I was the only person reaching into my wallet to pay. I clumsily shuffled fingers to pick the right notes, then waited for change as the till was opened, and a receipt printed. Advertisement Speedy Beijing shoppers simply flash their smartphone at the cashier. She scans the Quick Response (QR) code generated on screen by their A-P-P, and they're off.  Many bring their own shopping bag, to avoid the small fee charged for an environmentally unfriendly plastic bag. Beijing is like that now. Eco-conscious and convenient. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link When Beijing's pollution level soars on the smartphone A-P-P, children are kept indoors, air purifiers switched on, and filter masks donned. Photo: Bloomberg How did a communist capital, once notorious for its bureaucratic processes, become so convenient? Last time I lived here, shopping in department stores required patience and multiple queues: to select a product and have it wrapped, take a ticket to a separate cashier's office and receive a stamped payment receipt in triplicate, which was duly carried back to the sales assistant to secure the release of the purchased goods.  SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Beijing apartment prices outstrip those in Sydney, despite average wages being far lower. Photo: Bloomberg But the grand department stores of Wangfujing, old Beijing's first shopping street, sit comparatively empty now as the real business of buying stuff takes place online. Mini delivery carts zoom around the city streets bearing the logos of online shopping destinations. Shared bicycles sit waiting at busy street corners, ready for young commuters to unlock and pay with smartphones (another QR code) and pedal off to work. Taxis are almost impossible to hail, unless you have the A-P-P. The QR code is ubiquitous, from restaurants to market stalls. There are 900 million Wechat users in China, and 800 million are using its mobile payment service. Rival Alipay is even bigger, with its QR codes used in about half of the $US5.5 trillion in mobile payments made each year in China, according to analysts. Apple chief executive Tim Cook said last week the Chinese had become the world's biggest mobile payers because the population had a higher willingness to embrace change. I think it's more likely the smartphone simply offered convenience – something that had been so badly lacking in a society long bound up in red tape and rules. Digital innovation is creating freedom from bureaucracy in everyday life. But red tape continues to be heaped on life's biggest purchase – a home. Much like Sydney, housing affordability is the talk of the town. Ten years ago, my young Chinese colleagues were focused on buying apartments in Beijing, as construction boomed in the lead-up to the Olympics. Today a young worker would have little chance as a first home buyer, without help from the "bank of mum and dad". Luckily, in China, it is the bank of mum, dad and two sets of grandparents. The One Child Policy, which ended last year, has produced a generation of young Chinese who can call on the combined wealth of two families for a leg-up in life. Beijing apartment prices outstrip those in Sydney, despite average wages being far lower. In February, Beijing home prices surged another 22 per cent year on year. The government has slapped down rules to stop property speculation (ie, the kind of serial acquisition of apartments that is national sport among Australian Baby Boomers). Mortgages of more than 25 years are banned in Beijing from this week. Buying a second home requires a 60 per cent deposit. Divorcees must wait a year before they are no longer classified as second home buyers.  The central bank explained there had been a boom in families divorcing in order to beat the rules on second home purchases. Beijing residents without a "hukou" or family registration in the city must also have paid tax here for five years before qualifying to buy an apartment. Green tape, by contrast, appears to be welcomed by Beijingers. Residents here care deeply about solving air pollution.  On a blue-sky day in spring, cutting edge architecture gleams in the city, as office towers bend and curve across the skyline. Blossoming peach trees line city roads, and magnolias unfurl sturdy white and purple blooms.  On the weekend, the public parks are vibrant with family kite-flying as residents ignore signs forbidding them to walk on the grass. When the pollution level soars on the smartphone A-P-P, children are kept indoors, air purifiers are switched on, and filter masks donned. There are ways to live around it. Air-purified playrooms have sprung up at glitzy shopping malls, asking a hefty price ($50 to $100) to keep children driven stir-crazy at home amused for a few hours. Inflatable domes have been erected over sports fields in upscale apartment compounds. But it doesn't beat those vast Beijing parks, with their public gardens, lakes, and cheap amusements, at just $1 entry. Beijingers want more of those blue-sky days.

Newly arrived from Sydney, I found it startling. This was how far the Chinese consumer had catapulted into the digital future. When I last signed an apartment lease in Beijing, over a decade ago, cash was king.  House hunters were forced to act like gangsters, clutching bags stashed with ridiculously thick wads of money to pay the standard deposit of three month's rent up front to secure somewhere to live. The deal was signed with an ancient tradition – the red-ink seal. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The smartphone simply offered convenience, which had been badly lacking in a society long bound up in red tape and rules. Photo: AP But that burdensome cash society is fast disappearing. Queuing for groceries at the supermarket this week, I was the only person reaching into my wallet to pay. I clumsily shuffled fingers to pick the right notes, then waited for change as the till was opened, and a receipt printed. Advertisement Speedy Beijing shoppers simply flash their smartphone at the cashier. She scans the Quick Response (QR) code generated on screen by their A-P-P, and they're off.  Many bring their own shopping bag, to avoid the small fee charged for an environmentally unfriendly plastic bag. Beijing is like that now. Eco-conscious and convenient. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link When Beijing's pollution level soars on the smartphone A-P-P, children are kept indoors, air purifiers switched on, and filter masks donned. Photo: Bloomberg How did a communist capital, once notorious for its bureaucratic processes, become so convenient? Last time I lived here, shopping in department stores required patience and multiple queues: to select a product and have it wrapped, take a ticket to a separate cashier's office and receive a stamped payment receipt in triplicate, which was duly carried back to the sales assistant to secure the release of the purchased goods.  SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Beijing apartment prices outstrip those in Sydney, despite average wages being far lower. Photo: Bloomberg But the grand department stores of Wangfujing, old Beijing's first shopping street, sit comparatively empty now as the real business of buying stuff takes place online. Mini delivery carts zoom around the city streets bearing the logos of online shopping destinations. Shared bicycles sit waiting at busy street corners, ready for young commuters to unlock and pay with smartphones (another QR code) and pedal off to work. Taxis are almost impossible to hail, unless you have the A-P-P. The QR code is ubiquitous, from restaurants to market stalls. There are 900 million Wechat users in China, and 800 million are using its mobile payment service. Rival Alipay is even bigger, with its QR codes used in about half of the $US5.5 trillion in mobile payments made each year in China, according to analysts. Apple chief executive Tim Cook said last week the Chinese had become the world's biggest mobile payers because the population had a higher willingness to embrace change. I think it's more likely the smartphone simply offered convenience – something that had been so badly lacking in a society long bound up in red tape and rules. Digital innovation is creating freedom from bureaucracy in everyday life. But red tape continues to be heaped on life's biggest purchase – a home. Much like Sydney, housing affordability is the talk of the town. Ten years ago, my young Chinese colleagues were focused on buying apartments in Beijing, as construction boomed in the lead-up to the Olympics. Today a young worker would have little chance as a first home buyer, without help from the "bank of mum and dad". Luckily, in China, it is the bank of mum, dad and two sets of grandparents. The One Child Policy, which ended last year, has produced a generation of young Chinese who can call on the combined wealth of two families for a leg-up in life. Beijing apartment prices outstrip those in Sydney, despite average wages being far lower. In February, Beijing home prices surged another 22 per cent year on year. The government has slapped down rules to stop property speculation (ie, the kind of serial acquisition of apartments that is national sport among Australian Baby Boomers). Mortgages of more than 25 years are banned in Beijing from this week. Buying a second home requires a 60 per cent deposit. Divorcees must wait a year before they are no longer classified as second home buyers.  The central bank explained there had been a boom in families divorcing in order to beat the rules on second home purchases. Beijing residents without a "hukou" or family registration in the city must also have paid tax here for five years before qualifying to buy an apartment. Green tape, by contrast, appears to be welcomed by Beijingers. Residents here care deeply about solving air pollution.  On a blue-sky day in spring, cutting edge architecture gleams in the city, as office towers bend and curve across the skyline. Blossoming peach trees line city roads, and magnolias unfurl sturdy white and purple blooms.  On the weekend, the public parks are vibrant with family kite-flying as residents ignore signs forbidding them to walk on the grass. When the pollution level soars on the smartphone A-P-P, children are kept indoors, air purifiers are switched on, and filter masks donned. There are ways to live around it. Air-purified playrooms have sprung up at glitzy shopping malls, asking a hefty price ($50 to $100) to keep children driven stir-crazy at home amused for a few hours. Inflatable domes have been erected over sports fields in upscale apartment compounds. But it doesn't beat those vast Beijing parks, with their public gardens, lakes, and cheap amusements, at just $1 entry. Beijingers want more of those blue-sky days.

Devin Nunes (R-CA) when he went to the White House to view classified documents suggesting that Donald Trump and his aides were captured in incidental surveillance. In a breach of protocol, Nunes relayed that information to Trump himself before telling members of his committee, with which the intel has still not been shared. The NYT reports: Several current American officials identified the White House officials as Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the senior director for intelligence at the National Security Council, and Michael Ellis, a lawyer who works on national security issues at the White House Counsel’s Office and formerly worked on the staff of the House Intelligence Committee. A White House spokesperson declined to comment. Mr. Cohen-Watnick is a former Defense Intelligence Agency official who was originally brought to the White House by Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser. The officials said that this month, shortly after Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter about being wiretapped on the orders of President Barack Obama, Mr. Cohen-Watnick began reviewing highly classified reports detailing the intercepted communications of foreign officials. Officials said the reports consisted primarily of ambassadors and other foreign officials talking about how they were trying to develop contacts within Mr. Trump’s family and inner circle in advance of his inauguration. The White House on Thursday invited high-ranking members of the House and Senate intel committees to view materials though it’s unclear if they are the materials that Nunes viewed: “Our view was that the smart move was to make all the materials available to the chairman and the ranking member of the relevant committees,” Press Secretary Sean Spicer said during the White House briefing Thursday. “We are focused on the substance of it and I think the goal is to make sure people have the substance that are looking into this.” Spicer said the information being made available to lawmakers was uncovered by the National Security Council. In the letter, White House Counsel Don McGhan wrote the material related to whether “information collected on US persons was mishandled and leaked.” That closely maps with how Rep. Devin Nunes described the information he viewed at the White House last week, and subsequently briefed Trump on during a hastily arranged session. Officials declined to confirm whether the two sets of information are the same. But Democrats cast doubts on the timing, and questioned White House’s intentions in making the information available to a broader set of lawmakers.

The NBA superstar stars in a new commercial for Intel’s 360 Replay Technology in which he hits the game-winning shot and proceeds to cry. But Intel put a fresh spin on his iconic moment following the 2016 NBA Finals by changing his face into that of a baby. “It’s an entertaining way to bring home the idea that (through Intel 360 technology) you can see things at angles that you haven’t seen before,” Intel chief marketing officer Steve Fund told AdWeek. Intel’s “Baby Face” commercial is part of a new partnership between James and the technology giant. The spot will air a lot this weekend during CBS’ broadcast of the Final Four.

The NY-T’s reported that 2 White House officials helped Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) view the intelligence. Mr. Nunes is the Chairman of the House Intelligence panel, which is investigating Russian ties to theY  2016 election and possible Trump Campaign connections to Russia. Mr. Nunes said last week that he had seen troubling information about the improper distribution of Trump associates’ intercepted communications, and he briefed the president on the material, all before informing his Democratic counterpart on the House committee. President Trump’s spokesman Sean Spicer said Thursday the material the White House wants the House and Senate intelligence leaders to view was discovered by the National Security Council (NSC). Is is being reported that Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the senior director for intelligence at the NSC, and Michael Ellis, a White House lawyer who previously worked on the House Intelligence committee, played a role in helping Mr. Nunes view the materials. Mr. Cohen-Watnick is among 12 White House officials who would have access to the types of classified information Mr. Nunes says he viewed. He has become a controversial figure among Democrats and others in government intelligence circles, but President Trump decided to keep him on over the objections of the CIA.

Kaby Lake Pentiums and Celerons won't support Optane Memory by Jeff Kampman  3:05 PM on March 30, 2017 When Intel's Optane Memory technology launched this week, we overlooked a critical requirement for the platform. Despite seeming ideal for speeding up budget-friendly systems with hard drives as their sole storage devices, Optane Memory apparently won't have support from Intel's most budget-friendly Kaby Lake CPUs: the Celeron G3930, the Celeron G3950, the Pentium G4560, the Pentium G4600, and the Pentium G4620. Lower-power "T" variants of those chips won't work, either. Only Kaby Lake Core CPUs are Optane Memory-compatible, according to Intel's ARK database and the Optane Memory product page. We've gotta say: this is a baffling decision on Intel's part. Assuming ARK is correct, the cheapest CPU one can pair with an Optane Memory device is the Core i3-7100, a $120 part that's $28 more expensive than our budget-favorite Pentium G4620. The Core i3 adds 200 MHz of clock speed and AVX support to the bargain, to be fair. Even so, paying $65 or so in total to get that Core i3 CPU and the 16GB Optane Memory hardware itself seems like a hard sell for the frugal system builder who's already chosen a capacious hard drive. If we play the incremental cost game a bit more, one can get a reputable budget 480GB SSD like Toshiba OCZ's TR150 for $130—not that much more versus the $105-ish extra that one would pay for the 16GB Optane Memory module, the Core i3-7100 CPU, and the WD Blue 1TB hard drive one would need to get our Budget Box's storage subsystem Optane Memory-ready. We'll have to reserve judgment until we've had time with Optane Memory products to be sure, but it seems like those 3D Xpoint-equipped gumsticks and their caching software will need to be quite competitive with SSD performance to be worth the platform cost. We've asked Intel to comment on this matter, and we'll update the post if we hear back. Tags: CPUs Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Fox News Tech Expand/Collapse Search Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Business Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World On Air Tech Home Computers Google Video Games Military Tech War Games Slideshows Wearable Tech Intel True VR shoots and scores with March Madness coverage By Robert Gray Published March 30, 2017 FoxNews.com Facebook0 Twitter0 livefyre Email Print (Courtesy: Turner Sports) Intel Sports Group’s virtual reality unit, recently rebranded as True VR, has literally stepped up its game for this year's March Madness. The platform doubled the amount of exclusive live games that it offered from last year when Intel provided the inaugural VR coverage for the NCAA men’s basketball tournament. True VR also boosted the viewing options for users and charged consumers to watch the NCAA men’s basketball games for the first time. Fox News decided to give the updated technology a shot to find out if it’s worth the price of admission for what’s believed to be the first-ever virtual tickets to a sporting event. INTEL PATENTS A 3D CAMERA BABY MONITOR THAT COULD DETECH BREATHING PATTERNS The Game Plan Intel’s March Madness app is a free download from the Oculus Store and I demoed it using the compatible Samsung Gear VR headset and Galaxy S7 phone. The Real VR experiences cost $2.99 per game for the Gold package featuring more viewing options and dedicated VRCAST announcers. It’s $1.99 for the Silver plan with a single courtside view and a simulcast of the CBS and Turner Sports broadcasters on TV. You can read more about True VR’s technology here. Execution The app’s features start with picking your favorite team to decorate the “home” locker room and a player’s jersey to hang in a locker. In addition to live games, there’s a wealth of content here, including highlights and a box score from every game in this year’s tourney—just select a game from the onscreen bracket, a historical highlight reel from years’ past, and full game replays or highlights in virtual reality of the games in San Jose that were broadcast in True VR. The Golden Ticket is a sweet deal for an extra $1 per game since you'll get more options for produced or manual camera switches and custom commentary that’s helpful for newbies. There are still some issues endemic to watching sports in VR on any headset, especially if you're wearing headphones (you can hear the sound from the phone’s speakers without them) as you lose the camaraderie and social experience of watching with friends, family, and fellow fans in your living room or elsewhere. Of course soon you’ll be able to watch virtually with a friend anywhere in the world. INTEL SUPERCHARGES ENTHUSIAST LINE WITH NEW BROADWELL E-PROCESSORS Intel Sports Group Managing Director David Aufhauser told Fox News: “We definitely believe social interactions with others will be a key component of VR and we are actively working on solutions.” The Score Overtime: Today’s fans are spoiled with multiple channels carrying so many games and DVR’ing to binge watch them, but when slipping on the VR headset it centers your focus. Viewers should keep in mind you won’t be tweeting, you shouldn’t be moving around, and your full attention will be on the game. I found the Gear surprisingly comfortable for periods lasting up to 30 minutes without a break. While you can pause live games, there’s no fast-forward to “catch up” to real-time—yet. Intel says it’s coming. Double Bonus: The first thing some viewers will notice is the freedom of watching without glasses or contacts. Then there’s the clarity and how the app truly renders a 180-degree view as if you are sitting courtside. True VR’s unique vantage from the stanchion cam captures just how big the players are and delivers a great view of the banging underneath the basket. Boxed Out: The most glaring omission for me is the absence of onscreen graphics and data. Intel’s Aufhauser says, “We have built the capability and can demo it. You will find it coming soon in future executions.” The Intel exec adds they’re working on adding a game clock; it’s in frame for the halfcourt camera but can be obscured behind the backboard. TV Timeout: A bonus for some fans: commercials were noticeable by their absence. The announcers took a break leaving you with the arena’s ambient audio. Enjoy the silence: Aufhauser says, “In the future, we envision customers providing interactive or 2D and eventually 3D commercials to fill the breaks.” Blocked Shot: There were some sightline issues with the half-court camera, just as there would be if you were sitting in the arena’s front row, but the VRCAST switched quickly enough to capture just about every touch in these areas. Hot Hand: The phone’s battery got very hot by halftime (not unusual when running VR apps) so monitor that. Sub In: the battery level dropped from 98% to 35% by halftime so you keep the charger handy or plug in the device. Sweet Shots: The 180-degree viewing experience scored with hoop heads and casual fans alike. Overall it was a fun and transformative experience for me and a few fellow viewers. Cut Down the Nets: While today’s viewers want data on demand and we’re spoiled with DVR functionality, True VR’s broadcast manages to capture the drama of buzzer beaters, deep threes, and above the rim play in a first-person, in-your-face manner that literally brings a fresh perspective to one of the most exciting events on the sports calendar. It’s a game changer both with its production values and without a doubt by throwing open the virtual ticket window for VR experiences.

Cyclone Enawo in pictures: Madagascar laced by strongest storm in a decade [update] Get Out movie review: an impeccable horror with a social twist Industry News / Trends / Innovation / Xbox Ones and tiny tablets: this is South Africa’s ‘classroom of the future’ By Andy Walker: Editor on 27 March, 2017 AndyWalkerSA Share When I was at school, the most advanced technology we had were space cases, chair bags and desks that didn’t creak, but Microsoft and the Cape Town Science Centre’s (CTSC) vision of education is quite different indeed. The Observatory-based institution today launched its classroom of the future exhibit to the public, backed by the Redmond tech giants, the likes of Intel, and a number of other technology partners. As one might expect, the exhibit doesn’t include traditional text books or ink-based writing equipment, but rather things with screens, buttons and toggles. The exhibit, Microsoft explains, is a combination of what works in classrooms today and what might work in classrooms of the future. The future of South Africa’s education, or more short attention spans? On the more logical side of the showpiece, a tablet-adorned circular table surrounds an interactive whiteboard system that the teacher can pilot. The tablets are an Intel reference design for education, sporting 11.6-inch screens, Intel Celeron processors, rotating cameras, and a number of adorable and informative interactive programs. I especially enjoyed the Mars Curiosity Rover visualiser, which allows users to zoom in and learn about various parts of the extra-terrestrial probe. ‘The pace of change in society isn’t always recognised in education’ especially in South Africa On the experimental side, Xbox One gaming consoles allow kids to play games like Minecraft: Education Edition, Rock Band 4 or Kinect Sports. Sure, there’s no shooters on this list, but gaming in the classroom focusses on building creativity, improving coordination and well, becoming the next Slash? Another rig, modelled in the form of a Golden Arrow bus, seats up to six kids, and allows each to digitally paint or perform simple numeric or linguistic tasks with a stylus on a personal interactive touch screen. Education: keeping pace with modern technology It all looks very different from the classrooms of today. But that’s largely thanks to the speed at which technology is reforming the various sectors of South African life, notes Microsoft South Africa’s MD Zoaib Hossan. “It’s absolutely no secret that technology is changing the way we play, the way we live, the way we work, and certainly the way we learn.” The exhibit is a stark representation of that. Of course, we tried to chat to a few of the kids from Crystal House who were engaging with the products, but few things can draw children away from screens, buttons and gaming consoles. Jaye Richards Hill, programme manager at Microsoft Education for South Africa, explained that education needs to keep up with the “incredibly rapid” pace of technology’s development. “The pace of change in society isn’t always recognised in education,” she notes. She mentions that communications technology allows kids to indulge in the world of information more early and quickly than ever before. “Our young children have access to communication devices that make the global space their playground.” Citing the recent terrorism incident in Westminster, London, Richards Hill also explained that through the guidance of teachers and technology, these children can be educated to “not only be problem solvers, but problem finders”. The Classroom of the Future exhibit is available for public viewing and for interested teachers at the Cape Town Science Centre.

Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumour Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Contact Us The Bitbag Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumors Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Reviews Tech News Intel 10nm Chips Will Be Better And Cheaper Than Samsung, Qualcomm By Necta Casiple on March 30, 2017 02:45 PM PHOTOGRAPH: Flickr/Pascal Volk | Rivaling chipmakers Samsung and Qualcomm both had a headstart over Intel in the 10nm chipset game. The Korean phone maker has recently launched its latest 10nm Exynos 8895 chipset along with the Samsung Galaxy S8 while Qualcomm is already set to power most 2017 flagship devices with its own Snapdragon 835 SoC in several regions. However, just because Intel’s product has not been released yet doesn’t mean it won’t do a better job than the two. In fact, the company is already bragging that the next Intel 10nm chips will be “a full generation ahead” than its rivals.  All these will be possible, thanks to the “hyper scaling” technology, which Ubergizmo notes allowed Intel to incorporate twice as many transistors in the same space as other 10nm chipsets. According to the company’s press release, its upcoming Cannon Lake chips will deliver up to 25 percent performance and 45 percent power efficiency improvement compared to the existing Kaby Lake processors when they hit the shelves by the end of this year. What’s more is that the “enhanced version of the 10nm process” called 10++ will boost performance further by an additional 15 percent, and decrease power consumption by another 30 percent. Intel Intel 10nm Chips: The chipmaker’s Kaby Lake lineup. Moore’s Law The chipmaker further points out that even though the chip trace sizes will stay the same, the Intel 10nm chips will have better feature density and twice as many transistors found in Samsung’s Exynos 8895 processor. VentureBeat notes that the company still runs its business on Moore’s Law, Intel chairman emeritus Gordon Moore’s forecast back in 1965 that the number of transistors on a chip will double every couple of years. “People have been saying that Moore’s Law is dead for years, and the industry has always proved them wrong,”  Dan Hutcheson, chip analyst and CEO at VLSI Research, said. By producing smaller die sizes, Intel can put more transistors in the same space, eventually making the chip faster. The company says it also makes it 30 percent cheaper as it requires less material. This means as the chips get smaller, it becomes faster and cheaper at the same time. In the 10nm chip’s case, Intel says it’ll cost 30 percent less than its rivals such as Global Foundries, TSMC, and Samsung. The claims seem promising. However, it’s worth noting that the Intel Cannon Lake chips won’t launch until the first half of 2018, giving both Samsung and Qualcomm enough time to enhance their already existing 10nm chipsets and technologies. In fact, TSMC and the Galaxy phone maker are already both working on 7nm technology, which may hit the shelves in 2018. This leaves Intel one step behind the game once more.

Dell has launched its “lightest, smallest and most power-efficient thin client” yet, with a 101.6 x 101.6 x 27.9mm Wyse 3040 system that weighs 0.24kg and runs on under 5 Watts. The device is powered by a quad-core, 1.44GHz Intel Atom x5-Z8350 “Cherry Trail” SoC, giving it 30 percent better performance than “previous generations,” says Dell, presumably referring to the single-core Wyse 3010 and the dual-core 3020 and 3030. The power-efficient (2W SDP) SoC also runs on the UP board and UP Core SBCs. Wyse 3040 (click image to enlarge) Starting at $329, the Wyse 3040 ships with the BSD-based ThinOS, which has long been offered by Wyse, a thin client company that Dell acquired in 2012. ThinOS is “ultra-secure with no published APIs and therefore no attack surface,” says Dell. Starting in June, customers will also be able to download a new ThinLinux distribution based on SUSE Linux 12 that has been “further hardened and optimized by Dell for thin client environments,” says the company. Virtualization Review quotes Jeff McNaught, VP of marketing and chief strategy officer for the Cloud Client Computing Unit at Dell, as saying: “[You will] be able to have a local browser and to embed specific Linux applications right into that thin client.” Wyse 3040 on the desktop (left) or attached to a cubicle wall The Wyse 3040 is aimed at “highly-regulated” sectors such as retail, finance, healthcare and education. Like other thin clients its designed to run virtual sessions from various workspace environments. In this case, it supports virtualization software brokers including Citrix XenDesktop, Microsoft RDS, and VMware Horizon. The system supports Citrix HDX and Microsoft’s RDP and PCoIP protocols, and starting in June, it will also be able to run the VMware Blast Extreme remote protocol. Customers can use Wyse Device Manager and Wyse Cloud Client Manager applications for remote configuration and policy management through a single console. Wyse 3040 detail view: 1) audio jack, 2) USB 2.0, 3) USB 3.1, 4) power, 5) DisplayPort, 6) USB 2.0, 7) GbE (click image to enlarge) The Wyse 3040 supports up to 2GB DDR3 RAM and 8GB flash. You get two DisplayPorts for dual displays of 2560 x 1600 pixels, as well as digital speakers and an audio combo jack. Other features include a GbE port, 3x USB 2.0 ports, and a USB 3.1 port. An 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac WiFi and Bluetooth module is optional. There’s a Kensington Security Slot, as well as optional displays, dual-monitor stands, and a keyboard and mouse.   Further information The Wyse 3040 is now globally available, starting at $329.

Tech Apple Science Cars Baselworld 2017 Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     2017 IMac: Rumors, Specs, Release Date, Price And Everything We Know Posted: Mar 30 2017, 8:51am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Apple     Apple is expected to release a new iMac in 2017. The last time Apple updated the iMac was in 2015. Apple is expected to release a new iMac in 2017 as early as the WWDC 2017 in June. There is no hard evidence that a new iMac is coming, but the anticipation grows.  Don't Miss: Today's Best Deals on Amazon.com Apple has been under fire for neglecting the desktop for a while now. Microsoft used Apple's moment of weakness in a perfect way. The Surface Studio makes the iMac look like ancient technology. Microsoft in a way is helping Apple iMac fans to get a new iMac sooner than later. The new 2017 iMac needs to be innovative in design and functionality to match Microsoft's stunning device. 2017 iMac Features We can take some pointers from the new MacBook Pro that Apple release end of 2016. Apple might introduce the Touch Bar in the 2017 iMac. Apple has patented the integration of the OLED touch screen on standalone keyboards. LG already said in 2015 that Apple is coming out with an iMac featuring an Retina 8K display. This of course did not happen. One thing that Apple is fond of is though resolution. An iMac Retina 8K is technically possible. The 8K resolution would also allow Apple to give the iMac a bigger screen option. How does a 34" iMac with 8K Display, Core i7 sound? The new iMac will adopt USB-C like the MacBook Pro. This change requires to get new adapters for your peripherals and has already caused a ruckus at the launch of the 2016 MacBook Pro.  The are some rumors floating around that Apple would adopt the new AMD CPU Ryzon, replacing Intel. This is not very likely, but possible as Apple uses AMD GPUs in the iMac. Intel started to ship the new 7th Generation (Kaby Lake) Intel Core i7 (i7-7700) Processors. The new iMac might adopt the new top of the line Intel Desktop CPUs. I would not mind to go back to the thick design of the iMac in order to get the most powerful CPUs and GPUs on the market. I don't see the thinness of the iMac when i sit in front of it. The problem is that Apple is obsessed with making things thin.  3D is exploding in a big way on Windows 10 this spring. Virtual Reality is driving 3D creation, but Apple has so far no solution for this new big trend. The next iMac ideally would have powerful graphics to drive a virtual reality headset. Right now creative companies have to get a Windows Gaming PC to use an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. Apple is rumored to work on an augmented reality solution. That is though likely only for the iPhone. 2017 iMac Release Date At this point it is just guessing. April is a possibility for Apple's first event in 2017. Another option is the WWDC 2017, kicking off on June 5. The WWDC kicks off with a keynote that usually brings new Apple hardware. The new iMac requires a media event. WWDC 2017 is the perfect stage for a new iMac reveal. Apple unveiled a bunch of new products including a new iPad and iPhone SE on March 21. The red iPhone Plus and the new iPad went on sale on March 24. 2017 iMac Price The Microsoft Surface Studio is $800 more expensive in the top configuration than any iMac currently available. The new iMac prices could match Microsoft's prices for the top configuration. The lower end iMac models will likely be priced the same or drop slightly. The 2015 iMac starts at $1,099. The most expensive iMac configurable on apple.com has a price of $3,999. iMac deals are available on amazon.com. Should I Wait to Buy a new iMac? We recommend to hold off with the purchase of a new iMac until at least WWDC 2017. If Apple is not releasing the 2017 iMac in June, the release will be in fall. Apple will not launch the new iMac during the summer. Registration for the WWDC 2017 tickets opens Monday, March 27 at 10:00 a.m. PDT. The opportunity to buy tickets to WWDC17 will be offered by random selection. To register, you must be a member of the Apple Developer Program or Apple Developer Enterprise Program. What is the iMac? In Apple's words: "The idea behind iMac has never wavered: to craft the ultimate desktop experience. The best display, paired with high-performance processors, graphics, and storage — all within an incredibly thin, seamless enclosure. And that commitment continues with the all-new 21.5‑inch iMac with Retina 4K display. Like the revolutionary 27‑inch 5K model, it delivers such spectacular image quality that everything else around you seems to disappear. Adding up to the most immersive iMac experience yet — and another big, beautiful step forward." The iMac is the perfect desktop machine, but it is time for new power, new design, and bigger and better screen. There are a lot of new products and updates coming from Apple in 2017. The Apple rumor mill is in full swing. Find out in this Apple rumors round-up what new products and features Apple rumored to release this year. Read the latest Apple News.

Single page Print Intel defends its process-technology leadership at 14nm and 10nm What's in a number? by Jeff Kampman  10:00 AM on March 30, 2017 At its Technology and Manufacturing Day event in San Francisco this week, Intel delivered a stern rebuke to the growing chorus of questioners asking whether it's lost its process-technology lead. The company brought several luminaries from its manufacturing division on stage to talk about how its 14-nm process technology compares to its competitors' 16-nm, 14-nm, and 10-nm offerings. It also offered some projections about how its upcoming 10-nm process will stack up. From the top, Intel came right out and said what many in the industry have understood for some time: that the names of recent process nodes have become unmoored from the actual characteristics of the underlying technologies they claim to represent. A brief refresher: Intel's cutting-edge Broadwell, Skylake, and Kaby Lake CPUs are all manufactured on its proprietary 14-nm FinFET process. AMD's Ryzen CPUs and Polaris GPUs are produced on GlobalFoundries' 14-nm FinFET technology, and Nvidia fabricates many of its Pascal GPUs on TSMC's 16-nm FinFET tech. If one were to take those numbers at face value, one might believe that Intel, TSMC, and GlobalFoundries are all on relatively even footing when it comes to process tech. The worry among investors and the analyst community, in turn, seems to be that Intel's competitors will beat it to the next process node advance. For just one example of this perceived threat, Qualcomm's upcoming Snapdragon 835 chip will be fabricated on Samsung's 10-nm process, and that chip (plus Samsung's Exynos 8895 SoC) will both be shipping soon in Samsung's Galaxy S8. MediaTek has previously announced plans to make its Helio X30 SoC on TSMC's 10-nm process, as well. That SoC could arrive sometime this year. Not so fast, Intel says. The company points out that pitch measurements are just one characteristic of a semiconductor product, and it feels that using these measurements alone to characterize process capabilities isn't painting a complete picture. Instead, the company argues that a more useful measure of process advancement is to consider the density of logic transistors that a given process can achieve, independent of its node. With modern process technologies, the company suggests that measuring logic density using megatransistors per square millimeter (henceforth MTr/mm²) offers a better picture of what a given process can do. Intel Senior Fellow Mark Bohr says the company is modeling this metric using a theoretical logic block comprising 60% NAND gates (not to be confused with an NAND flash cell) as a simple structure and 40% scan flip-flops to represent more complex structures. The company introduced this metric using its 14-nm FinFET process as an example. That process can achieve 37.5 MTr/mm², compared to 29 MTr/mm² in what is presumably TSMC's 16-nm process and 30.5 MTr/mm² in GlobalFoundries' 14-nm FinFET technology. Intel says that at worst, its 14-nm process is still 25% denser than what its competitors can achieve, something that traditional n-nm feature sizes alone don't capture. Intel extended this measure to account for its guesses at how its competitors' 10-nm-class products will stack up by this transistor-density measure, since the company openly admits that it hasn't had the opportunity to reverse-engineer any shipping 10-nm products yet. Still, the blue team estimates its competitors' 10-nm processes will offer only slightly higher logic density than its own 14-nm FinFET process—three years after chips fabricated on that tech began shipping. The point of all this horn-tooting is that Intel believes its 14-nm process has plenty of life left in it. As we first saw with its Kaby Lake CPUs, Intel isn't producing just two generations of chips on a given process node any longer. As part of the company's "process-architecture-optimize" product strategy, Kaby chips are fabricated on what Intel calls a "14nm+" process, and it intends to perform another round of optimizations to produce a "14nm++" version of that process. 14nm++ is claimed to offer 25% greater performance at a given power level than the unoptimized 14nm process first used to produce Broadwell and Skylake chips, or as much as 52% less power consumption for the same level of performance. In fact, Intel's projections show that the transistor performance of 14nm++ will actually exceed that of its first generation of 10-nm products. Expect to see 14nm++ underpin Intel's rumored Coffee Lake CPUs later this year.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 30, 2017 at 10:00AM Last year, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) began shipping products based on a technology that it refers to as 14-nanometer+. This is a performance-enhanced version of the company's initial 14-nanometer technology that first went into production in 2014. Intel claims a 12% improvement. That technology is currently being used to manufacture the company's seventh-generation Core processor family -- Intel's current personal-computer processor product line spanning notebook and desktop computers -- and is expected to be used to build the company's upcoming Skylake Xeon processors for data centers. Image source: Intel. Later this year, Intel plans to start building products using a further refined version of its 14-nanometer technology marketed as 14-nanometer++. Let's take a closer look at what Intel had to say about this technology and what it should mean for the company's future products built using this technology. Another large boost in performance Intel claims that 14-nanometer++ delivers either 26% better performance compared with its original 14-nanometer technology, implying a 12.5% improvement over 14-nanometer+, or up to 52% lower power. Image source: Intel. Moreover, Intel says its 14-nanometer++ technology delivers at least 20% better transistor performance than competing 14- and 16-nanometer technologies from rivals Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM). As we saw when Intel moved from 14-nanometer to 14-nanometer+, those performance enhancements on the manufacturing side can translate into nice performance gains at the product level. For example, Intel's Core i7-6640U for notebooks came rated with a base frequency of 2.4GHz and a maximum turbo frequency of 3.4GHz. The 14-nanometer+ version of this chip -- the Core i7-7660 -- runs at a base frequency of 2.5GHz and delivers a maximum turbo speed of 4GHz. Maximum turbo to maximum turbo, we see a nearly 18% jump in frequency because of the migration to 14-nanometer+ and the other enhancements Intel probably did to the underlying circuit design of the chip. Even in the high-performance desktop market, Intel's 14-nanometer+ technology delivered nice gains. The Core i7-6700K gaming chip came rated at a base speed of 4GHz, and it could run a single core at up to 4.2GHz. The successor to this chip, built on 14-nanometer+, ran at a base speed of 4.2GHz, single-core turbo of 4.5GHz, and all-core turbo of 4.4GHz. I would expect, then, Intel's 14-nanometer++ technology to help deliver a solid improvement in product performance when it rolls out later this year. More on that in a future column.  The density sacrifice At its Technology and Manufacturing Day, Intel spent a good deal of time talking up the advantages of its technologies relative to competing technologies. Intel claimed that its 14-nanometer++ technology will be at least 20% faster than competing 14- and 16-nanometer technologies, and it claims that its 14-nanometer technology is about 30% denser than competing 14- and 16-nanometer technologies. However, I don't believe that both statements are likely to be true simultaneously. For example, in moving from 14-nanometer+ to 14-nanometer++, Intel says it's relaxing the transistor gate pitch from 70 to 84 nanometers. This certainly helps Intel improve performance, but it will undoubtedly come at some cost to chip-level transistor density. This is a good trade-off, especially since consumers are more interested in higher performance than in the density of the manufacturing technology that's used to build the chips inside their computers, but Intel's marketing makes it seem as if 14-nanometer++ delivers the density and performance advantages simultaneously, which I'm not happy about.  Foolish bottom line Intel has committed to delivering newer, better products to the market on an annual cadence, and the company's work to deliver 14-nanometer++ and products built on that technology should allow it to fulfill that promise. What I'd like to see from Intel now is sustained execution with respect to these annual product improvements. If it can deliver on this promise in the years ahead, then it should be in solid shape across its business units. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 March 2017 by Military News GigPeak to Demonstrate Industry-First Encoding Solution at NAB 2017 SAN JOSE, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–GigPeak, Inc. (NYSE MKT:GIG), a leading innovator of semiconductor ICs and software solutions for high-speed connectivity and high-quality video compression over the network and the cloud, today announced that it will demonstrate a new architecture for the support of High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) encoding at NAB 2017. GigPeak has developed an HEVC compression algorithm specifically optimized to run on the Intel Xeon E3 processor which uses significantly less power and offers a lower cost per stream. Streaming video has been growing rapidly for several years, consuming network bandwidth and driving up distribution and storage costs for operators and over-the-top (OTT) video providers. Now, new developments such as the rise of 4K/Ultra HD (UHD) video with support for high dynamic range (HDR) technology, and the growth of mobile video, are creating new bandwidth pressures and challenges. As video service providers seek out new ways to conserve bandwidth and lower costs while still delivering the highest quality video, the H.265/HEVC codec – a standards based compression technology that can save as much as 50% bandwidth when compared to H.264/AVC compression technology – offers the most reliable solution compared to other non-standard, proprietary compression technologies. GigPeak’s new HEVC compression solution on the Intel Xeon E3 processor addresses many of the problems operators and vendors face when trying to support HEVC. With high algorithmic complexity, HEVC requires high processing power for encoding or transcoding, increasing both the cost of equipment capable of supporting this technology, as well as the cost of deployment and operation compared to previous compression technologies due to higher power and space requirements. The advanced Intel Xeon E3 technology, in combination with GigPeak’s own proprietary HEVC algorithm, address these issues through lower power consumption and lower cost. GigPeak’s algorithm takes advantage of GPU optimization to offer the highest video quality. “We chose to utilize the Intel Xeon E3 processor because it offers lower cost and lower power usage than the Intel Xeon E5 series processors commonly used by other video compression vendors,” said Fure-Ching Jeng, Vice President of Video Broadcast Engineering at GigPeak, Inc. “While it would have been possible to simply use existing Intel codec technology developed for the E3 platform, we developed our own HEVC algorithm to offer the best possible video quality, higher performance, and most importantly, the ability to support the 10-bit video coding generally required to support HDR. This full range of advantages gives our customers the ability to support the needs of operators as they continue to enhance and expand video services across all screens.” To see a demonstration of the GigPeak HEVC Intel Xeon E3 implementation, please schedule a meeting (sales@gigpeak.com) with GigPeak executives at NAB 2017, April 24-27 in Las Vegas, Nevada. GigPeak HEVC compression technology for the Intel Xeon E5 series will also be demonstrated. This technology is designed for deployment on standard COTS servers, as well as virtualized cloud environments. About GigPeak GigPeak, Inc. (NYSE MKT: GIG) is a leading innovator of semiconductor ICs and software solutions for high-speed connectivity and high-quality video compression over the network and the cloud. The focus of the company is to develop and deliver products that enable lower power consumption and faster data connectivity, more efficient use of network infrastructure, broader connectivity to the cloud, and reduce the total cost of ownership of existing network pipes from the core to the end user.

House Speaker Paul Ryan told CBS This Morning that the intel came from a “whistle-blower type person.” Said Ryan: “He had told me that a whistleblower-type person had given him some information that was new, that spoke to the last administration and part of this investigation…He briefs me about it, didn’t know the content of it, only knew the nature of it and that he was going to brief others. He was going to brief everybody….What Chairman Nunes said was he came into possession of new information he thought was valuable to this investigation and he was going to go and inform people about it.” But Ryan later in the interview says that he’s seen the documents. Writes Daily Kos: “At this point, Ryan is saying that he has seen the documents, but isn’t sure that Nunes has seen them. And that’s far from the limit of the craziness.” Multiple Democratic lawmakers have called for Nunes to step away from the investigation and recuse himself.

Miller March 29, 2017 10 Comments Intel's latest announcements could lead to big changes in the framework of new processors. In a series of presentations yesterday, Intel gave many more details on its forthcoming 10nm process for making advanced processors, disclosed a new 22nm FinFET process designed for lower power and lower cost devices, suggested a new metric for comparing chip nodes, and generally pushed the idea that "Moore's Law is alive and well." What stood out most to me was the idea that even though processors will continue to become more dense, the difficulty and cost of the new process nodes will force a complete re-think of how chips are to be designed in the future. Mark Bohr, Intel Senior Fellow and director of process architecture and integration, gave Intel's usual pitch about how it leads the semiconductor industry in process technology. He said Intel continues to have about a three-year lead over its competitors, even though chip foundries such as Samsung and TSMC are in the midst of rolling out what they call 10nm processes before Intel's 10nm products come out towards the end of the year. Bohr said Intel introduced most of the industry's main advances over the past 15 years, including strained silicon, high-k metal gate, and FinFET transistors (which Intel originally called Tri-Gate, though it has since returned to using the industry standard name). Bohr said that the node numbers used by all of the manufacturers are no longer meaningful, and instead called for a new measurement based on the transistor count divided by the cell area, with NAND cells counting for 60 percent of the measurement and Scan Flip-Flop Logic cells counting for 40 percent (to be clear, he's referring not to NAND flash memory cells, but rather to NAND or "negative-AND" logic gates). This gives you a measurement in transistors per square millimeter, and Bohr showed a graph reflecting Intel's improvements on such a scale, ranging from 3.3 million transistors/mm2 at 45nm to 37.5 million transistors/mm2 at 14nm, and moving to over 100 million transistors/mm2 at 10nm. In the past few years, Intel has been using gate pitch times logic cell height as a measurement, but Bohr said this no longer captures all of the advances Intel is making. He said that measure remained a good relative method of comparison, but didn't give a hard number. Bohr said that even though the time between nodes was extending—Intel is no longer able to introduce new nodes every two years—the company is able to achieve better than normal area scaling, which Intel calls "hyper scaling." He showed a chart demonstrating that at both 14nm and 10nm Intel was able to make the logic area 37 percent the size of the logic area at the previous node. Bohr noted that other parts of a processor—notably static random-access memory and input-output circuitry—aren't shrinking at the same rate as logic transistors. Putting it all together, he said the improvements in scaling will allow Intel to take a chip that would have required 100 mm2 at 45nm and make an equivalent chip in just 7.6 mm2 at 10nm, assuming no change in features. (Of course, in the real world, each subsequent generation of chip does add more features.) Stacy Smith, Intel's executive vice president for manufacturing, operations, and sales, said that as a result, even though it is taking longer between nodes, the additional scaling has resulted in the same year-on-year improvements that the former two-year cadence provided over time. Ruth Brain, an Intel Fellow and director of interconnect technology and integration, talked about the company's existing 14nm technology, which started manufacturing in 2014, and said that it was similar in density to the 10nm products others are starting to ship this year. She explained how this process introduced "hyper scaling," in part by using a more efficient multi-patterning technique to create finer features than the 80nm or so lines that the current 193nm immersion scanners can create in a single pass. Intel said that by using a technology called "self-aligned double patterning" (SADP), rather than the Litho-Etch-Litho-Etch method that other manufacturers use, it can get more accurate and consistent results leading to better yields and performance. Overall, Brain said the use of hyper scaling results in 1.4 times more units per dollar than traditional scaling would allow, and that results in roughly the equivalent of the savings Intel would have gotten had the industry moved from 300mm to 450mm silicon wafers (a switch that was widely discussed, but seems to have been abandoned for now). Kaizad Mistry, a corporate vice president and co-director of logic technology development, explained how hyper scaling techniques are being used at 10nm, and gave more details on the company's 10nm process, which he described as "a full generation ahead" of other 10nm technologies. Overall he said that the 10nm node will deliver either a 25 percent improvement in performance at the same power or an almost 50 percent reduction in power at the same performance compared to the 14nm node. Mistry described Intel's process as using a gate pitch of 54nm and a cell height of 272nm, as well as a fin pitch of 34nm and a minimum metal pitch of 36nm. Essentially, he said this means you have fins that are 25 percent taller and 25 percent more closely spaced than at 14nm. In part, he said, this has been accomplished by using "self-aligned quad patterning," taking a process Intel developed for 14nm multi-patterning and extending it even further, in turn enabling smaller features. (But I would note this seems to indicate that gate pitch isn't scaling as fast as in previous generations.) Two new hyper scaling advances have helped as well, he said. The first of these is "contact over active gate," which means that the location where a gate crosses a fin to create a transistor is now directly over the top instead of just below it. He said this gave another 10 percent area scaling above pitch scaling. The second technique, which Mistry said had been used before but not with FinFET transistors, is called "single dummy gate." In the 14nm generation, he said, Intel's transistors have had full "dummy gates" at the edge of each logic cell; at 10nm, however, Mistry said there is only half a dummy gate at each edge. This provides another 20 percent effective area scaling benefit, he said. Together, Mistry said, these techniques allow for a 2.7x improvement in transistor density, and enables the company to produce over 100 million transistors per square millimeter. Mistry also made it clear that, as with 14nm, the expanding length of time between process nodes has made it possible for the company to enhance each node a bit each year. Mistry described in general terms plans for two additional nodes of 10nm manufacture with improved performance. (I did find it interesting—and a little worrisome—that, although these charts show the 10nm nodes clearly requiring less power than the 14nm nodes, they suggest that the first 10nm nodes will not offer as much performance as the latest 14nm ones.) He said the 10nm++ process will deliver an additional 15 percent better performance at same power or 30 percent power reduction at same performance compared to the original 10nm process. Later, Murthy Renduchintala, president of the client and IoT businesses and systems architecture group, was more explicit, and said the core products are aiming for a better than 15 percent performance improvement every year on an "annual product cadence." Bohr returned to describe a new process called 22 FFL, meaning 22nm processing using low-leakage FinFETs. He said this process allows up to a 100x reduction in power leakage compared to conventional planar technology, and would have higher density than any other 22nm process, along with the possibility of higher performance FinFETs. What's interesting here is that a chip design can use two different kinds of transistors within a single chip; high-performance transistors for things like application processing and low-leakage transistors for always-on-always-connected circuits. This may be designed to compete with other 22nm processes, such as Global Foundries' 22nm FDX (silicon-on-insulator) process. The idea seems to be that by going with 22nm, you can avoid the double patterning and additional expense that tighter nodes require, but still achieve good performance. Renduchintala talked about how as an integrated device manufacturer (IDM)—a company that both designs processors and manufacturers them—Intel has the advantage of a "fusion between process technology and product development." The company is able to choose from multiple types of IP and process techniques, including picking transistors that suit each part of its design, he said. What I found most interesting was his discussion of how processor design was moving from a traditional monolithic core to a "mix and match" design. The idea of heterogeneous cores is nothing new, but the idea of being able to have different parts of a processor built on dies using different processes all connected together could be a big change. Enabling this is the embedded multi-interconnect bridge (EMIB) that Intel started shipping with its recent Stratix 10 FPGAs technologies and discussed using in future Xeon server products at its recent investor day. Renduchintala described a future world where a processor might have CPU and GPU cores produced on the latest and most dense processes, with things like IO components and communications that don't benefit as much from the increased density on an earlier process, and other things on even older nodes. All of these dies would be connected using this EMIB bridge, which allows faster connections than traditional multi-chip packages, but is lower-cost compared to using a silicon interposer. If all of these things come to pass, the entire framework of new processors could change. From getting a new processor made entirely on a new process every couple of years, we may be heading toward a world that involves a much more gradual change of process technology in only parts of the chip. This also opens up the possibility of adding many more things to the chip itself, from integrating more IO components, to different kinds of memory. In the long run, this could signal big changes in how chips—and the systems they power—work. Michael J. Miller is chief information officer at Ziff Brothers Investments, a private investment firm.

Various motherboard and system vendors have their own offerings in this space. ECS started selling their own UCFF PCs under the LIVA brand in 2014. The initial focus was on the low end, with units based on the Intel Bay Trail and Braswell platforms. The lineup evolved to accommodate Core M-based units as well as systems in the mini-STX form factor. Today, we are taking a look at the ECS LIVA Z. This fanless Apollo Lake system targets the low-end market segment, and aims to differentiate itself by supporting two LAN ports. Introduction and Product Impressions Traditional UCFF PCs (such as the BRIX from GIGABYTE and the Beebox from ASRock) have stayed close to the Intel NUC form factor. ECS had experimented with a smaller form factor (Mini-Lake) in the first-generation LIVA, as well as the LIVA X, and LIVA X2. The LIVA Z, however, adopts a board form-factor similar to that of the Intel NUCs. The feature set and pricing of the LIVA units make it target the developing and cost-sensitive markets. The LIVA Z is no different. Intel's Apollo Lake SoCs improve upon Bay Trail and Braswell by adopting a newer microarchitecture (Goldmont) for the CPU cores and also getting fabricated in a more power-efficient / mature 14nm process. In the consumer market, the Goldmont cores are exclusive to the Apollo Lake family. The SoCs target the netbook and nettop markets, and it is no surprise that ECS has adopted the netbook variants for the fanless LIVA Z models. The LIVA Z comes in three variants,corresponding to the three members of the Apollo Lake mobile SoC family (6W TDP) - the Pentium N4200, or the Celeron N3450, or the Celeron N3350. Our review sample, the LIVA-ZN33 is based on the Intel Celeron N3350. The unit ships with 32GB of eMMC on the board, but, it was insufficient to enable the installation of all our benchmark programs. Therefore, we evaluated the PC in two different configurations - the base one with Windows 10 installed on the eMMC and used for typical workloads such as media playback, and a configuration with a M.2 SATA SSD for office workloads. The full specifications of our review configurations are summarized in the table below. ECS LIVA-ZN33 Specifications Processor Intel Celeron N3350 Apollo Lake (Goldmont), 2C/2T, 1.1 GHz (Turbo to 2.4 GHz), 14nm, 2 MB L2, 6W TDP Memory Kingston CBD16D3LS1KBG/4G DDR3 4GB 11-11-11-28 @ 1600 MHz Graphics Intel HD Graphics 500 Disk Drive(s) SanDisk eMMC DF4032 (32 GB; eMMC v5.0-compatible) ADATA Premier SP600 SP600NS34 (128 GB; M.2 Type 2242 SATA III; MLC) Networking Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 3165 (1x1 802.11ac - 433 Mbps) 2x Realtek RTL8168/8111 Gigabit LAN Audio 3.5mm Audio Jack, 1x Digital Microphone Capable of 5.1/7.1 digital output with HD audio bitstreaming (HDMI) Display 1x HDMI 1.4a 1x mini-DisplayPort 1.2 Miscellaneous I/O Ports 3x USB 3.0 Type-A 1x USB 3.0 Type-C Operating System Retail units come barebones, or with OS depending on SKU. Our unit was the non-OS version, but we installed Windows 10 Pro x64 Pricing (As configured) $180 (eMMC / No OS) $220 (eMMC / Win 10 Home x64) $250 (with M.2 SATA SSD, as configured / No OS) Full Specifications ECS LIVA Z Specifications Buy ECS LIVA ZN33 on Newegg The ECS LIVA-ZN33 package comes with a 65W (19V @ 3.42A) AC adapter and a VESA mount / screws in addition to the main unit. Windows 10 is the only officially supported OS, and all the drivers were downloaded on our review unit from the ECS website. One of the interesting hardware components in the LIVA-ZN33 is the integrated digital microphone. This allows the end user to configure it as an always-listening machine (if needed), without the need to connect an external microphone. The other selling point is the availability of two GbE RJ-45 ports. Intel Ethernet controllers would have sweetened the deal, but, ECS has taken the cost factor into consideration and opted for Realtek controllers. Gallery: ECS LIVA Z - Chassis Design The industrial design is attractive and the unit feels solid. The chassis is made of plastic (not uncommon at the targeted price point). The internal heat sink which faces the bottom lid, however, is solid metal, and possesses good characteristics for effective heat transfer from the SoC. It would have been nice if the design allowed for the generated heat to dissipate via convection. In any case, we will take a look at the effectiveness of the thermal design in a later section. Platform Analysis The specifications of the Intel Celeron N3350 indicate that the SoC can support up to 6 PCIe 2.0 lanes, 2 SATA ports, and 8 USB ports. The break-up of the high-speed I/O lanes is interesting in the context of the availability of four USB 3.0 ports (3x Type-A + 1x Type-C) as well as two GbE LAN ports in the LIVA Z Intel Celeron N3350 HSIO Block Diagram [ Courtesy : Intel Pentium and Celeron Processor N- and J- Series Datasheet - Volume 1 of 3 (PDF) ] The distribution of PCIe lanes in the LIVA Z is as below. PCI-E 2.0 x1 port #3      In Use @ x1 (Realtek RTL8168/8111 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Adapter) PCI-E 2.0 x1 port #4      In Use @ x1 (Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 3165 AC HMC WiFi Adapter) PCI-E 2.0 x1 port #5      In Use @ x1 (Realtek RTL8168/8111 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Adapter) Since the used PCIe lanes are muxed with the USB 3.0 lanes, and, there are four USB 3.0 ports in the system, it stands to reason that at least one USB 3.0 port has its bandwidth shared with the PCIe lanes / networking interfaces. At the price point targeted by the LIVA Z, this is hardly an issue. In the table below, we have an overview of the various systems that we are comparing the ECS LIVA-ZN33 against. Note that they may not belong to the same market segment. The relevant configuration details of the machines are provided so that readers have an understanding of why some benchmark numbers are skewed for or against the ECS LIVA-ZN33 when we come to those sections.

The obvious question is how well would it run some sort of Linux server version and what driver problems one would encounter with Win7? Reply mjeffer - Thursday, March 30, 2017 - link I'm guessing there are probably Linux drivers for all the components in this machine and would be 100% fine with Linux. Just don't expect ECS to provide any help with it. Reply StevoLincolnite - Thursday, March 30, 2017 - link Would have been great to see some gaming benchmarks. Especially eSports titles like Overwatch, StarCraft, Counterstrike etc'. Reply nathanddrews - Thursday, March 30, 2017 - link Not worth it: https://youtu.be/fN8paf1RtHY Even if it had Iris Pro graphics, the anemic dual-core can't deliver a playable experience. As a Kodi/Retroarch box, it's probably perfect. If you can get Linux running on it, it would also make an excellent pfSense box - but the lack of a quad-core means foregoing some more advanced plugins. Reply BrokenCrayons - Thursday, March 30, 2017 - link OMG it's adorable cute and for $220, the price isn't bad at all. It badly needs the M.2 SSD to make it usable since ECS skimped on the eMMC drive, but it looks like a really nice little system you could mount on the back of a monitor to keep clutter down. The fact that it's fanless AND has good thermal performance are huge selling points for me. Reply JoeyJoJo123 - Thursday, March 30, 2017 - link Perfect box for pfSense. [X] Dual Lan [X] Built in WiFi (not necessary, but nice bonus) [X] Small [X] Cost Effective [X] Built in flash memory (32GB is enough for pfSense and minimal logging) [X] Support for m.2 SSDs. [X] Passive heat dissipation design Realtek LAN controllers are a bummer, but it's OK given that throughput/availability issues shouldn't be strained as most internet connections in the US are measured in tens of megabits, rather than saturating the full gigabit connection anyways. Also wished it was a bit better than a mobile Celeron, but that is plenty for most internet connections and without too many pfSense add-ons. At the end of the day it is 4core/4threads and can burst up to 2.2Ghz on some single-threaded loads, any more and it might not have been able to be passive at this small form factor. Really like this, and I'll keep my eye on it. Reply takeshi7 - Thursday, March 30, 2017 - link This would be a great homebrew router/NAS combo. I would still get a separate WiFi AP though. That 1x1 configuration on the built in WiFi wouldn't cut the mustard. Reply nathanddrews - Thursday, March 30, 2017 - link This is the 2C/2T model. Reply JoeyJoJo123 - Thursday, March 30, 2017 - link Yes, Einstein. I'm not talking about the dual core reviewed here, I was talking about the N3450 model which is also available. https://ark.intel.com/products/95596/Intel-Celeron... 4 cores / 4 threads. Reply Smudgeous - Thursday, March 30, 2017 - link I concur. This beats the Fitlet in terms of price by around 50% (especially when you factor in the extended fin heatsink/cover) and the power draw in the 3450 would still be better for comparable performance. This little guy looks like a real gem.

The Senate is on the cusp of a historic shift by preparing to nix the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees. But unlike previous close calls where institutionalist-minded senators stepped in, there’s nobody coming to the chamber’s rescue this time. “The Senate has changed,” said Sen. John McCain, who fought past efforts to change the rules. “You can’t do what we used to do, what I did in the past. There’s too much ill will.” “Acrimony between the two parties has become so routine that invoking the so-called nuclear option to get Neil Gorsuch confirmed to the Supreme Court is almost a ho-hum affair, assumed to be a done deal,” Burgess and Seung Min report after interviewing more than two-dozen senators. Attempts to form a gang of at least eight Democrats to join with Republicans to head off a Gorsuch filibuster have fizzled. Well, you guys fix it: Now several senators are looking to Senate leaders Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer to stave off major changes that would take away the minority’s power and bring the Senate more in line with the majority-ruled House. But there have been no meaningful conversations between the two leaders about avoiding a rules change. McConnell is dug in, dead set on getting Gorsuch confirmed. And Democrats’ anger about the GOP blockade of Merrick Garland still runs deep.

Some members like Rep. Trent Franks are openly wondering if the group overplayed its hand, while others are adamant that they’ll be on the right side of history. “The reality is that if we all went home next week with a bill with only a 17 percent approval rating, I think we would all regret that vote,” said Rep. Raul Labrador. Rachael with more: http://politi.co/2mSetCk Does House Speaker Paul Ryan regret pushing health care first? “Not at all,” he told Norah O’Donnell in an interview on CBS this morning. “It is inconceivable that we would have been able to write a tax reform bill into law before summer,” Ryan said. The speaker said he worries if Republicans don’t get their act together on a repeal bill, they will “push” President Donald Trump into working with Democrats on a far-less conservative plan. STEP IT UP — With the House probe into Russia’s election meddling in tatters, leaders of the Senate Intel Committee held a bipartisan press conference Wednesday to prove they’re more than up to the challenge. Sens. Richard Burr and Mark Warner “delivered a bravura bipartisan performance at their first joint press conference, complimenting each other and vowing to bridge their political differences to get to the bottom of what Burr called one of the most important investigations in his 22-year tenure in Congress.” The deets: The Senate panel has seven full-time staffers devoted to the Russia probe with security clearances that give them access to information previously only available to the “Gang of Eight,” made up of congressional leaders and heads of the two Intelligence panels. More from Austin and Martin Matishak: http://politi.co/2mS7h9y Today: The Senate Intel Committee holds its first public hearing on Russia with outside experts speaking on two panels. No government officials are testifying. ** A message from USP: How do you ensure drug quality in a global economy?

Speaker Ryan said on CBS this morning he was told by Nunes that a “whistleblower type” was the one who gave the California Republican recent intel about monitored communications from Trump transition officials. But Democrats have disputed that notion. I SEE YOU THURSDAY. And I’m already looking ahead to Friday. Welcome to March 30 and thanks for reading POLITICO’s Huddle, the play-by-play guide to all things Capitol Hill. And if you’re in the Capitol Hill press corps, remember today is the last day to renew your ID. WEDNESDAY’S MOST CLICKED: Seung Min and Burgess’ story about the latest GOP strategy to confirm SCOTUS nominee Neil Gorsuch was the winner. W.H. OUTREACH ALERT — GOP Sens. Rand Paul and Mike Lee met privately with White House chief strategist Steve Bannon on Tuesday, shortly before the East Room reception for senators and their spouses, two little birdies tell Huddle. One person described it as a get-to-know-you type of affair, rather than a meeting with any specific policy agenda. IT WASN’T ME — Rep. Duncan Hunter is pushing back on allegations of fraudulent campaign expenses, insisting he did nothing wrong but declining to say who is responsible for the tens of thousands of dollars in questionable expenditures. "I was not involved in any criminal action," Hunter told Bres in an interview Wednesday. "Maybe I wasn't attentive enough to my campaign. That's not a crime." The California Republican is currently under investigation by the Justice Department over the expenses. Hunter said neither he nor his wife, who works as his campaign manager, have been contacted by federal investigators. Bres and Kyle with more: http://politi.co/2nmTm7p DHS CHIEF TRIES TO MOLLIFY DEMS — Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly on Wednesday sought to appease Senate Democrats outraged by Trump’s hard-line immigration policies. Kelly told senators that border agents don’t plan to separate mothers and children at the border and reiterated that immigration officials are not targeting so-called Dreamers, undocumented immigrants brought here as children. Several senators left the two-hour meeting unconvinced. Ted Hesson and Seung Min with more: http://politi.co/2nmEMwV LOCAL BOY DONE GOOD — House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes is being put through the ringer in Washington over his recent controversial actions related to the panel’s Russia probe. But back home in Tulare, Calif, you’d have no idea. “If anything, his difficulties in Washington are only improving his stock among Republicans at home,” David Siders reports from the district. “Every time Devin comes on TV, we’re very proud of him,” said Mariann Hedstrom, chairwoman of the Tulare County Republican Party. More: http://politi.co/2nmPHXl BETO BETS ON SENATE — Texas Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke will challenge Sen. Ted Cruz next year, he’s expected to announce in El Paso Friday. O’Rourke was mum about the announcement in the Capitol Wednesday but he also didn’t shoot down the news, first reported by the Houston Chronicle. As for whether Cruz is beatable in a deep-red state like Texas? “Yes,” O’Rourke said. Cruz has been “running for president for four years while he should've been serving the people of Texas," he added. More: http://politi.co/2ozgNdZ From Cruz’s presidential campaign manager: "Someone please tell @JoaquinCastrotx that he's no longer a rising star so stop acting like one. Muscled out by Beto? Pathetic display,” Jeff Roe tweeted. THERE’S AN APP FOR THAT — House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer is rolling out a new version of his “Whip Watch” app today that includes major changes aimed at making it easier for users to track votes in real time. The updated app will allow users to see live vote totals, including party breakdowns, the time remaining in a vote and how long a vote stays open after it was supposed to close. ON SECOND THOUGHT… Democratic Rep. Stephen Lynch is declining to meet with White House aides, saying he sees no room for middle ground in Trump’s current policies. “They said they were looking for ‘moderate’ Democrats – which I am. But under the circumstances I felt like they were trying to divide our party so I declined the invitation,” Lynch said about the invitation. Lynch is one of a handful of centrist Democrats who have been approached about meeting with the White House’s legislative affairs team. The Boston Globe: http://bit.ly/2nmIOFw SPOTTED (via Playbook): Sens. Chuck Schumer, Claire McCaskill, Michael Bennet and Mark Warner at Le Diplomate last night with Schumer’s Capitol Police detail out in force ... Sens. Mike Lee and Ted Cruz with Cruz chief of staff David Polyansky and WPA’s Chris Wilson and Brian Phillips splitting desserts at Capital Grille. MAKING MOVES — Matt Paul, a longtime Democratic operative, is joining Cornerstone’s public affairs division. Paul previously worked as Tim Kaine’s chief of staff, a Hillary Clinton aide and Tom Vilsack’s communications director. Eric Haren is leaving his job as Democrats’ chief counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee to join the New York Attorney General’s office as special counsel and adviser.

The show streamed live to analysts, investors and media worldwide and Intel used it as a showcase for its new tech initiatives. As well as deeper tech presentations by the likes of Mark Bohr, Stacy Smith, Kaizad Mistry, and other Intel luminaries, it published the triumphant 'Leading at the Edge' video, below. Amongst the press materials from the day there's an interesting PDF fact-sheet which seeks to explain why Intel's 10nm technology is "estimated to be a full generation ahead of other 10nm technologies". This document can be supplemented by a PDF press deck from Kaizad Mistry, the CVP of Technology and Manufacturing Group and Co-Director of Logic Technology Development at Intel. Much of Intel's claimed 10nm process advantage is down to the use of library height scaling and 'hyper scaling'. Scale reduction technology allows Intel to continue the benefits of Moore’s Law economics "by delivering transistors that are smaller and have lower cost-per-transistor". It can do this even though the transition between process nodes appears to have slowed down. Thanks to the new scaling tech the minimum gate pitch of Intel's 10nm process shrinks from 70nm to 54nm and the minimum metal pitch shrinks from 52nm to 36nm. The logic transistor density of a new Intel 10nm chip can thus be 2.7x higher than Intel’s previous 14nm technology. In knock-on performance benefits it can provide a 25 per cent uplift at 45 per cent power reduction compared to 14nm. Furthermore, Intel says that its refined 10nm++ process "boosts the performance an additional 15 per cent while reducing power by another 30 per cent." Intel has managed to scale its 10nm process so well thanks to new library height scaling of fin pitch and metal pitch. Furthermore, behind the umbrella 'hyper scaling' term are two technologies, as follows: COAG (contact over active gate) - A process feature whereby the gate contact is stacked on top of the transistor gate rather than at its side. Intel has implemented COAG in its 10nm process – an industry first – thereby improving transistor density. SingleDG (single dummy gate) - A gate that isn’t part of a transistor, put on the edge of a logic cell, needed to isolate one cell from another. Traditional processes used two dummy gates per cell; Intel’s 10 nm process requires only a single dummy gate, thereby improving transistor density. Intel plans to build its 10nm chips for three years before it gets around to deploying 7nm technology. Intel EVP of manufacturing, operations and sales, Stacy Smith, wrote in a blog post "We are always looking three generations - seven to nine years - ahead," before concluding that "Moore's Law is not ending at any time we can see ahead of us."

All good (and exciting) things in good time. But in those cases at least we have had tech demonstrations, or existing products to base the future off. This is just hot air, if you look at the charts, they very cleverly put 2017, then skip 2018 and the next bar is 2019, so its reasonably safe to assume they will have working silicon sometime after 1018 which will take some time to translate into products on shelves. Im guessing consumers wont have anything 10nm in their hands, from intel until after Q2 2019. “by delivering transistors that are smaller and have lower cost-per-transistor” Not that the consumer will ever see any of the cost savings… Posted by Platinum - Thu 30 Mar 2017 13:41 Intel has demod chips http://hexus.net/tech/news/cpu/101143-intel-demos-10nm-cannon-lake-laptop-ces/ Posted by Biscuit - Thu 30 Mar 2017 13:46 Platinum Intel has demod chips http://hexus.net/tech/news/cpu/101143-intel-demos-10nm-cannon-lake-laptop-ces/ Ha!

Price, design, CPU and GPU 2. Screen, hard drive, battery, ports and verdict Our Verdict Long battery life, a good cost-to-power ratio, sleek looking design, high portability and the lack of bloatware makes the BlackBook Zero 14 an excellent choice of Ultrabook. For All-day battery life Includes two chargers Has minimum Photoshop specs Doesn't get too hot Against Core M CPU only up for light multimedia work Average media encoding speed Slightly different keyboard layout Some of the biggest breakthroughs in the ultraportable laptop category over the last year have taken the form of more compact cooling architecture – something that's allowed full-spec Intel Core i5 and i7 laptop CPUs to squeeze into sub 1.5cm (⅝ inch) laptop chassis'. As a result, many of our recommended slim-and-light laptops often feature powerful components that professional customers won’t mind paying a premium for.  With Intel's power-saving Core M CPU family now into it’s third generation, however, the chip giant has been making steady gains in overall performance when compared to the 'real' Core i5 and i7 mobile CPUs. In fact, it’s now at the point where the latest Kaby Lake Core M chips can meet the minimum specs for demanding applications like Photoshop, and for many professional users that'll be all they really require. Intel's so confident that it's even rebranded Core M processors to use the same Core i3, i5 and i7 naming scheme – the giveaway is that the contain a Y in the model identifier number, such as Core i5-7Y75. When you factor in that Core M also offers better power efficiency and removes the need for active fan-based cooling – and all the breakable and dust-gathering moving parts that come with it – then there's arguably never been a better time to make an Ultrabook with a Core M processor. Venom’s new BlackBook Zero 14 is hoping to appeal to the creatives or professionals who'd prefer to spend a little less on a system but still get a system that has enough power to do everything they want.  Price and availability The Venom BlackBook Zero 14 range is currently available through Venom’s online global store (or www.mln.com.au in Australia) with prices starting at $999 (£829.86 and AU$1,499) for the Intel Core i5, 128GB model. A unit with the same Core i5 processor and a larger 240GB SSD goes for $1,099 (£912.93 and AU$1,699), while the largest 500GB SSD variant comes in at $1,199 (£996  AU$1,899). The BlackBook Zero 14s with faster Intel Core i7 CPUs start with a 240GB SSD model for $1,249 (£1,037.54 and AU$1,949), with a larger capacity 500GB  Core i7 model landing at $1,349 (£1,120.61 and AU$2,149) and the largest capacity 1TB SSD Core i7 model costing $1,549 (£1,286.75 and AU$2,549).   Design With a body honed from a black sandblasted metal alloy composite, this 1.4kg (3 pound) clamshell is around 15% heavier than the lighter 2-in-1s and Ultrabooks that you’d generally pit it against. It might seem counter-intuitive for an ultraportable unit to intentionally pack on the pounds, but when you consider that its extra weight is mostly due to the sturdy metal chassis and its fractionally bigger 14.1-inch screen, it’s a trade-off we think many people will be willing to take.   Balancing the two halves of this black metal laptop is a sturdy hinge that has a soft resistance, allowing the screen to be tilted without having to hold onto the base. We hope that the hinge, like the rest of the laptop, has been built for longevity, as the one on our test unit did sit on the looser end of the spectrum already.   At a total folded thickness of 14mm (0.55in), the BlackBook Zero 14 slips nicely into carry cases, briefcases and backpacks and the accompanying diminutive charger and cable makes it an exceptionally portable package on the whole.   Keyboard and trackpad Continuing the matte-black theme is a black-coloured chiclet keyboard that has powdery soft-to-touch keys. The key travel distance feels generous for a device this thin and we were happy with the responsiveness and strong feedback for a membrane keyboard.   The only grievance we had was that the Home, 'Page Up', 'Page Down' and End keys sit at the far right edge of the unit, making the Backspace, Enter and Shift keys slightly out of a regular alignment. This has been done in a way that makes sense for any power users who are willing to tweak their keyboard techniques and use their pinky for fast scrolling, but it will likely create problems for new users. That's mainly because the Home button sits just outside the Backspace key, so it was common for us to nudge it rather than delete a mistake, meaning the tail end of a sentence was regularly spliced into the beginning of a paragraph.   The trackpads on Windows PCs have, on the whole, gotten significantly better in the past few years, and though we have no complaints with the temperament and performance of the BlackBook Zero 14’s powdery-finished trackpad, it’s still a little shy of a MacBook or even ASUS ZenBook experience. That said, it's notably better when it comes to responsiveness than many PC laptops and it was easy enough to become accustomed to in our testing.    (Image: © Joel Burgess) CPU   Venom’s Managing Director and Chief Designer Jaan Turon said that the decision for an Intel Core M CPU in the BlackBook Zero 14 was driven by the long term thermal benefits and prolonged physical integrity of computers that don’t require fans. “We were getting a lot of feedback from customers saying that the heat of laptops on their laps was a big problem,” he told us, “and fans, when they are this small, have a tendency to make a lot of noise and collect dust over time, which will eventually cause issues in performance. "Our engineers did a lot of work restructuring the internals of the BlackBook Zero 14 to accommodate a CPU that didn’t need fans, so we could pass on those longer term benefits to our customers.”   We haven’t had the BlackBook 14 for quite long enough to verify whether the unit is more robust than Ultrabooks requiring fans, but the internal thermals are quite moderate (considering the performance) and the chassis definitely has less intense hotspots than many thin-and-light laptops we’ve tested. This reduction in heat stems from the Intel Core i5-7Y75 CPU’s lower base operating frequency of 1.2GHz, which generally sits at around 80ºC (176ºF) in intensive work or home usage conditions in ambient temperatures of 20 to 25ºC (68-77ºF), although when pushed to the extreme it can reach up to 86ºC (186ºF) at times. Under a similar load, the SOC draws 14.66W which is about 17.5% less than a Skylake Core i5-6200U. When running PCMark 8’s general home usage and work benchmarks, the BlackBook Zero 14 hits 3,088 and 4,210 respectively — scores that are almost identical to the ASUS ZenBook Flip UX360UA’s more powerful Core i5-6200U chip. For an Ultrabook aimed at professionals, this is exactly the level of performance you generally want, and it’s encouraging that Venom’s managed to get this result using a more-efficient but less powerful chip.    The Core M chips don’t hold up so well in the multimedia-oriented tasks that are tested by Cinebench’s multi-threaded and single-core CPU rendering benchmarks, where the ASUS UX360UA’s older Core i5 came off better, with respective scores of 268 and and 112, against the BlackBook Zero 14’s  scores of 174 in multi-threaded and 71 in single-core CPU. That's a considerable difference and though this specific category of Ultrabook arguably isn’t aimed at users looking to do that kind of intense rendering work, this is likely to be the area where you will see the biggest difference in performance from Intel’s Core M chips. That said, in subjective testing we found that the BlackBook Zero 14 had more than enough grunt to complete the few simple image editing tasks we threw at it, without having to close web browsers or other background applications.   Graphics When it came to GPU heavy tasks, the ASUS ZenBook Flip UX360UA’s integrated GPU (an Intel HD Graphics 520) netted 38fps in Cinebench’s OpenGL graphics benchmark, notably more than the Zero 14’s Intel HD Graphics 615, which only managed 25fps. This result was further corroborated by 3DMark’s Cloud Gate benchmark, where the former managed a score of 4,690 while the Zero 14 only mustered 3,497. So, the BlackBook Zero 14 isn’t quite as well-rounded when it comes to performance, and you shouldn't expect it to do wonders when it comes to gaming – this is for light and casual titles only – but then, at least manages to keep up in the most important work-related areas. 1 2 Current page: Price, design, CPU and GPU Next Page Screen, hard drive, battery, ports and verdict Topics Asus Tech deals, prizes and latest news Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!

Yes, it's more complicated than that. But for decades, the general principle has pretty much held true, leading to faster and cheaper computing power that enables supercomputers in our pockets, self-driving cars, smart refrigerators and more. But there's a popular belief these days that chip makers just won't be able to keep up with Moore's Law anymore. For more on Moore, Marketplace’s Molly Wood spoke with Stacy Smith, the executive vice president leading manufacturing, operations and sales for Intel. Below is an edited transcript of their conversation. Molly Wood: So you are in San Francisco, as I understand it, talking about, of all things, Moore's Law. I have heard rumors that Moore's Law may have been killed off, but you say not so fast. Stacy Smith: The rumors of Moore's Law's death stretch back 25 years. And what happens is the smart technologists figure out ways to continue to advance it and solve problems that, you know, they had supposed were insurmountable. And the beauty of that force is that it lets us bring down costs and bring more capable products to the marketplace year in, year out. Wood: And what has, for those who have not followed this story arc, what has Moore's Law playing out over time meant for Intel's business in particular as you keep building computer chips? Smith: Yeah, it's huge, it is. It's the economic law that really drives our business. And in fact it's ... huge for the industry and the economy at large. Specifically for us, what it means is that every generation we can bring out new capabilities that enable people to have new usage models like immersive virtual reality or to solve the big problems of the world by putting, you know, supercomputers to work on mapping the genome — those kinds of things. And we can do it at a lower cost and more capability. Wood: At what point does physics start to get in the way? I know that you've already had to cross what seemed like impassable barriers to keep making transistors smaller and more powerful. How long can it go on? Smith: Yeah, it's a great question. I was in the factories back in 1990, so 25 years ago, and that was the point at which the line that we were trying to scribe on a wafer for was more narrow than the wavelength of light. And we used something called lithography to do that, so it was actually, think of it as almost a photo process. And that was seen as an insurmountable technology barrier — there's just no way the industry could progress past the wavelength of light. And it wasn't even a speed bump. The reality is that the smart men and women that work in these factories and technology development, they find ways to use X-rays, they find ways to bend light by putting it through water. And they continue to solve these problems. Wood: What does this mean for the actual physical creation of these transistors? Like, are we talking about the tiniest robots building the tiniest chips? Smith: We have highly automated factories. I wouldn't say it's robots building chips. You know, each factory that we build has thousands of people. The work that they do is very different than what they used to do. It's moved from, you know, physically touching the wafer to being engineers to make sure that the equipment that's manufacturing the products is doing that with a high level of precision. I think the big impact of Moore's Law though is just that basic model of being able to double the capability every year or bring the cost down every year, or every two years, excuse me, is the fundamental driver.... I shared some — if I can digress — I shared some fun data that we had pulled up that said if other industries progressed at the same kind of doubling of capabilities every two years that Moore's Law had, and if you apply the same metric to something like gas mileage, it says you could drive to the sun from the earth on a single gallon of gas. You could drive that distance with a single gallon of gas. It's just a phenomenal driver of our business and the economy. Wood: It seems like every day we have some new vision [of the future], whether it's, you know, virtual reality, completely immersive virtual reality, self-driving cars, missions to Mars. How much of that actually depends on you being successful in extending the life of Moore's Law? Smith: Yeah. All of it. You know, if we stopped being able to advance the capabilities of computers, we would stop advancing our capability to solve some of these problems. I mean, it's as simple as that.

Aaeon launched the first in its line of modular, customizable OMNI Series Box Kit touchscreen panel-PCs with the Intel Bay Trail based OMNI-2155. The new OMNI-BT similarly runs Linux or Windows on a quad-core, up to 2.0GHz Celeron J1900 (10W TDP) or dual-core, up to 1.58GHz Celeron N2807 (4.5W TDP). OMNI-BT (left) and unnamed Skylake-based OMNI (click images to enlarge) There’s also a new Intel 6th Gen Core “Skylake” panel computer in Aaeon’s latest OMNI roll-out. This taller, unnamed model offers a choice of dual-core Core i5-6300U or Celeron 3955U CPUs with clock rates up to 2.4GHz and 2.0GHz, respectively. Both models are available with Windows 7, 8.1, or 10, as well as an old-school Linux Kernel 2.6.x or above. Both products feature the OMNI expansion interface, which appears to implement a set of signals equivalent to a pair of mini-PCIe slots. Users can easily swap out the brick-like modules via the plug-in OMNI interface on the back of the unit. Available modules include USB/COM/LAN, dual LAN, mini-PCIe/SIM, COM, isolated COM, DIO, CAN Bus, audio, HMS, and a module that combines 4x COM ports with 16x DIO signals. Aaeon claims there are 12 modules, so perhaps two more are on their way. While the OMNI-2155 shipped standard with a pre-integrated, 15.6-inch capacitive touchscreen, the two new devices offer a choice of 7x LCD sizes ranging from 10.4 to 21.5 inches. You can buy them with either capacitive (industrial PCAP) or resistive touchscreen. The Skylake-based system measures 183 x 182 x 45mm compared to 183 x 162 x 28mm for the Bay Trail model. The Skylake OMNI supports -20 to 55°C temperatures while the Bay Trail based OMNI-BT can operate at -10 to 55°C (J1900) or 60°C (N2807). Both ranges apply to use of HDDs with 0.5 m/s airflow. Wide temperature DRAM is optional. Both systems also provide vibration resistance to the tune of 1 Grms / 5~ 500Hz, with an HDD. The aluminum case is available with IP65 ingress resistance. The OMNI systems provide a 3-pin terminal block connection for 9 to 30 VDC input. OMNI-BT detail views (click images to enlarge) The Skylake computer supports up to 8GB of DDR4 RAM, while the OMNI-BT can load up to 8GB (J1900) or 4GB (N2807) of DDR3L 1333MHz. Both systems ship with 2.5-inch SATA HDD bays, and the OMNI-BT also offers a CFast slot. The Skylake system ships with 1x GbE ports while the OMNI-BT provides two. The Skylake device provides 4x USB 3.0 ports, whereas the OMNI-BT gives you one 3.0 port along with 3x USB 2.0 ports. Both systems provide an HDMI port, and the OMNI-BT also adds a VGA port. The Skylake system gives you dual RS-232/422/485 ports while the OMNI-BT offers one. Other features include SMA antenna holes, LEDs, and power and remote power buttons. Wall, VESA, and desktop mounting options are available.   Further information No pricing or availability information was provided for the new OMNI Series Box Kit systems, but the OMNI-BT appears to be ready for order if not shipment. The Skylake-based OMNI, which is not listed under Ordering Information, appears to be farther off. More information may be found on Aaeon’s OMNI Series Box Kit product page.   Related posts: Rugged panel-PC runs Linux, offers piggy-back add-ons Rugged 10.1-inch panel PC has quad-core CPU, dual GbE Compact, rugged box-PC has four GbE ports, runs Linux Rugged, fanless Skylake box-PC has triple GbE and dual HDMI 3.5-inch SBC features Intel Skylake CPUs, dual GbE, dual… Rugged, expandable embedded PC runs Linux on Skylake SoCs Rugged embedded box gets tough with Kaby Lake Compact, rugged Skylake computer-on-module is big on PCIe Rugged box-PC runs Linux on quad-core Bay Trail Celeron Linux-friendly Celeron based 3.5-inch SBC has four GbE ports (advertise here) PLEASE COMMENT BELOW Please comment here...

The best thing about the Optane DC P4800X drive is that it also works as RAM memory. That’s right, Optane drives may deliver cover RAM and SSD duties in the future. I say in the future because this first Optane product isn’t aimed at the consumer market. Instead, it’ll be used in servers for the time being. However, Intel has now announced a second Optane-branded product, the Intel Optane Memory, which targets regular computer users and should offer you a computing experience as fast as an SSD even on a system that still uses regular HDD spinning drives. Don't Miss: Galaxy S8: Specs, release info, and everything else we know right now Even though SSDs will significantly speed up computers, they’re considerably more expensive than good old HDDs. But the Intel Optane Memory SSD is a product that’ll speed up systems that still use a mechanical hard drive as the primary storage. The Optane Memory is an M.2 NVMe SSD, AnandTech explains, that will be used as a cache drive inside your computer. It comes in 16GB and 32GB capacities, which means it’s not made for regular storage purposes. Instead, Intel designed the drive to be used only for caching, with the help of its Rapid Storage Technology drivers. Optane Memory caching is only supported on Windows 10 64-bit and only for the boot volume, the report explains. Furthermore, you’ll need a Kaby Lake generation 200-series motherboard and Kaby Lake processors to make it all work. Furthermore, the drive might not be too power-efficient for use in a laptop for the time being. If you’re thinking about combining Intel’s Optane Memory with an SSD drive to further speed up your system, don’t get too excited. It’s likely you won’t notice any performance improvements. In spite of these “limitations,” the Optane Memory is a relatively cheap upgrade for desktop users who want a faster OS experience but also plenty of HDD storage. The product retails for $44 (16GB) or $77 (32GB) and is available for preorder right now with an April 24 ship date. More technical details about Intel’s Optane Memory are available over at Intel and AnandTech.

More videos Mars mission plans unveiled Head of SpaceX Elon Musk has outlined his plans for an interplanetary rocket that can transport people and cargo to Mars. Phil Larson, a space policy adviser to former US President Barack Obama who worked for SpaceX and is now at the University of Colorado, has called the mission a "Wright Brothers moment for space." Much of the expense of space travel lies in building engines, capsules and other equipment only to be used once and then discarded. Billionaires including Musk and Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos are racing to make rocket reusability - once derided as a crazy idea - into a reality that will dramatically lower costs. Related Content SpaceX rocket launched from historic NASA pad in Florida SpaceX successfully launches rocket SpaceX has built the Falcon 9 as well as the rocket's Merlin engines in-house, taking a Silicon Valley approach to constant improvements and a tight collaboration between design and manufacturing. The rocket SpaceX was attempting to re-fly on Thursday first took off and landed successfully on an unmanned drone ship bobbing in the Atlantic Ocean in April 2016. The company has recovered eight rockets in total, three by land and five by sea. Advertisement Recovering and refurbishing the used rocket booster that flew on Thursday took SpaceX roughly four months, SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said earlier this month. Eventually, that turnaround time will drop to a single day as the company aims to refly rockets much in the way airplanes operate today. "I think Elon's given us 24 hours, maybe, to get done what we need to get done," said Shotwell. "That vehicle needs to be designed to be reflown right away." SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link SpaceX says it can save considerable time and money by reusing the big, expensive parts of its Falcon 9 rockets. Photo: Bloomberg SpaceX has successfully launched four rockets this year and aims to fly 20 to 24 missions in 2017. The California-based company has contracts with the NASA valued at $US4.2 billion ($5.5 billion) to resupply the International Space Station using its unmanned Dragon spacecraft and later ferry astronauts there with a version capable of carrying crews. Musk announced last month that SpaceX plans to send two private citizens who paid "significant deposits" on a week-long flight circling the moon late next year. The chief executive officer of electric car and batteries maker Tesla founded SpaceX 15 years ago with the goal of one day creating a human colony on Mars.

Laverty The cost of a Falcon 9 launch is roughly $US62 million, according to SpaceX's website, with modest discounts available for contractually committed, multi-launch purchases. SES, which has flown with SpaceX twice before, was the first commercial satellite operator to launch with the company back in 2013.

Devin Nunes Briefs Reporters At The White House On Intelligence Cmte Russia Investigation (Photo: Mark Wilson/Getty Images)    Nunes Didn’t Do Anything New By Viewing Raw Intel At The White House Richard Pollock Reporter 9:31 PM 03/30/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5564886 There is nothing new about House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes leaving the panel’s secure room beneath the Capitol Building and heading to the White House complex or a related facility nearby to view raw intelligence, The Daily Caller News Foundation’s Investigative Group has learned. For years, intelligence committee chiefs have trekked to the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue or to an intelligence agency to view such super sensitive intelligence material, because the congressional secure room can’t handle such material. Former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Pete Hoekstra told TheDCNF that “if someone was going to present me with raw intelligence or unfinished intelligence or with intelligence which was designed for use by another part of the government, yeah, it’s very reasonable to expect that I would have to go somewhere else.” The Michigan Republican chaired the intelligence panel from 2004 to 2007. Nunes has been harshly criticized by congressional Democrats for his decision to travel to the White House executive complex to view raw intelligence delivered by a whistleblower about allegations the Obama administration spied on then President-elect Donald Trump and his transition aides. Nunes’ actions amount to collusion with the Trump White House, according to Democrats. The New York Times Thursday went further, identifying two White House National Security Council (NSC) officials who assisted Nunes. The NYT concluded the unmasking of the NSC officials “is likely to fuel criticism that the intelligence chairman has been too eager to do the bidding of the Trump administration.” But Col. (Ret.) Jim Waurishuk, who served at the NSC, told TheDCNF such viewings are “routine,” especially at the White House complex. “Speaking from my experience, I talked to members of both sides of the aisle,” he told TheDCNF. “I’ve done that a thousand times. I say that’s routine because that goes on all the time when you’re dealing with the intelligence committee or the armed services committees. We regularly obliged them. Cleared committee chairmen would go over the White House once or twice a week.” Waurishuk was also deputy director for intelligence at the U.S. Central Command, and is now vice president of OPSEC, a nonpartisan group of retired special forces and intelligence officials. “The Members of Congress don’t get to see raw information,” Fred Rustmann, a 24-year CIA veteran, told TheDCNF. “They get to see finished information that has to be disseminated through normal channels.” Members of the “Gang of Eight” — chairmen and ranking minority members of the Senate and House intelligence committees, plus top House and Senate leaders — cannot rely on getting real-time intelligence, raw intelligence or unfinished intelligence by sticking with their limited computers. They instead must travel elsewhere to access this highly sensitive information. The congressional intelligence chiefs usually go to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building to view the data. The complex is not in the White House itself, but sits next to it in an ornate 19th century building built in the French Second Empire style. The building contains the world’s most elaborate secure facilities known as Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities. Congressional officials can review raw intelligence at CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., the National Security Agency in Ft. Meade, Md. and at 15 other intelligence agencies “In the agency [the CIA], the computers are hooked up so the intelligence won’t go out of the agency,” Rustmann said. “Members of Congress would be forced to go to the CIA to view that information.” Cooperation between the intelligence agencies and the congressional committees has not always been smooth. Relations between the CIA and the Senate Intelligence Committee nearly collapsed in rancor and discord during the Obama administration when senators and staffers were accused of stealing sensitive CIA information from a clandestine CIA facility. Members of the Senate committee, led by then-chairman Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, reviewed information about interrogation techniques at a secret CIA location in Virginia. Mistrust by both sides erupted when printed portions of materials somehow left CIA custody, then turned up in a safe in a second-floor Senate building, according to The Guardian. Critics wonder why raw intelligence can’t be viewed on Capitol Hill computers, but intelligence officials told TheDCNF that classifications would have to be downgraded before they could transmit some of the nation’s most sensitive documents to the less capable congressional computer systems. This would also greatly expand the number of people entitled to view the classified documents or tapes. The raw intelligence issue exploded recently when in the final days of the Obama administration, the president expanded the sharing of raw satellite communications, phone calls and emails collected by the National Security Agency to 16 other intelligence agencies without the previous safeguard protections. Waurishuk, who said he has routinely helped Democrats and Republicans view raw intelligence since 1990, called the recent Democratic attacks “temper tantrums.” “I wish they would grow up and become adults,” he mused.

But the congressional official said investigators were unwilling to broker a deal with Flynn – who resigned last month for misleading White House officials about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the United States – until they are further along in their inquiries and they better understand what information Flynn might offer as part of a deal.

Separately, the White House figures behind the disclosure to Republican House intelligence chairman Devin Nunes of documents suggesting Trump had been picked up in surveillance were revealed, giving insight into a development that has stalled progress in the investigation of links between Trump and Russia. The revelations rocked Washington even as experts testifying in the Senate described the sustained influence campaign mounted by Russia during the US election. Related Content US National Security Adviser Michael Flynn resigns Michael Flynn a dramatic early casualty in Trump administration Flynn's lawyer, in a statement on Thursday evening US time, confirmed discussions with the House and Senate intelligence committees about possible testimony by his client. The lawyer, Robert Kelner, did not provide specifics about the terms under which Flynn would testify, but said that "no reasonable person, who has the benefit of advice from counsel, would submit to questioning in such a highly politicised, witch hunt environment without assurances against unfair prosecution". Advertisement "General Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should circumstances permit," the statement said. The Wall Street Journal reported Flynn's offer to testify.

Federal law allows the Justice Department to delay a congressional immunity deal but not block it outright. The New York Times reported on Thursday that two White House officials played a role in providing Nunes with documents the Republican committee chairman cited to show Trump and his associates were swept up in surveillance by US intelligence. Several US officials identified the White House officials as Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the senior director for intelligence at the National Security Council, and Michael Ellis, a lawyer who works on national security issues at the White House Counsel's Office and formerly worked on the staff of the House Intelligence Committee. Trump said Nunes' comments about the surveillance helped justify his insistence, made without evidence, that former President Barack Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower in New York, his campaign headquarters.  As investigations into personal links between the Trump campaign and Russia continues, the Senate committee pressed ahead as well. 'Propaganda on steroids' Russia mounted a campaign of "propaganda on steroids" seeking to influence the 2016 US presidential election, Senator Mark Warner told an intelligence committee hearing on the allegations. The top Democrat on the US Senate Intelligence Committee listed several areas of concern about possible links to Republican Donald Trump's campaign. In Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin again denied that Russia tried to influence the election, but in doing so he made reference to the wrong US president in answering a question at an Arctic forum. "Once, Reagan, while discussing, I think, taxes, told the Americans: 'Read my lips: 'No!'" His reply recalled what George H.W. Bush told Americans during his 1988 presidential election campaign, "Read my lips: No new taxes." Bush later raised taxes. Trump has dismissed suggestions of links with Moscow as Democratic Party sour grapes about his surprise November defeat of the party's candidate, Hillary Clinton. US intelligence agencies said Russia hacked emails of senior Democrats and orchestrated the release of embarrassing information to hurt Clinton's campaign. "I will not prejudge the outcome of our investigation," Senator Mark Warner told an intelligence committee hearing on the allegations. "We are seeking to determine if there is an actual fire, but so far there is a great, great deal of smoke." Putin also said on Thursday that contacts Russian diplomats had made in the United States were merely part of routine work. At the hearing, lawmakers warned of the danger that Russia could interfere in elections in France and Germany this year and in future US campaigns. Cyber security experts at the rare day-long public hearing detailed what they described as the dissemination of disinformation and cyber attacks on both Democratic political operatives and Republicans. Lawmakers and cyber experts mentioned stories that were being spread to discredit German Chancellor Angela Merkel. And they said Britain's "Brexit" vote last year on leaving the European Union should be examined. Clinton Watts, a security consultant and former FBI agent, told Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican committee member, that he may have been a victim of Russian activity during his unsuccessful campaign for the 2016 Republican nomination against Trump. Rubio later said he would not comment. But he told the hearing that in July 2016, after he announced he would run for re-election to the Senate, former members of his presidential campaign team were targeted by an unsuccessful cyber attack from Russia. He said former campaign staffers were also targeted unsuccessfully from within Russia within the past 24 hours. "We're all targets of a sophisticated and capable adversary," said Senator Richard Burr, a Republican who heads the intelligence committee. Democrat Warner, who was a technology executive before entering politics, described a sweeping Russian campaign using trolls and botnets, or networks of hacked or infected devices, to spread large amounts of disinformation. The campaign of "fake news" was particularly targeted at traditionally Democratic-leaning states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, where Trump defeated Clinton by narrow margins that were not predicted by opinion polls, he said. "This Russian 'propaganda on steroids' was designed to poison the national conversation in America," Warner said. Citing concerns to be addressed in the committee's probe, Warner listed the prediction by a Trump associate about the release of hacked emails weeks before they were released, a change in the Republican Party's platform to water down language on Ukraine, and Trump's campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and other Trump associates being forced to step down over ties to Russia. A separate investigation in the House of Representatives into the intelligence agencies' allegations of a Russian role in the US election has become mired in controversy over accusations that its Republican chairman, Trump ally Nunes, is not impartial. Nunes and Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House committee, met on Thursday to discuss their investigation. Schiff said the two had discussed obtaining documents before deciding which witnesses to call in.

Problem Solving | 13 Mar 2017 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (15) How to Identify High-Performance GPU Apps on the MacBook Pro by Jeff Carlson Shortly after the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar began shipping, battery life became a hot topic. Although Apple boasts up to 10 hours of performance per charge, I wasn’t seeing anything near that on my machine. I’d get maybe 4 hours. For a while, Consumer Reports refused to recommend the MacBook Pro because of battery life, although their testing methodology was questionable (see “Why We Should Care about the Consumer Reports MacBook Pro Rating,” 12 January 2017). The upside of the tempest was that Apple was able to fix some graphics and battery life issues in the macOS Sierra 10.12.2 and 10.12.3 updates. One of those problems centered around the way macOS switched between the built-in Intel graphics processor and the discrete AMD Radeon Pro graphics card available in the 15-inch models. (Although I’m writing specifically about the 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, the following discussion applies equally to any MacBook Pro with a discrete graphics card.) When you launch a graphically demanding app, such as Adobe Photoshop, macOS switches to the Radeon processor, which consumes more power. When you quit the power-hungry app, the machine is supposed to turn off the discrete card and switch back to the integrated graphics processor, which offers less graphical power but doesn’t chew as much battery life. Before 10.12.3, macOS wouldn’t accurately sense that the changeover had happened and would continue to drive the display using the discrete GPU. Since applying that update, my battery life has dramatically improved. Even still, though, there are times when it seems as if my battery level is slipping away faster than I would expect given the work I’m doing. If you’re experiencing something similar, here’s how you can determine which apps are using which graphics processor and potentially track down the culprit. You have a couple of options: First, click the Battery menu bar item, which will tell you which applications are “Using Significant Energy.” That’s a fuzzy indicator, however. You can be running an application that’s using significant energy and still be using the integrated graphics processor. So, a quick trip into Activity Monitor is more helpful. Launch Activity Monitor (located in the Utilities folder in the Applications folder; you can get there quickly in the Finder by choosing Go > Utilities) and click the Energy tab. At the bottom of the window, see which graphics card is currently in use: Integrated (the Intel GPU) or “High Perf” (the high-performance Radeon GPU). If it’s the latter, you may be burning energy faster than you want. To determine which application is causing the discrete GPU to run, click the Requires High Perf GPU column to sort the list of running processes based on that attribute. You may have to click the heading twice to sort it correctly; the caret to the right of the column title should be facing down to indicate that you’re sorting in descending order. At the top of the list, the apps that say Yes are your culprits. Quit those apps. Even if you’re not actively using them, their presence can keep the discrete GPU active. The Graphics Card indicator at the bottom of the screen should switch back to Integrated. You’ll notice that Activity Monitor also includes a Time Remaining estimate. When Apple released 10.12.2, it took the unusual step of removing this information from the Battery menu bar item (see “macOS 10.12.2 Sierra Focuses on New MacBook Pros,” 13 December 2016). Happily, you can still get that information in Activity Monitor. The estimate is still just an estimate, though, and shouldn’t be taken as gospel because macOS adjusts its energy management features frequently. Nevertheless, the Time Remaining estimate can be a helpful guideline if you’re getting close to the wire. Of course, if you have to use even a single app that requires the discrete GPU, your battery life will suffer, and there’s nothing you can do about it. Similarly, even if no apps are using the discrete GPU or reporting as using significant energy, the battery may drain faster than you expect due to other factors. Especially on the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, I’ve found that turning off keyboard illumination (expand the Control Strip on the Touch Bar to reveal the keyboard brightness buttons) and reducing screen brightness can make a big difference.   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

Is your MacBook Pro with Touch Bar getting less battery life per charge than you think it should? The culprit could be applications that are forcing it to use the high-performance graphics processor. Here’s how to tell which GPU is in use and which applications to close to switch to the integrated processor. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Richard  2017-03-13 15:31 This is brilliant and incredibly useful. I'm using a 2014 MacBook Pro but I've always wanted to see which of my application uses the discreet GPU. It looks like my only application that uses it is Lightroom. Safari has memory issues but they're not related to the GPU. Reply Greg  2017-03-13 21:16 Why would pgAdmin need the graphics card? It's the only app that was using it. pgAdmin can view Postgres databases. That doesn't seem too demanding. Is there any downside when the MBP is not running off the battery? Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-03-15 13:08 I just downloaded the latest version (4.13) and also found it requires the "high perf. GPU." My guess it's because its GUI is made using the Qt framework and there's something about the framework that makes the Mac think it should use the discrete video card; every application made with Qt likely will do the same. I would report it to Postgres in case there's some setting they can use in the Mac build process to make the application *not* trigger use of the discrete video card. When you're not running off battery, the consequences of using the discrete video card are much less significant; you're using more electricity than necessary and may be adding wear to the cooling fans. Reply Tony Voss   2017-03-14 01:55 I use a 15" MacBook Pro as the navigational system on a yacht and power consumption is critical, especially when there is little sun or wind for power generation. For years I have used gfxCardStatus (http://gfx.io). This useful app places an extra item in the menu bar which indicates by displaying the letter i or n whether the integrated or Nvidia discrete processor is active. Pull down on the icon and it shows a list of apps requiring the external card processor. You can also switch between using Integrated only, discrete or dynamic switching. You cannot switch to 'Integrated only' if an app is already using the discrete processor. Some apps and an external display force discrete mode anyway. I have gfxCardStatus set to display a notification whenever the mode is switched. This is a useful warning when you happen to launch an app that turns on the discrete processor and comforting confirmation when you quite a culprit. I have successfully got app developers to remove unnecessary use of the discrete card and to fix an app that left it on when quitting. But if the app is no longer being maintained you may be out of luck - Bento for example. Thoroughly recommended. Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 12:17 I wanted to mention gfxCardStatus, but it's no longer actively maintained, and doesn't work reliably under Sierra (and maybe a version or two back). I used it for years, and wrote about it for TidBITS in 2011: Reply Troy T  2017-03-19 22:55 I've used this utility for years and continue to be happy with it. As it isn't maintained, it's less helpful in shifting sources of video drivers, but it continues to flawlessly show when the system is using discrete graphics and which apps are forcing its use. As long as gfxCardStatus still reports what's going on with the video circuitry, I'll strongly recommend it for anyone who is interested in stretching their battery capacity. Reply DelfM  2017-03-14 08:35 It's probably rare that you would be concerned about power consumption when you connect an external monitor, but my 2012 MacBook Pro Retina switches to the high performance graphics card when I connect an external monitor, even if none of my open applications need it. Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 12:14 Yes, I think all MacBook Pros with discrete cards switch to the GPU to power an external monitor. Reply Curtis Wilcox   2017-03-15 13:18 I don't understand why it automatically uses the discrete card when an external monitor is attached, Macs without such cards are able to use the same monitors. It also happens regardless of whether the external monitor is extending the desktop or mirroring the built-in display. At work, we always advise faculty to use the AC adapter when presenting from a laptop but it would be nice if they didn't have to. I don't have the ability to check at the moment but I wonder if screen mirroring over AirPlay or using 3rd party mirroring software triggers use of the discrete card. It would be a little ironic if they don't, given that mirroring by software almost certainly is more intensive than mirroring on a physically connected display. Reply David Redfearn   2017-03-14 13:57 I started looking at this data when I got my new MBP 15. One oddity I have noticed is that Apple Photos does not seem to use the AMD GPU. I have two Photos extensions (RAWPower and DxO) that do trigger the GPU when they are used, but when I am finished with them, the GPU is turned off. David Reply Jeff Carlson   2017-03-14 16:15 I would bet Apple tuned Photos especially so it doesn't need the GPU. Reply Brian Harvey  2017-03-28 00:43 More a question than a comment. MBP 2016 with 2.9 GHz Intel Core i7. running with 598 GB free. Docked most of the time using a Benq 32 inch 4K monitor; currently running at 1080P. Latest s/w not beta. I seem to have a lot of spinning beach balls. I cut they system down to only a few add ons such as SwithcResX. I still frequently get the spinning beach ball with Safari and iTunes. I even get the ball with the MBP native resolution with no external monitor attached. Anyone seen this happening? Reply Tony Voss   2017-03-28 04:55 I have seen a lot of spinning beach balls of late - maybe since Sierra 10.12.3? MacBook Pro 15" with Thunderbolt Display and lid closed. I only rarely use iTunes and have the feeling it is linked to use of Safari. Reply Adam Engst   2017-03-28 09:34 This sounds like the sort of thing you'd need to track down carefully. Joe Kissell's Speeding Up Your Mac: A Joe On Tech Guide is where I'd look for that information. http://www.takecontrolbooks.com/jot-speeding-up Or maybe his Troubleshooting Your Mac: A Joe On Tech Guide http://www.takecontrolbooks.com/jot-troubleshooting Reply Brian Harvey  2017-03-29 23:04 Tony, sadly it seems to have started from almost day one. I am glad I did a clean install when I got this computer rather than a transfer. I thought I would give it a few versions to see if MACOS versions would help. NADA. Adam, I guess I should have bought one of those yesterday rather than upgrading another book from Take Control.

That doesn’t mean we allow uncleared members from the media to come and look at this,” Spicer said during the White House press briefing on Thursday.  The House Intelligence Committee's ranking member Rep.

But Schiff also said this invitation "raises far more questions than any it answers."   House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) has been under fire for meeting with the president without conferring with his committee, and publicly announcing that Obama administration inadvertently collected surveillance on Trump transition associates during a broader intelligence probe, based on reports he had seen. Nunes said he privately reviewed the documents on White House grounds "to confirm what I already knew,” before making his announcement. Nunes has also refused to identify his sources or the agency the information came from, claiming it would scare other potential sources from disclosing sensitive information.  It's not clear if the documents Spicer was referring to are the same that Nunes saw.  Some critics accuse Nunes of working for the White House and have called for him to recuse himself from the investigation, concerned that he is trying to give Trump cover for his allegations of wiretapping against President Obama.  Tags Adam Schiff   View the discussion thread.

View Latest Posts >>> NEO – London Attack: Policeman Murdered by the Mainstream Media By Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor on March 30, 2017 by  Seth Ferris,  … with New Eastern Outlook,  Moscow “For those who can remember” [ Editor’s note: As he often does, Seth Ferris absorbs an event for a while before writing about it, avoiding the rush to claim the “who dun it” prize on day one, a national pastime for Internet Dick Tracys. Frankly, after the France and Germany truck terror assaults, I had expected a much larger wave of copycat attacks. But I love to be wrong on things like that. Seth goes into an area that most have not, on how the vast media coverage of such events is a bigger inspiration that whatever ISIS does on line, which miraculously all the Intel orgs seem powerless to stop; and this smells a bit suspicious me, the untrusting soul. I was also wrong about expecting suicide bombers in shopping malls after 9-11. The number of soft targets are uncountable, so I thought it was a given they would happen. But what we learned is that they were not really here; their absence gave birth to all the FBI sting operations to keep their terror budget funding going. It was only years later that the copycat killers began to emerge, with some questionable cases as to their real motivation. The British have me baffled. They seem to have no law to pick people up who have gone to the Middle East for Jihad, so they are left with “watching them”, a huge waste of limited counter terrorism manpower, when a long stretch for aiding and abetting would be cheaper and safer. To be fair, we would have to give the same treatment to those in the British Establishment who have aided State proxy terrorism, which the Brits are old hands at, which might be why there are no laws to pick people up. But they are taking action against some Brits who have gone to serve in the Israeli Army. Go figure that… Jim W. Dean ] Jim’s Editor’s Notes are solely crowdfunded via PayPal – JimWDean@aol.com This includes research, needed field trips, Heritage TV Legacy archiving, and more – Thanks for helping out _________ First published March 2017 As the world knows, on March 22nd a 52-year old man drove his car through a crowd of pedestrians on Westminster Bridge in London, killing some and injuring many others, before crashing the car into the railings of the Houses of Parliament complex and stabbing a policeman to death. He was then shot dead himself before anyone could find out who he was and why he had done this. Armed police rush towards Parliament’s gates after the officer was stabbed The Metropolitan Police and the emergency services immediately responded to the incident by declaring it a terrorist attack. This is a laudable precaution, but as the police said at the time, “we are treating it as a terrorist attack until we know otherwise”. When a person goes to hospital with a particular medical condition it is common to test for other, more serious, conditions as a precaution against these sitting there undetected or developing later. At no time did the police state that this was a terrorist attack—simply that it could be, and would therefore be treated as such as a precaution. But what have we seen? Practically every media outlet immediately assumed it was a terrorist attack – in other words, that it had been planned and executed by an organised group regarded as”terrorist” by those governments who claim to be fighting terrorism. Politicians from the UK and all over the world rushed to condemn terrorism and declare their defiance of these fanatics. Though some voices pointed out that we didn’t yet know this was a terrorist attack, this didn’t matter. Politicians and media outlets had an agenda to pursue, so that was that. It turned out that the perpetrator was Khalid Masood, who had previously been known as Adrian Elms and Adrian Ajao. He was an English convert to Islam and wasn’t white, so this got alarm bells ringing. When ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack this assertion was given wide publicity, despite the fact it always claims responsibility for any terror attack it agrees with, and its statement made clear that it had not actually directed the attack or even known who the attacker was. The London attack is a classic example of that old mainstream journalism maxim – “to hell with the facts, get on with the story”. It is a story we have heard time and again from different governments. These are the same governments which claim that we live under a terrorist threat whilst arming those terrorists from the US and allied countries by issuing fake end user certificates for the shipments, recruiting and training their “militants” in the Pankisi Gorge and other places and sending them from one conflict to another on fake Georgian passports, funding them by taking over the oil and drug smuggling routes and ensuring only terrorists can use these and using those same terrorists as their own intelligence agents – which is why we know a lot about them after an atrocity is committed, but no one had been able to use this information to prevent the atrocity. So what actually happened in London? Who was really behind it? At the time of writing no one can say for certain. But where does RESPONSIBILITY for these events lie? Exactly where the media doesn’t want us to look – for a very obvious reason. _________ False Opposition State-sponsored terror against itself – A history of complicity in terror attacks? The UK is used to terrorism. Not only Northern Ireland but the UK mainland endured 30 years of it during The Troubles. This is why people can no longer pretend to be Prime Minister by having their photographs taken outside 10 Downing Street as they once did – the street is closed to the general public as a result of a serious IRA attack in the 1980s, protected by a gate and patrolled by guards. During those days UK politicians also routinely said that they would never give in to terrorism. We now know however that successive UK governments had a range of unofficial dealings with Republican terrorists, and that Unionist terrorists were actively assisted by policemen acting with the tacit approval of the UK government. This is why so many people lined up to pay tribute to former IRA terrorist Martin McGuinness after his recent death – their descriptions of him as a man of peace may have been genuine, but also driven by an understanding of what terrorists can still reveal about those who said them. It has long been asked why these contacts existed if the UK government really wanted to stamp out terrorism. This question has particular relevance to the citizens of Birmingham, where homes have been raided in connection with the London attack. In November 1974, 21 people were killed by two bombs planted in Birmingham city centre pubs. In the wake of these six Irishmen living in Birmingham were jailed for 16 years for bombings which the police and security services knew from the beginning they had not committed, as were eleven other innocent people in two contemporaneous cases. In all of these cases, credible suspects have been suggested by people who were apparently connected with these bombings, and some convicted persons have admitted their role in them. But no one has been prosecuted, and in the case of Birmingham the files have been sealed until everyone mentioned in them is dead, an action only taken when there is something deeply embarrassing to hide. It is therefore disingenuous, to say the least, for the British government to say that it is on one side and terrorists are on the other. But the spectre of terrorism is raised at every opportunity, to justify actions such as high defence spending in a rich country where hundreds of people live off food banks, colluding with human rights abusers such as Saudi Arabia to gain intelligence and invading Iraq and Syria after helping South American dictatorships inflict equal or greater terrorism on their populations. If the UK government wanted to prevent terrorist attacks it would, in many cases. Instead it colludes with terrorists and gives them constant publicity to encourage others to follow their example. The family of PC Keith Palmer, the policeman murdered by Khalid Masood, has reason to ask whether this is even intended to be the right approach. _________ One of Us People are endlessly fascinated by criminals. The UK government even goes so far as to collude with terrorists and gives them constant publicity to encourage others to follow their example At the time of writing, the police are still saying that, as far they can see, Masood acted alone. Several people have been arrested in connection with the case, but as yet no one has been charged with assisting Masood, let alone being a member of a terrorist organisation. It appears that Masood had a history of criminal convictions for offences involving violence, and particularly knives. His murderous attack on PC Palmer is consistent with his known history. It is however rather amateurish for a terrorist conducting a planned operation. Are we supposed to believe that anyone planning a raid on the British parliament would draw attention to themselves by randomly murdering people in his car, then try and burst through parliamentary security single-handed, armed with no more than a couple of knives? No other person was arrested elsewhere in the vicinity of parliament, despite the security operation which moved swiftly into place. It is doubtful whether any of the government ministers responsible for counter-terrorism measures, let alone the police, actually believe such a story. The fact that Masood was a convert to Islam raises eyebrows. There are many reasons why people adopt a new religion, or abandon the one they have. But as with political affiliation these are as much to do with that person’s psychological makeup as ideology. Sammy Davis Jr. famously converted to Judaism despite being African American, with no apparent ties to that faith. According to Jerry Lewis, Davis felt the Jews were an oppressed people in the same way African Americans were, but had developed a whole theology around this in the way his own people hadn’t. This was the basis of a genuine commitment to Judaism which Davis retained for the rest of his life. The British press has long gone out of its way to associate the terms “Islam” and “terrorist”. Masood may not have been part of a terrorist group, but he did have a history of violence, despite neighbours describing him as personally inoffensive. If he was attracted to this faith by the violent extremism ascribed to it, which we can infer from the fact he had previously been investigated for links to such extremism, this would explain why he seems little known amongst practising Muslims the police have spoke to in connection with the attack. British politicians say they do not agree with equating Islam with terrorism, using London’s Mayor, the Muslim Sadiq Khan, as a poster boy of such campaigns. However they are not lining up to condemn those US politicians who are justifying crime by saying it is “the will of God“. Again, the families of Khalid Masood’s victims might wonder why this is so, if you don’t really want people to think that Islam and crime are the same thing, and be prepared to act accordingly. _________ He Got it From Someone Else The politicians and mainstream media have an answer to this however. Knowing that it may be discovered that Masood was acting alone they have a ready quote to hand. As the police did not know whether he was a terrorist or not, they justified their response to the attack by saying that Masood was “inspired by terrorism”. Having seen what these awful people do, he had decided to try and do something similar on his own, rather than actually join a terrorist group. This assertion will make all the claims about this being a terrorist attack accurate. Even if he wasn’t a terrorist he must have wanted to emulate what he had heard, seen, read or been told about. So terrorists must be responsible at the end of the day, and the war on terror, and the profits it makes for some, can continue as before. If Masood was inspired to emulate terrorists by a particular person, that person will be arrested and charged in relation to the London attack. We are told that the security services have extensive files on radical Muslims who might want to commit terrorist offences, and that Masood had not been under suspicion of such links for several years. People are therefore asking how Masood managed to carry out this attack without the security services knowing, whilst ignoring the obvious answer. If Masood was “inspired by terrorism”, but had no known links with any radical terrorists, his inspiration must have come from the media. We have all seen how the likes of Tatarkhan Batiashvili, who was invalided out of the Georgian Army, are promoted around the world as fearsome jihadists whose rise and crimes are unstoppable. The US and UK have TV talent shows called things like Pop Idol and American Idol. They might as well have another one called Terror Idol, given the glamourisation of “popular” terrorists in the Western media. Mainstream media outlets will doubtless say that anything they report about terrorists is nothing to do with the government because they are independent. The Western world prides itself on its free press. However the London attack came less than a week after George Osborne, David Cameron’s Chancellor of the Exchequer who lost his job when Theresa May took over, had been appointed the new editor of the Evening Standard, the main London newspaper. Osborne has the right to pursue a new career at any time. But he has stated that he will be doing no such thing – he intends to remain an MP, representing his constituents when his duties at the newspaper allow. Apparently the Evening Standard, this bastion of the independent, free press, does not feel its independence is compromised by having a serving MP, from the governing party, as its editor. On the contrary, it feels it brings it closer to the news, or rather the stuff it wishes to print. _________ No excuse Western governments have armed, trained and created terrorists for many years. They have geo-strategic reasons for continuing to do this, regardless of a human cost which would have them all in jail if they were called Nazis, Serbs or Khmer Rouge. As part of this programme, terrorists are promoted as invincible warriors which only vast resources will defeat. Russia demonstrated the nonsense of this when it bombed the ISIS positions in Syria and cleared out the militants in one raid. But as long as Western governments continue with this policy there will be terrorist atrocities in their own countries, to remind the population that they might be victims themselves at any time, and so cannot question the use of their taxes on allegedly fighting these people. George Osborne with despatch box The mainstream media has done all it can to facilitate this process with its scare stories. A free press should safeguard the public from government schemes of this kind. But here it is insisting that a man with a history of violent crimes who did the same again must be a terrorist, and if not be “inspired by terrorism” to justify this allegation. Police Constable Keith Palmer was murdered by Khalid Masood. But if Masood was really inspired by terrorism it is the mainstream media, and its refusal to do its job, which is ultimately responsible for his death. It has glorified the Western-created terrorists and said that Masood acted on these stories. By its own admission, the London attack would not have happened without it. A public fund to compensate PC Palmer’s family raised £500,000 within 24 hours of opening. We should all look forward to the day when editors such as George Osborne return all that money to its donors, and replace it with their own.

The Nazis and Isil are more than welcome in British politics as long as they attack Russians, other Slavs, Arabs, Germans, Italians and all other interesting folks with land riches. Britain has (had) psychopathic stepmothering problems with the rest of European nations (including Ireland), it doesn’t want any ties to them other than the upper hand in trade wars. First you thought because they drive on the left, but nah, they just couldn’t care less if between La Manche and the Persian gulf is one, three or thirteen countries, and in what language. As long as the oil is coming and currency is supported.

John Ballard (TMFRazorback) Mar 30, 2017 at 5:01PM NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has risen 650% in the last five years as it has broadened its graphics technology to a number of areas beyond gaming. It's important for investors interested in the company to know what the graphics specialist is doing to stay ahead of the competition and continue delivering returns for shareholders. Partnerships and design wins NVIDIA's business outside of selling graphics processing units (GPUs) to PC gamers is heavily dependent on winning a place inside other company's systems, so-called design wins. Gamers can buy NVIDIA's GPUs direct from the company on its website, but selling GPUs to other industries like auto, manufacturing, and cloud computing is a little more complicated. As a consequence, there's a lot of work besides engineering that goes into supplying GPUs to an auto company or manufacturer. NVIDIA and Bosch recently partnered to build an AI self-driving car computer. Image source: NVIDIA.  Every year, NVIDIA has one or two chances to achieve design wins with potential customers or partners. Failure to offer a product competitive on functionality and price can lead to lower revenue and lower market share. Companies in various industries have particular needs, so it's extremely important for NVIDIA to work closely with companies to ensure it provides GPUs that fulfill a specific requirement. This places emphasis not just on great GPU design and engineering, but also on having great people who can form relationships with companies. A key part of NVIDIA's business success is anticipating what companies in different industries need and then supplying the right product at the right price. This makes the growth of NVIDIA's business in the last few years all the more impressive. NVIDIA partners include TomTom, which provides mapping technology for self-driving cars; FANUC, a robot manufacturer for automated factories; and auto manufacturers and suppliers including Tesla, Volkswagen AG's Audi, PACCAR, Bosch, and Europe's top trucking supplier, ZF. NVIDIA's advancements in GPU technology have left CPU giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) scrambling to catch up as the GPU is the only processor capable of handling the computing power needed to teach a car to drive by itself or to power robots in automated factories. As NVIDIA gets more design wins and creates important partnerships in serving new growth markets, Intel has found itself in a defensive posture and is trying to buy its way to self-driving car dominance through acquisitions, such as its recent deal to buy Mobileye. Intel might be kicking itself for not attempting to acquire a much cheaper NVIDIA five years ago. The GPU is the processor of the future, and NVIDIA's quickly increasing list of partnerships with major auto and manufacturing companies demonstrates it has the technology and people to succeed in important future growth markets. Superior financials NVIDIA's success with GPU development has translated to superior financials compared to its prime GPU competitor, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). NVIDIA finished fiscal 2017 with $6.8 billion in cash and marketable securities and less than $2 billion in debt -- a very healthy net cash position of $4.8 billion. This is a much stronger financial position than AMD's $1.26 billion in cash and $1.4 billion in debt. The financial picture looks even better for NVIDIA when we take into account its ongoing share repurchases and dividends. NVIDIA's cash generated from operations has increased from $906 million in fiscal 2015 to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2017. In the last three fiscal years, NVIDIA has generated a total of $3.7 billion in cash from operations and distributed a total of $2.8 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. While NVIDIA is in a position to reward shareholders with excess cash flow, AMD is in the difficult position of managing its finances in order to pay down debt.  This is a major Achilles' heel for AMD as it tries to win back market share in the discrete GPU market. AMD burned $234 million in cash from operations over the last three fiscal years, causing the company to issue debt in order to pay down debt. NVIDIA's superior financial situation is a result of better positioning in product design and pricing by its management team led by CEO Jen-Hsun Huang. Going forward, its strong balance sheet and its superior cash flow generation give NVIDIA more resources to invest in GPU development compared to AMD. John Ballard owns shares of Nvidia.

Intel lets loose Kaby Lake-based Xeon E3 v6 processors by Bruno Ferreira  4:58 PM on March 28, 2017 We love our Core i5 and Core i7 CPUs around here, particularly when it comes to gaming, but not everyone has time for such frivolity. Workstation users have a different set of processing needs, usually revolving around a stable platform, ECC memory, and certified drivers. That's where the Intel's Xeon E3 v6 family of Kaby Lake-based CPUs come in. The updated lineup contains a total of eight models, ranging from the humble-ish Xeon E3-1220 v6 with its four cores and clock speed up to 3.5 GHz, up to the mighty Xeon E3-1280 v6 and its four cores, eight threads, and turbo clocks up to 4.2 GHz. The TDP for all the CPUs in the family hovers around 72W, and the amount of cache is likewise the same for all models, at 8MB. Intel says the new models support ECC RAM in amounts up to 64GB and speeds up to DDR4-2400. Owners of existing setups with DDR3L RAM need not worry—that's supported, too. Seeing as the new Xeons are based on the Kaby Lake architecture, 10-bit HEVC encoding and decoding is on the menu, too. Like you'd expect from workstation-grade processors, the Xeon E3 v6s support all the alphabet-soup virtualization technologies: TSX-NI, vPro, VT-d, and VT-x. Those concerned with system security will be happy to know that the whole host of security features (including AES-NI, SGX, Trusted Execution, and OS Guard) are all supported, too. Here's a full list of the models: Model Cores Threads Base clock Turbo clock IGP Price Xeon E3-1280 v6 4 8 3.9 GHz 4.2 GHz - $612 Xeon E3-1275 v6 4 8 3.8 GHz 4.2 GHz Yes $339 Xeon E3-1270 v6 4 8 3.8 GHz 4.2 GHz - $328 Xeon E3-1245 v6 4 8 3.7 GHz 4.1 GHz Yes $284 Xeon E3-1240 v6 4 8 3.7 GHz 4.1 GHz - $272 Xeon E3-1230 v6 4 8 3.5 GHz 3.9 GHz - $250 Xeon E3-1225 v6 4 4 3.3 GHz 3.7 GHz Yes $213 Xeon E3-1220 v6 4 4 3.0 GHz 3.5 GHz - $193 The three models whose number ends in a 5 (E3-1225, E3-1245, and E3-1275) all pack Intel's spankin' HD Graphics 630 IGP. The company claims that when armed with this IGP, "designers may no longer need a discrete graphics card for some of the most commonly-used workloads." According to Intel, the IGP in the E3-1275 v6 CPU should offer three times the performance as the one in the old E3-1275 v2 when measured with SPEC graphics tools. The company also says that chips with these P630 IGPs are up to the task of "entry professional VR," among other pro applications. The P630 graphics driver is certified for use with multiple pro applications, too. The general theme seems to be one of upgrading the CPU rather than replacing an entire machine, given that the Xeon E3 v6 processors still go into Socket 1151, have dual-channel memory controllers, and will fit existing motherboards with C232 and C236 chipsets, likely only at the cost of a BIOS update. Those looking to make use of the P630 IGP will need the higher-end C236, though. As a recap, when compared to the C232, the C236 chipset has IGP support, 20 lanes of PCIe 3.0 instead of eight, and support for Intel Active Management Technology, Node Manager, and Rapid Storage Technology features. The new CPUs should be available to OEMs right away. Tags: CPUs Servers Workstations Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Aorus GA-AX370 Gaming K5 mobo trims a little fat by Wayne Manion  11:30 AM on March 29, 2017 So much functionality has been moved from the motherboard into the CPU itself that variations within a product line often come down to little details. That's the case with Gigabyte's Aorus GA-AX370-Gaming K5. This motherboard is a full ATX affair with four DDR4 DIMM slots, three metal-reinforced PCIe slots, four USB 3.1 ports, and support for AMD's latest Ryzen CPUs. Overall, the board is quite similar to the Aorus GA-AX370-Gaming K7 we described a few weeks ago, with only a couple of niche features pared back. The most obvious difference between the Gaming K7 and the new Gaming K5 is in the motherboards' networking section. The Gaming K7 has an Intel Gigabit Ethernet controller and a Killer E2500 802.11ac Wi-Fi chip, while the Gaming K5 makes do with just the Intel wired networking adapter. The other main difference we could tease out from the specifications is in the audio section. The Gaming K7 sports two Realtek ALC1220 codecs—one each for the front and rear audio outputs. The Gaming K5 soldiers on with just one of these chips. The Gaming K7 also has nine temperature sensors, eight fan headers, and two additional headers for temperature probes. The Gaming K5 knocks the number of temperature sensors down to six and the number of fan headers to five. The headers for thermistors didn't make the cut either. These are probably minor omissions for most users. What remains is still a pretty full-featured package. The board supports all AMD AM4 CPUs including seventh-generation APUs and the entire Ryzen lineup. The Gaming K5 is compatible with two-card SLI and Crossfire setups. The single M.2 slot is ready to accept PCIe x4 NVMe storage devices, to go along with up to eight onboard SATA drives. When the zoned RGB lighting is disabled, the Gaming K5 has a subdued black-and-gray look. Once the switch is thrown, the DIMM slots, PCIe slots, and other areas on the board light up in any of 16.8 million colors, controlled by Gigabyte's RGB Fusion software. Gigabyte did not provide a launch date or pricing information for the GA-AX370-Gaming K5, though we would expect the mobo to arrive soon at a lower price than that of the $210 Aorus GA-AX370-Gaming K7.

Asus readies 35 motherboards for Optane Memory by Wayne Manion  4:00 PM on March 30, 2017 Intel's consumer-targeted Optane hybrid cache drives have yet to enter the TR labs, but when the 16 GB and 32 GB M.2 gumsticks arrive, a wide swathe of Asus' 200-series motherboards will be ready for them. The manufacturer announced on its Edge Up blog page that BIOS updates for 35 different models with B250, H270, Q270, and Z270 chipsets will enable Optane compatibility. As we noted in our previous coverage, these devices will only work with Intel Kaby Lake Core i3, i5, and i7 CPUs with 200-series and C236 chipsets. Users with Kaby Lake chips on 100-series motherboards or Skylake processors on 200-series mainboards are left out of the Optane party. Owners of Kaby Lake Pentiums and Celerons are similarly disqualified. What we know about the first wave of consumer Optane models suggests that owners of the lower-end chipsets paired with old-school spinning-rust storage devices will see more benefits from the new technology than those with ROG Maximus IX Extreme Z270 boards paired with cutting-edge NVMe SSDs. Intel has a list of Optane-compatible boards from a number of manufacturers here. As a reminder, the 16 GB model is expected to sell for $44 and the 32 GB model will go for $77.

And would he have. His work cut out for him it was still a White House right app please welcome. CNN's senior political comment. And a host of the acts this ticket acts arrived at. President Obama's senior advise that so. When you heard the new guys claims. That he'd been wiretapped. By Obama did you get best. I got stunned. More than I mean obviously. A it it's you get pissed but. The thing was so ludicrous. I mean it was just so incredible because anybody knows anything about. Government which may have led him out yes yeah we know that president had oral wiretap. You'd have all kinds of agencies and people complicit in such an act there are rules and laws and courts that governs such things. And so even if you ascribe those kind of motives or of that back kind of attitude to Barack Obama which I've found us an astonishing claim. There are just it just was be impossible to accomplish and I think most people. Agree although there was CBS poll SS said. A large number of Republicans believe that he was wiretapped. So well it's being reported that the Obama administration again blocked FBI James caught FBI director James calling from going public with information. About Russian interference. Earlier he wanted apparently right an bed in their view and I just wasn't there at the time I was working for CNN but their view apparently was. It that all the agencies should come forward at once at the should be done as in up Pettit and in October they did come for but I will tell you this when I was at the Republican Convention there were already intimations. Of Russian. Interference and that story was out there remember Amanda for rack was ushered out shortly after that so. I don't think it was a secret that something was going on about sober. They were very definitive about. I'll get down we're watching the what's going on with the Russian connections right now the FBI. The House of Representatives and the senate old investigating possible links between rushed a trump associates and Russia. Okay. The Intel chairman units that seems to be wait for a little bit on his position it doesn't seem to know what he's doing. I had a lot of people are going to be interviewed it would gonna learn a lot. Now. Not since what do gate have I seen anything like this in terms of corruption possible corruption at god and government. Do you think that trump will end up like Nixon did. You know yeah I think it's too early to say what it was an early this technical gas. Are you suddenly direction assistant rhetorical question. Oh look. So the good if it is found that his folks were coordinating with the Russians and knew about the hack and knew about the leaks that were to come. That is a very serious thing and then the question will be the Watergate question. What did the president know and when did it all went back and I think that will be a major crisis and it's going to be tough for the congress remember back in. In in the Watergate year there were there were Republicans like Howard Baker. Who were very much involved in that process and put the country ahead of party yet and it's incumbent on on both. Sides to do that because this goes to the heart of what democracy is all I get right now I see only sips traction on that hot I don't see any of that well you know that it shouldn't the new -- thing was weird you know I mean. I all of us who raise kids. Would advise him that if you. If you sound guilty and you look guilty people are gonna think you're guilty and he and that was a strange. Interlude and he really set there. Pro back the senate is on a different track and they seem to be. Coordinating and most of the best thing would be if they are war a National Commission. And that was free of some of this politics that could really shine a bright white on the asset. A lot of Democrats and and conservatives like myself are calling for us to remove himself from this investigation is a lot of strange behavior that went on secretly visited the White House and well tonight's. I went and got information and then ran back to give it back to them I think he goes after he doesn't tell his own Intel committee but instead tell us that the president and the media. Very strange behavior that people are saying I noticed it was on the transition committee and or if all the transition team he has so is he -- is he protecting the president or can he be an advocate for actual transparency in front. I view is that this was right after the day after the hearing where Komi testified. Admiral Rogers testified and it was a terribly embarrassing hearing for the president or state. They've knocked down this whole notion of the bugging and I think noon as was my my my furious he may have been whistled and then told you know what. Because now he's also canceled a public hearing that promised have other revelations so I think he's. You know he's under maximum suspicion here and he's gonna continue to be under pressure until he read deems himself by showing that he can run. A o'clock clean investigation. Williams first talking about a little earlier about a bomb she became an official federal employee. She's now advising her father along with her husband chaired pictured. Do you think this is a problem magic in regard to nepotism. Well look there's there's nepotism issues there's conflict of interest issues and there's one more issue you know I know her and I know Jared and they're both very bright. Skillful people. But they've they've never been in government. No one around the president in a senior role has ever been in government the president's never been in government never served in military. First time in history that that's happened and you know this is one of the reasons why the first seven days have been so colan evidence. And I'm not sure that she's gonna add to that but I will say this if the one thing she does his. If she says Deb when we just hold that cell phone for you. Yeah. It's a great service to the Catholic outlets OT about health care. Because for the last two years we've been hearing from president trump about repeal and replace. The Republicans had seven years to come up with some sort of replacement. It didn't happen. Why was this such a failure. It was such a failure because the Affordable Care Act in many ways was such a success he. The fact is it's changed a lot of lives every point. We'll have health care who didn't have health care. And new benefits under insurance policies that are basic to health care and Medicaid expanded. That's why so many Republican governors were opposed to a law. This was a collision of a political slogan with practicality with the reality. In people's eyes I'll tell you I was there when the Affordable Care Act and we can debate before we'll Carrick and there's no doubt that it can be improved and it should be improved. A I'm a total chronic illness epilepsy. I almost went bankrupt when I was a young newspaper reporter because she had seizures ten a day Jeddah take medication. And the medication and and other stuff was costing us a thousand dollars a month out of pocket and I was making 3538000. Thousand I remember the terror associated with that I cried the night the Affordable Care Act passed because I knew other families wouldn't have to go through what my fans when. Now saying that there will be some sort of health care deal and that's gonna be easy to get that done. Ship out earlier sometimes he's a little inconsistent. Sometimes as for the next RAI. I don't see the impetus for that right now the Republican Party is divided the democratic party's enraged. And it's very hard to put this together in a coherent way so I don't see. I don't see that happen. He says he wants the Democrats to help them now is set at Apollo chefs know and that O'Brien well I don't stay a step forward in the way that Democrats felt comfortable with he will lose a lot of Republican votes from peoples who. Don't want to its continue to Affordable Care Act of Phyllis publicly don't believe the government should be involved in helping to two provide. Health care access to Health Net and people. I wanna get your special quickly he and yet a CNN special ax filed airing this Saturday which is mean after your podcast yet you sit down with your political rival John McCain and we sneak peek take a look. You know the thing about Ted Kennedy the reason you guys what's menace to each other oh please pride and we would fight and we would. And then we would finish the fight would put her arm around each other I've never forget -- we did pretty good dimly you know I mean he was. Because he divorced personal relationships. And personality. From the issues so therefore. If you were friends who lives Ted Kennedy. That friendship who worked. I. To get back into our politics it is it'll and it.

Speaking at Wednesday's press briefing, Republican Senator Richard Burr said that the probe was in the initial stage and it was too early to draw any conclusions. © AP Photo/ Alex Brandon Trump Trying to Shut Down Russia Probe in House Intel Committee - US LawmakerRadio Sputnik discussed the issue with Robert Guttman, academic expert in US politics and founder and director of the Center on Politics and Foreign Relations at George Mason University. According to Guttman, US media are too actively manipulating the subject of the alleged Russian interference in the US election, although no evidence has been found so far. When asked if there was any evidence of Russian meddling, US Senator Richard Burr evaded the question replying that the investigation is not over yet. According to Burr, seven full-time professional staff members are working to assess intelligence data related to the alleged Russian involvement in the election hacking. "The FBI is doing the main investigation, and they will keep everything private and secret until they come out and find it — which could be a year or six months we don't know," the expert told Radio Sputnik. At the same time, Guttman believes that "the average American is more interested in jobs than Russian interference." "Now politics is being dominated by what is happening in Russia and Russian connection. But people who voted for Trump basically voted for him because he could get them jobs, rebuild the economy…. So this "Russia thing" is kind of odd because the majority of people don't care that much about what is going on in Russia. If we find evidence, people's attention may change. But right now, their attention is [directed] to the country," the expert noted. US media outlets have repeatedly accused Trump and his associates of alleged links with Russia, which could have contributed to the politician's victory in the recent presidential election. Russian officials have denied the allegations of meddling in the US election and the White House had also reaffirmed that there was no corresponding proof. "Russia shouldn't even be in the news, it shouldn't dominate the news. We have a president for whom foreign policy was not a strong suit. When he was a candidate, he was talking about defeating ISIS and working with Russia. Other than that, he was basically building a wall against Mexico and immigrants and rebuilding the infrastructure. So, we have a domestic policy president. 90 percent of what he talks about and the reason why he was elected is jobs, creating jobs for Americans. And now we have all these possible scandals because something may have or may have not happened with Russia," the expert concluded. Earlier, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the continuous probe about a Russian collusion with Donald Trump would affect the bilateral relations between the two countries. He also stressed that the investigation is Washington's long-running internal discussion, which Moscow would like to abstain from. ...

Ethernet switch merchant silicon investments in the 10 Gbits/second space were very limited, with Fulcrum (Intel) being the most famous vendor to battle Broadcom’s dominance in the market. Cavium, with its acquisition of Xpliant in late 2014 sparked new interest. Now Barefoot, Innovium, a resurgent Marvell, Mellanox, Centec, as well as others with yet unannounced products have joined Cavium and Broadcom to chase the merchant silicon market in the data center. The Ethernet switch merchant silicon market has become far more attractive to vendors for two reasons. First, the cloud is the fastest growing segment in data center switching and about to become the market’s largest segment. There is an allure in chasing after business from Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft.  Second, merchant silicon products are expanding their scope beyond traditional data center switching and into transport networks that connect data centers together, commonly referred to as the DCI market. Cloud providers are looking for one unified class of product to become their data center core and transport solutions. Transport networks represent a significant expansion of the total addressable market. Silicon providers and system vendors see this transport market as 100% green field and as a higher ASP opportunity than the leaf/spine (top-of-rack) market which has become highly commoditized. Over the past three years, most Ethernet switch platforms that have come to market have used merchant silicon (see chart above). Even Cisco’s Nexus 9000 family launched with merchant silicon. It wasn’t until late 2016 that Cisco began ramping its own Nexus ASIC. At the same time, Juniper took a similar strategy of using its own ASIC in the QFX10K.  This has caused the market for merchant silicon to temporarily plateau, but we believe the longer term trend remains and that the growth portions of data center networking will deploy more merchant silicon compared to the declined enterprise segment. With the ecosystem around 25/100 Gbits/s mostly filled out and the major supply constraints mostly behind the industry, it’s time to look forward as to what is next. The market for merchant silicon is about to undergo two significant inflection points. First, cloud customers are each planning on adopting next generation silicon at different rates. This is an opportunity and threat to the supply chain. The opportunity is clear, there are several technology insertion points at each cloud account over the next several years where there is limited benefit to the incumbent. The threat is that the supply chain beyond the system and merchant silicon companies in under pressure, especially on the optics side. Simply put, there are too many intermediate steps between now and 400 Gbits/s for each supplier to invest and offer everything. The go-to-market for merchant silicon will also undergo several inflection points by 2020. First, merchant silicon vendors will have to engage directly with cloud customers to directly show how they differentiate. Getting products to market will require using traditional switch vendors and direct ODMs as most cloud providers procure product through both.  The merchant silicon vendors will then have to decide how to expand into the tier-two cloud, telco service providers and enterprise space in order to reach sufficient volumes. We estimate that it will take at least 10 percent share in the merchant silicon market in order to have long-term viability which is a market larger that winning just one or two large cloud accounts. --Alan Weckel is founder and technology analyst at 650 Group, focusing on the data center, the cloud and the Internet of Things.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 30, 2017 at 2:30PM At Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Technology and Manufacturing Day, hosted on March 28, the company disclosed a whole bunch of information about current and future manufacturing technologies. One of the more interesting disclosures the chipmaker made was the announcement of a new, low-cost technology that it calls 22FFL. The technology, Intel says, is "the world's first FinFET technology for low power [Internet of Things] and mobile products." Let's take a closer look at the technology and the business rationale for why Intel is bothering to develop it in the first place. A hybrid of 22-nanometer and 14-nanometer tech In terms of physical dimensions and performance, 22FFL can be described as a "hybrid" of the company's 14-nanometer tech and its 22-nanometer tech. As seen from the dimensions that Intel has provided for the technology, it's closer in terms of chip area/density to the company's older 22-nanometer tech than it is to the company's current cutting edge 14-nanometer technology derivatives. Image source: Intel. From a performance and power perspective, however, 22FFL appears far better than the old 22-nanometer tech that Intel introduced back in early 2012. Intel says 22FFL offers chip designers two transistor options: high-performance transistors and low-leakage transistors. Image source: Intel. As Intel explains, the high-performance transistors are suitable for use in portions of the chip that demand high performance (for example, CPU cores) and can deal with higher-leakage power, or what Intel calls "wasted power" in a glossary on its website, in exchange for higher performance. The low-leakage transistors, Intel says, are better fits for less performance-critical "always-on always connected circuits." The high-performance transistor options available in 22FFL, Intel claims, offers drive currents like what its state-of-the-art 14-nanometer++ technology does -- at least in the range within which 22FFL can operate. As a chart that Intel provides shows, the performance of 22FFL's high-performance transistors dramatically exceeds the high-performance transistors of its original 22-nanometer tech. Image source: Intel. The low-leakage transistor option, Intel says, "provides the lowest leakage transistors for any mainstream technology," though the company didn't offer hard data comparing its 22FFL with other commercially available technologies. Both high-performance and low-leakage transistors, Intel says, can be used on the same chip design. For both internal and external use Intel is first and foremost an integrated design manufacturer, or IDM -- which means the company both designs and manufactures its own chip designs. I suspect that 22FFL will be used extensively across Intel's own product portfolio. However, the company appears very interested in trying to get third-party chip vendors to use 22FFL as well. Indeed, the company says the market for "leading-edge" foundry -- that is, contract chip manufacturing -- was around $23 billion in 2016. Intel defines "leading edge" as 28-nanometer technology or more advanced. Image source: Intel. Intel is courting mobile-applications processor makers as well as vendors of chips targeted at Internet of Things applications with 22FFL -- not so coincidentally, the applications that require leading-edge technologies. The company claims that 22FFL is "cost competitive with other 28/22 [nanometer] planar technologies," supports a "wide range of advanced analog/RF devices," and can deliver "die area scaling better than industry 28/22 [nanometer] technologies." The technology is expected to achieve "production readiness" in the fourth quarter of this year, meaning that we'll start to see products using it in the marketplace in 2018. At this point, it's too soon to tell how much success Intel will have in getting third parties to use it, and frankly, it's hard to even guess at how much success Intel might be able to find as a contract chip manufacturer. Intel has been advertising its foundry services for a while now, and it still hasn't seen serious revenue flowing in from said services. However, if Intel can manage to capture a reasonable amount of share here over the long term, then that could be an interesting potential growth vector for the company.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Scott Applewhite US House Intel Committee Chair Got Data on Trump Wiretapping From Whistleblower - RyanWASHINGTON (Sputnik) — The New York Times claimed that Ezra Cohen-Watnick of the National Security Council and Michael Ellis, a national security lawyer with the White House Counsel's Office, were connected to the release of the materials related to the surveillance of Trump’s transition team to Nunes. The report, however, did not specify what role each of the individuals played. Earlier in the day, House Speaker Paul Ryan said that Nunes learned about the surveillance of President Donald Trump's presidential campaign team from a whistleblower source. On March 22, Nunes told reporters that the information about Trump team was "incidentally collected" during the transition period. Following the announcement, the intelligence committee chair visited the White House and briefed the US president on the findings. Later, Nunes explained why he decided to brief the press and US President Donald Trump on new intelligence information before telling the ranking Democrat on the committee. © REUTERS/ Henry Romero McCain Urges Nunes to Explain Visit to White House Prior to Briefing Trump on WiretappingThese actions triggered immediate criticism of the panel's members, who have not been notified in advance about the additional documents related to Trump's wiretapping claim. On Tuesday, several prominent Democrats called on congressman Nunes to recuse himself from the probe into alleged Russia's election interference. On March 4, Trump took to Twitter to accuse Obama of having his Trump Tower headquarters' "wires tapped" prior to the 2016 presidential election, describing this as the former administration's "new low. The president went on to compare the alleged surveillance to McCarthyism and the Watergate scandal. The claims have been rejected by Obama's representative. The US House and Senate Intelligence Committees have found no credible evidence to support Trump's claims. ...

New game and BIOS updates promise to boost Ryzen performance by Wayne Manion  12:30 PM on March 30, 2017 The value proposition of AMD's Ryzen 7 lineup of eight-core processors in highly-threaded workloads is pretty clear-cut. It's harder to say the same about the CPUs' bang-for-buck in gaming when compared to Intel's Kaby Lake offerings. AMD has promised to work with game developers to improve performance of popular titles on Ryzen chips, and the company says progress has been made on this front. Additionally, AMD says it will soon ship microcode updates to motherboard vendors that should improve performance and prevent system instability in certain conditions. On the software front, AMD says it has worked with Stardock and Oxide Games to improve performance in technology-demo-slash-real-time-strategy-game Ashes of the Singularity, and with Valve Software to increase minimum-FPS performance in Dota 2. Setting aside the incomplete picture of performance provided by average FPS and minimum FPS figures, AMD says its tweaks increase average FPS in Ashes on Ryzen by somewhere between 15-30% depending on the type of test. Ryzen minimum frame rates in Dota 2 rose by almost 15% after some optimization work. PC Perspective tested the Ashes patch and saw performance jumps similar to AMD's claims on Ryzen chips. The patch didn't change performance on an Intel Core i7-6900K tested for comparison. We must note that Intel's chips still deliver the highest performance figures in Ashes, though, even after the Ryzen-focused update. AMD will soon issue a 1.0.0.4 microcode update for Ryzen CPUs, as well. This revision claims to decrease DRAM latency by up to 6 ns, prevent system instability when Ryzen chips execute "unusual FMA3" code, correct a clock speed reporting bug, and eliminate the need for the High-Precision Event Timer when using AMD Ryzen Master. AMD says BIOSes incorporating the new microcode will start showing up in early April, though update times will vary from boardmaker to boardmaker. The company goes on to say that another microcode update scheduled for release in May will "focus on overclocked DDR4 memory," which has been something of a sore spot for the platform.  If AMD can unlock similar performance gains in a wide variety of titles to those it's achieved in Ashes of the Singularity, the value proposition of all Ryzen chips in gaming workloads could improve quite a bit. Similarly, if the company can deliver on improved performance, stability, and compatibility through microcode updates, Ryzen will only become more appealing. Time will tell.

On Thursday, a day after the company revealed a slow start to 2017, it was just another retail stock being pummeled. Lululemon LULU, -23.44%  late Wednesday reported fourth-quarter earnings that were below Wall Street expectations and sales that were slightly above forecast. Crucially, however, it called for lower profits and sales for the current quarter, and on a conference call with analysts following the results, Lululemon’s executives blamed the early-year miss on a Spring collection that lacked depth and color. Wall Street’s reaction was swift, weighing in with at least two stock downgrades and several price target reductions. Shares were headed for their lowest close since December 2015, and their largest percentage decrease in 8 years. Read more: Will denim steal Lululemon’s thunder? Lululemon is taking responsibility for its miscues with its spring collection, but “a lot of questions need to be answered before we can gauge the viability of a sustainable recovery,” analysts at SIG Susquehanna said in a note to clients Thursday. They downgraded the stock to neutral, saying they’d rather “step to the sidelines until visibility improves.” The company is taking action to correct its issues, adding new colors to its assortments in an effort to drive sales growth. That is likely to strengthen e-commerce sales and trends as early as April, although the company still has to contend with slow bricks-and-mortar store traffic, they said. “We appreciate the various initiatives management is putting in place to reaccelerate revenue anddrive margin, but we are not fully convinced they will all work,” the Susquehanna analysts said. Analysts at Wells Fargo also nicked Lululemon’s stock with a downgrade, taking it to their equivalent of neutral from buy, saying the company’s fourth-quarter earnings report had uncovered “issues that are likely to create an overhang on the stock for the foreseeable future.” Related: Wal-Mart is beating the pants off Amazon in apparel, and it’s fighting to keep it that way The slowdown is being driven by both online and stores, and the company’s full-year guidance “could prove optimistic given macro pressures and lack of needle-moving levers to pull,” they said. 3-D printed clothing coming to a store near you?(4:27) A 3-D knit printer developed by Intel is among new technology at the National Retail Federation convention that will help retailers meet customers' immediate needs.

Photo: Intel “While there are still some attractive aspects” of Lululemon, such as its international expansion and “dominant” position within its core categories, the positives are largely offset by emerging risks, the Wells Fargo analysts said. They also lowered their full-year 2017 per-share estimate to $2.34 from $2.56. The company has called for net revenue in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion and per-share earnings between $2.26 to $2.36 for the full year. The FactSet expectations for fiscal 2017 were for EPS of $2.16 and sales of $2.3 billion.

Morgan kept their rating on the stock at buy, but lowered their price target to $66 from $78. The magnitude of Lululemon’s e-commerce slowdown and color and fashion miss may be transitory, but the company “has checked into “Show-Me” camp with inconsistent execution deserving a lower interim multiple,” the analysts said. Wedbush analysts also stuck with their buy rating on the stock. While first-quarter guidance was disappointing, most of the first-quarter downside is self-inflicted “and thus fixable,” they said. Moreover, the company remains on track for margin growth and expense control. That Spring collection with no colors? It was a dubious merchandising decision, the Wedbush analysts said, but the fact that the misfire played a meaningful role in the first-quarter slowdown suggests “performance can be improved as 2017 goes along—and executives noted that color should begin to hit the assortment in April.” Shares of Lululemon have declined nearly 25% in the past 12 months, compared with 15% for the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.29%  in the same period. The underperformance is more stark on a three-month basis, with Lululemon stock down 22% to the benchmark’s 6%.

The realities of the smartphone market mean that Intel's cellular modem technology -- at least in its current form -- will find limited success outside of Apple. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Mar 30, 2017 at 12:30PM In a recent note from Susquehanna Financial Group (via Barron's), analyst Christopher Rolland said that he and his team were "optimistic" that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) might be able to find business outside of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for its stand-alone cellular modems but noted that "Chinese handset vendors did not share [Susquehanna's] enthusiasm." Here's my take on why Intel just won't get any traction with its modems outside of Apple, no matter how good they are. Image source: Intel. Understanding the market A smartphone maker can opt to equip a smartphone with a stand-alone applications processor paired with a stand-alone cellular baseband processor, or it can choose to use a single chip that integrates the applications processor with the cellular baseband processor. In the early innings of the smartphone market, it wasn't uncommon to see both -- some smartphone makers would go with stand-alone baseband and applications processors, while others would pick the more integrated solutions. Today, for cost and space reasons, integrated solutions dominate the market. It's virtually impossible today to market stand-alone smartphone applications processors, and there's only one high volume smartphone customer that uses stand-alone cellular baseband chips -- Apple. Intel doesn't sell integrated solutions In the past, Intel had indicated that it aimed to both sell integrated applications processor/baseband solutions alongside stand-alone modems. However, the company has slashed its investments in mobile technology over the last couple of years (Intel says its investment in this area is down 55% over the last two years) and hasn't said much publicly about trying again to build such integrated parts organically. The chipmaker is attacking this market in a roundabout fashion by offering manufacturing services to companies like Spreadtrum, but it remains to be seen whether Intel can gain significant traction in the mass-market smartphone market (outside of Apple) this way. Intel could conceivably try to field organically developed integrated solutions into this market at some point, but given that Intel already tried, failed spectacularly, and pulled the plug on its efforts here, it's hard to imagine that smartphone vendors would be in a hurry to bet their businesses on Intel's product road map and execution. But the bottom line is that there's simply just not a market outside of Apple for stand-alone cellular modems, even if those modems are highly competent. The next step for Intel In the near to medium term, Intel's job will be to focus on trying to continue to build competent stand-alone modems to keep Apple happy. Apple buys enough chips, and Intel probably gets enough for each chip, that Intel could probably continue to justify modem development just with Apple's business. At some point, though, Intel is going to want to expand the total addressable market that it can address with its modem technology. Maybe another crack at the integrated smartphone applications processor market would be the right course of action, or perhaps it could partner with a third-party chipmaker to incorporate its modem technology into their own applications processors (a suggestion that's been thrown around about Apple, although I doubt that it would be interested in doing that). The point is that if Intel can consistently deliver great cellular modem technology, and if that technology has been "battle tested" inside of multiple generations of Apple iPhone models, then it would be a shame for the chipmaker to not find a way to get it into other smartphones and profit from it.   Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

(Youtube screen grab via MSNBC)    EXCLUSIVE: Ex-Obama Official Responds To Allegations She Spread Trump Intel [VIDEO] Chuck Ross Reporter 12:47 PM 03/30/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5563305 A former Obama administration official is responding in an exclusive interview with The Daily Caller to recent claims that she helped disseminate intelligence about Donald Trump and his advisers throughout the federal government. Evelyn Farkas, who served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia until 2015, says she had no hand in circulating actual intelligence, contrary to claims made this week by conservative media outlets, including Sean Hannity. “I had no intelligence whatsoever, I wasn’t in government anymore and didn’t have access to any,” Farkas said in an interview with TheDC on Thursday. Farkas, a former Clinton campaign adviser, found herself in the media spotlight this week after a video clip resurfaced of an interview she gave on March 2. In the interview, on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Farkas responded to a bombshell report in The New York Times laying out the Obama administration’s last-ditch efforts to preserve and disseminate intelligence that had been gathered on Trump advisers. The Times reported that the Obama officials spread the information throughout the intelligence community and various federal agencies to help ensure that as many people could view it as possible. The Obama loyalists also classified the information at relatively low levels so that more people could have access to it. (RELATED: Obama Admin Sabotaged Trump’s Transition To The White House) In her “Morning Joe” segment discussing the Times report, Farkas said that she too grew “very worried” after the election that intelligence gathered on Trump advisers would be squirreled away after Trump took office. “I was urging my former colleagues, and frankly speaking the people on the Hill, it was more actually aimed at telling the Hill people, get as much information as you can, get as much intelligence as you can, before President Obama leaves the administration,” Farkas said in the interview. In another interview on MSNBC later in the day, Farkas described a “frantic desire” within the Obama administration to preserve the intelligence. WATCH: Evelyn Farkas interview on “Morning Joe,” March 1. Though Farkas’ interview occurred a month ago, it bubbled up through conservative websites this week before being addressed by Hannity and conservative radio show host Hugh Hewitt. Hannity saw Farkas’ comments as evidence of a potential crime as well as a vindication of Trump’s claims that the Obama administration conducted surveillance against him and his advisers prior to the election. Trump made that claim on Twitter on March 4, days after the Times piece was published. While it does not appear that the Obama administration conducted surveillance directly on Trump or his advisers, U.S. intelligence officials have collected incidental intelligence, likely from conversations between foreigners discussed Trump & Co. “Did Obama officials commit a crime here?” Hannity asked during his show Wednesday night of Farkas’ statements. “It seems like she’s admitting the surveillance…that that took place of Trump transition team members. She’s admitting that they unmasked them because they’re Trump transition members,” he added. On Thursday, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus commented on Farkas’ claims during an interview with Hewitt. “It’s just an incredible statement,” Priebus said, adding that he discussed Farkas’ comments with White House press secretary Sean Spicer. “What it means and what she meant by that, and whether that has anything to do with the issues in regard to surveillance of Trump transition team members is something that we need to figure out this morning and throughout the day.” “A personal reaction is it’s, it’s almost, it’s so cavalier and unbelievable that I just wonder whether this person knows what the heck she’s talking about,” he added.

You may opt out at anytime. You also agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. But Farkas says that her comments have been misconstrued. She was not in possession of intelligence about Trump or his advisers, and she did not share documents with Congress, she told TheDC in a phone interview. “I had no intelligence whatsoever, I wasn’t in government anymore and didn’t have access to any,” said Farkas, who acknowledged that her work on Russian issues has made her hyperaware of the Kremlin’s activities. “I didn’t know what the smoke or the fire was, but I was nervous that maybe the right people in Congress weren’t being informed according to normal procedures.” Farkas, who is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and MSNBC contributor, said she reached out to Republicans and Democrats she knew on Capitol Hill in an effort to push them to ask for any intelligence that may have been gathered on Trump advisers. “I was getting the feeling that the people on the Hill weren’t briefed up, mainly because they weren’t bringing it up in conversations with me, and they were not concerned with what the Russians had done,” she says. “You guys need to be asking the White House to bring you all the information they have,” she says she told congressional staffers. “I could tell that there was something there because all I had to do was look at the faces of Obama people when the topic came up, and they wouldn’t talk about it so it was clear that it was super sensitive.” Farkas declined to reveal who she talked to on Congress. She did say that she was not a source for the New York Times article.

These tiny but speedy M.2 cache drives were first announced earlier this week, sporting 3D XPoint technology. Since then, ASUS has announced its plans to release a BIOS update to support it and today Gigabyte has joined in too. Today, Gigabyte announced that it would be releasing a BIOS update for its own 200 series motherboards in order to add support for Intel Optane Memory, which speeds up mechanical driver performance by acting as a cache for rapid access of frequently used files. Gigabyte seem quite excited by Intel’s latest storage boosting technology too, with its Vice President of motherboards, Henry Kao, going as far as to call it a “game-changer for the industry”. The update to enable Optane Memory support on Gigabyte and Aorus branded 200-series motherboards will be available on the relevant product pages for each board. KitGuru Says: We can expect a few more companies to come out and start supporting Optane Memory over the next couple of weeks.

There would be no Amazon, no eBay. No Reddit, no Intel. Google, Tesla, and Yahoo? Gone. And you can say goodbye to your iPhone. These are just a few of the biggest names, but half of all billion-dollar U.S. startups were founded by immigrants. Silicon Valley would simply not exist, and the United States’ position as a global tech leader might never have come to fruition. Under President Donald Trump, we are not far from this hypothetical. Trump’s immigration ban and H-1B visa restrictions will significantly harm the U.S. technology industry, diverting the steady, decades-old stream of foreign tech talent to international competitors. And there’s no country better positioned to welcome this diverse group of innovators than Trump’s northern neighbor: Oh, Canada. At the center of the country’s identity is Toronto — the fourth-largest city in North America. Boasting a diverse community, booming tech scene, and forward-thinking government, this city is the leading contender to welcome tech talent and become the next epicenter of innovation. A Culture of Inclusion It’s easy to talk in generalities when it comes to diversity and inclusion — but I’m actually a product of Canada’s welcoming stance on immigration. My family emigrated to Canada from Tanzania, East Africa. We fled political turmoil and settled in Canada to build a better life. It would also become the place where I eventually began to flourish as an entrepreneur. Related NATOSen. Rand Paul: Montenegro Joining NATO Is Against U.S. Interests NATO Sen. Rand Paul: Montenegro Joining NATO Is Against U.S. Interests Forty years later, Canada is still a beacon of hope for immigrants, an open society that is welcoming refugees in unprecedented numbers. Toronto was recently named the most diverse city in the world, and has become a cultural haven in which foreign entrepreneurs can pursue innovative ideas. In fact, it’s easier than ever for immigrants to work up north — capitalizing on Trump’s decision to delay H-1 B visas, Canada recently announced an expedited work permit process, allowing foreign talent to be approved for work in a short ten days. Toronto recognizes that diversity both breeds innovation and is good for business. As the EVP of Venture Services at a Toronto innovation hub, I’ve seen the power of diversity on the startup teams we are advising. Of the roughly 1,000 startups within our ecosystem, 54% have at least one foreign-born founder – a higher percentage than Silicon Valley. So, as America tightens its borders and retreats inward, diversity in cities like Toronto will flourish. Infrastructure for Innovation Toronto’s diverse community has fostered a rapidly growing startup scene. Recently named one of the world’s most innovative cities, Toronto is home to between 2,500 and 4,100 active tech startups, the world’s largest innovation hub, and world-class academic and research institutions. And with 150,000 full-time students enrolled in universities in the Greater Toronto Area — many focused on science and engineering fields — the region benefits from a robust pool of entrepreneurial and tech talent. Of course, this hasn’t always been the case: while Canada has historically been victim to a “brain drain” of academic talent emigrating to the U.S., Trump’s policies will undoubtedly lead to more talent staying in Toronto; and we may start seeing the reverse as Silicon Valley talent leaves to head north. University of Toronto has already seen a 70% increase in applications from American students following Trump’s win. As always, tech follows the money — Toronto’s rapidly developing venture capital community is setting record investment numbers. VC in Canada hit a 15-year high in 2016, with a total of $3.7 billion invested— a whopping 36% increase over 2015. I haven’t seen Canadian VC excel at this rate since the dot-com boom, and every day speak with investors from around the world looking to cash in on Canadian ventures. With names like Shopify and Hootsuite rivaling Silicon Valley successes, I can understand why they’re hedging their bets. The New Wave of Global Entrepreneurship Where investors see the most potential, however, is in ventures that scale — ventures that tackle tough problems and provide global solutions. And as someone who works with fellow immigrants every day, I believe that foreign entrepreneurs are more likely to develop these types of solutions, with the broadened worldview necessary to take on global issues. In fact, amongst our ventures with foreign-born founders — over 70% have some social purpose in mind, developing solutions in areas like healthcare and clean energy. A Syrian refugee creating an open approach to drug discovery. A Mexican immigrant developing digital solutions for mobility impairments. These are the breakthroughs I see from global entrepreneurs in Toronto every single day. While I believe that Silicon Valley once fostered this type of innovation, somewhere along the way it got stuck in a “move fast and break things” mentality, promoting innovation for innovation’s sake. They stopped caring about true progress and started caring about VC dollars — today, you’re more likely to see the Valley pump out a new photo editing app or subscription box before a clean energy solution or drug therapy. And with Trump’s new restrictive policies, fewer entrepreneurs will be able to come to the U.S. to build the globally impactful ventures that society truly needs. But as America shuts them out, Canada welcomes them in. Global entrepreneurs can find a home in Toronto — a city that sees beyond borders, and whose tech community leads the world with solutions in cleantech, biotech, and more. For all of Trump’s talk about bringing back jobs to America, he may actually be helping to send them to Canada. And just as it once did for my family, Toronto welcomes this talent with open arms.

But Ryzen motherboards are becoming more polished by the day, and AMD just detailed a significant update ahead of the April 11 launch of the Ryzen 5 series of CPUs. Mentioned in this article Asus ROG Crosshair VI Hero X370 motherboard $255.00MSRP $255.00View on Amazon Ryzen motherboard BIOSes rely on the AMD Generic Encapsulated Software Architecture, and AMD’s Rob Hallock says AMD’s pushing an AGESA update to its motherboard partners soon. Its tweaks are expected to appear in AM4 motherboard BIOS updates in early April. [ Further reading: AMD Ryzen motherboards explained: The crucial differences in every AM4 chipset ] [ Further reading: These 20 absorbing PC games will eat days of your life ] Here’s what you’ll find in the update, verbatim from Hallock’s post: “We have reduced DRAM latency by approximately 6ns. This can result in higher performance for latency-sensitive applications. We resolved a condition where an unusual FMA3 code sequence could cause a system hang. We resolved the “overclock sleep bug” where an incorrect CPU frequency could be reported after resuming from S3 sleep. AMD Ryzen Master no longer requires the High-Precision Event Timer (HPET).” That last bullet point is especially notable for gamers who want to squeeze more performance out of their Ryzen PCs. Overclocking your system and disabling HPET are two key tricks to maximizing Ryzen PC performance, so having AMD’s own Ryzen Master overclocking software dependent upon HPET was a bit of a bummer. No more! Brad Chacos The April AGESA update is just another step in the path for Ryzen, not a final destination. AMD’s also planning an update for the first week of April that will improve how Ryzen behaves with Windows 10’s Balanced power plan, hopefully negating the need to set your system to the more power-hungry High Performance plan to squeeze the most out of your games. Another future update targets how finicky AM4 motherboards are with high-speed RAM, as Hallock explained in March: “We intend to issue updates to motherboard partners in May that will enable them, on whatever products they choose, to support speeds higher than the current DDR4-3200 limit without refclk [reference clock] adjustments.” Mentioned in this article AMD Ryzen 7 1700 Processor with Wraith Spire LED Cooler $329.99MSRP $329.00View on Amazon And after suffering from availability woes since Ryzen's launch, many AM4 motherboards—including coveted X370 models—appear to be in stock in greater numbers at online retailers as of today. Get them while you can, folks. Ryzen performance boosts aren’t coming from motherboard tweaks alone, though. AMD’s working with developers to optimize performance in PC games. This very morning, Ashes of the Singularity released a beta patch that increases Ryzen performance by roughly a third in PCWorld’s testing. Hot damn. The company’s also inked a multi-game deal with Bethesda—the studio behind Doom, Fallout, Elder Scrolls, Prey, and more—to optimize performance on AMD hardware, while “fast changes” to Dota 2 helped Ryzen’s minimum frame rate increase substantially, AMD says. The impact on you at home: Improved performance and ease-of-use for Ryzen systems is a huge impact indeed. New computing platforms always have rough edges that are sanded out over time, which is why it’s important in this specific scenario to ignore the common wisdom of ignoring most BIOS updates. You want those quality-of-life upgrades. PCWorld’s guide to updating your PC’s BIOS can help walk you through the process.

Ford's Michigan investment Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Pin Share On email Share On email Share On link Share On link Share This Link Alan Diaz / AP Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Pin Ford announced on Tuesday the company would invest $1.2 billion in three facilities in Michigan where it will build trucks and SUVs, and store electronic data. President Donald Trump took to Twitter to link the news to his efforts to increase manufacturing by automakers within the US. "Big announcement by Ford today. Major investment to be made in three Michigan plants. Car companies coming back to U.S. JOBS! JOBS! JOBS!" he tweeted early Tuesday. Presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway also heralded the news on Twitter, suggesting Trump deserved credit: "Two weeks after @POTUS met with auto execs...Ford plans ‘significant’ investments in 3 plants," she tweeted. The problem? The investment announced on Tuesday actually stemmed from a 2015 deal negotiated between Ford and the United Auto Workers union. Under that 2015 collective bargaining agreement, Ford committed itself to investing $9 billion in US plants with the expectation of creating or retaining 8,500 jobs across a number of states, including Michigan. "The majority of what was announced today is part of the 2015 UAW contract," Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker told BuzzFeed News via email. "The $850 billion at Michigan Assembly Plant was part of the contract, as was the Romeo Engine Plant. The $200 million data center was not part of the UAW contract, but it wouldn’t be because there are no hourly jobs at the data center." When asked if the White House did anything during a meeting with automakers that may have led to the Michigan announcement, press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters, "I think there's been some regulatory effort and some commitments on the regulatory efforts going forward in the future that I think may have played a role." Felker also said that Ford reached out to the White House about its plans shortly before 8 a.m. ET — about 90 mins after Trump sent his tweet. 2.

Before he was even inaugurated as president, Trump took credit for stopping Ford from moving to Mexico — but the automaker had no plans of shuttering the factory. "Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico," Trump tweeted on Nov. 17. "I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!" While Ford had been planning to move the production of its Lincoln MKC to Mexico, the company said its Louisville plant was not set to close, or even lose any jobs, because of the expanded production of another vehicle, the Ford Escape. Instead, the Lincoln will now continue to be built in Kentucky. "We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve US competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,” a Ford statement from November said. 3. ExxonMobil's Gulf Coast investment Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Pin Share On email Share On email Share On link Share On link Share This Link Pool / Getty Images Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Pin Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former CEO of ExxonMobil. In early March, Trump and his administration pointed to a $20 billion investment by oil giant ExxonMobil on the US Gulf Coast as proof they were "bringing back the JOBS!" "This is something that was done to a large extent because of our policies and the policies of this new administration having to do with regulation and so many other things," Trump said in a video address. "I said we would bring back jobs. This is one example of it." "@POTUS promised to bring back jobs to America," Vice President Mike Pence tweeted. "Today's news is further evidence of the country's spirit of optimism, boosting job growth." But statements from both the White House and Exxon also contained the following important disclaimer about Exxon's Growing the Gulf program: "Investments began in 2013 and are expected to continue through at least 2022." 4. Charter Communications' hiring plans Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Pin Share On email Share On email Share On link Share On link Share This Link Jeff Roberson / AP Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Pin In an Oval Office event on March 24, President Trump and Charter Communications CEO Tom Rutledge announced the company would invest $25 billion in the US and commit to hiring 20,000 American workers over four years. But in April 2016, the company had said it would hire 20,000 employees if regulators allowed it to purchase Time Warner Cable. The deal was approved and finalized last spring. "We've already begun insourcing efforts for the new company," Rutledge said on a company call in August. "The process of insourcing will take several years and will require that we hire 20,000 people." On that same August call, Rutledge said the company was building a call center in McAllen, Texas — a facility Trump also pointed to in his Oval Office "announcement" in March. A Charter spokesperson maintained to BuzzFeed News that while the company had previously spoken of "plans" to hire 20,000 new workers, it hadn't formally "committed" to doing so until this March. 5. Intel's Arizona factory Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Pin Share On email Share On email Share On link Share On link Share This Link Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Pin President Donald Trump and Intel CEO Brian Krzanich in the Oval Office in February. Speaking alongside President Trump at the White House on Feb. 8, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich announced a $7 billion investment in a semiconductor factory in Chandler, Arizona, which he said would employ 3,000 high-wage workers as part of a total of more than 10,000 long-term jobs in the state. "We’re very happy and I can tell you the people of Arizona are very happy,” Trump said of Intel’s announcement. But Krzanich first announced the Chandler factory, dubbed Fab 42, back in 2011 during a visit to an Intel facility by President Obama. Intel said then the company aimed to finish construction of the factory in 2013. "Fab 42 was originally announced in 2011,” a spokesperson for Intel told BuzzFeed News in a statement. “We delayed completion to ensure Fab 42 came online when we expected sufficient demand. We’re making this investment now in anticipation of the growth of our business.” 6. SoftBank's $50 billion US investment Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Pin Share On email Share On email Share On link Share On link Share This Link Andrew Harnik / AP Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Pin During the presidential transition, the CEO of Japanese technology giant SoftBank paid a visit to Trump Tower in New York City to announce meet with the then president-elect. Masayoshi Son, or "Masa," announced a $50 billion US investment would create 50,000 jobs over four years. The money, he said, would come from a $100 billion fund he created with Saudi Arabia in October 2016. "Masa said he would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!" Trump tweeted of the US investment. Many analysts, however, were skeptical of Trump's claim that SoftBank would not have invested in the US had he not won the election. "Those billions were likely to end up in the US no matter who won," according to a Wall Street Journal report. "SoftBank announced the $100 billion SoftBank Vision Fund nearly a month before the election, when most pundits expected Mr. Trump to lose. Given its size, the fund was likely to put most of its money in the US, still home to the world’s most-promising technology companies." Jun Tanabe, who works at JPMorgan Securities in Tokyo and analyses Soft Bank, told the Washington Post he believed Masa was trying to build a good relationship with Trump. "[Masa] must have intended as much as half of the Vision Fund to go to the US, as he’s aware that there are great companies in Silicon Valley. But he chose this time to announce it as Trump is now going to be the next president," Tanabe said. Softbank, which owns Sprint and has invested in BuzzFeed, has pushed to have Sprint merge with T-Mobile to create a telecommunications company that could better compete with AT&T and Verizon. Such a merger would require approval from federal regulators. Matthew Zeitlin, Hamza Shaban, Claudia Koerner, and Salvador Hernandez contributed reporting.

As James hugs a teammate in celebration, and the camera circles in slow motion, the face of a crying baby is super-imposed over his own. James has shown real tears on the floor before — most famously last June after carrying Cleveland to its first pro sports championship since 1964. He’s been accused of whining by opposing fans while winning three NBA titles and advancing to the Finals six straight seasons. Intel wants to showcase 360-degree technology that allows fans to view games from every angle. The 30-second commercial with James will debut Saturday during the Final Four. The company says it wants to “draw a parallel between our high-performance brand and this high-performing athlete.” Read the latest on Donald Trump's first 100 days in office.

(AMD) Stock Will Hit New Highs in Weeks Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock Is a Buy, But Only If … View All Posts I’ve been keeping a close eye on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) over the last couple of months, and that has a lot to do with one of my primary strategies. Source: AMD Those of you who have followed my advice in the past know that I like to use a top-down approach to finding investment opportunities in the market. This allows me to focus on broader industry trends, then dig down deeper to identify specific groups and stocks that are outperforming their peers in the current environment. This strategy treated my subscribers and me well over the years, and it’s one reason I’m keeping watch over AMD stock. We talked about this stock back in February. Advanced Micro Devices was up more than 600% over the past year and had just powered through $15 for the first time since 2007. I wasn’t a buyer there — in fact, I had said to expect a near-term top. But I did note that it could provide a technical swing-trade opportunity if it pulled back, bounced off $12.60 and traded in the $13 area. Given the recent chart action, I believe we’re seeing that now. AMD Stock Chart AMD hit a multiyear high of $15.55 on Feb. 28 before dipping more than 20% to test support at its 50-day moving average (the blue line). Support held, and while the shares fell to a low of $12.38 on March 6, they were able to rebound to close the day at $13.04. That was the technical signal I was waiting for, and with Advanced Micro Devices only slightly higher today, I now view it as a buy given the potential for the market, sector and stock to hit new yearly highs in the coming weeks. The tech industry is outperforming right now, and I remain bullish on it looking out into the second half of 2017. One of my favorite groups within the sector is semiconductors, and that’s what brings me to individual stocks like AMD, which continues to be a fan favorite. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Gears Up for War While the fundamentals remain an issue here (AMD stock is overvalued), I do expect money to pour into semiconductors as a whole, and Advanced Micro in particular in the near-term. Momentum is behind the stock, and the chart remains bullish, so I believe buying near the 50-day MA provides a high reward-to-risk opportunity. For those of you who like to implement a strict risk management strategy, I’d recommend a tight 2% stop-loss below the 50-day moving average. This will help keep any potential losses to a minimum.

Roughly a decade after founding Mobileye, whose camera-based sensor chips and software systems are helping to develop self-driving cars, Shashua set up OrCam, which uses a camera mounted on eyeglass frames to help the visually impaired interact with their surroundings. OrCam's system can read newspapers, street signs and recognize common items, dictating words into the user's ear. The company completed a $41 million investment funding round last month that values the company at $600 million. "Sales targets for 2017 are four times more than 2016," Shashua told Reuters. "By the end of 2018 the revenue, the profit, of the company will be at such a level, together with the ability to forecast, that it's good enough for an IPO." The listing would either be on Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange, he said. The company would not provide further financial details. The Intel-Mobileye deal, announced on March 13, is expected to close within nine months and will result in Intel's Automated Driving Group being integrated into Mobileye and based in Israel, with Shashua, Mobileye's chairman and chief technology officer heading up the combined group. Though most of his time will be focused on Mobileye, Shashua doesn't see that detracting from his efforts to prepare OrCam for a listing, although commentators have questioned how easy it will be able to divide up his time. "I'm going to get more responsibilities as folding in Intel's assets in autonomous driving and leading the combined effort, but I believe that this is not going to change anything in terms of the time I spend at OrCam," he said. Intel has also invested $6 million dollars in OrCam. (Editing by Greg Mahlich) Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

According to Circa, “dozens of times” last year, the intelligence reports identified Americans who were directly intercepted talking to foreign sources or were the subject of conversations between two or more monitored foreign figures. Circa reported sometimes the Americans’ names were officially “unmasked”, “other times they were so specifically described in the reports that their identities were readily discernible.” Among those cleared to request and consume unmasked NSA-based intelligence reports about US citizens were Mr. Obama’s national security adviser Susan Rice, his CIA Director John Brennan and then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch. It was reported that some of the intercepted communications from last November to January involved Donald Trump’s transition Team members, or foreign figures’ perceptions of the incoming President and his new administration. Intercepts involving congressional figures also have been unmasked on occasion for some time, Circa reported. The NSA is expected to turn over logs to congressional committees detailing who consumed reports with unmasked Americans’ identities from their intercepts since the Summer of Y 2016 the report stated. And the data will become a Key focus of the Russia election meddling probe of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees. The news outlet noted that President Trump is seeking vindication for alleging that Mr. Hussein-Obama ordered that he be “wiretapped” aka survailed at Trump Tower during the Presidential campaign, a claim that has been refuted. Circa writes, “Any proof Obama aides were using NSA-enriched intelligence reports to monitor his transition on the world stage could embolden the new President.” “But perhaps the most consequential outcome of the new revelations is that it may impact the NSA’s primary authority to intercept foreigners: Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is up for renewal at the end of the year,” Circa reported.

Tech giants like Intel and Apple say the Eastern District of Texas, within the federal 5th Circuit, has become a haven for frivolous patent lawsuits, with favorable rulings often handed down to litigants that would lose elsewhere in the country.  ADVERTISEMENT In 2015, 43.6 percent of all U.S. patent cases were filed in the East Texas court, located far from the nation’s tech hubs. Those tech companies are now taking the issue to the Supreme Court, filing legal briefs in a separate patent lawsuit before the justices. But other major players in the industry, including Ericsson, are lining up on the opposite side, defending the Texas court and its right to hear patent cases. The divide has made the case TC Heartland v. Kraft Heinz crucial for the tech industry. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Monday and a ruling is expected this summer. In the case, Kraft filed a patent infringement suit against Heartland, which makes zero-calorie sweeteners, claiming its Refreshe brand copied Kraft’s MiO product. Kraft filed the suit in federal court in Delaware, but Heartland sought to move it to Indiana, its home state. Heartland noted that it sells few of its products in Delaware and has no offices there. But federal courts generally give companies broad discretion in picking the court venue or forum where they take their case, usually allowing any district in which a product is sold. A lower court denied Heartland’s request, which the company is appealing at the Supreme Court. A case pitting two food companies against each other seems an unlikely lawsuit to spark the interest of Silicon Valley. The question of where patent suits can be filed, though, is one with high stakes for the industry. Critics say that so-called patent trolls, companies that hold patents but don’t manufacture any products themselves, have flocked to the Eastern District of Texas, filing cases and winning big-dollar judgments. A ruling for Heartland could boost Silicon Valley and make it easier for them to move patent lawsuits to federal courts in California and other states. The fight has left tech companies divided. Companies such as Dell, Oracle, Intel and Adobe have all filed briefs in support of Heartland. “Forum shopping is a particularly egregious strategy patent trolls use to tip the scales of justice in their favor,” said Abigail Slater, general counsel at the Internet Association, a trade group including Amazon, Microsoft and Twitter, which filed a brief. “By selecting sympathetic courts, trolls are able to extract increased settlements from innocent businesses, large and small.” But other tech companies, including Ericsson, want judges to keep the current rules in place. They say it’s good to have one court handle a number of patent cases, arguing that court would have expertise in dealing with those issues. “Patent cases are complex, and the courts that hear most of them — including the Eastern District of Texas — have become particularly skilled at patent law,” Ericsson wrote in its brief. That argument also has strong support from drugmakers that have sought to consolidate medical patent cases in a few courts. They note that retired Judge T. John Ward of the Eastern District created rules to streamline the patent litigation process, limiting the length of proceedings and the size of filings. But tech companies on the other side aren’t sold. They say current rules give those filing lawsuits an unfair advantage to pick favorable courts. “Litigants have few tools to check forum-shopping. Defendants ... are rarely able to move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, even if they have few contacts with a forum,” the Business Software Alliance, a trade association, wrote in its brief. Highlighting the divide, some tech trade groups declined to comment on the issue, noting that their members are on opposite sides. During Monday’s hearing, the justices directly raised the issue of the Texas court. Kraft’s lawyers tried to argue that tech patent cases weren’t relevant, but Justice Elena -Kagan dismissed that idea. “The complaint is that it allows a kind of forum shopping, right? That it — you — lets you go down to Texas where we can get the benefit of a certain set of rules,” she said. Kagan noted an earlier decision that said lawsuits could be filed where defendants were incorporated. “For 30 years, the Federal Circuit has been ignoring our decision and the law has effectively been otherwise,” she said. Justice Anthony Kennedy questioned the role of “generous jury verdicts” in the debate. The fight also has the attention of Washington, where both parties have pushed for patent reform in recent years. Former President Obama called patent trolls one of the “biggest” problems facing tech. Sen. Orrin HatchOrrin HatchWhat if there’s no 'Nuclear Option' in the Senate? Senate votes to eliminate Obama-era retirement rule Battle over tech patents spills into Supreme Court MORE (R-Utah), the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and a former Judiciary panel chairman, said the issue had to be resolved. “That district in Texas has been a major preferential district for one side. It’s clearly biased and clearly not run correctly,” he told The Hill on Tuesday. But Hatch said he had no plans for legislation, and efforts at patent reform have stalled in recent years. In the House, Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), told Politico on Tuesday that if the justices keep the current rules in place, there would be a “huge” appetite for legislation.  For now, though, tech is looking to the justices for answers.

 People in the embattled House Intel chair's California district are cutting him some slack amid Trump-Russia turmoil Bryan Logan Mar. 30, 2017, 4:42 AM 2,614 facebook linkedin twitter email print The House Intelligence Committee chairman, Devin Nunes, on Capitol Hill on Friday. AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite The Republican leader of a bipartisan congressional investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election has himself become the story over the past week. Rep. Devin Nunes, the House Intelligence Committee chairman, has been roundly criticized by both Republicans and Democrats for what his fellow lawmakers have deemed "very strange" behavior amid the investigation — with his image apparently transitioning from bipartisan ally on the committee to someone who has "gone off on a lark by himself," as Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina put it to NBC on Tuesday. Nunes' constituents in his home district in California's Central Valley, however, are standing by him, Politico reported on Wednesday night. Nunes represents the 22nd congressional district, a farming region roughly halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles. He has held the office since 2003. According to Politico's David Siders, residents in Nunes' district are largely displeased not with Nunes' actions of late in Washington but with people who are grilling him. A local radio host said of the backlash against Nunes: "The way he's being lambasted and barbecued right now, how much worse can it get?" Nunes' grilling began last week when it became clear that he, through an anonymous source, had become privy to information involving President Donald Trump but unrelated to his committee's Russia inquiry. In a handful of press briefings and interviews, Nunes said he said he had found evidence that some members of Trump's transition team had been scooped up in possible surveillance activities after the election.

Mark Wilson/Getty Images The revelation threw the committee for a loop, as Nunes had withheld the information and his source from his colleagues. "I have no idea what it is he knows, but the Devin I knew doesn't do this type of stuff normally," Nunes' former press secretary Johnny Amaral said, according to Politico. "And if he does … I can only surmise that it's something big." Another local told Politico that Nunes deserved the benefit of the doubt: "I haven't seen anything that's really given me pause yet ... I have no idea the way it works in the intelligence community." Nunes' revelations last week appeared to ease Trump off of his ongoing, unsubstantiated allegation that President Barack Obama had eavesdropped on his operations before the election. That has led some critics to wonder whether Nunes, who was a member of Trump's transition team, had been improperly cooperating with an administration that is under federal investigation.

AP Photo/Rick Bowmer Bucking the trend The support Nunes appears to be receiving back home stands in contrast to the reception other Republican lawmakers have encountered in their home districts in the past couple of months. The Trump administration racked up controversies in rapid succession following the inauguration, leading to swift blowback in Republican congressional districts nationwide. The backlash, marked by raucous town-hall meetings and protests, pitted some GOP representatives against angry voters upset with the Trump administration's then-pending moves to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and Trump's frequent breaks from presidential tradition, like his refusal to publish his tax returns. Back in Washington, however, Nunes' behavior has not afforded him much goodwill. Republican and Democratic leaders have asserted that he has lost his credibility and is no longer fit to lead the House Intelligence Committee's Russia-Trump investigation. Nunes, however, says he's not going anywhere, saying on Wednesday that the investigation would happen "with or without" Democrats.

But Ian Morrison notes that the upcoming Linux 4.11 kernel fixes one of the last remaining issues: HDMI audio. Since Ubuntu 17.10 and other operating systems set to launch later this year will probably use the new kernel, that means there’s a better chance that you’ll be able to use the official install images to get Ubuntu (or other Linux-based operating systems) up and running with minimal fuss. Until then, Morrison has a workaround. Intel has pretty much given up on producing new Atom chips for low-power laptops, tablets, and notebooks. But if you’ve already got a Bay Trail or Cherry-Trail powered device that you’d like to use as a Linux PC rather than a Windows or Android machine, the latest kernel should be helpful. Among other things, it’ll let you let you plug your device into a TV using a single HDMI cable. Previously you would have either needed to apply a software patch or use a separate audio cable to deliver sound to a TV. Morrison has released a script that lets you build your own Ubuntu disc image by patching the official ISO with the latest Linux 4.11 kernel release candidate.

Fox and Friends, Trump's preferred source of daily disinformation, is 100% on board with this dreadful administration, carrying water for the troubled regime as often as possible. Steve Doocy framed it this way: Well the mainstream media seems obsessed with House Intel committee chair Devin Nunes' trip to the White House last week.... Where was the outrage when when the Obama White House had controversial guests, some of them invited hundreds of times? Of course Doocy claims that the Obama White House had its own list of controversial characters. The Fox "News" people can't see the false equivalency between President Obama's White House guests, whom they don't approve of, versus an unorthodox surreptitious trip to the White House that Nunes was supposed to be investigating. DOOCY: You know conveniently what they leave out of that network news coverage is the fact that apparently Devin Nunes went to the White House last week to talk to a "whistleblower" because he couldn't look at whatever secret information they had compiled (at) the intelligence community where he worked or else, you know, everybody would have known that he was a whistleblower. COLLINS: Exactly and Devin Nunes has said that he went to the White House to see these documents because he could not see them on Capitol Hill. Right so he had to go to the White House, while so we don't know what he saw, he felt it was important enough to share it with the public (but not his own intelligence committee). DOOCY: Of course there's this connection and this fascination by the mainstream media of all things Russian. During St.Ronnie Raygun's days, Russian collusion would have been considered a major sin, but since the Obama Presidency, anything white is alright? Sure seems that way. A Russian Ambassador coming to the White House an average of two to three times per year is not at all unusual. But what's interesting is there's a complete double standard. For instance, we put up a graphic of the Russian Ambassador to the United States. Serious, he visited the White House when Barack Obama was president at least 22 times and I don't remember the outrage. ↓ Story continues below ↓ COLLINS: Exactly this is the guy who Jared Kushner is coming under fire for having met with Jeff Sessions. Mike Flynn lost his job because he met with this guy and then misled the 'vice president' about it So just worth pointing out there's all this pushback for Jeff Sessions meeting with this guy when he was a senator but there's none for this guy showing up to the White House a lot of times. DOOCY: Absolutely, meanwhile we've got a picture of Doug Shulman. He's the IRS commissioner accused of targeting conservative groups. (He was exonerated of all charges). He went to the White House 161 times, and of course no coordination, and Bob Creamer, accused of inciting violence at Trump rallies, on the Obama White House visitors log 342 times. Creamer, husband of Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, was accused by the O'Keefe creeps and their Project Veritas cohorts, of Trump rally nonsense, hardly credible sources. Project Veritas also was able to plant an intern in Creamer’s Washington, D.C., office to secretly video workers. Creamer said she posed as the niece of the fake potential donor, who asked Creamer to give her a job. Naturally, they get their list of villains from unsavory liars like those at James O'Keefe's Project Veritas. and Tucker Carlson's Daily Caller. Are you surprised? DOOCY: The reason there is no outrage from the mainstream media is it looks like, I mean to a fair observer, that they are working with the Democrat Party (he had to get that insult in) to just simply discredit Donald Trump's presidency. No Steve, Donald is doing a fine job of that all by himself, he doesn't need any help. But Doocy is proud of their efforts to defend the indefensible Trump and his cohorts. He brags: There are other a lot of the other, you know, questionable figures who were at the White House, welcomed to Barack Obama's White House multiple times and I just think it's worth pointing out, and we have done just that. All right! Mission accomplished! They're missing the point here, given that the Obama White House didn't receive classified information about Benghazi from the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, but that's how they roll. Your mission of misinforming America is accomplished all day long. Thanks Rupey!

The Trident 3 Arctic features a frosty white look and boasts of a huge performance upgrade. MSI MSI just launched a “chilled” limited edition of its award-winning gaming PC, the Trident 3 Arctic. The frosty white look isn’t the only thing the Trident series’ newest addition has, it also boasts of a huge performance upgrade. The Arctic packs a customised GeForce GTX 1070 Gaming graphics card in ITX format and the latest Intel Kaby Lake processor to rise above its same-sized counterparts. With its small form factor, MSI’s latest offering is as compact as it gets, yet the insides account for high-performance PC gaming. The console-sized Trident 3 Arctic is the world’s smallest VR-ready system. It also allows users to connect a VR headset via a VR Link, the HDMI port on the front side of the unit that has MSI One-click to VR software support. It automatically enhances system performance and inhibits any program from impacting virtual reality immersion. The MSI Trident 3 Arctic uses Silent Storm Cooling 2 to uniquely keep itself as quiet and breezy as possible. By using separated chambers, the most essential heat-producing components in the system are individually cooled. Noisy fans and overheating hardware are going to be the least of its users’ concerns during gameplay. MSI’s new PC also features RGB Mystic Light, perfect for those who are into adding personal touches to their hardware. Users can straightaway change the colours and effects of the system’s front-facing LED lights with the use of the Mystic Light App or MSI’s Gaming Centre software. The MSI Trident 3 Arctic is set to be available in the US in early April and in Europe just before May. No official word has yet to be made regarding its availability in Australia. The limited edition gaming PC comes with a US$1,500 (AU$1,955) price tag.

Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) as the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. "This action is necessary in order to meet the public's expectation that Congress conducts an impartial investigation into a matter that threatens the core of our democracy," the CBC said in a statement on Wednesday. "Congressman Nunes' recent actions have caused him to lose the confidence of members of his committee, and, more importantly, the American people, and he can no longer be trusted with the information that the committee receives." ADVERTISEMENT The statement comes amid calls by Democratic lawmakers on the committee for Nunes to recuse himself from the panel's ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the presidential election and alleged ties between President Trump's campaign and Russia. Nunes stirred controversy last week when he announced without first consulting members of the committee that he had received evidence that the U.S. intelligence community had incidentally collected information on members of Trump's transition team. Shortly after the revelation, the California Republican went to the White House to brief Trump on the matter. But the evidence cited by Nunes has not been made public, and he has refused to reveal the source of the information, even to other members of the intelligence panel. It was also revealed on Monday that Nunes paid an unscheduled visit to White House property the night before he made his announcement, reportedly to view the evidence. That late-night excursion has led some Democrats to accuse Nunes of colluding with the White House on his announcement in an effort to vindicate Trump's claim that his presidential campaign was wiretapped by the Obama administration. Some have called for his recusal, while others, like committee member Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), have urged Ryan to remove him from his post.  Nunes has rebuffed pressure to recuse himself from the investigation and sought on Wednesday to cast blame for the House's floundering probe on Democrats, accusing them of not taking it seriously. The CBC also demanded an independent special commission to carry out the Russia probe, arguing that the standing intelligence panels in the House and the Senate cannot carry out the investigation. "Congress must create an independent, bipartisan commission to expose the full truth about any and all Trump-Russia connections and collusion," the statement reads. "The American people want and deserve to know if their government has been compromised by the Kremlin."

This is significant, because it shows Nunes may have had White House help in his ham-handed efforts to buttress (sort of) Trump’s false claim that former President Obama wiretapped his phones, and later, after admitting that didn’t happen, that Trump and associates were subject to U.S. surveillance. Nunes apparently cited the info he’d been given to suggest that Trump may have been wiretapped, though he later backed off of that assertion. If the White House provided that info, it adds to the case that Nunes is functioning as a defender of Trump rather than exercising oversight, by running his committee’s probe into Russian meddling and possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. Meanwhile, another big story is unfolding: Republicans on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is running its own probe, are beginning to treat this matter with the seriousness it demands — particularly since it is now becoming apparent that the House probe is devolving into absurdity. Indeed, a Senate Intel Committee hearing Thursday on Russian interference revealed some genuinely new — and stunning — information. It should worry Republicans just as much as Democrats — particularly the Republicans who continue to back Trump and Nunes. Here’s what happened. In a remarkable moment, one key witness, Clinton Watts, a senior fellow at the George Washington Center for Cyber and Homeland Security, bluntly informed Sen. Marco Rubio, who serves on the Intelligence Committee, that as one of Trump’s presidential primary opponents, Rubio “suffered from” Russian disinformation efforts. (Although Watts wasn’t specific about those efforts, later in the day Rubio charged that Russian hackers have conducted unsuccessful cyber attacks on his former presidential campaign staffers.) According to Watts (who was backed up by other witnesses who testified), the Russians have been using “active measures,” which are built on propaganda tactics that date back to Soviet times, to spread disinformation, fear, confusion, and chaos in multiple democratic countries, including the United States. These efforts include the use of visible Kremlin propaganda outlets, such as RT and Sputnik, to publish false news stories and conspiracy theories. Russian actors then deploy social media bots to spread these false stories far and wide. In the U.S., Watts said, the goal has been to provoke the Trump into repeating them or retweeting them to his millions of followers. In a moment that stunned the hearing room, Watts flatly stated that the president himself has become a cog in such Russian measures. When asked by Oklahoma Republican James Lankford, who appeared visibly dismayed, why, if Russians have long used these methods, they finally worked in this election cycle, Watts’ answer was extraordinary. “I think this answer is very simple and is one no one is really saying in this room,” he said. Part of the reason, he went on, “is the commander in chief has used Russian active measures at times against his opponents.” To buttress the claim that Trump (unwittingly or not) aided Russian disinformation efforts, Watts cited several instances. Among them: Trump’s citation of an apparently false Sputnik story at an October 2016 campaign appearance; his ongoing denial before and after the campaign of U.S. intelligence of Russian interference in the election; his claims of voter fraud and election rigging, which Watts said was pushed by RT and Sputnik; and Trump’s questioning of the citizenship of former President Barack Obama and even his primary rival Ted Cruz. Watts added that one of the reasons such tactics are working is that Trump and/or his surrogates have repeated some of the claims, further spreading them through social media accounts that are owned both by real people and bots. Thus, the disinformation is kept alive and gradually becomes more real and plausible. “Part of the reason active measures work is because they parrot the same lines,” Watts said. Republicans on the committee Thursday seemed to be grappling with the enormity of what this could mean — and, crucially, that this threat should not be seen through a partisan prism. Rubio questioned Watts about a series of such false news stories and hoaxes, including claims that a thousand Muslims had burned down the oldest church in Germany while shouting “Allahu Akbar,” that migrants had raped a German girl, and that the European Union planned to ban snowmen as racist. (If you’ve ever spent time on alt-right social media, there’s a familiar ring to these stories: they are exactly the sort of thing that gets spread and recycled, and reverberate as supposed evidence of the nefariousness of say, Muslims, or the overreach of “political correctness.”) Rubio seemed to suggest that he sees these tactics as intended to divide Americans from one another. “Aren’t we in the midst of a blitzkrieg, for lack of a better term, of informational warfare conducted by Russian trolls, under the command of Vladimir Putin,” Rubio asked, that is designed to divide Americans “politically, socioeconomically, demographically, and the like?” Watts confirmed that one of the aims of Russian active measures is to “play on ethnic divisions.” It’s not clear yet how much significance these revelations have, if any, to the ongoing probe into possible Russian-Trump campaign collusion. But the gravity of Thursday’s hearing — combined with the New York Times revelations — may prod Senate Republicans into stepping up, particularly to fill the vacuum caused by Nunes’ plummeting credibility.

(AKAM) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks If Tesla Inc (TSLA) Stock Has a Shot at a Breakout, This Is It Why Buying Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Stock Isn’t Nuts View All Posts Last week, chipmaker — and graphics processing specialist — Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) unveiled some encouraging but perhaps unusual news. That is, Chinese internet powerhouse Tencent Holdings Ltd (OTCMKTS:TCTZF) has selected Nvidia as the provider of its core hardware needed to make Tencent’s artificial intelligence ambitions a reality. Source: Shutterstock It was odd, simply because that’s not what Nvidia does. A more conventional computer processor and chipset name like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) or Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) would make more sense serving as the backbone for a new AI system. Thing is, this isn’t the first time owners of NVDA stock have heard of the company’s hardware being selected as the centerpiece of an artificial intelligence system. Just two weeks ago, Nvidia was tapped by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to power the next generation of its AI offering. What gives? As it turns out, traditional computer processors like Intel’s Core and Pentium CPUs or AMD’s Ryzen aren’t necessarily best-suited for the ultra-high-speed processing needs the rise of AI has created. Investors — and not just NVDA stock holders — would be wise to note the nuance, as AI is expected to become a $16 billion market by 2022, and grow to $36 billion by 2025. GPU Technology vs. CPU Technology Historically, while the hardware and firmware supporting a computer’s (or laptop’s) display screen was a key part of its performance, a device’s heart and soul was its processor, or CPU. It operates… well, everything at blazing fast speed, with more RAM (memory) helping out. The graphics processing unit, or GPU, wasn’t a dealmaker or a dealbreaker. As computers have become faster and more powerful, though, and performance expectations have swelled, GPUs have become very, very impressive, in many cases fully taking on the display-management role that was otherwise taken on by the CPU. Indeed, a GPU is some4thing of a mini-computer in itself… … and they’re very, very fast. That makes them perfect for high-speed artificial intelligence applications, where the quantity of computations is more important than the depth or complexity of those computations.

The PHLX Semiconductor Sector (NASDAQ:SOX) started March at 985 and has already flown above the 1,000 level thanks to product launches from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and a solid quarterly earnings report from Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU). Source: AMD Only Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stands out as the underperformer in this market. The takeover of Mobileye NV (NYSE:MBLY) for $15 billion will add risks for shareholders, as integrating such a big company will be fraught with uncertainties. Investors should stick with what they know best: Advanced Micro Devices’ CPU refresh, with the Ryzen 7 and the Ryzen 5 next, holds big promise for AMD stock. And as much as that promise seems priced in … it’s not. Ryzen 5 Targets the Mainstream Market The Ryzen 7 CPU, rebuilt from the bottom up, will compete with some of Intel’s high-end chips, including the i7 processor. AMD is targeting enthusiasts here, so the chip is still at the high end. Still, at least one outlet cut the price of Ryzen to 1700X to $370. As the price falls, AMD should be able to gobble up more share. Ryzen 5 targets a different market than the 7, however. Retailers are apparently releasing the chip weeks ahead of schedule, and at a price range that won’t cramp the ol’ wallet. On April 11, AMD will officially announce four Ryzen 5 chips: the 1400, 1500x, 1600 and 1600X. The chips will range from 4-cores to 6-cores and will cost just $169 to $249. At that price point, Intel’s budget i3 chip and Pentium chips will look laughably expensive. Ryzen 5 offers between 8 and 12 threads, which is up to three times more than that offered on the G-series Pentium processors. The high-end Ryzen 5 chips will compete with Intel’s i5 7600K, since the former costs just $10 more. AMD Stock: Growth, But With Risks Ryzen 7 must win PC enthusiasts now. The more gamers that use AMD chips, the faster that game developers will optimize the software to work efficiently on Ryzen. Meanwhile, Ryzen 5 must win the OEM and PC manufacturing orders. Big companies like Dell, HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) and Lenovo could give shelf space to AMD-based computers and laptops. If that happens, AMD will be chewing market share from Intel on a couple of fronts. Also, Polaris-based graphics cards can help AMD win back some market share from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).

Photo credit Susanna Frohman, San Jose Mercury News. Bay Area philanthropists Gordon and Betty Moore have given Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford $50 million toward patient care and advance research for children with heart disease, the hospital announced on Tuesday, March 28. The Moores' private donation is the largest gift from an individual to Packard Children's Hospital since its founding gift from David and Lucile Packard, the hospital said in a statement. The hospital will rename its Children's Heart Center the Betty Irene Moore Children's Heart Center in honor of the gift. The donation provides funding for clinical and research facilities, an endowment for the center's highest strategic priorities and endowed positions for faculty to lead specialized care and research, the hospital said. Gordon Moore is co-founder of Intel Corporation. He and his wife, Betty, are founders of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, which funds research in the sciences, environment, health and education. Long-time supporters of Packard Children's Hospital, the couple previously made gifts to the hospital's 521,000-square-foot expansion, which is now nearing completion this year. The Moores decided to make the $50 million gift after their grandchild was helped by care from the heart center. "Our grandchild had lifesaving surgery at the hospital, and we would like to help make sure the capability is there for others," Gordon Moore said. The heart center has gained recognition as a national and international destination for highly specialized surgical procedures, including many that are among the most challenging and complex cardiovascular cases. The center receives more than 25,000 patient visits annually and performs 80 to 90 percent of all cardiac surgical care for children in northern and central California, according to the hospital. Pediatric heart surgeon Dr. Frank Hanley is executive director of the Betty Irene Moore Children's Heart Center. The Moores' gift comes at a critical point in pediatric cardiovascular care in that it will help physicians advance beyond surgical repair that is not a cure for disease to discovering treatments that could ultimately lead to true cures, he said. Currently many patients require multiple surgeries and repairs throughout their lifetimes that can interfere with their quality of life, according to the hospital. "We imagine a day when a child born with a poorly working aortic valve, rather than undergoing multiple open-heart operations throughout his lifetime, instead receives a replacement valve engineered from his own stem cells," he said. The Moores' gift will allow the heart center to build a robust research program aimed at improving the treatment and prevention of congenital and acquired heart conditions, including adult congenital heart disease. The Center will also expand its clinical facilities, including a newly designed outpatient center in the coming years, the hospital said. Comments There are no comments yet. Please share yours below.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 March 2017 by Military News Mercury Systems Launches First Model in Secure Rack Server Product Line Printer-friendly version Built-in System Security on Dual Intel Xeon Platform Enables Forward Deployment ANDOVER, Mass. – March 30, 2017 – Mercury Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRCY, www.mrcy.com), announced that it has launched the Ensemble® HDS9624 Secure Rack Server to address the need for rack servers with system security features that can be forward deployed or sold to allies under Foreign Military Sales (FMS) or Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) programs. In addition to the unique security features, Mercury’s new product line is the only rack server that includes both ruggedization and a fully trusted supply chain for both hardware and software. Rack servers deployed for missions in wide-body aircraft, ships, submarines, or ground stations need to be secure, trusted, and rugged. Security comes through system security features that deter reverse engineering. Mercury provides these security features as a turnkey solution or as a customer-private, customizable portfolio of techniques. Trust comes through DMEA accredited design, manufacturing, and testing by US personnel in US facilities that minimize the risk of backdoors, counterfeits, and trojans. The board support package, BIOS, and network stack are designed by US personnel and are available for inspection by government agencies. Ruggedness is delivered by applying ANSI/VITA 48.7 Air Flow-By™ mechanical and cooling techniques to a standard ATX-based server form factor. Together, the system security features and trusted supply chain of the Secure Rack Server are designed to help system integrators meet U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) instruction 5200.44 “Protection of Mission Critical Functions to Achieve Trusted Systems and Networks.” “Until now, system security engineering requirements have challenged the rack server form factor, requiring untenable tradeoffs in affordability and system architecture,” said Scott Orton, Vice President of Mercury’s Secure Processing Solutions group. “As a result, many programs were not able to optimize Critical Program Information protection while maintaining the affordability and performance advantages of the rack server form factor. Mercury’s Secure Rack Server product line provides an affordable solution across system security levels.” The HDS9624 Secure Rack Server is an ATX-class server with two 10-core Intel® Xeon® E5 v4 processors with a cache-coherent memory pool running a single SMP operating system across all cores in both processors. The design of the HDS9624 server is optimized for both memory bandwidth and I/O bandwidth, resulting in a high-performance server architecture that can be used for sensor processing as well as mission computing. Because the HDS9624 server is based on standard server designs, it benefits from the full software ecosystem for networking, storage, and data center applications. For portability and isolation in a secure setting, the HDS9624 server has options for secure virtualization and a secure hypervisor. Mercury’s Secure Rack Server product line is designed to address concerns about Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) in the use of commercial servers. Unlike traditional servers that typically are available for only 3 years, Mercury’s Secure Rack Servers offer 10+ years of supply longevity. A demonstration of Mercury’s Secure Rack Server can be seen at the Navy League’s Sea-Air-Space Exposition in booth #1724. For more information on the HDS9624 Secure Rack Server, visit www.mrcy.com/secureserver/ or contact Mercury at (866) 627-6951 or info@mrcy.com. Mercury Systems – Innovation That Matters™  Mercury Systems (NASDAQ:MRCY) is a leading commercial provider of secure sensor and mission processing subsystems. Optimized for customer and mission success, Mercury’s solutions power a wide variety of critical defense and intelligence programs. Headquartered in Andover, Mass., Mercury is pioneering a next-generation defense electronics business model specifically designed to meet the industry’s current and emerging technology needs.

My guess is President Obama lit a celebratory cigar when he learned that ObamaCare still lived while President's Trump's healthcare proposal crashed and burned on Friday. Both Trump and Speaker Paul RyanPaul Ryan6 reasons 'TrumpCare' flatlined Overnight Healthcare: Ryan says key ObamaCare payments will continue during House lawsuit White House invites House Intel Dem to view documents MORE (R-Wis.) deserve much of the blame. But what did they do wrong? The GOP has a president, and control of both the House and the Senate, but Republicans couldn't get their version of healthcare done. Here are the results of the autopsy on AHCA. 1. Trump made a rookie mistake. Chuck Todd of NBC News thinks the new president made a rookie mistake in making his first legislative initiative a proposal that took something away from the American people instead of a bill like infrastructure that gave people something. Back in 2010, when Congress debated the merits of ObamaCare, many Republicans argued that it was necessary to kill the proposal in its crib. They were right. Once you give people something, it's hard to take it away. Especially when it means more than 20 million Americans would lose the health insurance they got from the Affordable Care Act. 2. Republicans failed to plan. Since ObamaCare became law in 2010, House Republicans voted to repeal it 59 times without offering an alternative. Finally, after seven years, Ryan came up with an alternative and it was an unmitigated disaster for the GOP. "TrumpCare" — or maybe it's better called "RyanCare" — was a slapdash effort. The proposal looked like something scribbled on a cocktail napkin after a long night at the bar. Ryan had seven years to figure healthcare out, but he came up empty. With all that time, you'd think the GOP would have come up with a rock-solid plan. 3. Right-wing Republicans ran amok. Ryan didn't have any more luck dealing with the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus than his predecessor as Speaker, John BoehnerJohn Boehner6 reasons 'TrumpCare' flatlined Paul Ryan sells out conservatives with healthcare surrender Matt Schlapp: 5 lessons Trump, Ryan must learn from healthcare debate MORE (R-Ohio). Some are now demanding Ryan's removal after he badly mishandled his version of healthcare reform. The reason why it took the Speaker seven years to propose an alternative to ACA was because he wasn't able to develop a proposal that both the Freedom Caucus and moderately conservative Republicans in swing districts could support. The only thing that would have satisfied the right-wing caucus would have been the complete withdrawal of the federal government from the healthcare arena. A Freedom Caucus member, Tom Massie (R-Ky.) summed up the thinking of caucus members when he described the AHCA as "a stinking pile of garbage." He went on to say, "I think the [American Health Care Act] was written by the same people that wrote ObamaCare." On Friday — like Obama — BoehnerJohn Boehner6 reasons 'TrumpCare' flatlined Paul Ryan sells out conservatives with healthcare surrender Matt Schlapp: 5 lessons Trump, Ryan must learn from healthcare debate MORE probably celebrated when he heard that his successor's healthcare plan went down in flames. The Freedom Caucus drove Boehner out of the Speaker's chair and the caucus may do the same to Ryan. 4. The president dissed his base. Trump should have danced with the ones who brung him, as the old saying goes. The president danced his way into White House with white working-class support. But once he got to the White House, he waltzed with wealthy Americans instead. TrumpCare would have eliminated health insurance for millions of his supporters so that wealthy Americans could get a tax cut. The bill would have cruelly taken away healthcare from millions of men, women and children who couldn't afford anything else. As Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) told The New York Times, "It's so cartoonishly malicious that I can picture someone twirling their mustache as they drafted it in their secret Capitol lair last night." 5. Democrats and progressives stood united. Democratic unity, and division among Republicans, sealed the AHCA's fate. Democrats hung tight and progressive activists kicked butt. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) deserves some credit for the AHCA's demise. Ryan couldn't even round up one Democratic vote for AHCA, which forced him to rely on the "Scorched Earth Caucus." Calls, tweets and emails to members of Congress ran heavily against AHCA thanks to the efforts of many progressive groups. This strengthened the resolve of congressional Democrats. The death of TrumpCare also indicates that there are deep divisions within the Republican Party. Democrats and progressives working together will continue to exploit the great divide within the GOP. 6. Trump ignored checks and balances. It's obvious that when Trump entered the White House, he thought he could do almost anything he pleased. The new president had to learn about checks and balances the hard way. First, his travel ban is blocked by federal judges. Then his own party kills his healthcare bill in the House. And even if his reform bill had squeezed through the House, the plan was dead on arrival in the Senate, where several GOP senators had already said publicly that they would oppose the House bill. Last week, the president told congressional Republicans that they had to vote on the bill as is or he wouldn't sign any healthcare reform bill down the line. Massie tweeted "If Exec branch tells the Legislative branch 'when 2 vote' 'how to vote' and 'what it will b allowed 2 work on if vote fails' is that a republic?" It's back to the drawing board for the GOP. The good news is that millions of Americans can sleep soundly knowing they still have a backup if they suffer a severe injury or serious illness.

Development of specifications for the new DDR5 DRAM has started, and it will be finalized next year, JEDEC, a memory standards-setting organization, said on Thursday. DDR5 will succeed the current DDR4 memory, which is used in PCs and servers. DDR5 will be two times faster than DDR4 and also more power efficient. DDR5 will also have double the density of DDR4. Typical DDR5 DIMMs will have twice the gigabyte capacity of DDR4 DIMMs. Analysts didn't expect DDR5 to be developed; instead, they thought the line for DDR DRAM would end at DDR4. But PC and server designs haven't changed much in recent years, and there could be an appetite for DDR5. It's not certain when memory makers will release DDR5 memory. But like DDR4, DDR5 may first make it into servers and high-end gaming PCs and then to laptops. A low-power form of DDR5 could make it available for mobile devices. Samsung's latest Galaxy S8 smartphones have LPDDR4 memory. Chip and motherboard makers will also have to build in support for the new DDR5 memory, and that process could take longer than a year after the specification is released. Tech vendors are developing new forms of memory to rival DDR5. Intel next year will ship Optane memory DIMMs, which could replace DDR DRAM. Optane has the advantage of being able to retain data even if a computer is shut off, something that DDR DRAM can't do. Multiple forms of DRAM alternatives have also emerged in the form of the faster HBM2 (High-Bandwidth Memory) and GDDR5X, which are mainly used in resource-hungry graphics processors. A new form of 3D memory called HMC (Hybrid Memory Cube) is used in Intel's Xeon Phi supercomputing chips. There could be a demand for DDR5 partly because applications like databases are moving to in-memory processing. Companies like Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise are doubling memory capacity in servers at fast rates to handle those applications. JEDEC also announced that development of the specifications for a new form of hybrid memory called NVDIMM-P is underway. NVDIMM is a form of persistent memory, which merges nonvolatile flash storage and volatile DRAM into a DIMM slot. This sort of memory is targeted at applications like databases, which use a mix of flash and DRAM for processing and caching.

Snigdha Sengupta Fireside Ventures founder Kanwaljit Singh. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint Founded: 2017 Headquarters: Bengaluru Stage: Seed, Series A Target fund size: $45 million At 53, Kanwaljit Singh is starting a new venture capital firm for the second time in a decade. This time around, though, he’s a little bit more excited than the last time. Fireside Ventures, his firm, currently on the road to raise a Rs300-crore (about $45 million) maiden fund, takes him back to his roots—consumer businesses of the non-technology variety. “I believe consumer brands are the new emerging trend and provide an alternate investment opportunity to technology investing,” Singh told MintAsia on the phone from Bengaluru, where he is based. “I realized the DNA required as an investor is quite different and, therefore, decided to focus on this as an exclusive space. This belief and passion probably comes from being in the FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) sector for a large part of my career early on,” he said. Before becoming a venture capitalist, Singh spent 10 years at FMCG major Hindustan Unilever Ltd and then about three years in marketing at chipmaker Intel Corp. About 11 years ago, when India’s venture capital market was practically non-existent, Singh reckoned that it would be a good idea to blend his passion for non-technology consumer businesses with technology ones. He quit his job as a director with The Carlyle Group and teamed up with Daksh eServices founder Sanjeev Aggarwal, Silicon Valley-based serial entrepreneur and angel investor Ashish Gupta and, former Walden International executive Rahul Chandra to start Helion Venture Partners, one of India’s oldest homegrown venture capital firms. The bid to combine non-technology start-up investments with technology start-up investments met with limited success at Helion. In late 2014, Helion decided to shift gears to pure technology investments and Singh quit to go his own way. The experience, however, didn’t dampen his passion for non-technology consumer businesses. Rather, he decided to double down on investments in such start-ups. Fireside was born about two years ago as Singh’s family office and is now an investor in over a dozen consumer start-ups. Some of the better known ones in the portfolio include Hector Beverages, which owns packaged beverages brand Paperboat; Drum Food International, which retails ice cream under the Hokey Pokey brand, and online meat and fish store Licious, owned by Delightful Gourmet. “It was clear to me at the time that the market had started to change in favour of homegrown consumer brands. When I say consumer, I mean FMCG-type of businesses. The local ecosystem and infrastructure around these businesses has matured to the extent that now one doesn’t need tens of millions of dollars to achieve scale,” says Singh. He thinks that the combination of new distribution and marketing models and high-pedigree entrepreneurs offers a classic inflection point for the creation of such consumer businesses in India. Having proved his investment thesis, Singh thinks that the time is now right to go out and set up a specialist venture capital firm focused on home-grown consumer start-ups. He stopped making investments through the family office about 4-5 months ago and will make future investments through the new Fireside fund. At present, he’s raising commitments for the fund from domestic investors and has already received commitments worth Rs100-120 crore from local family offices. Investments from the fund will continue the strategy he’s followed in the past couple of years—invest in tranches of Rs1 crore, Rs4 crore and Rs10 crore over the life of a company. Anything else he’d like to do differently from his previous outing in the venture capital business? “Bring younger people on board, establish clear growth paths to becoming partners… the vision is to build an institution that outlasts me,” he says.

Trump-Russia collusion is being investigated by FBI, Comey confirms https://t.co/pKvStJDuNV — The Guardian (@guardian) March 20, 2017 “Other than allowing routine governmental functions, there must be a total and complete shutdown of any agenda item being pushed by the Trump Administration. Congress cannot continue regular order and must stop voting on any Trump-backed agenda item until the FBI completes its Trump-Russia collusion investigation,” Lieu wrote in a press release. "President" @realDonaldTrump: You truly are an evil man. Your job is to help Americans. Not intentionally try to destroy their lives. https://t.co/2M94E1g39b — Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) March 25, 2017 In the scathing report, Lieu appears to suggest that President Trump may have committed treason and cited a report which claimed that several U.S. officials believe the FBI has information about coordinated effort between members of Trump’s team and suspected Russian operatives to release hacked information that would be damaging to Hillary Clinton, the Independent wrote. President Donald Trump denied that his campaign had allied with Russia to interfere with last November’s elections, ahead of the first public hearing in Congress on alleged Kremlin interference in those elections. Trump tweets ahead of Intel hearing: Russia collusion is "FAKE NEWS" https://t.co/ZZwLe0Ewdu pic.twitter.com/nJlaiARnER — The Hill (@thehill) March 21, 2017 In his personal Twitter account, Trump said that James Clapper, who was national director of intelligence in the government of former President Barack Obama, and “others” have said there is no evidence that he “conspired with Russia.” James Clapper and others stated that there is no evidence Potus colluded with Russia. This story is FAKE NEWS and everyone knows it! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 20, 2017 For the FBI, counterintelligence investigations are one of the most complicated and time-consuming cases, and the case could possibly go on for years. In January, U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin personally ordered a covert job to undermine Hillary Clinton’s opportunities and help Trump. The House Intelligence Committee is charged with investigating the alleged interference by the Russian government in the November elections, an investigation in which Trump requested to also include alleged practices of illegal listening against him. In the report, Lieu states that “the bombshell revelation that U.S. officials have information that suggests Trump associates may have colluded with the Russians means we must pause the entire Trump agenda. We may have an illegitimate President of the United States currently occupying the White House.” As a report from Common Dreams pointed out, Lieu is not alone in his call to halt the president’s agenda. Noted filmmaker and activist Michael Moore urged the Democratic Party to declare a national emergency after the FBI said it was investigating Donald Trump’s team and he posted the following message on his Instagram account. “The Democratic Party needs to declare a National Emergency. For the first time in our history, the President of the United States and his staff are under investigation for espionage. This announcement, by the head of the Trump-friendly FBI, is a shock to our democracy.” the left-wing author wrote. “The Democratic leadership in the House and Senate needs to bring a halt to all business being done in the name of this potential felony suspect, Donald J. Trump. No bill he supports, no Supreme Court nominee he has named, can be decided while he is under a criminal investigation.” Furthermore, a petition hosted by MoveOn.org says that Congress must pause all Trump-related legislation and appointments and it asked the below question. “How can Congress, in good conscience, agree to further Trump’s agenda amid such serious allegations regarding possible illegal collusion with Russia? The answer is simple: It can’t.” FBI director James Comey noted that the agency is investigating the origin of any link between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any kind of coordination between the campaign and the meddling of Russia. U.S. officials said that so far they have found no evidence of the above. However, there are ex-officials and a few others who remain in office claiming to have discovered evidence that there were people associated with Trump who had repeated contact with Russian officials, including people linked to Russian intelligence.

Photo: MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images In the middle of overhauling the federal bureaucracy and negotiating Middle East peace, Trump’s top aide and son-in-law Jared Kushner will reportedly have to squeeze in an appointment with the Senate Intelligence Committee to answer questions about meetings he set up with Russian officials. The New York Times reports Kushner organized sit-downs with the help of Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition, including at least one between Kushner and the head of Russia’s state-owned development bank, which had been on the U.S. sanctions list since Kremlin encroachment in Ukraine. The Senate Intel Committee called Kushner in for a hearing as part of its broader investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, something the FBI confirmed last week that it’s also probing. According to the Times, Kushner and Michael Flynn — who resigned as NSA for allegedly misleading Vice-President Mike Pence about the subjects of Flynn’s own discussions with Russian officials — met with Kislyak in December in Trump Tower. They reportedly discussed how to better relations between the U.S. and Russia. Kislyak apparently asked for another meeting, but Kushner sent a deputy in his stead. And, finally, at the request of Kislyak, Kushner met with Sergey Gorkov, head of the Vnesheconombank, which is on the Ukraine-related sanctions list. The White House confirmed those meetings, and said these gatherings were part of Kushner’s routine outreach to foreign leaders during the transition. But Kushner will tell that to the Senate directly. “He isn’t trying to hide anything and wants to be transparent,” said administration spokeswoman Hope Hicks.

The House Intel chairman’s last name is a pronunciation minefield pic.twitter.com/Etx5XFhjYH — POLITICO (@politico) March 30, 2017 No one can say Devin Nunes‘ name, which is a problem, since he’s a major headliner in the news right now. Look no further than the above compilation from Politico. Listen. Let’s go over how to pronounce it once and for all. Here is an ad from when the California congressman was running for office. He says “Noo-nes.” Why? Because there is no tilde (~) over the second “n” in Nunes. Think back to ninth-grade Spanish class and recall that the tilde adds the “y” sound, so it would be necessary to have the tilde if Nunes were pronounced “Noon-yes.” It would look like this: Nuñes.

Twitter Facebook Staying alive: DDR5 memory is on its way DDR5 DRAM will be two times faster than DDR4 Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 31 March, 2017 07:26 - - - - print email Comments More DDR memory is on the way, despite many predictions that its time would soon be up. Development of specifications for the new DDR5 DRAM has started, and it will be finalized next year, JEDEC, a memory standards-setting organization, said on Thursday. DDR5 will succeed the current DDR4 memory, which is used in PCs and servers. DDR5 will be two times faster than DDR4 and also more power efficient. DDR5 will also have double the density of DDR4. Typical DDR5 DIMMs will have twice the gigabyte capacity of DDR4 DIMMs. Analysts didn't expect DDR5 to be developed; instead, they thought the line for DDR DRAM would end at DDR4. But PC and server designs haven't changed much in recent years, and there could be an appetite for DDR5. It's not certain when memory makers will release DDR5 memory. But like DDR4, DDR5 may first make it into servers and high-end gaming PCs and then to laptops. A low-power form of DDR5 could make it available for mobile devices. Samsung's latest Galaxy S8 smartphones have LPDDR4 memory. Chip and motherboard makers will also have to build in support for the new DDR5 memory, and that process could take longer than a year after the specification is released. Tech vendors are developing new forms of memory to rival DDR5. Intel next year will ship Optane memory DIMMs, which could replace DDR DRAM. Optane has the advantage of being able to retain data even if a computer is shut off, something that DDR DRAM can't do. Multiple forms of DRAM alternatives have also emerged in the form of the faster HBM2 (High-Bandwidth Memory) and GDDR5X, which are mainly used in resource-hungry graphics processors. A new form of 3D memory called HMC (Hybrid Memory Cube) is used in Intel's Xeon Phi supercomputing chips. There could be a demand for DDR5 partly because applications like databases are moving to in-memory processing. Companies like Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise are doubling memory capacity in servers at fast rates to handle those applications. JEDEC also announced that development of the specifications for a new form of hybrid memory called NVDIMM-P is underway. NVDIMM is a form of persistent memory, which merges nonvolatile flash storage and volatile DRAM into a DIMM slot. This sort of memory is targeted at applications like databases, which use a mix of flash and DRAM for processing and caching. Join the Computerworld New Zealand newsletter!

Music News Entertainment Politics Features Share < br />this article: Sean Spicer inadvertently leaked how many sources Nunes met on White House grounds In News by Maggie Serota / March 30, 2017 Share < br />this article: Follow @maggieserota At the White House daily press briefing, Sean Spicer loves chastising reporters over how they should be focusing on the people leaking information on the Trump administration and not the substance of those leaks. Now it looks like Spicer is one of those leakers, even if it’s just by accident. On Thursday, The New York Times broke the news that House Intel Committee chair Devin Nunes had met with two White House sources — Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the senior director for intelligence at the National Security Council and Michael Ellis, a lawyer in the White House Counsel’s Office — before he ran off to President Trump to inform him of intelligence agencies picking up incidental surveillance of Trump transition team members while investigating foreign targets. Prior to this story, it was unknown just how many White House sources Nunes met with or whom he met with on White House grounds the evening prior to making the surveillance announcement to the press. During Tuesday’s briefing, Spicer was asked if he knew who cleared Nunes for entry onto the White House grounds. Here’s his response, emphasis mine: But when the information that is occurring now, which is two individuals who were properly cleared — or three, or whoever [Nunes] met with, I don’t know — that they are sharing stuff that is entirely legal with the appropriate clearances — and then there is an obsession on the process. Spicer admitted that Nunes met with two sources on White House grounds, realized what he did, then said “or three” and then realized he fucked up further so he buttoned his verbal ass spray with “I don’t know.” Smooth. He did it not only once, but twice! Granted, the below quote (“two individuals”) could refer to just Nunes meeting with one source, but the “however many” that follows feels like he’s just covering his tracks again: And it’s sort of — it’s a backwards way that when you all report on stuff with sources that are leaking — illegally leaking classified information, that’s appropriate and fine. No one questions that — the substance and material. When two individuals, or however many are engaged in this process, have a discussion that is 100 percent legal and appropriate and cleared, suddenly the obsession becomes about the process and not the substance. During Thursday’s presser, Spicer told reporters that he didn’t know whom Nunes met with during his clandestine White House meeting, but that seems unlikely given that he seemed to know how many people the House Intel Committee chair did.

By Agam Shah U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Mar 30, 2017 1:34 PM PT Credit: HPE More like this DRAM will live on as DDR5 memory is slated to reach computers in 2020 Adoption of DDR4 memory faces delays Intel ships first Optane memory modules for testing Video Nvidia's mighty GeForce GTX 1080 Ti cranks PC gaming to 11 More DDR memory is on the way, despite many predictions that its time would soon be up. Development of specifications for the new DDR5 DRAM has started, and it will be finalized next year, JEDEC, a memory standards-setting organization, said on Thursday. DDR5 will succeed the current DDR4 memory, which is used in PCs and servers. DDR5 will be two times faster than DDR4 and also more power efficient. DDR5 will also have double the density of DDR4. Typical DDR5 DIMMs will have twice the gigabyte capacity of DDR4 DIMMs. Analysts didn't expect DDR5 to be developed; instead, they thought the line for DDR DRAM would end at DDR4. But PC and server designs haven't changed much in recent years, and there could be an appetite for DDR5. It's not certain when memory makers will release DDR5 memory. But like DDR4, DDR5 may first make it into servers and high-end gaming PCs and then to laptops. A low-power form of DDR5 could make it available for mobile devices. Samsung's latest Galaxy S8 smartphones have LPDDR4 memory. Chip and motherboard makers will also have to build in support for the new DDR5 memory, and that process could take longer than a year after the specification is released. Tech vendors are developing new forms of memory to rival DDR5. Intel next year will ship Optane memory DIMMs, which could replace DDR DRAM. Optane has the advantage of being able to retain data even if a computer is shut off, something that DDR DRAM can't do. Multiple forms of DRAM alternatives have also emerged in the form of the faster HBM2 (High-Bandwidth Memory) and GDDR5X, which are mainly used in resource-hungry graphics processors. A new form of 3D memory called HMC (Hybrid Memory Cube) is used in Intel's Xeon Phi supercomputing chips. There could be a demand for DDR5 partly because applications like databases are moving to in-memory processing. Companies like Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise are doubling memory capacity in servers at fast rates to handle those applications. JEDEC also announced that development of the specifications for a new form of hybrid memory called NVDIMM-P is underway. NVDIMM is a form of persistent memory, which merges nonvolatile flash storage and volatile DRAM into a DIMM slot. This sort of memory is targeted at applications like databases, which use a mix of flash and DRAM for processing and caching.

But it's unclear if the documents Rep. Adam SchiffAdam SchiffSenate Intel panel tells WH to send Russia information directly Overnight Cybersecurity: Senate Intel holds Russia hearing | WH struggles to respond to latest Nunes development | Trump extends Obama cyber threat order White House invites House Intel Dem to view documents MORE (D-Calif.) has been invited to view are the same mystery documents seen by Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the chairman of the House panel, Schiff said. Schiff said he has accepted the invitation from the White House Counsel, but said the invitation "raises far more questions than any it answers." He added that he has pushed for the entire committee to have access to the materials. ADVERTISEMENT White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that the White House had invited leaders of both the House and Senate intelligence committees to review materials related to their investigations into Russian interference in the election.  But Schiff did not appear mollified by the White House's invitation, commenting hours after a New York Times report identified two National Security Council (NSC) staff members who it said helped Nunes acquire the information. Schiff said if that was the case — and these are the same documents provided to Nunes — it is "bewildering" that the information wasn't simply taken directly to the president. "Why all the cloak and dagger stuff?" he said.  "They don't need our chairman to deliver something to the president they can deliver themselves," Schiff said. "The White House needs to answer is this instead a case in which to effectively launder information through our committee to avoid [revealing] the true source of the information." Nunes earlier this month said he had been shown information indicating that the U.S. intelligence community had incidentally collected information on members of President Trump's transition team and subsequently unmasked that information, perhaps inappropriately. The GOP chairman was shown the information while on White House grounds last week. The next day, he briefed Speaker Paul RyanPaul Ryan6 reasons 'TrumpCare' flatlined Overnight Healthcare: Ryan says key ObamaCare payments will continue during House lawsuit White House invites House Intel Dem to view documents MORE (R-Wis.), held a press conference announcing his discovery, and then trekked back to the White House to brief Trump on the information. Democrats have accused the chairman of acting as an agent of the White House, perhaps to provide substantiation for Trump's claim that the Obama administration "wiretapped" him during the campaign — a charge Nunes has vehemently denied.  The incident — along with the cancelation of a public hearing involving former Obama administration officials — has thrown a wrench into the committee's investigation into Russian interference in the election.  Schiff and other Democrats have called for Nunes to recuse himself from the investigation and work on the committee was effectively halted this week.  Earlier in the day, Schiff told reporters that Democrats had determined to proceed with the probe, following a week of speculation that the minority might walk away in protest.  In one sign of slightly thawed relations, Schiff said that Democrats have signed on to a letter from Republicans inviting FBI Director James Comey to return to testify before the committee behind closed doors.  Democrats had originally resisted signing the invitation because it conflicted with the originally-scheduled public hearing involving former acting Attorney General Sally Yates.  He said Republicans have not yet signed on to a request from Democrats to reschedule that hearing — but that he has accepted the chairman's claim that the only obstacle is a desire to hold the closed session with Comey first.  But Schiff's manner Thursday afternoon remained grave. He vowed that the uproar over the chairman's actions would not "distract" from the core mission of the committee's investigation.  "This issue is not going to distract us from doing our Russia investigation," he said. Schiff gave no timeline for when he will travel to the White House to view the documents. Updated: 4:53 p.m. Tags Adam Schiff Paul Ryan   View the discussion thread.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Data centre design is on the cusp of an OCP-led revolution By Greg McCulloch Feature  The Open Compute Project aims to make future data centres more efficient and cost effective. Shares It’s a truism in modern technology that the only constant is relentless change. However, anyone looking at data centre blueprints over the last two decades with this mindset would be in for something of a shock. In a world where innovation is a ubiquitous buzzword and cloud computing has changed many aspects of data centre usage, data centre design has largely remained the same. There are good reasons for this stasis - but with the progress of the Open Compute Project (OCP), this could, and indeed should, radically change.    The economics of running a data centre have traditionally relied on getting as much value as possible from each square metre of space within it whilst keeping the whole system cool enough to be functional. Especially in areas where land values are high, for example in London, the efficiency and therefore the profitability of the data centre leans on the design and layout of the infrastructure and the clever management of these factors. This has historically led to a standardised design approach amongst most data centres, give or take marginal differences. However, developments from the work of the OCP are slowly changing the assumptions at the core of data centre design – for those who are paying attention to it.  Currently, any data centre designer or architect is compelled to reserve a large part of the data centre blueprint to the rooms that house the uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), batteries, and generator. These fail safes guarantee the data centre’s functionality regardless of most mechanical and electrical errors that can occur, and the room where they are housed is arguably one of the most vital rooms in any data centre. It also represents a very large investment, both in terms of CapEx and OpEx costs. Meanwhile, the need for raised floor cooling in order to efficiently prevent the building from overheating eats further into data centre space. Data centre real estate is a fixed asset that data centre operators need to maximise – and the above factors represent big restrictions on what can and can’t be done.    Enter the OCP - founded by Facebook, Microsoft, Intel, Rackspace, and Goldman Sachs, its mission is to alter how data centres are built with the goal of making them more efficient and cost-effective. IT infrastructure has historically been a ‘black box’, proprietary to its owners and inaccessible to everyone else. Where ideas are kept separate and siloed, new ways of doing things can’t evolve, and it is this that the OCP is attacking. It has taken the creativity spawned by the collaborative and accessible spirit of the open source software movement and applied it to data centre hardware, with exciting results.    Two of its key innovations directly challenge the assumptions underpinning data centre design by altering the requirements mentioned above. OCP technologists have discovered a way to condense the battery into the server whilst retaining the functionality of both, reducing the need for a separate room with a centralised UPS system. Meanwhile, new ways of cooling the data centre solely using environmental and ambient elements erode the need for raised floor ceiling and take back yet more real estate. More room in the data centre means more space to focus on efficiency and innovation measures.  Yet change is never simply a matter of technical possibilities. To achieve significant change and a break from the standard behaviour of the past, you need to alter people’s ways of thinking and take into account the human element. As emphasised earlier, the current norm for data centre design has become entrenched in the collective mind of the data centre industry over a period of around two decades. Few third-party data centres would automatically break with years of habit and normalised behavior to design a data centre without a UPS, generator, and battery room, or a raised floor. The need for these things is embedded in the industry’s way of thinking and the current mind-set is that these elements are absolutely necessary to keep the site running in the event of a power failure. Changing this view will be a long process – regardless how much black site testing is done.  The key to changing mindsets is developing a set of norms around the use of OCP hardware and educating the industry. Although terms such as ‘OCP ready’ are already being heard around the industry, these are not always so helpful, especially as the Project themselves have yet to set out a clear. The terminology so far only conveys to potential customers that the data centre in question is capable of using OCP optimised hardware. There needs to be a standard which communicates clearly that physical alterations have been made to a site that enable it to take full advantage of OCP innovations. Data centre luminaries from Intel, Facebook, and Microsoft, amongst others, are working together on the OCP board to devise the parameters by which suitability for OCP hardware can be accessed and therefore a informative new standard for OCP optimised data centres can be unveiled.  Conventional thinking can be overturned by education, and this will undoubtedly play a key role in helping data centre operators to rethink the possibilities of design and infrastructure. The first task of the OCP is to set out clear definitions of an ‘OCP Ready’ or ‘OCP Optimised” data centre. Once this has been achieved then data centre managers and designers can work towards these parameters. This will make it possible for the industry to conceive of a data centre without a UPS, battery, and generator room, as well as without raised-floor cooling. However, by illustrating the vast possibilities that these innovations can create, attitudes can slowly be shifted and correspondingly data centre design can be modified. Slowly but surely, we will see OCP start to make an impact as a key part of modern IT infrastructure.  Image Credit: Scanrail1 / Shutterstock   Topics Cloud software data centres open compute project it infrastructure GET YOUR FREE MAGAZINE NET: The Money Issue worth £5.99 Join over 7000 ITProPortal subscribers!

Author: Issie Lapowsky. Issie Lapowsky Business Date of Publication: 03.30.17. 03.30.17 Time of Publication: 2:06 pm. 2:06 pm A Silicon Valley Lawmaker’s $1 Trillion Plan to Save Trump Country Jim Wilson/The New York Times The Trump administration may not believe that automation threatens today’s American workforce, but try telling that to a travel agent or a truck driver or a factory worker or an accountant. One recent study found that for every one robot introduced to the workforce, six related human jobs disappear. But those six humans still need to get by. That’s why many Silicon Valley leaders, even as they innovate entire industries and livelihoods out of existence, have started gravitating toward a not-so-new concept: basic income. Under the idea, the government would provide every citizen with a stipend, no strings attached. Especially in times of economic upheaval, when technological change is both rampant and unpredictable, the thinking goes, a basic income would ensure a baseline of stability. Now the Valley’s newest congressional representative is bringing the idea to Washington, to the tune of $1 trillion. Democrat Ro Khanna of California’s 17th district—home to companies like Apple and Intel—would seem to have little chance of persuading the most conservative Congress in memory to blithely give away so much money. But there’s a wrinkle: The biggest beneficiaries wouldn’t be Khanna’s well-heeled constituents in Cupertino or Santa Clara. It’s President Trump’s core supporters in rural America who would have the most to gain. Related Stories Joseph Bien-Kahn Trump Can’t Deliver the Rust Belt Jobs He Promised Because Work Has Changed Maya Rockeymoore Cutting Social Services Only Makes the Robotic Takeover Worse Vasant Dhar Robots Will Soon Do Your Taxes. Bye-Bye, Accounting Jobs Clive Thompson The Next Big Blue-Collar Job Is Coding Khanna is preparing to introduce a bill that he calls “the biggest move in orders of magnitude” toward providing a basic income in the US. Specifically, it proposes a $1 trillion expansion of the earned income tax credit, which would roughly double the amount of money going into low-income families’ pockets. The main difference between Khanna’s plan and the Silicon Valley utopianists’ version of basic income is that for now recipients would still have to have a job to qualify. Think of it more as a basic income warm-up. Khanna, a former Stanford economist who briefly worked for the Commerce Department under President Obama and supported Bernie Sanders for president, knows Congress will probably (ok, definitely) never go for it. For now, that’s fine by him. You could think of his plan as a kind of political moonshot. As with Google Glass, it’s a bold idea that may not catch on in the mainstream. But simply injecting the idea into public conversation propels it forward until people finally find it palatable (hello, Snap Spectacles). “The criticism of the Democrats in the past is that they were too timid. They ran on consultant-driven platitudes and didn’t offer a compelling enough vision,” Khanna told me as he sipped cappuccino from a paper cup inside New York’s Chelsea Market building one crisp morning in March. “As we saw with this election, people are attracted to bold clear ideas.” But the boldest part of Khanna’s plan isn’t merely what it will cost a budget-conscious Congress. According to the Tax Policy Center, which assisted Khanna in crafting this bill, this plan would compensate the bottom 20 percent of earners for wage stagnation dating back to 1979. Currently a family with one child earning below a certain income threshold receives a $3,400 earned income tax credit. Under Khanna’s plan, they would get roughly twice that. The more kids you have, the more money you get. And you don’t need to dig too far into a map of average incomes across the US to see where that 20 percent lives. Hint: It ain’t Silicon Valley. Instead, the plan, if it worked as promised, would especially benefit states like Arkansas, Mississippi, and West Virginia—in other words, Trump Country. Coders in Coal Country Khanna became Silicon Valley’s newest voice in Washington in November after ousting incumbent Mike Honda, a member of Congress since 2001, in an acrimonious primary. It was Khanna’s second time running, and his insurgent campaign earned support from techies like Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg, Google’s Sundar Pichai, and yes, even billionaire Trump supporter Peter Thiel, who admired Khanna’s attempt to unseat a career politician. “Peter Thiel and I disagree on 99 percent of things,” Khanna said stiffly, aware of the seeming contradiction that a devout libertarian like Thiel would contribute to his campaign. “But he wants robust, spirited debate.” Support for basic income also doesn’t break down along the usual party lines. The idea of a guaranteed income originated with libertarian economist and Reagan administration advisor Milton Friedman, who called it a “negative income tax” and argued it would “dispense with the vast bureaucracy” that dictates welfare programs. At the same time, some progressives argue that basic income would undermine need-based welfare programs and the more important priority of creating jobs. ‘This idea you’re going to take a 50-year-old coal miner and turn them into a software engineer is ridiculous. That’s sometimes how the Democratic message came out.’ Ro Khanna During his short stint in office so far, Khanna also has not followed the most conventional path. For a congressman whose district is home to billionaires and boasts a median annual income of more than $111,000, he has shown an unusual fixation on crafting policy for the country’s rural poor. For too long, he says, the tech industry has not heeded President Kennedy’s call to “ask not what your country can do for you.” Over the years, the industry has done a lot of asking: for regulatory changes, for high-skilled worker visas, for privacy protections, for net neutrality, for patent reform. To be sure, all of those things help the tech industry thrive. But Khanna says the November election reminded tech leaders that America is a big country, and the tech sector needs to use its power to help Americans who live outside of the industry’s narrow, coastal enclaves. “They don’t want a populist backlash,” Khanna said of his constituents. “They don’t want a country divided by place.” Khanna believes there’s little the tech industry can do about such divisions if its leaders continue to cling to the coasts. Shortly after taking office, Khanna traveled to Paintsville, Kentucky, to check out a program that teaches people in Appalachia, many of them the children of coal miners, to code. It also connects them with jobs once they finish. Scaling such programs will be critical to equipping the next generation with the skills they need in a tech-centric economy. At the same time, Khanna acknowledges that Democrats especially can’t rest on the notion that code can fix everyone’s economic woes. Certainly older workers who bought into President Trump’s message about reviving manufacturing didn’t buy it. “This idea you’re going to take a 50-year-old coal miner and turn them into a software engineer is ridiculous,” Khanna says. “That’s sometimes how the Democratic message came out.” A Not So Modest Proposal Khanna believes expanding the safety net through the earned income tax credit, a kind of basic income precursor, could help provide more comprehensive support for people caught up in the economic turmoil spurred by automation. And in that, he’s not exactly alone. Last year, President Obama and House Speaker Paul Ryan both proposed expansions of the credit that would benefit childless workers. But the more radical idea of a basic income—which is to say, giving away free money—has failed to take hold in the United States especially, as lawmakers fear it would dampen people’s incentive to work. Even Khanna agrees these kinds of subsidies should be tied to work. It’s a less radical approach to a basic income, which is why there are optimists like liberal economist Robert Reich who believe Khanna’s plan might just have a shot, particularly at a time when Trump’s base comprises the people would seem likely to benefit most. “Unless the party has become brainlessly ideological, one would think that this concept would appeal to many of them,” says Reich, who has also been working with Khanna on the plan. The congressman holds no such illusions. Not only would it cost $1 trillion—a hard sell as the Trump administration is gutting the federal budget—but Khanna proposes paying for it with a financial transaction tax, even as the administration rolls back Wall Street regulations. But getting a bill passed isn’t really the point. Khanna says Ryan gave Democrats a blueprint for how to operate as the opposition party, and now that the Democrats are out of power, he’s following it. “He was proposing budgets into the wilderness,” Khanna said of Ryan’s approach, “but then they became a real part of the conversation.” For Khanna, the Democrats lost in 2016 because they failed to lay out a clear vision. Whether or not the party ultimately gets behind basic income as part of that vision, Khanna believes Democrats must say what they’re for, not just who they’re against. Until they win back power, most Democratic proposals will remain hypothetical. They might as well be daring, too. Go Back to Top.

Quick, Rapid, Turbo, And Fast Charging Explained: What You Need To Know About Charging Your Smartphone David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2015/06/12 12:36pm PDTJun 12, 2015 367 Plus 1 on G+ 326 Share on Facebook 3 Share on Twitter Total Shares696 Other Reviews You've probably heard of quick charging, turbo charging, adaptive fast charging, rapid charging, and Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 before - or at least one or two of these things. What you may not know is that all of them are actually basically the same thing, based on the same licensed technology from Qualcomm known as Quick Charge. With that basic premise in mind, what I want to dispel in this article is the notion that you need an OEM-branded charger to get the maximum charging speed out of your smartphone, because this generally isn't true. And understanding that could save you a fair bit of money, especially if your phone doesn't come with a quick charger, or you need a second one for work or travel. First, let's talk about what Qualcomm's Quick Charge is. The basic thing you need to know is that "Quick Charge" is just a marketing term for the capabilities of the power management circuitry in your smartphone and wall charger. That means both your phone and your charger need to support quick charging in order for it to work. And no, that does not mean your phone needs a Qualcomm processor - quick charge support in end devices is contingent on only the power controller, not the larger chipset. Qualcomm has licensed the technology to non-Qualcomm smartphones like the Galaxy S6 (Exynos) and ZenFone 2 (Intel). As far as how it works, quick charging allows you to dump a lot of power into your battery by using higher-than-normal voltage until it reaches what's called "saturation" - usually around 60-80% charge depending on how the phone's power management is configured. At that point, the phone's power controller scales back the amount of power it's receiving and your phone will begin to charge more and more slowly as it approaches 100%. This is where the "adaptive" language comes from in Samsung's fast charge marketing - quick charging allows your phone to intelligently scale the amount of power it takes from the charger based on the current charge state of the battery. So, how do you know if your phone supports quick charging? You'll need to do some research on the web. You're going to have to consult Qualcomm's Quick Charge website or your device manufacturer if you want to know for sure without actually trying a quick charger. There are lists of phones with this technology out there - Qualcomm has a very good one that you can find right here - so if you're not sure, just do a little digging - it shouldn't be difficult information to find. Just remember that Quick Charge 2.0, quick charging, fast charging, adaptive fast charging, and turbo charging - they're all usually going to be referring to the same thing. Now, by usually, I mean that there are essentially two generations of quick charging out there. You have the Qualcomm Quick Charge 1.0 devices, most of which came out in 2013 and early 2014 - phones like the Galaxy S5, Note 3, the first-gen Moto X, the Nexus 5, and a handful of others. These phones don't charge as quickly as Quick Charge 2.0 devices, but they should charge at full Quick Charge 1.0 speeds when using a Quick Charge 2.0 charger, so there's at least backwards compatibility. Quick Charge 1.0 isn't on many new phones anymore, so it's not really as relevant to discuss - what you need to know is basically just that Quick Charge 1.0 isn't as fast as Quick Charge 2.0. How much slower is it? Qualcomm says it's around half the speed of Quick Charge 2.0 if you're charging from 0% for 30 minutes on a device that's turned off. It's worth noting, though, that the difference is probably proportionally less if you were to do, say, a 50 to 100% charge, because of the saturation effect and intelligent scaling. Quick Charge 2.0 is the technology you see on the Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, the LG G4, the One M8, M9, the Note 4 and Note Edge, the ASUS ZenFone 2, the Moto X 2014, the Nexus 6, the DROID Turbo, and the list goes on and on. Like I said, check out the document Qualcomm has (here) if you want a complete listing of supported devices, because there are quite a few. All of these phones, when using a Quick Charge 2.0 charger, are going to charge at basically the same speed relative to the rated capacity of their batteries. It shouldn't matter what brand the charger is - if it's a Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 certified charger, it's going to work and charge at the full rated speed a modern phone will allow. It's possible in the future faster chargers will emerge (ie, >18 watts), but for now, most phones only support 15 watts at maximum. So, yes, you can charge your Motorola Nexus 6 with a Samsung Galaxy S6 Adaptive Fast Charger and still get basically the same charging speed as you would with the Motorola Turbo Charger 2.0 that the Nexus 6 comes with. And that, of course, brings us to an important question: why call them different things if they're all really the same? Yes, your Nexus 6 will charge just as quick with a Samsung unit. The answer, and there really is not much more to it than this, is marketing. Motorola would like you to buy their charger from them, and Samsung would you like you to buy their charger from them. That's pretty much it. Now, we can talk about whose charger contains higher-quality components and whose has a higher failure rate, but those things aren't relevant to the actual performance of the chargers themselves. This is my point: you don't need an expensive, OEM-branded quick charger to get the maximum charging speed out of your phone. Qualcomm's own Quick Charge 2.0 documentation even has a list of Quick Charge 2.0-certified chargers (granted, it's far from complete). This Aukey charger is around sixteen bucks on Amazon. Why, then, does a Motorola Turbo Charger cost $35 while something like this Aukey Quick Charge 2.0 charger is just $16 on Amazon? Certainly, you could probably argue that the Motorola charger is subject to more scrutinizing quality control, potentially contains superior electrical components - and I cannot stress enough that even this may not be true, I haven't torn these chargers apart - and as such may have a lower failure rate than an off-brand charger. Beyond that? They're basically the same thing. (For the record, I tested the Aukey I bought on a Nexus 6, Galaxy S6, Galaxy Note 4, Note Edge, ASUS ZenFone 2, HTC One M8, M9, and LG G4 - all of them recognized it as a fast charger.) Can the extra money for the official charger be justified, then? Let me put it this way, even if you bought two of these Aukeys - a brand which I am not specifically endorsing, it's just a random one I picked up on Amazon - and a month later one of them failed, you'd still come out ahead versus the OEM-branded charger. Here's a list of ones with at least 15W of output that seem to review well on Amazon, and there are likely even more well-reviewed ones out there on other online shopping sites. Anker 18W Quick Charge 2.0 wall charger Aukey 18W Quick Charge 2.0 wall charger CHOETECH 18W Quick Charge 2.0 wall charger Keedox 18W Quick Charge 2.0 wall charger iVoler 18W Quick Charge 2.0 wall charger While I'm certainly not deaf to the argument that shoddy electronics exist, we've also got to realize that hundreds upon hundreds of companies are now building smartphone wall chargers, and there are only so many things you can really screw up before your Amazon reviews end up in the gutter. And remember, you're only going to need this charger, probably, for a couple years - does it really matter if the Motorola one is more likely to last for five? Let's also not forget that with the transition to Type C USB connectors on the horizon, full-sized USB ports on wall chargers may become a thing of the past within the next few years. Another practical question about quick charging that you might have: how can I tell if the charger that came with my phone is a quick charger? This is actually easier than you might think. Among the various certifications and product info on the charger, you should find something resembling the word "output" - and next to that word you should see a voltage and an amperage, if not usually two or more voltages and amperages. Quick Charge 2.0 chargers generally have at least two ratings, one of which should be 15W or more (multiply the voltage by amperage to get your wattage - in this example its 1.67x9, which is roughly 15W). You can see this Galaxy S6 / Note 4 charger has a peak output of approximately 15W You'll find some that claim to be 18 watts (like all of the Amazon models I linked), or 12V at 1.5A and 9V at 2A, but as far as I can tell, no smartphone actually supports that amount of power yet, as no major smartphone manufacturer is shipping an 18-watt charger. But if your charger does support up to 18 watts, in theory you could be a little more future-proofed when phones with this charging speed start to come out. There are even 20 and 30W examples on Amazon, but again, no phone can take that much power just yet, and the end device will only accept the maximum level it's capable of handling, which for now appears to top out around 15W. As to the whole 60W claim Qualcomm makes, well, that's really just theoretical - I don't think there even is a single-port 60W Quick Charge 2.0 charger yet, and 60W is a lot of power - more than enough even for many laptops. No smartphone is remotely close to supporting that amount of power input yet, so don't worry: 15 watts is generally the maximum these phones can accept, at least for now. I hope this article's given you a little more insight on quick charging, how it works, and how you can save some money on your next charger - I know it was a learning experience for me simply in writing it. Update: As suggested by one of our commenters, if you're looking for a good USB cable to go along with your quick charger, Monoprice has 24AWG microUSB cables that should handle all that current with no problem.

David Ruddock That's a different technology limited to Oppo devices. If you have an Oppo phone, that means you'll want a VOOC charger. redCell216 I'm usually an Anker man, but that Aukey has a way better footprint. Cool The Anker is only $10.99 on Amazon. Check the promotion area in the listing. I grabbed the Aukey for the same $10.99 price on Newegg a couple days ago. But that sale is over now (free shipping, too, great deal). David Ruddock Nice! Cool Nice article, BTW. This was overdue for being given a good explanatory article. Yours was well done. Cheers. wuafri interesting article I use my fast charging all the time. Arcest Anker with PoweriQ is the best. Also its usb cables have low resistance and charge even with 3 meters! Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Well, sure, but PowerIQ has absolutely zero to do with this. I have their PowerIQ stuff all over the place, but for my Nexus 6 that's meaningless against Quick Charge 2.0. Alex Lord I've been wondering this, does Anker poweriq (essentially just a load balancer imo) have the ability to deliver the 'Charge 2.0' my S6 Edge requires? It can certainly deliver enough power, but is it the charger circuitry that TELLS it to create the higher pull from the device if you get my drift? Otherwise I'd imagine the Anker would deliver a standard charge? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman PowerIQ cannot deliver Quick Charge 2.0. As you noted, IQ mainly just negotiates with the device to give it however much power it can handle based on its abilities. Quick Charge 2.0 makes use of the additional pins/wires meant for things like data transmission to simultaneously send up to three separate voltages of power simultaneously to the device, allowing it send way more power than the USB spec is capable of. Anker does make devices that have QC2.0 that then fall back on PowerIQ when plugged into a device that doesn't support it, though. Alex Lord Awesome description Jarrett thanks! godutch The samsung fast charger does not work to fast charge a moto x 2014 though, although my qualcomm approved quick charger does fast/quick charge my exynos s6 David Ruddock There's no reason it shouldn't. godutch I tried it with a moto x 2014 and a note 4 charger, it just didnt work, it took around 1.5-2 hours to fully charge the moto x, whereas it took only 45-60 minutes to charge the note. The moto x is broken so I can't test anymore but I am pretty sure it only had quickcharge 1.0 available on the note charger. I also had a car quick charger then and it took only 30 minutes to charge the moto x. Maybe the samsung charger recognizes samsung devices and only gives them high voltage charging David Ruddock As in a Note 4 charger that came with a factory sealed Note 4 in the box that you personally purchased? godutch my ex bought it, not me but it was factory sealed and bought from a reputable chain (belcompany, owned by vodafone) David Ruddock Well, I'm not sure what to tell you - something is obviously going wrong. I know my Samsung adaptive chargers work fine with the Nexus 6, which I believe has the same power controller as the 2014 X. godutch I can't test anymore but we have different chargers in Europe of course. Actually there still isnt a quick charge 2.0 charger available (not since my moto x died a few weeks ago anyway) N8 I have a Note 4 and a 2014 Moto X, and I know the Moto X charges quite a lot faster on the Note 4's charger and cable than it does on its own. The Moto X did not come with a QC2 charger, but it *appears* to take advantage of the faster charging capability. Mix I ordered this bad boy on sale for $15.99 and it's pretty sweet only one Quick charge port though http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00LSKPN94?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00 Theo bad electronics can screw up the battery, even your phone. also there is the matter of the percentage of electricity that the charger converts. in other words how much electricity loss the charger has. so bad chargers could be dangerous. so don't buy anything that doesn't has the proper certifications (like CE written somewhere) godutch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wi-b9k-0KfE no cheap chargers for me anymore... Theo usually the big company's give you quality chargers. the Chinese oem from ebay are a fire hazzard. the problem is that a lot of chinese oem charger comes with printed certifications that are printed only to impress so people has to be careful with those things... godutch not only fire hazard but a real risk the high voltage input is short circuited to the supposedly low voltage( and amperage) output MattE303 cool teardown, a real eye opener! David Ruddock Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh no. The output spec on the charger is measured at the port. Theoretically, it could require more INPUT to achieve the specified output if it was particularly inefficient, but no, if it says it does 15W of output, it should do 15W of output. Loss over the cable / at the power management interface on the phone may happen, yes, but this is splitting hairs. As to 'screwing up the battery,' modern phones have pretty capable power management systems and would likely cut the charge if unsafe fluctuations or surges were detected (within reason). Obviously, do not buy from sellers with poor reputations or from sellers who claim to be selling "OEM" products at suspiciously discounted prices. Just be a smart consumer, and you'll probably be just fine. Theo when i say electricity loss i don't mean lower output capacity. every charger input some watt (f.e. x watts)and ouputs 15 or 18. x is always greater than the ouput. quality charger will input 15.something max 16 watt and ouput 15. a lower quality will input more, ergo there is a possibility that a cheap charger will cost more (more money to the electric bill) than an expensive charger in it lifetime. like the power supplies of computers. they come rated bronze,silver,golden. bronze has 80+ % efficiency silver 85+ and gold 90 N8 That's a good point. Bad chargers DO exist. But if you stick with third-party names that have a decent reputation, or wait a few weeks and pick ones that have a good spread of reviews leaning mostly toward the 4- and 5-star off a reputable site, the chances of actually getting a dud are very low. Saving $20 to get an Aukey, Anker, or other respected third-party charger with 400 4+ star reviews from Amazon is a wise choice. Saving $25 to get the "SPARKY SUPER FAST KWALKOM TWO POINT OH CHARGE QUICK FOR CHARGE USE NOT FOR OTHER USE NOW WITH FREE GIFT!!!!!!!!!!" from sooperelectronikscheap.ru? Not so much. :) compuguy1088 For example I would be weary buying anything branded CHOE.. Shady Gambino Nice job. I new the basics of the tech, but I like the way you broke it down and now I know more about it. AnthonyRyan89 i know it really doesn't work with the N7 (2013) but it seems to charge a bit faster using the Moto turbo charger. Brad That means the other wall chargers don't put out as much as the n7 can take at its max... a lot of my friends say their phones charge faster with my chargers... it'll suck up the max it can and since these put out more than generic chargers... slight bump in speed. AnthonyRyan89 Does the N7 have Quick Charge 1.0 then ? Cool It's an S4 pro Snapdragon, right? I don't think it does have quick charge 1.0 A Snapdragon 600 does. Which is similar. AnthonyRyan89 Yeah S4 pro compuguy1088 Its actually a pared down/downclocked snapdragon 600, so it *should* support qc 1.0. AnthonyRyan89 i remember reading something like that but i wasn't sure because all the specs say S4 pro, wasn't that the same with the orignial Moto X ? Cool Ha. That's why I asked originally because I forgot if it was Snapdragon 600 or Snapdragon S4 pro. Funnily enough, the Wikipedia page for that tablet calls it a Snapdragon S4 pro. Though, of course, that can be wrong. Brad No clue... Seth Merritt Dumb question, but when type c comes out, will there be cables that are type c to type a? David Ruddock Yes. http://www.monoprice.com/Product?c_id=103&cp_id=10303&cs_id=1030319&p_id=13009 Seth Merritt OK, so technically these chargers should still work then David Ruddock Yep. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Yes, just probably nowhere near what the devices are capable of at that point. Probably even below Quick Charge 2.0 speeds as they'll likely have replaced the QC2.0 protocol with something more appropriate to what USB-C can do. David Ruddock Well, not necessarily. QC2.0 supports up to 60W, and the tech is all in the power controller, not the actual port. USB-C obviously gives more headroom, but I think QC2.0 will be around for a while yet unless a more efficient system is discovered. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Perhaps, but from what I've read about QC2.0, one of the main things that differentiates it is its ability to draw different wattages across different sets of pins, including those normally used for data. So it redirects what would have been data pins to charging, and the QC2.0 charger is designed to deal with that. Those elements would be unnecessary with USB-C, as it's already built, from the beginning, to transmit massive amounts of power without any tricks. David Ruddock Yeah, I don't know what the underlying IP is. If it literally is just that Qualcomm has a patent on hijacking the data pins, then yeah, USB-C may just replace it entirely. But if Qualcomm has patents on things like the scaling technique, battery read method, etc in the power controller, then it could be a different story. Qualcomm is very intentionally obtuse about how all of this works, sadly. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Yeah, my assumption is that SOME of the underlying technology will carry over. But I don't think the pin-out system will match up, which is why I strongly suspect the current QC2.0 chargers won't be able to charge USB-C devices that are designed for high-speed charging at their full capacity. But time will tell. yeah right There is a groupon for $10 for the official Motorola quick charger. I bought two. compuguy1088 Link? wasseng Thanks David! Pilz The Zenfone 2 64/4 ships with a 18W quick charger. I haven't noticed any difference between that and my 15W David Ruddock Does it? I haven't looked in the box yet. If so I'm guessing it's because they got a deal with a supplier who makes an 18W version. But yeah I doubt it actually can use the full 18W. Cool Only the 64 GB version ships with it. Not the lower spec one. It doesn't use the full 18 watts (lol). A tablet might get close, though. Edit: Oh, he stated 64/4, already. Pilz Ywha my Nvidia Shield hit 6A according to my battery monitoring app using my 30W quick charger. I was thinking holy sh*t that's a lot of power and it stayed there for 3 minutes before dropping to 3.5A compuguy1088 The nvidia shield tablet I believe can do 18 watt (I've seen via ampere pull over 3 amps of power over usb before, if that is accurate... Pilz Yes but only the 64GB model. It's called the "BoostMaster" charger and is 18W when charging at 9V. I have too many quick chargers so I don't really use it morw than any other one. I still haven't noticed a difference in the time it takes to charge besides the phone getting really hot. My battery will be around 121°F before it steps down which probably isn't good. My Nexus 6 caps the battery heat at 113°F with the same charger and starting % Cool It definitely charges a lot faster with the quick charger. I've compared it by trying a 1 amp charger on my wife's Asus ZenFone 2 and it'll take about three hours on 1 amp. The quick charger is substantially faster. Charging from 0 to 60 in about 40 minutes. Pilz I wasn't disputing that at all. Let me clarify this, I have multiple Qualcomm certified quick chargers and I used them on my Zenfone. Some of these are NOT 18W but rather 15W or 30W and yet I see no noticeable difference on the charging time. That's the short of it in a simple way. Cool Ah. Now I'm on the same page. That makes sense. Good catch. BoFiS So ANY microUSB cable that plugs into a QuickCharge 2.0 a/c adapter will deliver the magical charging goodness? What about if you then use a magnetic charging adapter or dock like with the Sony Z3 and Compact? Does that drop it back to standard charging or is all the magic in the adapter? David Ruddock If it's a pogo-pin situation all bets are off, I just don't know. But yes, if it's a microUSB cable that isn't like, ancient, then yeah any cable should work in theory. Android Developer How ancient? WORPspeed Mayan relics anicent Android Developer At least not ancient China: http://twitteling.com/2012/10/android-logo-inspired-ancient-bronze-statues-china/ ? WORPspeed Sorry, I meant to say Mayan space relics, from before they settled on earth, or more accurately: were relocated to earth by [Aliens] :P exadeci You should correct that because not any cable will do it depends of the AWG of the cable 28/28 vs 28/24 is not at all the same charging speed the "easy" way of seeing if a cable will be able to deliver the proper amps is the thickness of it and then an app like ampere will give you more infos. The quick charge is managed by the phone so any 2+ Amp charger will work. David Ruddock Fair enough. Wirecutter has a good article on this http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-micro-usb-cable/ but basically, just pick a decent brand. KlausWillSeeYouNow Great article, Dave. Loved it. David Ruddock Thanks! Ibrahim Jadoon But don't buy MonoPrice if you want a long USB cable; it can't charge quickly! http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-micro-usb-cable/ DANonamous Any cable can if the guage is proper compuguy1088 Essentially....unless you have some really crappy cheap usb cables. For example I bought some cheap chinese slim cables awhile back. Used one with a quick charger, and the cable failed, most likely because it was a thin AWG that couldn't take the current. Monoprice's cheapest micro usb cables work just fine. redCell216 The dock will also matter in that situation. Sony has a magnetic dock that supports QC2.0, the DK48. Otherwise, you will lose the QC2.0 speeds. DANonamous The "magic" is in the adaptor AND the device being charged - nothing to do with the interconnecting cable AT ALL. BBpost Does the quality of the USB cable matter? David Ruddock It shouldn't unless you're using a very old or purpose-built cable (like those really skinny ones that ship for charging some wireless headphones, for example). andy_o It needs to be a data cable and less resistance (thicker wire and/or shorter) is always better all other things equal). WORPspeed I've been charging my Nexus 5 slowly my entire life (minus the few weeks I was in the US) O_O The horror! (unless my current charger is actually Turbo charge 1.0 compatible, but the article doesn't tell me how to check it) David Ruddock Quick Charge 1.0 is, i *think*, 9 watts max output usually. So look for 5v / 1.8A. WORPspeed I have 5volt ... 1A :( Also, how does this relate to Wireless charging, any benefit there as well? Are there slow/fast wireless chargers? David Ruddock All wireless chargers are pretty damn slow - I think 5W is actually the output of most of them. WORPspeed Well I guess that is what I get for ordering my Nexus 5 from the US and using my Dutch Samsung Galaxy charger :S Still I wouldn't notice it that much, most of the time I charge it wirelessly, or through USB from my computer... Still for this year's nexus I will either wait for a EU version or get a turbo charger off amazon Jordan Smellie But using a QC2.0 charger on my Nexus 5 will still provide the full QC1.0 speeds it can (apparently) handle, correct? Does a QC charger at 5V/1.8A operate differently than a 'regular' charger at 5V/1.8A? I have a bunch of chargers made by RIM(Blackberry), but I don't think they have any QC tech inside. Would I see a difference using a QC charger over these? I wish I'd known the N5 could do any kind of quick charging a long time ago... compuguy1088 The nvidia shield tablet does support QC 2.0 (as long as it isn't on the bugged 5.1 update). Android Developer What's the max W for it? andy_o About the same, but it charges at 12V instead of 9V like most phones which should be more tolerant of higher resistance cables. The bugged 3.0 update (5.1) thing is true though. Android Developer I'm not familiar with the "bugged 3.0 update". What is it about? andy_o The Android 5.1 update (version 3.0 for NV) was so buggy they pulled it. It's snappier, but they effed up fast charging, it now charges at 5V only like a regular tablet. Among other things they screwed were USB OTG (you need to restart the tablet with the thing plugged for it to work, but that disables charging, for which you need to restart again), and somehow it seems to be messing with a lot of people's speakers, though I haven't seen that personally. Android Developer I see. So what happened to those that have updated to this problematic version? Did they get a notice to downgrade or something? andy_o It was only mentioned in a forum comment (not even in a post) by an NV staff member, but people aren't getting the upgrade OTA notice anymore. If you need to downgrade you can use a factory image but NV isn't helping you out for downgrading. Android Developer That's too bad. Jason Davison I would also like to know what can be done about the 3.0 update. I've been struggling to find out why my OTG cable stopped working and haven't seen this issue referenced anywhere else, so thanks for the heads up! I also want to utilize quick charge as I have the Anker 40W with IQ andy_o Right now people are just waiting. Since I don't have any super critical problems, I'm also just waiting. If you want to go back I think the only recourse is to use a factory image from the NV developers site. andy_o btw, the Anker multiport chargers aren't QC 2.0 compatible. The only Anker is the one in the post, and that one is a rebrand that sells under several different brands. Jason Davison Thanks, I didn't realize that. From their description, it seemed like the IQ technology was QC 2.0 but now that I re-look at it, it's a proprietary power system. I'll have to pick up a QC 2.0 compliant charger and see what the difference is. I have been recording my battery charging stats in a spreadsheet as I experiment with different chargers, so I should be able to tell pretty quickly. Thanks for the info! blahmoomoo Hmm, based on my experience with the 2014 Moto X (with the Motorola Turbo Charger, which has the 12v mode), it does appear to use the 12v mode of the turbo charger. I can tell because, when charging up from nothing, I saw noticeable charging rate changes at 50% and 75%. Which suggested to me that the Moto X is tuned to use 12v from 0-50%, 9v from 50-75%, and 5v above that. The phone also isn't nearly as hot while it's charging on the turbo charger above 50%, though still warmer than when charging on standard high current 5v. David Ruddock I'm not sure what your point is here. 12v at 1.2A is 15W. 9V at 1.67A is 15W. blahmoomoo Snip. blahmoomoo Never mind, the Turbo Charger doesn't have an 18w mode. The 12v mode is 1.2a, so more like 15w. Somehow charges faster than the 9v mode though. David Ruddock That's the saturation effect. The voltage goes down as the battery saturates because the lithium ion cells can't go into overvoltage. I've tried to think of an analogy for this effect but it's kind of.. abstract. But basically, yes, it will slow down when it gets to a certain point, the tl;dr being that's just how lithium ion batteries work. Cool Good analogy: You slow down filling a large jug of water as it reaches the top so it won't overflow. At least that's how I fill large jugs of water. Maybe I'm weird. David Ruddock That works. blahmoomoo The 9v mode is also ~15w, but I guess there is some battery chemistry reason why that charges slower (and is sufficient to avoid overvoltage) compared to the same-powered 12v mode. Hitokage Tamashi What about something like a high speed chase? You go from driving really fast to slowing down as you get caught, until you come to a stop. That any good? Android Developer Does using quick-charge lower the efficiency/capacity of the battery faster than normal charging (over time) ? Do you always use quick-charge? Or only when you really need it? David Ruddock Depends how much heat is generated and how long the battery is heated to that temperature. I've not seen any scientific data on this. I would guess, for most people, the effect is not going to be all that dramatic in terms of cycle longevity. roccotool Head over to Battery University for the stats. Josep Ali surely it will reducing battery life.... Android Developer But how much? and would normal charging also reach this phase? If so, after how many rechargings ? Josep Ali it varies...nobody can predict it.... Tony G. I use it only when I need it charged faster. Android Developer Sounds like a good tip. roccotool Just remember that heat is bad for your battery. Quick chargers heat it up more than usual. Jake_Indiman @rdr0b11:disqus Not sure if you came across this blog post. Interesting thoughts about OEM and fake chargers..... http://www.righto.com/2012/10/a-dozen-usb-chargers-in-lab-apple-is.html David Ruddock Yeah, never buy an "OEM" charger from anything but the manufacturer's website. Counterfeits for Samsung, especially, are RAMPANT even on Amazon. Gisle Enåsen Blablabla...how about europe? David Onter -.- Kostas Very informative article. You should note though, that CABLES DO MATTER. Every el-cheapo ebay cable isn't supported for quick charging. They usually allow about 700mAh to pass through. You need high quality cables that probably came with your smartphone in order for quick charging to work. I have done several tests with my Note 4 with several cables and an adapter that meters the output Amperage. David Ruddock A USB2.0 Type A to microUSB data cable of remotely respectable quality will work fine. If you're going on eBay to buy cables, as with anything electronic, god speed - the amount of counterfeit and generally terrible stuff there is mind boggling. A $3 Monoprice USB2.0 micro cable can handle anything you can throw at it. http://www.monoprice.com/Product?c_id=103&cp_id=10303&cs_id=1030307&p_id=9965&seq=1&format=2 exadeci http://www.monoprice.com/Search/Index?keyword=micro+usb+28%2F24 Those can handle 2+ amp David Ruddock Good suggestion. krudl3rx Good luck getting those to fit a case. Kostas Nice suggestion. I will keep it in mind for my next order. Nice ninja edit too :P David Ruddock I'd go with exadeci's suggestion since it is explicitly a thicker-gauge wire. And also cheaper. Michael If you ever need one in a hurry (like you forgot yours on a vacation or trip) most Walmart's have a 10' Onn-brand PS4 controller charging cable for only $5. I don't know what gauge it is, but it works with my fast charger. It is somewhere around the thickness of a CAT5 cable. Avrohom Eliezer Friedman Can you link to a usb cable of this quality on amazon? Michael Just search PortaPow SUB cable. For QC 2.0 you'll want the green tipped ones. Michael Or, also on Amazon, a PortaPow, green tipped data/charging cable = 20 gage charging wire. But do NOT get the red tipped charge only cable, it will not work with quick charge 2.0. Well, it will work, but you will not get QC 2.0 charging speeds out of it. But the red tip one will help you to get the most out of your charger for a conventional device and added security at a computer Reverend Veritas If my manufacturer built a USB cable with EL wire or LEDs I'd buy that, but for $5 free s/h I'm gonna go for the glow. gritforfive It also depends on the gauge of the wire. A 24awg wire will be able to hand the 2A coming from one of these chargers. You have to search for wires that have 24awg. Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Micro-24-28-Quick-Charge-Cable/dp/B01ND11FZS/ Monoprice: http://disq.us/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.monoprice.com%2FSearch%2FIndex%3Fkeyword%3Dmicro%2Busb%2B28%252F24%3ATiBvP2yHxaYBIp3FVpLnjopnfrE&cuid=1370072 Tyler Humphreys Cables shouldn't affect Quick Charge specifically. Generally you need better cables to support higher amperage (not mAh as that is capacity and is irrelevant to cables), and Quick Charge has slightly lower amperage since it ups the voltage instead. That being said, standard USB is only 500mV so cheap cables might not handle more than that, but Quick Charge hasn't changed anything in that regard. George I think you might mean Standard USB is only 500mA, excuse me if I am wrong as I'm still learning about this. Tyler Humphreys That is correct. Way to correct my typo 4 months after the fact. DANonamous That is a power standard not based at all on the guage of usb cables DANonamous It's all about guage and which wires - of the 4 in a usb cable - are being used, and which pair. REkzkaRZ @disqus_w4sMVDIyog:disqus - would like to see which tests you did. Maybe that's a good future article for @AndroidPolice? Kostas Device almost depleted with Screen On and Off or Device completely off. 2A High quality not fast charger with the above condiditions (one piece with its own integrated cable). Same for quick charger that came with the note 4 with its own cable and several different ones (from other flagships or from ebay) with all the above conditions as well plus Quick Charging Turned On in the Settings too. Dedren Cables seem to matter more than anything. I have tested about twelve old and new cables and very few charge at max. I found one on amazon that does, finally. I have a very wide range of devices and chargers and cables, & I was noticing that the vast majority of them we're not charging devices fast as they should be. Going so far back as the original Nexus 7, Nexus 5, blackberry classic, Nexus 6, Nexus 10, moto 360, and Nvidia shield tablet, I was getting hit or miss results. Finally I decided to try every combination and use a battery meter to confirm charging speed and I was pretty shocked that the vast majority of the time it was the cable that was not performing. Most of these cables where from older generations of phones, all micro USB. DANonamous Polarity and actual amount of wires in the cable used are factors in Turbo charging. winterwonderland808 I believe the Motorola TurboChargers have the adapter and cable fused together so you don't have to worry about a cable. Or you can buy a separate turbocharger and use the charging cable with your phone because typically the cords are of high quality. DANonamous No. Kostas 💪🎩 ok Channel 2012 You speak the truth! I was wondering why my ThinkPad Tablet 2 was always charging slowly at home, regardless of which AC adapter was being used, but I eventually narrowed it down to the thin-gauge Samsung-brand MicroUSB cable. vibhor nice article Thanks for information cabbieBot Good post, David. One thing I never took into account until I ran across a random XDA post explaining it is cable quality. I figured there had to be a middle ground between expensive OEM cords and the ones I've been buying off of monoprice that are cheaper than my exes. Basically, most USB cables sold are 24 or 28 AWG (American Wire Gauge) in regards to their thickness (higher = thinner), and the logic is that a fatter cable is going to bring more current and probably last longer too. There's also the issue of cables that do data transfer/sync also will charge slower than one that is just supplying juice Suffice to say, I'm waiting for these to come in from Amazon right now and hoping they work as well as I think they will. I don't mind spending 8 bucks on a good cable if it'll do the job and not break on me: "PortaPow Specialised 5ft 20AWG Charge Only Micro USB Cable" http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0088HTYUE "PortaPow Specialised 3.3ft 20AWG Charge+Sync Micro USB Cable" http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00RQ5AZJ8 David Ruddock Good suggestions! Those are some BEEFY cables. Wildcard One of the reviewers said those dont work with QC "Well the cable works and charges, however, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS CABLE IF YOU PLAN ON USING THESE CABLES WITH A "FAST CHARGING" CAPABLE DEVICE/CHARGER. I purchased these cables to use with the Anker 18W USB Wall Charger with Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 Technology charger, as I have a device capable of "fast charging." These cables provided the standard charge (5V), but would not work with the "Fast Charging" (9-12V) technology. So in summary, works as a regular charging cable. These cables will not work with a "Fast Charging" device or charger." andrey3000 Correct.. you need a "standard" USB cable to use QC. The so called "charging"-cables doesn't support more than 1.5A. Or to be more precise according to the USB standard a connected device must not draw more than 1.5A when connected to a "old school" USB charging port where the data pins are shorted. Modern chargers (including QC) use the D- and D+ lines to negotiate voltage and ampere with the connected device. Felix The only thing I'm interested to know is: Is Quick Charging harmful for my battery life?! David Ruddock Probably to some extent, but I don't think anyone's assembled enough data points to say for certain how much. I don't think it's THAT much, because I'm guessing OEMs did test it before deciding to integrate it into their products and felt any loss was acceptable in light of the improved performance. I'd also say it's still nowhere near as bad wireless charging, which generates TONS of heat AND takes forever. Felix Hmm.. thanks man for answer and quick repeat ;) Love my Moto X 2014 and was never sure if the quick charge adapter could damage my battery. Josep Ali Of course the OEMs tested it, but also they want you to purchase the new battery sooner. that's called capitalism. roccotool Check out Battery University for the data. David Ruddock Thanks for all the productive comments, guys, you're pointing out stuff I forgot to mention or simply didn't know - it's super helpful. I've updated the article with a high-quality USB cable suggestion (though there are other options). YouNex After asking about the utility of the 2nd USB port on the Motorola charger (first gen Moto X), some people said the they output different amperage (1A/2A). Does it have something to do with Quick Charge 1.0 ? David Ruddock A lot of dual or multi-port chargers have a "fast" and "slow" port, so no, I don't think it's anything explicitly to do with QC, so much as just saving a buck. YouNex Thank, any idea about how to distinguish between them ? Josh Sleeper Great article, thanks for the clear explanation! I'd love to see a teardown of some of these chargers to find out which ones are actually built better electrically. Charles "that does not mean your phone needs a Qualcomm processor" On the flipside to that, what about phones that have a recent Qualcomm SoC but aren't on the catalog of 'select' products that have received marketing dollars to get on the list? Take the el-cheapo MotoE2, for instance. Is QC2.0 restricted to Qualcomm's high-end SoCs or will you find it in any phone using a current Qualcomm processor? Double_a2013 Great article. My biggest question about quick charge is what is it doing to the health our batteries? Josep Ali more heat, reducing battery life.... DANonamous No, it isnt more heat, its just quicker Josep Ali Great article ! David, there is one QC2.0 charger vendor who offer limited lifetime warranty, do you think they use better components and may have a lower failure rate ? If not, why other vendors don't offer it. Bruce Wayne Excellent article, David. Good research, well written and very informative. Just a heads up, you made a typo in the paragraph about marketing. You said "and Samsung would you like their charger from them." I think you meant "and Samsung would like you to buy their charger from them." JG Question... Does the quick charge degrade the battery faster than a regular charge? Would it be cool to replace the standard charger with a quick charge & use it every time I need to charge my phone? Or should I save it for rare special occasions? Tarek Still waiting for Anker to do that four ports Quick charger 2.0 wall charger! AngeloDBallou i like me police ..... < Start working at home with Google! It’s by-far the best job I’ve had. Last Wednesday I got a brand new BMW since getting a check for $6979 this - 9 weeks past.

I work through this link, < w­­­w­­­w.­jo­b­­N­e­t­20­­.­­­C­­­o­­­m ---------------------------------------------- Đức Thành This was an interesting read. Thanks, David. Puneet Singh Great article indeed @rdr0b11:disqus but you missed a point IMO. You should have also explained the Rapid Charging or VOOC - employed by OPPO.. Something very different than Quick Charge 2.0 by Qualcomm and substantially faster...!! It would have made thing more clear. Anyway relly helpful article for majority of the readers, i guess..!! Aaron So you're saying VOOC charging is OPPO's own invention? NThe technology is not based on Qualcomm Quick Charge? Puneet Singh I do not think that VOOC is in any way related to Qualcomm Quick Charge. I might be wrong but VOOC is a very different thing. andrey3000 So.. basically you are saying.. "any Quick Charge 2.0 compatible charger" can charge "any Quick Charge 2.0 compatible phone"? I am not claiming this is witch craft.. but what kind of deamon have you summoned from the deeps of hell to manage this?? But seriously.. isn't this the whole point of a "standard"? Rick Johnson Side note - why are the videos shot in 1080i? The interlace artifacts are distracting! coreycore "especially if your phone doesn't with a come with a quick charger" fyi anehlo Great article! Thanks! Ashish Typical AP article. A bunch of words without any substance. The most critical part of a fast charger is the cable. That doesn't mean gauging. QC2.0 compatible cableshave to be data and charging cables rather than the later only. andrey3000 You could pretty much sum up the entire article in one sentences.. "Any Quick Charge 2.0 charger can charge your Quick Charge 2.0 phone, but your phone manufacturer wants to earn money!" Instead we've got a 1770 word article stating the obvious again and again.. I read it all waiting for some revelation that pretty much never came... and Samsung sells their phones WITH a charger included.. AND a genuine new one costs like £13 from Korea.. SilentPatriot Anxiously awaiting USB type-C; in the meanwhile, learning a little about the power consumption requirements of my Galaxy S3 after a couple bulging batteries and struggling with it falling behind in charge while plugged into AC while using it pretty much strictly for wireless tethering with FoxFi. Had it plugged into an old HTC Touch Pro 2 1amp after the original adapter finally wore out and couldn't do much more than light surfing on 1 PC without it starting to slowly lose a charge. Long story short, I went power-shopping on the internet yesterday and found one on clearance at BB for $7.99 - a 12w 2.4a Rocketfish brand (they are replacing with new Insignia brand and charging 2-3x price, btw, so pick up what you need now!), specifically marketed towards the Kindle, but turns out to be exactly what I needed. Streamed video on 1 PC while gaming on another all night and never fell below 100%! Yay! =) chinna_rao why does my nexus 5 show the charging symbol within the battery as white? sometimes its black... can i differentiate the charger based on this(whether quick charge or not)? Renaldi I. Depends on how much juice is currently in the battery, I think. When I had an N5 on KitKat, the battery icon would be white on gray if there was only a little charge, and then slowly change to black on white as it gained more charge. Elena This is the best technology that charges the Smartphones powered by Quick Charge 2.0-technology at 75% rate as compare to the conventional chargers. X-47B David Ruddock: nice artcile, but a slight error. Samsung doesn't use or license Qualcomm's Quick Charge or Quick Charge 2.0. The technology is similar, and you can use QC 2.0 adapters with Samsung's phones with both Qualcomm and Exynos. Even on Samsung phone based on Qualcomm SOCs, they make use of MAX77823 and Qnovo's Fast Charging algorith for this purpose. Read more here: http://www.qnovocorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Qnovo-Intro-Adaptive-Charging.pdf Similar feature, different implementation. Josep Ali Beside Samsung, who's adopted this Qnovo adaptive technology ? Asus ? Matthew Fry Didn't cover vooc flash charging though. For anyone curious, the vooc is different in that it stays at 5V and dumps a shitload of current down. 5A worth. The charger and the cable are very expensive and needed. Rod Hosilyk Nice article David - very timely with much needed info. In addition to what you discuss, there are many confusing marketing terms claiming to be "fast chargers". For instance, "USB charger provides high power rapid charge for cell phones, etc....an intelligent charger using Auto Detect Technology yada yada...". In fact these are nothing more than 5 volt USB chargers capable of supplying higher current - typically over 2 amps per port. The claim further goes on to say they "automatically detect and provide the exact current needed to rapidly charge your device". Well, duh, a device will only take the current it needs so this statement is double talk. In summary, if the "adaptive fast charger" doesn't supply 5 volts PLUS at least one higher voltage, it probably doesn't comply with the Qualcom 2.0 standard and therefore will not charge at the greater speeds it provides. Josep Ali But the USB meter showed it draws 9V....double talk ?

As far as I know, the G4 supports it, but doesn't have an indicator. Michael Also through Amazon a Brit company, PortaPow, offers a 20 gage charging cable in both its red tipped USB charge only cable and its green tipped. USB data/charge. To make use of Quick Charge 2.0 you will need the green tipped data/charge cable. Because you have to have a minor data connection, between the phone and the charger, for Quick Charge 2.0 to work. Michael I wish they would make it more clear if they did all of these charging speed tests with the phone powered down/off or just in idle mode. Michael Another good charging cable on Amazon, for Quick Charge 2.0, is the green tipped ones from PortaPow. The charging wire in it is 20 gauge. But for quick charge 2.0 do not confuse it with the red tipped charging only cables. Those will not work at QC speeds with quick charge 2.0 as you need the data connection, between the phone and the charger, and the red tip charge only cables will not provide that. You will only get conventional charging speeds out of the charger if you use them. That being said, I very much do like the red tipped charge only cables for use with conventional chargers and for extra security when using public computers. Michael So is quick charge 2.0 supposed to work the same whether the phone is on or off? I have an LG G4 and I do not seem to get quick charge speeds when the phone is on just sitting idle as opposed to it being off. I mean, I know a phone generally charges faster when it is off, however, relatively speaking, you would think a quick charge 2.0 would still charge faster than a regular charger would when the phone is on and sitting idle. Xavier LightsForever Mathews Brilliant. Eric Hompe I'm wondering if using a Quick Charger every night will shorten my cell phone's battery life. I could continue to use a legacy charger for overnight charging since I don't need a fast charge then. I'll continue to do that if Quick Charge shortens battery life. Mr. Ruddock? roccotool With new phones featuring non-removable batteries, yes it DOES matter how long your battery lasts. And I will extend my battery's life because I love my phone. Boontarin Charoenthitiwong I have 1 more question. How do I know that my device is quick charging? seancaldwell It depends on the device. Some will say "fast charging" in the battery info menu. On the Samsung S6, there's a little notification that comes up on the top that says "fast charger connected." That doesn't appear if it plug it into a regular 2.4 amp charger that does not have the voltage ramp up. Alex Lord So sounds like the charger has a circuit that tells the S6 to create the pull for the higher charge? Rather than the S6 just taking it if the charger is able? Marius Very good article. Thank you! George Yes excellent article thanks, nice to see the new Samsung Wireless Fast Chargers (~15w) for the S6 Edge+ and Note 5 too are almost catching up to the Quick Charge 2.0 speed. seancaldwell I hope some clarity can be gained on the new Nexus 5x / 6p. The supplied charger for those is a 5v 3A charger and Google has not said the phone is qualcomm quick charge certified. Are they going with a different charging method to ramp up the amperage and keep the voltage constant at 5v? If so, guess I need to look for a charger capable of outputting 3 amps. DT Try it with a QuickCharge 2.0 charger, see what the time to charged says. seancaldwell Got the 5X and can say that the quickcharge 2.0 chargers I have do bring up the "rapid charging" on the 5X. However, they are limited to 2.4Amps...which is close to the 3A max the 5X can take. So most 2.4Amp chargers will do well with the new Nexus. This is one of my favorites at $7 on Amazon: http://amzn.to/1PEcfO1 DT Do you have any device that can confirm wattage over the wire? seancaldwell Have a drok oled usb multimeter on the way and will do more testing. So far the one linked above is charging the 5X quite quickly. The proof will be in the volts & amps. Will know next week. seancaldwell Have a drok oled usb multimeter on the way and will be able to share volt & amp details next week. Here's the one I bought: http://amzn.to/1GY2z9a Alex Lord Is QC charge a binary thing? What if your multi port charger has a high load (couple of iPads)? Is the QC standard just a ceiling? If your device is getting somewhere between standard charge and QC 2.0, would it take it, or is it all or nothing do you know? DT Did you guys even attempt to read the Motorola Turbo Charger? It supports 9V, 1.6A and 12V, 1.5A. And THAT is why it's better than the Motorola one. Jeruel Canales Thank you for the heads up. This is quite thorough and objective. More power to you! Randy Starkey I've found the monoprice cables at the micro end don't last. IXCC much better. Also 22ga. Hans Great article! Really helped with all this marketing mess. But there's still one more thing: are RAVPower's iSmart and Aukey's AiPower as efficient as the "classic" fast-charging technologies? So far, it seems that they are quite slower, and you see the companies using Qualcomm's Quick Charge ports along with their charging tech. And plus, the ones with a QQC port are at least $5 more expensive. Hans Yeah, you can also add Anker's PowerIQ and other "charging technologies" I'm not aware off to the question. darrendarren Will a 5V/3A wall charger charge supported Quick Charge 2.0 devices as fast as a 9V/1.67A charger? They're both output 15W of power, but is it the same? Microchip 15 watts is all they can "take?" Apparently this article and even the responses are flawed in so many ways with leaps and bounds of misinformation. Firstly, chargers work on the basis of detecting "voltage" not "wattage" in terms of deciding when they get turned on and off. One poster writes the size of the wire matters. The size of the wire carrying the electrical path is not particularly relevant as we are not boosting a car battery. I could post some charts indicating the electrical resistance of wire based on wire diameter, but a few millimeters here or there is like comparing which grain of salt is larger than the other. It's currently carrying capacity when compared the diameter and size of these wall charger cables with one another is entirely insignificant. Comparing 4 AWG battery booster cables with cell phone wall charger cables is another story . Heres how it works regardless of wall charger cables size. When a battery reaches a predetermined maximum voltage, a sensing circuit turns off the charge going to the battery. This is regardless of the "wattage" ratings of the charging unit itself. Secondly, fast charging a battery has negative consequences for the battery regardless of what fancy technological name you would like to attach to it or how it's being accomplished. The laws of physics hasn't changed just because we call it "speed charging" or whatever. The reality is the battery will not cycle for as long therefore you wiill be expecting to replace the battery sooner. Of course, this is good for battery manufacturers from a marketing perspective. The faster you can wear and burn out your battery the better it is for them. The article isn't entirely wrong though. You will indeed enjoy "speed charging" at least until the battery decides to cook itself to death which is probably a few months or so. Doesn't much matter since we are a disposable society anyways. After all why should things last any longer than the next upgraded phone model released 6 months from now? We are reaching the the point of disposable phones so cooking the batteries in a short time is incentive for maximizing profits. So be sure to cook your battery as fast as you can so you can throw it out sooner than we have ever done before. We can just call this charging feature "advanced technology." Is it... Is it really? Like I said before, this article is loaded with misinformation. Flodis The article feels a bit backwards. The charger is not about some power about to hit your phone. The important thing is what voltage is available at the smartphone input connector, Smartphones adapts how much current they use depending on voltage. One major component is the cable between charger and phone. The volage drop is proportional to current X cable resistance. The phone will try to use as much current as possible given the state of charge, battery temperature etc. But not to any extent - It will monitor input voltage. If you have a weak charger that drop in voltage when phone tries to use the required current the phone will try less current and charge time increases. Same if cable voltage drop is significant. It will reduce the charge current until input voltage is fairly ok. What you need is not power. You need a charger capable of the current the phone requires and you need a solid and short USB cable. Look for 2.5A chargers with 5.2Volt output. Then you have headroom for cable voltage drop and even if you loose 0.2Volts in the cable at 2.5A there is still 5.0V at the phone input and it will think this is a rock solid power supply. Even a 5V, 20A charger is useless if cable is thin and long. If cable voltage drop is too large phone will reduce charge current to not overheat or overload what it thinks is a weak power source. MAKAVELI Thanks mate Ga ton I read al that and still don't know if I can use turbo charger 2 on a normal bluetooth headphone!? Or will I ruin its battery? Specter29 Thank you for sharing this ^ ^ David T This article is already out of date as it excludes the new USB C 5V 3A used by Google phones and tablets... but so confusing that there's now multiple standards for quick charging. Pedram Roshan Does the cable need to be a fast charge cable or can you use a regular one? mbcls not all cable are the same. when you plugged in the phone, if it shows "fast charging", you're good. if it shows "cable charging", you need a better cable. Foxtrot Charlie Does quick charge mean quick discharge? Someone told me that if i have time to charge with a non fast charger that it will be slower but the phone will also hold a charge longer; such as a quality vs quantity? sharamall Two complaints about this article: First: I have a Nexus 6, and my mother has a Galaxy 7. Her charger will NOT turbo charge my device, only my OEM Motorola charger does. How come you say any charger will work? Second: this article is missing many important details. Is the USB cord relevant or just the power adapter? (only power adapter I think) What is the downside to turbo charging? (makes phone really hot; can throttle phone's CPU and charging rate if it isn't cool) Does the Apple™ Lightning™ cable have an equivalent technology? (seems so) Ben Favored Son Wait, you ended abruptly, without explaining the importance of using good USB cable between charger and phone. My Android One smartphone came with a fast charger and its technology being compatible with the Quick Charge 2.0 by Qualcomm as stated and explained in the users guide. A few months after this, I came across the Ampere app at the market and tested the current the battery was charging at and the current was between 800ma to 900ma. though it would at times go down to 600ma, and even 400ma but generally stayed between 800ma to 900ma. What was quite interesting was that the Ampere support page discussed how dependent charging current is on the Charger, Charging software in the phone, and on the Cable. Ampere actually was encouraging users of the app to test the best combination of Charger and Cable with the phone for the best optimum charging combination. This was basically one of Ampere app's objectives. I had gone through 1 cheap tablet and an Asus Transformer and even had a couple more USB cables lying around that came with some forgettable gadget I bought, and also a couple of cheap smartphones and so I started using the same charger that came with my Android One with this cable, then that cable, and after testing all the cables. I was surprised and amazed at what a big difference in charging current was between using the original cable that came with my Android One phone with the other cables. The Asus Cable was charging my phone at a constant rate between 1,150ma to 1,200ma. I never attained these levels of charging with the original cable. The other cables were charging at almost the same as the original albeit in a narrower and more stable 800-850ma. A couple of cables from cheap phones performed worst from 40-690ma. The original cable performance was quite dismal. I couldn't imagine shipping an Android One with a substandard cable. Then again, Android One is generally cheap but still, I still expected better quality than this this now considered piece of wire that came with my Android One. I think its important to explain the virtues of using a good USB cable connecting charger, which is plugged to a wall socket, to the phone to deliver a stable charge, and at optimum levels. You need to test what you have to find out. atro430 Great Article, Helped me decide if i should buy this product : https://www.amazon.com/Charge-TOPGREENER-TU1152QC-2-ports-Charger/dp/B01F4HBFHA/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1472159013&sr=8-2&keywords=quick+charge+usb+charger+outlet danwat1234 The animated GIFs on this article is eating up the battery life on my laptop... stop it ISIAH WOLK my business partner wanted SSA-7050-F4 several days ago and discovered a business that hosts an online forms database .

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — Ryan noted that he advised Nunes to add the newly discovered facts about the surveillance of Trump Tower to the existing investigation into Russia's alleged meddling in 2016 US presidential election. "He had told me that a whistleblower type person had given him some information that was new, that spoke to the last administration and part of this investigation," Ryan told CBS News. © AP Photo/ J. Scott Applewhite Nunes Apologizes to Intel Committee for Briefing Trump on SurveillanceOn March 22, Nunes told reporters that the information about Trump team was "incidentally collected" during the transition period. Following the announcement, the intelligence committee chair visited the White House and briefed the US president on the findings. Later, Nunes explained why he decided to brief the press and US President Donald Trump on new intelligence information before telling the ranking Democrat on the committee. These actions triggered immediate criticism of the panel's members, who have not been notified in advance about the additional documents related to Trump's wiretapping claim. On Tuesday, several prominent Democrats called on congressman Nunes to recuse himself from the probe into alleged Russia's election interference. On March 4, Trump took to Twitter to accuse Obama of having his Trump Tower headquarters' "wires tapped" prior to the 2016 presidential election, describing this as the former administration's "new low. The president went on to compare the alleged surveillance to McCarthyism and the Watergate scandal. The claims have been rejected by Obama's representative. The US House and Senate Intelligence Committees have found no credible evidence to support Trump's claims. ...

ADVERTISEMENT Under the legislation, marijuana businesses would gain access to the regulated banking system. Many banks currently are reluctant to open accounts for marijuana businesses because of fears that the federal government could seize the money. Another measure, introduced by Wyden and Sens. Michael Bennett (D-Colo.) and Rand PaulRand PaulWith Freedom Caucus dig, Trump masters the media ... again The Hill's 12:30 Report Pot state Dems want federal regulation of marijuana MORE (R-Ky.), would allow marijuana businesses to claim federal deductions and tax credits, ending what the senators called a tax penalty on those businesses. “This is commonsense legislation that will eliminate the growing tension between federal and state marijuana laws,” said Robert Capecchi, who oversees federal policy for the Marijuana Policy Project. “States are adopting laws designed to improve public safety by replacing the illegal marijuana market with a tightly regulated system of production and sales. The federal government should be working to facilitate that transition, not hinder it.” Anti-legalization advocates say the current balance between federal and state laws are unsustainable, and that marijuana use remains a danger to public health. “While we support federal laws against marijuana legalization, we don't want to see folks locked up or given criminal records for smoking pot,” said Kevin Sabet, who runs Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a group that opposes legalization. “While we don't support an enforcement-centered war on drugs, we do support a targeted approach consistent with public health and social justice that stops the corporate interests driving Big Marijuana.” Oregon is one of eight states where voters have approved ballot measures to legalize marijuana for recreational use. Those new laws put states in conflict with federal law, which still considers marijuana an illegal drug. The vast majority of Americans live in states where marijuana is legal for medical purposes. Until now, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has taken an arms-length approach to legal marijuana states. A DOJ memo issued under the Obama administration deprioritized prosecution of marijuana-related activity, effectively allowing the industry to operate in states where it is legal. Attorney General Jeff SessionsJeff SessionsSessions: Convictions likely needed to end government leaks Sessions, Comey discuss threats with Jewish leaders Pot state Dems want federal regulation of marijuana MORE, who has been hostile to marijuana liberalization laws, has said that agreement, known as the Cole Memo, will stand for now. But public officials in states where marijuana has been legalized — Washington, Colorado, California, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada and Alaska have also legalized pot — remain wary of the Trump administration’s future actions. “I don’t know what direction the Justice Department is going to go, but it is going to raise some legal issues,” Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval (R) told The Hill last month. Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson (D) said in an interview that legalization states would fight back in court if the Cole Memo is revised or rolled back. “It is certainly my hope that the federal government does not undertake any significant changes,” Ferguson said. “States like Washington have legal tools to resist such an effort, in the same way we have legal tools to resist the executive travel ban.” The measures introduced Thursday are unlikely to advance in a Republican-controlled Congress. But marijuana advocates are increasingly optimistic about their chances of moving some legislation during this session of Congress. In recent years, riders to appropriations bills that would block the Justice Department from enforcing federal marijuana laws have gained steam, and advocates hope the increasing number of states where legalization initiatives have passed will mean more allies in Congress. A growing number of Republicans who don’t want the federal government suing their states have backed measures to ease restrictions on marijuana use. Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) sponsored the measure to block Justice from suing over marijuana. Sen.

And Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) introduced legislation to allow doctors working for the Department of Veterans Affairs to discuss medical marijuana with their patients. Pro-marijuana advocates point to public polls that show sentiment has shifted. New data from the General Social Survey released Wednesday shows 57 percent of Americans believe marijuana should be legal, up from 31 percent in 2000 and 44 percent in 2010. “The time for fiction and myth-making is over. The time for science, safety and social justice is now upon us,” said Tom Rodgers, a Washington lobbyist who backs legalization. --This report was updated at 12:00 p.m. Tags Earl Blumenauer Michael Bennet Jeff Sessions Cory Gardner Rand Paul Ron Wyden   View the discussion thread.

(AMD) Stock If You Hate Money Why Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Is Downright Dangerous Recent Posts: Why Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Is Downright Dangerous Freeport-McMoRan Inc (FCX) Stock Still Isn’t Cheap Enough The 7 WORST Stocks to Buy Right Now View All Posts All seems right again for Nvidia Corporation (NADSAQ:NVDA) stock. NVDA stock tumbled last month, after “sell the news” trading following fiscal Q4 earnings and two analyst downgrades. The reaction was swift: Nvidia stock declined almost 20% in five weeks. Source: Shutterstock But Nvidia shares have regained a good chunk of their losses, increasing steadily since early March. The acquisition of Mobileye NV (NYSE:MBLY) by Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) highlighted the value of Nvidia’s opportunity in automotive. Analysts from Goldman Sachs, B. Riley and UBS stepped up to defend the valuation of NVDA stock. In response, investors bought the dip in Nvidia shares. It’s too soon to think the storm has passed for NVDA stock, however. Several risks remain for a stock priced at 32x FY17 consensus earnings-per-share. And investors would be wise to consider those risks — and the likelihood of another correction in Nvidia stock. NVDA Stock: Not Everyone Can Win At the same time Nvidia stock was rallying in 2016, so was Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). AMD actually outperformed NVDA stock in 2016, with AMD gaining 295% versus a 224% increase in Nvidia shares. The optimism toward AMD comes from new products and a new ability to compete, driven largely by the Ryzen line. And there’s good reason for that optimism. But while AMD’s superior competitiveness will come mostly against Intel, AMD’s Polaris and Vega GPUs also make it a tougher competitor for Nvidia. Meanwhile, the backing of Mobileye’s technology with Intel’s scale, capital and connections makes a more fearsome competitor in automotive. Neither end market is a zero-sum game, but at the same time, it seems like something has to give. Mobileye gets bought out for $15 billion. AMD is soaring. NVDA has soared. Are the opportunities in gaming and automotive really that much bigger than projected in 2015? Or are investor expectations starting to price in success for everyone, even though that’s not possible? The latter explanation seems the most likely. And if those expectations change, the price of NVDA shares seems likely to fall as a result. There Are Some Weak Hands Holding Nvidia Stock There’s an “is the glass half-empty or half-full?” type of question regarding the recent trading in NVDA stock. Nvidia bulls might argue that the recent rebound shows that there remains a large number of investors willing to buy any dips in the stock. I’d argue the converse, however. NVDA stock declined 20% — quickly — in what was then a rather bullish broad market, particularly for tech. And the catalysts for that decline weren’t particularly compelling. Q4 earnings looked strong, yet the market sold NVDA stock off. Then two analyst downgrades from smaller firms (Instinet and BMO Capital Markets) changed the narrative around Nvidia stock. From here, that looks like a large group of investors willing to salvage profits after a big run, and a number of NVDA shareholders without a great deal of conviction in the bull case. And the 20% decline begs the question of what might happen if a true negative catalyst — like an earnings miss — comes into play. Even investors with a bullish long-term outlook on NVDA should consider the possibility of a more attractive entry point showing up in 2017.

Connecting with our people through trade mastery, instead of money, is key to productive and happy folks. → Are you a high-performance employee? Please help me better understand you by contributing to a 30-second anonymous survey. Thank you! http://bit.ly/high-performance-survey ← This article is part of an ongoing series on optimizing corporate environments for the High-Performance Employee (HPE). Part 1 is here. Part 2 is here. As the pace of global technology continues to accelerate, competition in emerging micro-segments is becoming incredibly dense. Many of our modern enterprises are struggling to sustain a backlog of innovation projects necessary for the growth demanded by investors and public markets. These same companies are showing signs of a disconnect between executives and high-performance employees. This disconnect shows in the way we design cultures for performance and results in a difficulty retaining and incentivizing our critical employees. Could it be that the key ingredient to retention, morale, productivity and sustainable innovation, is simply to cultivate the trade mastery potential of our high-performance employees (HPEs)? Rather than being tasked with doing the most, high-performance employees (HPEs) are asked to solve the hardest problems in every company. They are the technicians, builders, designers, creatives, culture shapers, narrators and innovators. My latest survey data* shows that 76% of high-performance employees say trade mastery is more important than money when considering career decisions. (*Over 3,000 respondents. For more on how I define HPEs read here.) Many companies lose touch with the concepts of truth in craft and trade mastery—vague concepts to be sure, yet somewhere deep in the mind of the HPE they hold vital importance. Perhaps companies like Patagonia, BMW, Dow Chemical, Intel, Github, Gucci, The North Face, Nike, Apple, Google, Basecamp, NPM, and Amazon can serve as examples. These companies seem to have proven over time that their fundamental focus, either by directive or happenstance, has been to sustain the energy incubated by their founders — an energy focused on technical/creative purity before financial gain. This focus on purity shows itself in high-performance people—reflected by their core principles, the way they think, and their dedication to vocational values. Most importantly, the HPE focus on trade mastery greatly influences where they work and how long they stay. Let’s go deeper. My latest data shows that 76% of HPEs are not primarily motivated by money. But why? The mysteries are hard to explain. It may sound strange, but let’s first talk about the concept of karma. We can consider karma as the mysterious inertia of life’s puzzle. Karma may be better explored by asking some simple questions: What explains to which parents we are born? To which city and country? Of which ethnicity? At which time we are born? Why were we not born as an oyster or a squirrel or a cactus? What explains our childhood temperament? What explains the unique and complex questions we seek answers to as we grow older? Many times more expansive than should be pondered here, the concept of karma encircles the mysteries of life, generational inheritance, and much more. It’s a mysterious concept that addresses the endless mysteries that surround us. Do we find our core skills, or do skills find us? Maybe we can think about trade skills and dedication to craft as a similar type of mystery. How do we choose our skills? The answer to this question is incredibly complex and if followed to its root, will begin to expose the fundamental questions of life itself. How can we explain the illustrator’s life-long curiosity with form? How can we explain the woodworker’s lust for fit, feel, shape and contrast? How can we explain the software engineer’s endless exploration into worlds of code and logic? How can we explain the stylist’s connection with trend? How can we explain the master sax player? How can we explain the mathematician? How can we explain the quantum physicist? What of the folks who were born into a technical or creative family? Simple. But what about the question of why and how they were born into that family? It’s so much more than a game of strategy and Life Building 101. I have no capacity to practically decode it without a simple-minded explanation based on linear thinking. Perhaps a more compelling way to consider the HPE’s connection with their vocational skill set would be that in most cases skills choose us, rather than we choose our skills. Perhaps our intersection with trade skills manifests more like mountaineers drawn to the range, or surfers to the ocean. The Japanese have an interesting concept called Ikigai, likely translated as “a reason for being” or “a reason to get up in the morning.” Surely our HPEs understand this inertia—a compulsion to start or finish each day solving interesting puzzles on the path to mastery. It’s so much more interesting than money. Let’s circle back to our original data point: 76% of high-performance employees (HPEs) say trade mastery is more important than money when considering career decisions. The utility of money as a long-term motivator or a proxy for core understanding and empathy are limited—if not completely misdirected—because an HPE’s connection to their trade resembles more a mysterious spiritual illumination and growing devotion than it does an evolution of practical decisions aimed in a concise direction. And so…using our corporate, bureaucratic, linear and financial logic to understand, reward and empathise with HPEs is silly. HPEs are so often on a mysterious quest to do their best work according to the truth and purity of their craft. This can result in earning great money. Yet how many of our rich HPEs consider money to be the endgame? I wonder how many of them look back later in life with fluffed and lined pockets, only to yearn for their past that focused primarily on the modesty of their principles. If we can understand our HPE’s dedication to craft and skill, and encourage the mastery of such talents by way of corporate culture and directive—then we will be more likely to really listen to our people while designing environments and process systems around them to maximize efficiency, retention, productivity and morale. In doing so, our companies can sustain innovation over long periods of time. Our products will be great. Our people will be happy. And if even for a short time, our work life might seem to make a bit more sense. → Are you a high-performance employee?

Who is John McAfee? He was born in 1945 on a US Army base in Britain, before being raised in Virginia. After working as a programmer and software designer for several companies, including NASA, he began to develop software to combat viruses. In 1987 he founded McAfee Associates, a computer antivirus company. Eventually Intel bought McAfee and changed the name of the branding – something McAfee expressed pleasure over. In August 2009, the New York Times reported that his personal fortune had fallen to $4million from $100million. He moved to Belize and wanted to find medicinal uses for plants on his land. At the DEF CON conference in LA in August 2014 he warned Americans not to use smartphones – suggesting apps are used to spy on clueless customers who do not read privacy agreements. He announced he would seek the office of President of the United States in the 2016 Presidential campaign as a candidate of the Libertarian Party. In May last year he was appointed chief executive chairman and CEO of MGT Capital Investments, later announced it would be renamed John McAfee Global Technologies. He then claimed he and his team had exploited a flaw in the Android operating system that allowed him to read encrypted messages from Whatsapp. Reuters 3 In August 2009, the New York Times reported that his personal fortune had fallen to $4million from $100million Why did he move to Belize? He said he moved to the country in 2008 thinking he would “retire and fish, scuba dive, sail and otherwise enjoy my declining years”. He was 63 at the time, but said he only remained retired for a few months. He lived on the North Island of San Pedro, where roads were impassable and the main mode of transport was the ferry service. Although it was meant to be an escape from business, he ended up starting a new one within a few months of moving there. What does McAfee think happened in Belize? He says in 2011 he caught wind of a government plot to kill him. McAfee claims he recorded options the government was considering to get rid of him, including sniper attack and planting explosives in his car. In response to this he increased his security and carried on verbally attacking the government. In May of that year he says his jungle compound was stormed by 42 paramilitary soldiers, who shot his dog, destroyed property and arrested him on charges that were later dropped. In 2012 his neighbour was murdered – he believes he was the target but the assassins entered the wrong house. He went underground, was arrested in Guatemala and then was returned to the US. AP:Associated Press 3 McAfee claims he recorded options the Belizean government was considering to get rid of him, including sniper attack and planting explosives in his car What will the film be about? Deadline has reported the movie, titled King of the Jungle, centres around McAfee taking a Wired magazine reporter on a tour of his Belize compound. It promises to be a darkly comic look at the intriguing life of McAfee.

It wasn’t the first time Putin floated the idea of a meeting with Trump. Russia had hoped for a thaw in relations with the United States after Mr. Trump’s election, but that has been dashed by the congressional investigation of possible links between Trump’s campaign and Russia.

Finnish President Sauli Niinisto, whose country is set to take the rotating leadership in the Arctic Council in May, said Thursday he would be honored to host such a meeting. Also Thursday, Putin again dismissed what he called “endless and groundless” accusations of Russian meddling in the U.S. election, describing them as part of the U.S. domestic political struggle. Putin sharply criticized what he described as the use of the “Russian card” in U.S. domestic politics, saying it contradicts American interests. “Do we want to completely cut relations?” he said. “Do we want to bring the situation to what it was during the Cuban Missile Crisis of the 1960s?” Earlier this year, Putin thanked Slovenia for its offer to host a proposed meeting with Trump, but noted that it would depend on Washington. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 March 2017 by Military News Intellinetics, Inc. Reports Year-End Results COLUMBUS, Ohio–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Intellinetics, Inc. (OTCQB: INLX), a document solutions software company focused on IntelliCloud™ (a cloud-based document management solution for the Small to Medium Business (SMB) market and business teams within large enterprises), announced financial results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Year End Key Metrics Software as a Service Revenue increased 86% Total Revenue increased 11% Despite net loss improvement, Adjusted EBITDA erosion – a result of sales and marketing investments needed to support and execute our burgeoning pipeline Summary – Year-End Results Revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 were $2,601,733, as compared with $2,336,991 for the same period in 2015, an increase of $264,742, or 11%. Sales of Software as a Service (SaaS) led the way with an 86% increase, which includes data storage and hosting services. Overall, gross margins were 73% and 77% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to product mix. Net loss was $(1,576,311) and $(3,921,428) for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, or $(0.09) and $(0.55) per share, respectively, representing a decrease of $(2,345,117), or 60%. Total decrease in net loss was attributable to the decrease in non-cash and mostly non-recurring expenses, including stock option expense, non-cash interest expense and notes payable conversion underwriting expense associated with the conversion of convertible notes to equity, effected in December 2015, as well as an increase in gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016. However, Adjusted EBITDA loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $(1,023,668), compared with a loss of $(481,454) for the year ended December 31, 2015, a 113% increase. Matthew L. Chretien, President and CEO of Intellinetics, stated, “We made tremendous progress in 2016 and many of the building blocks to create accelerating growth were put in place. We look forward to our quarterly financial results soon reflecting successful execution of our business plan. In the meantime, we look forward to providing progress reports on a growing number of OEM/Embedded channel technology partners.” 2016 Highlights Refined our imaging channel model by streamlining growth through a master distribution partner (such as copier resellers) using IntelliCloud to become a world-class managed business services provider. The partner is initially focusing on its top 150 dealers in its top 30 markets – supported by a mature multi-channel marketing engine and in-field sales teams. Designed, built and launched IntelliCloud University™, allowing dealers (that primarily sell Multi-Function Printers, Managed Print Services or Managed IT Services) to generate more sales by seamlessly adding IntelliCloud document management to their core offerings, while reducing our costs. (www.intelliclouduniversity.com) Continued to grow total revenues quarter-over-quarter all year while focusing on SaaS business. SaaS sales are a recurring revenue model – providing an increasingly growing, stable revenue base while maximizing long-term enterprise value. Launched in Q4, we focused on growing new revenue streams through technology-based partners that have leading cloud-based platforms with large and growing installation bases. This new OEM / Embedded channel segment embeds the sale of IntelliCloud into an existing model vs. as a separate / standalone process. In some cases, this created new offerings that we are also selling through our imaging channel. At the end of December, we initiated a convertible debt financing round of $1.25M (which was fully subscribed in January) to support our expected rapid growth. IntelliCloud™ – Powered by the Intel®NUC IntelliCloud™ is a cloud-based document management platform that is optimized for the vast SMB market segment and business teams within large enterprises who are stuck with paper in business-critical processes. Thousands and thousands of people at any given moment depend upon IntelliCloud to perform their work. IntelliCloud, which is strategically packaged with Intel® technology, provides Law Enforcement Grade security and compliance tools and is supported by a growing network of market-leading reseller partners. Resellers often attach IntelliCloud to the software, hardware, and/or services they already sell without the sales or technical complexity of other less effective options in the market. About Intellinetics, Inc. Intellinetics, Inc. is a Columbus, Ohio-based ECM software company. Intellinetics partnered with Intel to create the IntelliCloud Channel Program that makes it easy to add turnkey document workflow solutions to the copiers, productivity software and services they already provide. IntelliCloud provides dealers a “deploy once, use many” innovation where one IntelliCloud customer sale/activation creates endless possibilities to add other software applications that deliver more value and increase revenue.

Cautionary Statement Statements in this press release which are not purely historical, including statements regarding future business associated with any channel partner, distribution partner, or other reseller; Intellinetics’ future revenues and growth, whether SaaS-based or otherwise; market penetration; and other intentions, beliefs, expectations, representations, projections, plans or strategies regarding future growth, financial results, and other future events are forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, the risks associated with the effect of changing economic conditions, trends in the products markets, variations in the company’s cash flow or adequacy of capital resources, market acceptance risks, the success of our channel partners and distribution partners, technical development risks, and other risks and uncertainties discussed in the annual report on Form 10-K, to be filed on the date of this release, and any previously filed Form 10-Qs and Form 8-Ks. The company cautions investors not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Intellinetics disclaims any obligation and does not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements in this press release. Expanded and historical information is made available to the public by Intellinetics and its Affiliates on its website or at www.intellinetics.com or at www.sec.gov. Non-GAAP Financial Measure Intellinetics uses non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income, balance sheet or statement of cash flows of a company. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or a measure of our liquidity. Intellinetics urges investors to review the reconciliation of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to the comparable GAAP net loss, which is included in this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Intellinetics’ financial performance. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful performance measure and is used by us to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period-to-period and to provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than measures under GAAP can provide alone. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, and other non-cash expenses such as share-based compensation, note conversion warrant/offer expense and other financing related transaction costs.   Reconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA       Year Ended December 31,     2016 2015 Net loss – GAAP ($1,576,311 ) ($3,921,428 ) Interest expense, net 92,570 718,008 Depreciation and amortization 10,687 11,626 Share-based compensation 200,378 430,000 Note conversion/offer warrant expense 235,405 2,083,328 Note conversion/offer underwriting expense 13,603 197,012 Adjusted EBITDA ($1,023,668 ) ($481,454 )     INTELLINETICS, INC. and SUBSIDIARY Consolidated Statements of Operations         For the Year Ended December 31,   2016 2015   Revenues: Sale of software $ 390,583 $ 601,141 Software as a service 525,282 281,899 Software maintenance services 988,690 941,531 Professional services 502,952 382,717 Third Party services 194,226 129,703   Total revenues 2,601,733 2,336,991   Cost of revenues: Sale of software 73,566 125,108 Software as a service 247,928 121,466 Software maintenance services 127,805 128,597 Professional services 135,486 100,768 Third Party services 125,024 72,078   Total cost of revenues 709,809 548,017   Gross profit 1,891,924 1,788,974   Operating expenses: General and administrative 2,118,924 2,541,867 Sales and marketing 1,132,292 791,291 Depreciation 10,687 11,626   Total operating expenses 3,261,903 3,410,560   Loss from operations (1,369,979 ) (1,555,810 )   Other income (expense) Interest expense, net (206,332 ) (2,365,618 )   Total other income (expense) (206,332 ) (2,365,618 )   Net loss $ (1,576,311 ) $ (3,921,428 )   Basic and diluted net loss per share: $ (0.09 ) $ (0.55 )   Weighted average number of common shares outstanding – basic and diluted 16,650,085 7,152,276     INTELLINETICS, INC. and SUBSIDIARY Consolidated Balance Sheets   ASSETS       December 31,     December 31, 2016 2015   Current assets: Cash $ 689,946 $ 1,117,118 Accounts receivable, net 259,497 217,028 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 150,620 46,521   Total current assets 1,100,063 1,380,667   Property and equipment, net 18,783 22,603 Other assets 10,285 10,285   Total assets $ 1,129,131 $ 1,413,555   LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT   Current liabilities: Accounts payable and accrued expenses $ 767,197 $ 826,864 Deferred revenues 665,460 638,193 Deferred compensation 215,012 215,012 Notes payable – current 360,496 401,573 Notes payable – related party – current 38,307 92,805 Total current liabilities $ 2,046,472 $ 2,174,447   Long-term liabilities: Notes payable – net of current portion 585,782 782,206 Notes payable – related party – net of current portion 299,447 127,409 Deferred interest expense 158,062 136,078 Other long-term liabilities – related parties 1,125 12,852   Total long-term liabilities 1,044,416 1,058,545   Total liabilities 3,090,888 3,232,992     Stockholders’ deficit: Common stock, $0.001 par value, 50,000,000 shares authorized;

Contact me: bcovert@thinkprogress.org Mar 30 The woman who’s waging a battle against the gender pay gap on Wall Street The woman who pressured technology companies is waging a battle to get banks to disclose their gender pay information. Diana Ofosu/AP Images Jobs in finance are among those with the largest gender wage gaps. A woman who works as a securities or commodities broker, for example, makes less than 55 percent of what her male coworkers make, on average. A female financial specialist makes 60 percent of what a male one does. Even though nearly a third of financial advisers are women, they make just 62 percent of what men in those jobs make. But women who work for large banks may not know how their pay stacks up against their male colleagues’ — a lack of transparency that makes it tough to tackle the problem. A new campaign wants to change that by pushing six major financial institutions to publish data on their gender pay gaps. Natasha Lamb, a managing director at investor Arjuna Capital, is using her firm’s position as a shareholder at American Express, Bank of America, Citigroup, JP Morgan, MasterCard, and Wells Fargo to pressure the firms to disclose how female employees’ pay stacks up against the men’s. “We see gender pay equity as one of the structural barriers that’s keeping women from moving up the corporate ladder into positions of leadership,” she said. “If we don’t have that level of transparency, this compensation issue that has been in a black box for decades is going to continue to stay in one.” “If we don’t have that level of transparency, this compensation issue that has been in a black box for decades is going to continue to stay in one.” This isn’t the first time Lamb has deployed this strategy. Last year, she and Arjuna filed shareholder resolutions at nine technology companies — Adobe, Amazon, Apple, eBay, Expedia, Facebook, Google, Intel, and Microsoft — calling for the same thing. “We started engaging with technology because it’s such a male-dominated field,” Lamb said. Seven of the tech firms eventually disclosed data on their pay practices; Facebook and Google “simply paid lip service,” she said. But she was encouraged by what happened at one company. As a pilot for the larger project, she first filed a resolution with eBay. The proposal went to a vote. The first time around, it got just 8 percent support — but the following year, after other technology firms had committed to releasing their data, her proposal got 51 percent support. “It’s really impressive, and it shows a lot of momentum on this issue,” she said. Now, she’s hoping to take the momentum to Wall Street. So far she hasn’t gotten a very warm reception. Five of the six banks have printed opposition statements alongside the proxy statement shareholders will read about her proposal and the last has expressed its opposition. None of the banks responded to a request for further comment. American Express pointed to its statement of opposition, in which it urges shareholders to vote against Lamb’s proposal because “we feel that our employees are compensated fairly regardless of gender.” Bank of America did the same; its statement reads, “Our company is committed to fairly and equitably compensating all of our employees and maintains robust policies and practices to reinforce our commitment.” Wells Fargo says it is “committed to ensuring that we do not discriminate pay on the basis of gender.” Citi urges shareholders to vote no because it “would be costly and time-consuming, and in light of our many efforts in this area, would not offer stockholders meaningful additional information.” None of this has surprised Lamb. “Any outside proposals for the most part are always opposed by management,” she said. The next test will be when shareholder voting begins in late April at Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo. Lamb’s proposals aren’t likely to get overwhelming support at first. But she hopes that if pressure keeps up, what happened at eBay may happen at these firms, too. She sees her campaign as an important part of addressing gender inequities. As shareholders, she said, “We have the right to voice issues that we think are material risks or or opportunities at companies and to place proposals on the ballots of those companies for other shareholders to weigh in on. This is an important leverage point.” Having this data on what companies are doing to address gaps is important for shareholders, she said, so investors can judge them “on an apples to apples basis.” “As investors, we expect that companies will be adopting any pay practices that are going to benefit their brands, their ability to attract talent, and their performance,” she said. And she thinks pay transparency can accomplish all three. “Even if you have a quarter or a third of investors saying, ‘We care about this and think you should do this,’ that’s a strong signal that management should act on the issue,” she said. Meanwhile, she thinks her prodding can get these banks out ahead of the curve. “What we’re trying to encourage is to institutionalize this process, not wait around for policymakers to tell them they need to report out on the gender pay gap,” she said. She sees no reason why big banks shouldn’t have to be brought into the debate over the gender wage gap. “It’s certainly not an issue where [banks] should be held to a lower standard than the tech companies who came forth with their data last year,” she said.

We’re not pencil pads and lab coats, but games and lasers.” by Nicole Piper More stories by Nicole Piper March 30, 2017, 5:30 AM EDT From Subscribe Reprints Two Bit Circus Inc. co-founder and onetime clown Brent Bushnell spends his days playing games. In a converted warehouse in East Los Angeles, the 38-year-old races around a 10-foot-tall hexagonal tower, frantically pressing buttons in an attempt to beat the clock. He scores, high-fiving a guest who guesses, correctly, that it’s a giant, multiplayer version of Bop It!, the popular 1990s game that prompts players to twist, crank, spin, and pull knobs and levers. (From left) Two Bit Circus founders Gradman and Bushnell. Photographer: Yael Malka for Bloomberg Businessweek “Most people are antisocial,” Bushnell says. “If you were brought together around games and entertainment, instantly the barriers blast away.” He and co-founder Eric Gradman are betting they can lure people away from TVs and phones and into tech-enhanced versions of the Fascination parlors that sprung up at every seaside resort from California to New Jersey in the 1920s. Their investors agree. In January, Two Bit closed a $15 million funding round to build a chain of “micro amusement parks,” with the first one scheduled to open in L.A. in early 2018. You could say Bushnell was born to do this. His dad, Nolan Bushnell, who founded Atari and Chuck E. Cheese, is often called the father of electronic gaming. Nolan never missed a chance to school Brent on the ABCs of running a business. At an ice cream parlor, he’d say, “Let’s look at the shop floor economics of this place,” the younger Bushnell recalls, and ask him to guesstimate how much the cashiers got paid and how much the refrigerators cost. Gradman and Bushnell started collaborating in 2008 after meeting through a mutual friend. They quickly bonded over their shared past in the circus and a love of tinkering. “We are not your most typical nerds,” Bushnell says. “We’re not pencil pads and lab coats, but games and lasers and robots.” The two began to meet regularly to build games and eventually started renting out their contraptions as attractions for corporate events. “We literally became a high-tech circus, dragging these games to parties and taking them down at the end,” Bushnell says. “Fire’s so much more fun,” Bushnell says, “and you don’t die, because you’re wearing a fire suit.” Photographer: Yael Malka for Bloomberg Businessweek After putting on a series of weekend carnivals in a handful of cities, the pair began raising money to open a permanent space. Intel Corp. invested in Two Bit Circus after Bushnell and Gradman provided the entertainment at a few of its events. The two companies also have a partnership to make interactive games and builder kits for kids. “With Two Bit, we saw this opportunity to basically disrupt the entertainment industry,” says Christine Herron, the director of Intel Capital, the chipmaker’s venture arm. Out-of-home entertainment is a catchall category covering everything from movie theaters and bowling alleys to amusement parks. It’s an industry in flux: The Ringling Bros. circus announced it will be shutting down in May after a 146-year run, yet theme parks such as those of Six Flags Entertainment Corp. and Walt Disney Co. continue to thrive by doing things like marrying old-fashioned roller coasters with virtual-reality special effects. “I think the key is having something that is different and dynamic,” says Jefferies analyst Andy Barish. “A static entertainment experience tends to not be sustainable.” The most important business stories of the day.

(Nolan Bushnell isn’t an investor, but he has a seat on the eight-person board.) For their first location, the founders have signed a lease on a 50,000-square-foot warehouse space in Downtown L.A. “Our audience is going to be the millennials,” says Kim Schaefer, who leads Two Bit’s location scouting. “As we look at rolling this out, we’ll be a little more open-minded.” That could mean opening outposts in malls and shopping centers, a move the company has also considered. The plot lines in the VR games will vary, so visitors will have a reason to come back. Photographer: Yael Malka for Bloomberg Businessweek Among the attractions at Two Bit Circus’s Los Angeles space will be robot bartenders and a 30-minute “story room,” a variant of the popular type of adventure game in which players have to solve a series of puzzles to exit a locked room. There will also be a 1,000-square-foot virtual-reality arena where guests will compete against one another in video games. Unlike in regular arcade games, which have a limited set of outcomes, the plot lines in the VR games will vary, so visitors will have a reason to come back, Bushnell says. “In one of the episodes, we’re trying to get the ambassador home,” he says. “The next episode, we’re exploring the planet. The next episode, we’re in a dogfight with the bad guys. Freaking Star Trek did 10 seasons of that!” The giant Bop It! stands in the entrance of the company’s workshop in East L.A., alongside what looks like a few slabs of wood with a screen on top. A few weeks later these will be transformed into an arcade-style game in which players must traverse a minefield. Photos of inventions past and future line one wall. One showcases a dunk tank that uses fire instead of water. “Fire’s so much more fun,” Bushnell says, “and you don’t die, because you’re wearing a fire suit.” The bottom line: With backing from Intel and guidance from Atari’s founder, a pair of former clowns are pitching micro amusement parks.

Most companies and organisations today employ various technologies to function in the digital economy. The people of todays workforce, especially recent college graduates, are less and less likely to accept the divide that has traditionally existed between personal digital technology and digital work tools. More and more, the technologies in the workplace must be as seamless and easy-to-use as those we use in our every day lives. By implementing more agile, attractive tools in the workplace, businesses can better attract and retain talentand talent is the lifeblood of any organisation. Thus, it becomes crucial that when companies roll out new workplace technologies, they introduce them with the appropriate user adoption strategies to better ensure that their employees will embrace each digital advance.   Computacenter, in collaboration with Intel, believes that human technology is what businesses should focus on when introducing new digital tools because without looking at the people, user adoption of new technologies may fail and companies can lose out on investments and employees. What this means is that, while a constant advance in technology is essential, its the people using that technology that are really at the heart of the matter. Paul Bray, Chief Technologist in Workplace and Mobile sectors at Computacenter, explains the importance of taking a user experience approach, saying, If you choose the wrong product, or your users reject it, you may end up paying ongoing costs for something that isnt being used.   It is also extremely important that organisations take stock of the current and needed work styles of their employees, to get a better sense of how to approach the implementation of new technology in a way that includes and serves the people who will use it. Intels Director of Business Solutions, Jim Henrys, outlines three work styles that people use, including the freedom to work on the go, collaboration, and the focused productivity of a personal workspace. He argues, People like to work seamlessly and hassle free. Its what enables them to focus on their talents and their objective. Thats how they become happy and productive. But, if you cant help people change, then simply throwing technology at them wont make a difference. You need to work on mindset.   Todays business world should be about human collaboration and creativity. By taking a user centric view when looking at the way technology gets integrated into organisations, and focusing on user adoption as the end goal of the introduction of any new digital tool, businesses can anticipate not only more collaboration across and within departments, but enhanced overall productivity and creativity. Computacenter is there to help you find the user adoption strategies that are best for your company.   Learn more!

Instead, Speaker Paul RyanPaul Ryan6 reasons 'TrumpCare' flatlined Overnight Healthcare: Ryan says key ObamaCare payments will continue during House lawsuit White House invites House Intel Dem to view documents MORE’s decision to pull the bill from the House floor and regroup reflects an opportunity to learn from recent history and get it right. Not a single hearing was held on the AHCA, which meant that patients, employers, providers and plans had no voice in the process. Democrats were shut out too. And analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office revealed that the bill would drastically reduce the number of Americans with coverage and cut federal Medicaid support to the states. Perhaps now it is time to take an incremental approach that benefits from widespread stakeholder input. ADVERTISEMENT The problems in the individual market have not evaporated.  Ensuring stability for 2018 and beyond is one of the most important actions policymakers can take to guarantee that millions of hard-working Americans avoid dangerous and costly disruptions in coverage and care.  We applaud the administration for its early steps to tighten enrollment processes and urge Congress to quickly address the funding questions. No business can be expected to stay afloat absent basic information about money available. With filing deadlines set for June, time is running out for our nation’s leaders to ensure the market is stable and sustainable.   Beyond the immediate challenges in the individual market, we all know much more can be done to create a high-quality, affordable health system. The members of the Alliance of Community Health Plans are not-for-profit health plans that share a mission to improve the health of the communities they serve. They work together with providers to deliver high-quality, affordable, community-based care to more than 18 million people across the country. Value-based care that rewards doctors and hospitals for doing what is in the best interest of the patient, is critical to a successful, affordable health care system. That’s why we’re focused on smart reforms that prioritize cost-saving measures for patients and improvements to the quality and availability of care. If policymakers are serious about the cost of care, they will return with all due haste to the problem of sky-high drug prices. Rising drug costs are driving up premiums and taking a massive financial toll on Medicare and Medicaid. President Trump voiced his concern in January, saying, “We have to get prices down for a lot of reasons. We have no choice. For Medicare, for Medicaid, we have to get the prices way down.” The president even went as far as to say that pharmaceutical companies are “getting away with murder.” The first step is transparency. Insurers are required to file rates with state regulators; doctors and hospitals must now release pricing information. Isn’t it time Big Pharma do the same? We know that tackling this problem will require new and outside-the-box solutions that foster both innovation and competition. Other industries manage to develop new products and compete on cost. Why not our drug industry? We, at The Alliance of Community Health Plans, hold the view that the overriding goal is to get the right therapy to the right patient at the right time for the right cost. Government policy must also encourage and support innovations in value-based treatment and patient-centered care, including the use of telehealth to increase access and efficiency of care. Telehealth should be particularly important to Members of Congress from rural districts, many of which are facing health crises related to substance abuse and lack of access to treatment.  The Trump administration and House leadership will gain little if they dwell on the American Health Care Act as a loss; instead it should be viewed as a learning experience and an opportunity to course correct. Now is the time for everyone to roll up their sleeves, look toward the future, reach across the aisle — and figure out whether they want to be known for dismantling the ACA at all costs, or for taking smart steps to improve it.  Ceci Connolly is president and CEO of the Alliance of Community Health Plans and a former national health correspondent for the Washington Post.

As expected, both devices come with big displays, super thin bezels, and top-of-the-line specs. They look good. Quotes in the article Microsoft Corp MSFT ▲ 65.71 +0.24 +0.37% Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 143.93 -0.19 -0.13% Asustek Computer Inc ASUUY ▲ 41.85 +1.55 +3.85% Perhaps the most curious bit of news, though, isn’t about the phones so much as an accessory that supports them: the DeX. Short for “desktop extension,” this is a little dock that effectively turns the Galaxy S8 or S8+ into a desktop computer. So if you wanted to finish a Word doc you started typing on the bus, for instance, you could pop the Galaxy S8 into the DeX, hook up a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, and continue on the bigger screen. When everything is connected and the DeX is plugged into a monitor, the phone stretches out its Android skin to look like a Windows-esque PC platform. It seems pretty clean. The DeX itself has ports for USB-C, HDMI, Ethernet, and the older USB 2.0, and comes with its own cooling fan to keep your phone from overheating. You can still connect the web over LTE.© Provided by Business Insider samsung dex Samsung’s own browser, email, calendar and other apps have been reworked to fit the more spacious screen, but the company says it’s also getting Microsoft and Adobe to adapt their Office and Lightroom apps, respectively, to the non-mobile environment. Samsung isn't saying how much the DeX will cost or when it'll be available, but past leaks have said it'll cost €150 in Europe. So it could be pricey. Given that the Galaxy S8 itself isn’t cheap, Samsung is pitching the DeX as a neat, productivity-boosting extra for Galaxy diehards more than a core aspect of the phone itself.  A dream that will not die That's probably for the best. Samsung is just the latest in a string of tech companies who have tried to sell phones that can also be PCs. Thus far, none of them have taken off. Tech people call this “convergence” — the idea that a single gadget, in this case the smartphone, can swallow all other device types and become the One True Computer for whatever you need. The thinking behind it makes sense: The smartphone is already the most popular way people access the internet, and the technology behind it is only getting more powerful. Apple’s A-series of mobile chips are at the point where you can at least put them in the same conversation as an Intel desktop processor, and last year Microsoft showed how it can run its full Windows 10 operating system — albeit partially through emulation — on a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip. The Galaxy S8 itself runs on the latest and fastest Snapdragon 835 chip.© Provided by Business Insider samsung dex Meanwhile, more and more people are comfortable turning to less-robust devices like tablets and Chromebooks to fill their computing needs. If the phone is good and strong enough, why buy two or three computers when you could just have one? It’s an attractive pitch — which helps explain why Samsung is far from the first company to make something like it. Here's a quick history lesson: • Back in 2011, Motorola released the Atrix 4G, an Android phone you could plug into a “Lapdock,” a $500 laptop shell you could use to run the phone in a desktop environment. The phone itself was powerful at the time, but the Lapdock’s price and limited functionality kept it as more of a gimmick than a game-changer. • Also in 2011, Asus introduced its PadFone line. This was a series of Android phones that could dock in the back of a tablet shell and power that sort of form factor. Asus released a few iterations of this, but hasn’t launched a new model since 2014. • UK software maker Canonical has repeatedly tried to position its Ubuntu OS as a platform that works across devices, to little consumer success. In 2013, it raised millions on Indiegogo for an Ubuntu Edge phone that’d run Ubuntu when plugged into a desktop, but the company couldn’t get the astronomical $32 million it asked for, and it subsequently scrapped the project. It later launched a tablet that tried something similar, but it never really caught on. The company is now looking more at the Internet of Things. • Microsoft has taken the biggest stab at this idea, with its “Continuum” feature for Windows 10 designed to scale the OS down for phone sizes. If you plug a phone like HP’s Elite x3 into a dock, it’s meant to become a full Windows PC. There are still some features missing, though, and Windows phones have long lacked app developer support. That’s made Continuum a niche feature, at best, for Windows loyalists. • Jide’s Remix OS has transformed Android into a desktop-friendly design, but is still at the mercy of Google’s own software updates, and is again more known by enthusiasts than anything else. • Various crowdfunded projects have pitched the idea of a dock into which you could plug an Android phone and translate its software to a big screen. The Superbook, for instance, is a laptop “shell” that raised nearly $3 million on Kickstarter last year. Sentio, the company behind it, missed its original shipping date, but on Wednesday said it plans to start shipping the device in June for $139. Familiar concerns While all of these projects have had their individual issues, the underlying problem in each case is that the software just wasn’t cooked enough to be a full PC. The DeX will work with the most popular devices to take on this idea, but right now, it’s likely to have the same hangup: Android isn’t quite there yet for bigger screens. You can run multiple apps at once, but if an app isn’t designed for the DeX, it’ll be displayed in a phone- or tablet-sized window. Those apps then won't be resizable. We’ve seen this issue before with Android apps running on Google’s Chromebooks.© Provided by Business Insider samsung dex Even then, a lot of Android apps that are ostensibly built for big screens — even Android's Settings menu — resemble blown-up phone apps, with white space aplenty. It’s a similar problem to what Samsung just ran into with its Galaxy Tab S3 tablet: Google and Android developers just haven’t cared about this use case, so the experience has been sloppy, and Google itself seems to be favoring Chrome OS as its big-screen platform over Android. Still, there are reasons to think things will get better. The latest Android update, Nougat, made a number of concessions to larger screens, allowing two apps to run side-by-side, and the upcoming Android O looks like it’ll take that further, with things like improved keyboard support. Google is making Android on large screens a focus. But here you’ll have to wait on Samsung to update its software to take advantage of whatever comes next. And while Samsung says it's working to have "many more" apps support the DeX, the fact that the dock is made for a small subset of Galaxy phones gives reason to doubt how many other developers will jump onboard.  The DeX does have one trick that could get around Android's shortcomings: Samsung says it's working with software companies like Citrix and VMWare to let you run a virtualized (i.e., streamed) version of Windows 10 off the phone. That would give you a more desktop-ready OS, but it's a solution that hasn't run smoothly on past Windows phones. We’ll have to test the DeX further to see how well this all works — and how much the Galaxy S8 can handle — but it’s best to think of this as an add-on more than the next step for how smartphones collide with the PC. It’s something the iPhone cannot do. Still, it looks like Android will need to keep pressing forward before Samsung can accomplish what Microsoft and Motorola have failed to do.

Richard Burr, a Republican from North Carolina, in a joint appearance with the vice chairman of the committee, Democrat Mark Warner. We will get to the bottom of this, Warner emphasized at a press conference in the Capitol. Kushner, said Burr, is one of 20 people who will be questioned in private by senators as part of the probe starting next week, although the name of the presidents son-in-law is the one that has had the biggest public impact. The White House said on Monday that Kushner will testify voluntarily about his contacts with Russian officials before the Senate Intel Committee. The influential husband of Trumps older daughter Ivanka will be questioned when the committee knows exactly the scope of what there is to ask questions about, said Burr, adding that seven experts are analyzing an unprecedentedly large number of intelligence documents, adding that they number in the thousands. Burr said that a preliminary review of the classified information will be completed within a few weeks, although on Thursday the first public hearing with foreign policy experts will be held. With their appearance before reporters, Burr and Warner were trying to publicly guarantee the independence and integrity of their investigation, amid surging doubts about the impartiality of another simultaneous probe being conducted by the House of Representatives. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, a Republican, has been criticized by both Democratic and Republican lawmakers for what they say is his lack of independence. Last week, Nunes went alone to the White House and, without advising any of his committees members in advance, announced at a press conference that he had informed Trump about the possibility that his communications could have been indirectly intercepted while US agents were eavesdropping on other people. The fact that Nunes supposedly met with a White House official and received secret information has aroused doubts about his independence from the Trump administration. In addition to the two congressional probes, the FBI has also opened its own investigation into the matter of Russian election meddling and Moscows links with the Trump campaign.   Enter your email address to subscribe to free headlines (and great cartoons so every email has a happy ending!) from the Latin American Herald Tribune:   RSS Feed [ Home ] [ About Us ] [ Who's Who ] [ Contacts ] [ Help ] Copyright Latin American Herald Tribune - 2005-2015 © All rights reserved

They are devices that combine a touch screen, high-precision digitiser and pen, with huge computing power. iTWire was invited to a hands-on session with the Surface Studio and its Surface Dial. Tina Flammer, Microsoft Australia Surface Product Marketing Lead, and Patrick Burgess, Microsoft Surface Product Specialist, provided a tour of the intricacies of the Surface Studio, including the reason that it does not fold flat onto a desk – no coffee spills are allowed. Flammer said, “It is for people who bring ideas to life – artists, photographers, videographers, file editors, architects, draftsmen, engineers and perhaps one may sit on the CEO’s desk. “A lot of thought and collaboration has gone into the design. While it replaces separate screens and digitisers it is also a huge canvas for creativity. While it computes, there is nothing else like it in the creative space.” Burgess was chuffed with the Zero-gravity hinge (one finger can alter its angle) that goes down to a 20° tilt. During use it became evident why desktop touch screen monitors angled at 90° and 600mm away have not been popular – one needs to get closer to the workspace. The screen aspect ratio is 3:2, just like the Surface Pro and Book and it seems more useful than a 16:9 screen. The colours were good, courtesy of the 4500 x 3000, 192ppi, 1100:1 contrast, Pixel Sense display. Burgess said it had individually colour calibrated display adjustments for sRGB, DCI-P3 and vivid colour P3-D65 so it would reproduce Pantone colours to full-colour volume in movies. “It is better than 99% of colour calibrated displays out there,” Flammer claimed. The Surface Dial is like a 145g hockey puck shape with a non-slip base that can be used on the screen or the desk. The best way to describe it is as a companion to the Surface Pen. For example, one can push down and it reveals a circular on-screen menu that can be rotated through. It can control pen, brush, eraser, colour selection, and many more context sensitive commands. Flammer said that the Dial API was freely available and programs like Sketchable were taking full advantage of it. Burgess pointed out that the computing power was in the 250 x 220 x 32.2 mm base. It houses an Intel Core i5 to i7, Intel and NVIDIA GeForce graphics processors, SSD and SATA HDD, up to 32GB RAM, Wi-Fi AC/Wi-Di/Bluetooth/Xbox wireless, 4 x USB 3.0, Mini-DisplayPort, 3.5mm audio, and gigabit Ethernet ports. And it comprises most of the 9.56kg product weight – the screen is 12.5mm.   The Microsoft officials said the Windows 10 Creators update was not a reference to the original designers but to the creative aspects being incorporated into Windows this April. It will provide enhanced inking and drawing tools including an onscreen ruler that makes drawing a straight line easy, new 3D Paint, ink to text, math recognition, and more. Finally, security. It has Windows Hello biometric login, a TPM chip and IT system administrators can bring it into the Windows management portfolio – or it can be a standalone computer at home. Pricing The base unit with an Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce 965M (2GB), 1TB Hybrid drive is $4599. It comes with the Surface Pen, keyboard and mouse. The Studio Dial is $149.95. The top of the range Intel Core i7, 32GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce 980M (4GB), 2TB Hybrid drive costs a$6599. Pre-orders start now and general availability is from 27 April. iTWire has been asked to review one in mid-April.

The move means that the Chinese telecommunications equipment maker has ended more than a year of tension with the U.S. government. However, in the view of experts, the negative impact of the case on ZTE's earnings and operations is not over yet. Last year, the U.S. Department of Commerce placed export restrictions on ZTE as a penalty for violating U.S. sanctions on Iran. The department's action prohibited U.S. suppliers from doing business with the Chinese company. The removal from the blacklist is crucial for ZTE, which is the world's fourth-largest telecom equipment supplier, although it mainly relies on chips from U.S. companies such as Qualcomm and Intel, Wang Yanhui, secretary-general of the Mobile China Alliance, told the Global Times Wednesday. This partially explains why ZTE agreed to pay criminal and civil penalties of 2 million and an additional penalty of 0 million to U.S. Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security. “ZTE acknowledges the mistakes it has made, takes responsibility for them, and remains committed to positive change in the company,” said Zhao Xianming, chairman and CEO of ZTE, said in a press release on March 7. Zhao was appointed in April last year, which was perceived as a move to revamp the company's management in the wake of U.S. allegations. Following the U.S. fines, ZTE reported a net loss of 2.35 billion yuan (1 million) for 2016. It said it would have reported net profit of 3.83 billion yuan last year, up 19.2 percent, if it had not made a provision for the U.S. penalty, according to its annual earnings report to the Hong Kong stock exchange. The penalty not only will continue hurting ZTE's profit but also its ability to pursue innovation, Xiang Ligang, chief executive of domestic telecom industry portal cctime.com, told the Global Times Wednesday “It probably doesn't have much money to support its internal research and development, as the profits for three years will all be used to pay the U.S. fines,” said Xiang. The total fine of up to .2 billion is the largest sanctions-violation fine imposed against a Chinese company by the U.S. government, reportedly even exceeding ZTE's overall profit of 7.3 billion yuan over the past seven years. Wang has an optimistic view of the future of ZTE, which he suggested would not face capital issues, as fundraising will not be hard for the State-owned company. Both Wang and Xiang said that the U.S. penalty was a good thing for companies like ZTE, which will definitely learn a lesson from the case. Wang believed that ZTE would strictly follow local rules and laws in the future when it makes deals overseas. Moreover, Chinese companies will see the significance of developing their own core technologies in case they are handicapped by excessive dependency on U.S. patents, said Xiang. “What ZTE experienced may also happen to other Chinese technology companies at a time when Sino-U.S. relations are full of political uncertainties.” On March 21, the U.S. government published an online statement saying that it had imposed sanctions on 11 foreign entities and individuals including nine from China for transfers to Iran's missile program. Xiang said that those six Chinese companies won't all reach agreements with the U.S. easily, if they have alternatives. “I don't think Huawei Technologies Co would be as vulnerable as ZTE, because it is strong in intellectual property,” Xiang said.

No thanks. Reply 0 welbot @welbot Mar 30, 2017, 12:57pm Indeed! For a resolution like that, the 965m will no doubt struggle with many things. Should be fine for general PC stuff, but start getting in to graphic work or games, and unless you get the 4gb version, it's not going to cope too well. Even then it'll struggle with that res. My desktop 4gb 960gtx coped reasonably well at 2160p for most games, but I doubt even that would have done too well at 4500x3000! Reply 0 barry @barry Mar 30, 2017, 1:29pm You have to remember that when companies are designing and testing these devices, they start about 2 years ago so when they reach market, they are using hardware about two years old or even a year old. The next version of this will hopefully have great specs. Reply 0 pixelwhip @pixelwhip Mar 30, 2017, 12:47pm as a graphic designer, if this was just a screen i'd buy it in a flash.. Otherwise the specs of this machine are woefully inadequate for my needs; so no thanks..

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 March 2017 by satprnews satprnews Internet of Things (IoT) In Retail Market is Expected to Reach USD 94.44 Billion by 2025 The global IoT in retail market is expected to reach USD 94.44 billion by 2025, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc. This growth can be attributed to the merging of digital and in-store operations in retail stores. Browse the report: http://www.orbisresearch.com/reports/index/internet-of-things-iot-in-retail-market-analysis-by-solution-by-hardware-beacons-rfid-tags-sensors-wearables-by-service-by-technology-bluetooth-low-energy-near-field-communication-zigbee-by-region-and-segment-forecasts-2014-2025 Digital channels are becoming an important touchpoint for an Omni channel experience. Retailers are focusing on gaining a competitive advantage by installing smart shelves and RFID sensors, which detect low inventory and track products throughout the respective supply chain. The adoption of IoT also helps retailers to revolutionize the delivery operations and retail supply chain. The increasing Internet of Things spending in retail sectors for the purpose of premises monitoring, product monitoring, supply chain monitoring, and customer monitoring is driving the demand for IoT-based solutions. Cloud-based IoT solutions are enabling retailers to monitor and analyze the existing processes to improve them with incremental investments in capital equipment. However, with the rising degree of IoT penetration, retailers are still struggling on capitalizing IoT-enabled capabilities. Request a sample of the report: http://www.orbisresearch.com/contacts/request-sample/210689 The retail Internet of Things market is expected to witness promising growth as the industry is evolving from the passive approach of monitoring consumer behavior. Optimizing and automating supply chain is one of the key factors for the adoption of connected technology among retailers. However, fragmented technology standards and increasing security concerns are expected to hamper the industry growth. Further key findings from the report suggest: The retail IoT software is expected to be the fastest-growing segment owing to the increasing adoption of retail analytics solutions. Beacons are expected to grow at a CAGR of over 24%. This growth can be attributed to its increasing adoption for enhancing customer in-store experience. Professional services are expected to dominate the market over the forecast period. Buy the report@http://www.orbisresearch.com/contact/purchase/210689 Solution providers are focusing on providing Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and Payment-as-a-Service (PaaS) to retailers. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is expected to witness the fastest growth over the forecast period as this technology is gaining prominence in pre-tailing, payments, and post-payments operations. Latin America is expected to reach a revenue share of over 12% by 2025 due to the demand for innovation in infrastructure technology in retail outlets. The key industry players include Intel Corporation, Impinj Inc., RetailNext Inc., Allerin Tech Pvt. Ltd., and Losant IoT Inc.

Afinidad-Bernardo (philstar.com) | Updated March 31, 2017 - 12:09pm Actress, photography enthusiast and FujiFilm ambassador Bea Alonzo Photo release MANILA, Philippines —  Studies show that modern Filipino women are much into fashion and technology. In time for Women’s Month this March, multinational agency J. Walter Thompson (JWT) Philippines released the results of its “Filipina Next” study based on quantitative and qualitative research among Filipinas across socio-economic classes ABCDE and between the ages of 18 to 70.  According to the results of “Filipina Next,” 85 percent of Filipinas surveyed believe that technology empowers them, while 89 percent uphold that technology gives them a voice. “Technology has an important role in driving the Filipina forward, both in being a global citizen and in finding new solutions,” JWT Philippines stated. Social media, the study expounded, has allowed Filipinas to voice out issues that matter to them to people all over the world, as well as hear others’ stories. “New apps and gadgets have also helped her manage her day-to-day life better, such as having more information on her health and allowing her to stay on top of her business even when home,” the press statement added. Lifestyle Feature ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch: For those on the lookout for the hottest tech treats in town, check out these cool new gadgets ideal for travel and summer getaways. Actresses Erich Gonzales and Jessy Mendiola shot these selfies using Vivo V5 Plus smart phone. Studies show that technology has an important role in driving the Filipina forward. Photo release Creative ways to store Instax prints After the Photo Diary, FujiFilm Philippines launches the Memory Lane album, a unique Instax album made of thick-bordered pages where one can keep Instax prints. “Our mission is to keep memories on hand and make sure that they would be available for future generations to gaze at,” says Takuya Maeda, FujiFilm Philippines Division Head for Electronic Imaging and Photo Imaging. People nowadays, according to him, have become careless in taking pictures unlike before. “Filipinos love taking photos...We have endeavored to help them preserve their memories in the best possible way, especially now since it is graduation and summer season, when people really need to keep important memories.” The Memory Lane album has been designed to protect precious prints from dust, dirt, moisture and sunlight to reduce fading and ensure that they stand the test of time. It is bundled up with the Instax Mini 8 and a range of digital cameras. Actress and FujiFilm ambassador Bea Alonzo suggests designing the album in many creative ways, such as for a wedding proposal or as personal recipe book. Users are further encouraged to doodle on the sides, place stickers, even write haiku or short poems to make their albums not only unique but very personal and heart-warming. Memory Lane album kit The shop for the rough and tough From weekend warriors, Filipinos today, says entrepreneur Jay Tengo, have become workday-to-weekend warriors, which means many are now going straight to their outdoor adventures right after work. Thus, if there are day-to-night outfits, there also bags and accessories with the look, storage, strength and functionality, flexible enough for office-to-outdoor use. These goods can all be found in Tengco’s new lifestyle shop for the mobile urban warrior, Urban Rugged Gear (URGe). Located at the second floor of Greenbelt 1 in Makati City and at the second floor of Theater Mall in Greenhills, URGe carries innovative gear such as portable solar power systems; earphones made to never to fall out even under rigorous physical activity; action cameras; protective covers that can turn your regular phone into a professional diver’s camera; modular bags with removable parts; and gadget bags made of handmade textiles from artisan villages in Ghana, Guatamela, India, Indonesia and Vietnam.   Gadget bags made of handmade textiles from artisan villages in Ghana, Guatamela, India, Indonesia and Vietnam. Handmade two-in-one laptop/tablet Electronics company HP Philippines recently unveiled its latest hybrid innovation, the HP Spectre x360. To highlight the laptop’s unique feature as a “union between artisanal craftsmanship and functional ingenuity,” it was launched together with versatile art pieces from renowned furniture designer Kenneth Cobonpue and the Benildean Industrial Designers Organization. The new premium laptop is said to be “more artisan than manufactured” and can either be used as a laptop or tablet, said HP Philippines managing director Pallasena Viswanath. “It provides exceptional performance and design to complement the dynamic lifestyles of our tastemakers,” Viswanath added. As a laptop, HP Spectre x360 claims to deliver industry-level work performance, while it can also shift into a tablet, a powerful, portable tool for on-the-go users. For leisure and entertainment use, the stand and tent modes are there to enjoy movies and music. Similar to the first HP Spectre model, the new x360 unit also sports a hidden piston hinge mechanism, which makes way for a 10.4mm and 2.45lbs featherweight, seamless design feature that puts mobility at ease. It retains its predecessor’s distinct copper metal accent and two-tone gray carbon fiber and aluminum top finish.

Flynn has offered to be interviewed by House and Senate investigators examining the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia in exchange for immunity from prosecution, his lawyer disclosed on Thursday. , FILE PHOTO, THE NEW YORK TIMES By STEVEN T. DENNIS, TERRENCE DOPP and CHRIS STROHM / Bloomberg news Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF WASHINGTON – Former national security adviser Mike Flynn has told investigators that he’s willing to be interviewed as part of inquiries into alleged contacts between the Trump administration and the Russian government in return for immunity from prosecution. A congressional official confirmed on condition of anonymity that Flynn made the offer. The Wall Street Journal reported that Flynn made the offer to the FBI and two congressional committees. “Gen. Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit,” Robert Kelner, a lawyer for Flynn, said in statement late Thursday. “We will not comment right now on the details of discussions between counsel for Gen. Flynn and the House and Senate intelligence committees, other than to confirm that those discussions have taken place.” Flynn, a retired lieutenant general, was forced out of the Trump administration after it was revealed that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. after Donald Trump’s victory. FBI Director James Comey has told Congress that the bureau’s probe “includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia’s efforts.” The House and Senate intelligence committees are also investigating allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, including any contacts between Trump associates and Russia. Flynn’s lawyer suggested immunity is justified because his client is “the target of unsubstantiated public demands by members of Congress and other political critics that he be criminally investigated.” Kelner, a partner at Covington and Burling LLP in Washington, said: “No reasonable person, who has the benefit of advice from counsel, would submit to questioning in such a highly politicized, witch-hunt environment without assurances against unfair prosecution.” Jack Langer, a spokesman for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said “Flynn has not offered to testify to HPSCI in exchange for immunity.” Flynn, who ran the Defense Intelligence Agency under President Barack Obama, was one of Trump’s closest advisers during the campaign and briefly held one of the most sensitive jobs in the administration, which carries the highest-level security clearance. He has been at the top of the list for Democrats and others investigating the possible Russia connections. In the weeks after Flynn left the administration, new details emerged about his business ties with Turkey’s government and Russian entities. Flynn retroactively registered as a foreign agent with the Justice Department for work that his firm, Flynn Intel Group, did for a Dutch consulting company, Inovo BV, which has ties to President Recep Erdogan of Turkey. Flynn’s filing showed that his company received $530,000 from Inovo between Sept. 9 and Nov. 14. Kelner wrote in a letter accompanying the filing that Flynn had previously registered with Congress under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, but made the new filing because the work could have been interpreted as benefiting the government of Turkey. Lobbying on behalf of a foreign government requires registration with the Justice Department. The top Democrat and Republican on the House Oversight Committee are seeking documents related to Flynn’s security clearance applications and contacts and payments from Russian, Turkish and any other foreign sources including the Kremlin-backed media outlet RT, dating from Flynn’s 2014 retirement from the Defense Intelligence Agency to the present. They also want documents connected to Flynn’s vetting for the national security post, his work with a speaker’s bureau and any documentation that Flynn sought U.S. approvals for payments from foreign sources. Democrats on the House committee last week released documents showing Flynn received more than $45,000 from RT for taking part in a December 2015 gala where he sat at President Vladimir Putin’s table. Other documents showed that Flynn, who received $11,250 for a 2015 speaking engagement in Washington for Kaspersky Government Security Solutions, Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of a Russian cybersecurity firm; and an $11,250 payment from Volga-Dnepr Airlines. Price Floyd, a spokesman for Flynn, said the retired lieutenant general “both informed and fully briefed” the Defense Intelligence Agency about his Russia trip beforehand and when he returned.
