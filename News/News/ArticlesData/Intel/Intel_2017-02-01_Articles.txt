AMD churned out innovations like dual-core and 64-bit chips, which kept Intel on its toes. But some disastrous technological and management decisions cost AMD dearly, and over time, buyers began to consider its processors inferior to Intel's chips. Intel ran away with PC and server chip market share. AMD now is looking to rally its dwindling fan base with a series of Zen-based chips this year for desktops, servers, and laptops. The hyped-up Zen chips are expected to be good, and even Intel readily acknowledges the stiff competition coming its way. AMD promises that Zen chips will deliver a 40 percent improvement in instructions per cycle, an important metric for chip performance. That number is impressive, considering most chips based on a new architecture have typically boasted CPU improvements of up to 20 percent. The expectations around Zen are high, and the likelihood of it being a flop is unlikely, said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. "If it shows well, we'll be going back to 1997 or 2006 when AMD was competitive with Intel," McCarron said. If that doesn't happen, it'll likely be business as usual for AMD, McCarron said. A strong start is important for AMD, and early adopters of Zen will be the committed user base of enthusiast and gamers who are AMD loyalists. AMD's first Zen-based Ryzen chips are coming in March to high-end desktops. Systems and motherboards will be available right away, Lisa Su, CEO of AMD, said during an earnings call. The first Ryzen chips will initially compete with Intel chips like Core i5 and i7, Su said. Eventually, AMD will release a full complement of Ryzen chips to take on all Intel desktop chips. "What we'll see is some pent-up demand from them in the early launch," McCarron said. Some AMD loyalists who held off PC purchases will quickly pick up Ryzen chips for gaming desktops. Following the initial rush, the word-of-mouth on Ryzen will ultimately determine if Intel desktop users start moving over to AMD chips. AMD is expecting quick returns on Ryzen chips as the gaming market is exploding, Su said. AMD also plans to release its Vega GPU in the second quarter for enthusiasts, and it could be paired up with Ryzen chips. Most gaming machines today have Intel's high-end Core chips. Gaming PC makers like Dell's Alienware and Falcon Northwest are dedicated to Intel chips. But if there's demand, those PC makers could offer Ryzen chips in gaming PCs. In the second half of the year, AMD will release Zen chips, code-named Raven Ridge, for laptops. It's more difficult to predict whether Zen will be a hit in laptops as pricing matters more than the components inside. Raven Ridge's success also depends on PC makers. If major brands don't adopt the chips, AMD's chances of success diminish, McCarron said. PC makers haven't publicly stated whether they will offer laptops with Raven Ridge chips, but a few will likely bite. HP, Dell, and Lenovo have been using AMD chips in more laptops and could be open to using Raven Ridge. Raven Ridge is a strong product for high-end notebooks and 2-in-1s, but it could also be used in desktops, AMD's Su said. Su didn't share details about the GPU that will be integrated into Raven Ridge. In between the desktop and laptop chips, AMD in the second quarter will ship the beefy Zen server processor code-named Naples, which will have up to 32 cores. The goal with Naples is to provide more threads, faster throughput, and more memory capacity in servers. But AMD will be more conservative with Naples server chip shipments, partly because it'll be more difficult to topple Intel, which has a commanding server chip market share of more than 90 percent. The server market will be "a little bit slower from design win to revenue ramp," Su said. Su indicated AMD may compete on chip pricing with Intel to gain server market share. It worked with AMD's Opteron chips, which were considered a cheaper alternative to Xeon chips. Zen-based chips for mobile devices like tablets and smartphones are not on the roadmap because the company is targeting higher-margin and higher-performance computing products. In the longer-term roadmap, AMD is developing the Zen 2 and Zen 3 chips and is preparing to make chips using the 7-nanometer process. AMD has its chips made at GlobalFoundries, which has said it will make 7-nm chips by 2018. However, fab companies often don't meet targets for mass volume chip shipments on a new process. Last week, Intel announced it will establish a pilot factory for 7-nm chips. Intel is currently making chips at the 14-nm process but will ship its first 10-nm chips, code-named Cannonlake, by the end of the year. The 7-nm chips will follow 10-nm parts. AMD has fine-tuning its operational and technical capabilities and has set itself up for a strong 2017, building on the success of GPUs like Polaris, Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, said in a research note. Moorhead was formerly employed by AMD. "It's all up to AMD to flawlessly execute this year," Moorhead said.

The newest Performance Base variant of the Surface Book adds double the graphics power, without making any significant compromise on battery life — but it's also using tech that Microsoft's competitors have left behind. What Is It? Building The Surface Book: The Very Best Of Microsoft The Surface Book is Microsoft's own laptop, a convertible 2-in-1 that can run double duty as a everyday laptop and then transform into a touchscreen tablet device for watching movies or editing photos or drawing using Microsoft's digitiser-friendly Surface Pen. It's first and foremost a laptop, but all of the non-graphics processing is done in the top half, which unclips entirely from the base and contains its own battery. The base contains the lion's share of battery power, but also has a standalone graphics card that vastly improves the laptop's 3D performance. The Performance Base variant of the existing Surface Book, itself now over a year old, swaps the existing low-end Nvidia GeForce GPU for a more powerful GeForce GTX 965M. $3799 is the starting price you'll pay for a Performance Base variant of the Surface Book. That's a $1000 premium on top of the cheapest Surface Book, and gets you that discrete Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M graphics card along with up to 16 hours of battery life during video playback. Every Performance Base variant of the Surface Book packs Intel's 6th-gen Core i7-6600U dual-core processor zipping along at up to 3.4GHz, and either 8GB of RAM on the 256GB storage model ($4399) or 16GB of RAM on the 512GB storage model ($5199). What's It Good At? Time has been good to the Surface Book. The design of a now-year-old laptop still doesn't look or feel outdated, and that's a testament to the amount of time and effort that Microsoft put into building it in the first place. The Performance Base variant is very slightly thicker than the initial iteration, although you wouldn't even realise it unless you had the two side by side to compare directly. The same open-sided design and articulated hinge design remains, of course — and while the Surface Book definitely looks a bit weird side-on, it's a good kind of weird. The Performance Base actually has the very positive side effect of making the Surface Book more bottom-heavy, meaning it's easier to open with a single hand and easier to balance on your lap when you're not typing at a desk. The new Performance Base's keyboard tray is very slightly recessed compared to the older version, and still remains very enjoyable to type on for a laptop with no keyboard flex during heavy and fast typing even in the centre of the board. That excellent and large trackpad remains and while it's not up to comparison with Apple's Force Touch models, it's one of the best you'll find for navigating around Windows 10 and using the various swiping gestures that are a part of it. And with the Performance Base, you get a laptop that has finally had all the kinks worked out of it. My first few months with Microsoft's debut Surface Book — which is actually getting to be really affordable now, starting at $2299 — were a little bit rocky. The mediocre magnetic charging connector that doesn't always clip in correctly at the first try remains, but the laptop itself has changed dramatically from the Windows software updates and the Surface firmware updates that have been applied since launch. The process of undocking and re-docking the tablet segment and Performance Base, for example, works perfectly consistently on the new model where on the original it had a slight percentage chance of either not detaching or of unexpectedly restarting the machine. It's hard to talk about the Surface Book — in any of its variants, but doubly true of the Performance Base — without talking about its beautiful 13.5-inch 3000x2000 pixel, novel 3:2 ratio touchscreen display. It's nice. It's so nice. It's crisp and sharp and has amazing contrast, and excellent brightness that ranges from "low enough to type away on a dark overnight plane trip" to "bright enough to type away in a park in the middle of the day". The Performance Base means you can push the Surface Book to make use of that beautiful PixelSense display in more modern games and with higher-resolution files in processing-intensive applications, because you have more powerful graphics to run them with. Every Performance Base model uses the best of Intel's sixth-generation Core i7 mobile processor family, too. What's It Not Good At? The Performance Base version of the Surface Book is, at the end of the day, a moderate upgrade in graphical processing power over the original Surface Book. That model, released in late 2015, used a semi-custom graphics chip designed by Nvidia, which turned out to be based upon the GeForce 940M. The Performance Base hides a GeForce GTX 965M. It'll give a huge help to graphics-accelerated desktop applications like Photoshop, but with more demanding modern games like Titanfall 2 and Battlefield 1, it struggles at any resolution approaching the Surface Book's native 3000x2000px. The biggest issue facing the Surface Book's Performance Base variant is that, in 2017, it's going up against competitors using Intel's newer and more efficient 7th generation Kaby Lake mobile processors, and competitors using Nvidia's newer and more efficient 10-Series GeForce mobile graphics chips, and more importantly competitors using both at the same time. The unique 2-in-1 detachable tablet proposition of the Surface Book — you can take the screen off and carry it with you to halve the weight and bulk of the system — remains unassailable, but for outright performance and price and therefore value for money the Performance Base finds itself in rough water. Similarly, this was the mid-life update that I was hoping would see some I/O upgrades, most notably to the USB Type-C connector that Microsoft's odd-couple competitor Apple switched entirely to in the equally new MacBook Pro. A complete switch to Type-C would have been kinda annoying — that's why everyone's complaining about it on the MacBook! — but it would have been nice to see at least one native Type-C port with fast USB 3.1 transfer speeds on the new Performance Base, even if it had to take the place of both the miniDisplayPort connector and one of the existing full-size USB 3.0 ports. Native Type-C peripherals are starting to become widely available and this would have future-proofed Microsoft's flagship Windows device. And, of course, the Surface Book remains an expensive proposition. In a world of sub-$2000 competitors with discrete graphics cards, the $3799 starting price of the 8GB/256GB variant of the performance Surface Book is a big ask; step up to the 512GB or 1TB storage models with the 16GB of RAM I'd almost suggest as a default these days for anyone working on any kind of performance application, and you're paying $4399 or $5199. That's not stupid money, but it's a lot, and it's a lot taking into account the fact that the Surface Book is using older tech than some of its competitors. Should You Buy It? Just like the original, identical Surface Book on which it is based, the $3799-plus Microsoft Surface Book with Performance Base is a beautiful and unique piece of technology. It's unique in that it's equally well usable as a tablet and a laptop, thanks to Microsoft's end-to-end integration of the hardware with a (finally) mature version of Windows 10. This has taken just about a year for Microsoft to get right — the original Surface Book was plagued for some people with a series of bugs, most notably the laptop turning itself on whenever it was unplugged from a charger, despite being closed and shoved away in a bag — but the result is a refined hardware and software combo that works. (The best part of which still remains Windows Hello face-unlocking.) There's no way to upgrade the hardware of an original Surface Book to get the advantages of the Performance Base, either. Here I am wishing you could buy the Performance Base as a standalone upgrade for the original Surface Book at a smaller outlay. That would address some of the complaints I've heard from early Surface Book adopters who are beginning to run into the performance barriers of the older first-generation discrete Nvidia GPU. It's not the biggest problem in the world — Surface Book owners are a small niche already, those with older discrete GPU bases more so, those wanting to upgrade even less so again — but even then, it would have been nice. The Surface Book lives on its looks and design, and dies on its specifications. The upgrade in outright graphics grunt is significant — the 965M is powerful enough to get the GTX moniker that Nvidia denotes its gaming-ready chips with — but the entire Surface Book refresh comes at a difficult time in the mid-life upgrade cycle. There's an entire generation of newer and more powerful and more energy efficient hardware, and if you're buying a Surface Book you're investing in technology that (while still good) is outclassed by its competitors. It's definitely no slouch, but part of me wishes that Microsoft had held off to slot in 10-Series Nvidia graphics and 7th Gen Intel gear. Of course, I feel the same way about the Surface Studio, and I'd still buy one right now if I could. Specifications (slightly) aside, the Surface Book with Performance Base will appeal very much to those that want to use it for a purpose that makes use of its combo of excellent general laptop performance and the extra utility of the detachable tablet portion and 2-in-1 switchable display setup. I find myself using the touchscreen and the tablet much less than the keyboard — I'm a writer, after all — but it does have its applications, like photo editing. And Lightroom is an absolute joy to use because of it. If you're a creative professional — if you want a professional laptop, or if you want to be creative — then the Surface Book makes that happen.

Reply 1 MotorMouth @motormouth Jan 19, 2017, 3:53pm I have said before that my Surface Book is the worst PC experience of my life and, whilst that is absolutely true, it is also true that over time most of the problems were sorted out. When I finally decided to get rid of it, the only remaining issue was that it wouldn't work with my Novation Ultranova, a USB music peripheral that I use on stage with my band. If I had managed ot get them working together, I would definitely still have the Surface Book. What amazed me was, when I cleaned it up and took some photos of it for eBay, I realised that after one full year of normal use it did not show the slightest hint of use. I couldn't find the tiniest scratch or mark anywhere on the outside and, after a simple wipe down with a damp cloth, the keyboard looked like it had never been used. Within a week of using the Dell XPS 13 I replaced it with, the Dell was showing way more signs of use (and it is a helluva lot harder to clean). That tells me that the care Microsoft have taken with their Vapour Mg coating makes for a really tough, super-premium device. I had a similar realisation with the display. People like to complain about touchscreens but I realised last week that the display on my XPS13 is much dirtier than I would ever have allowed my Surface Book's to get, simply because the touchscreen was made to be easy to clean, where the matte screen on the XPS needs a damp cloth or a cleaning spray to remove crap and you have to be much more careful or you end up with streaks on it. It has made me realise that touchscreens are actually better when it comes to not having marks on your screen, something which is sompletely counter-intuitive but also true.

Reply 0 MotorMouth @motormouth Jan 19, 2017, 5:11pm That will depend on your needs. If you need the graphics grunt, it's not much of a premium over other laptops with 2Gb cards but the Iris Pro graphics in my XPS 13 runs Adobe CC and 3DS Max perfectly well. One thing I can tell you is that if you put an XPS 13 and a Surface Book in front of me and asked me to choose one, it would be a really hard choice. Reply 0 nizmo_man @nizmo_man Jan 20, 2017, 12:06pm Were you issues related to the laptop/hardware or Windows 10/drivers? Reply 0 MotorMouth @motormouth Feb 2, 2017, 10:05am Most seemed to be driver/firmware related but the mechanism that allows you to unclip and reclip the screen section also failed, requiring the whole machine to be replaced. To be fair, that only failed because a software bug forced me to have to quickly detach and re-attach it half-a-dozen times a day. That bug was fixed, though.

Everything worked, use mine all the time and I've found it a joy to use. I don't game with it and it's always been work only. Thinking back I think the only issue I ever had was with the battery when they released the firmware but that was fixed later but it was a pain when the battery drained faster than before. What things have you had issues with? Reply 0 data-cain @data-cain Jan 20, 2017, 1:39pm A few things, sadly - I'll note what I can think of below. Maybe it's because I use it so infrequently, as when I did use it a little more often it seemed better. I'm planning on using it a lot this year as I go back to UNI, so hopefully it stars behaving better again. :P I upgraded it to Win 10 at one point and was getting weird issues - things freezing, closing, etc. To revert to Win 8, you have to download a specific ISO from MS that matches your items serial, I already had Win 8 ISO's so it was that made it inconvenient. But, it actually turned into a real pain because I had limited internet access at the time, and the MS server was a slow piece of shit; the first 3-4 times I attempted the download it would drop the connection several hours in (and would not resume). There were no alt servers I could find at the time and in the end it took around 14-15h to get the full download (which I think was 3.5gb total) - also note, this was on a 35Mbit connection, which could download that in about 20mins. Then installation of the special Win 8 ISO was a PITA too. My standard ISO's would install and work fine, but couldn't be activated for a reason I don't recall. Anyway after a bunch of dicking around I got it all working again. With both version of Windows I would get issues sliding the lock screen up, either by touch or by keypress. I was not impressed by the battery life and standby life either. Specially if you use the wrong apps! i.e. Chrome was a no-no, as it would eat a full battery in about 1.5 hours (I don't know if it's still bad), even if it wasn't being used directly, and only the background service was running. Frequently it gets stuck in 'off'' mode too, and I end up spending 15mins trying to get the stupid thing to turn on. The hard reset controls don't always respond for some reason. The keyboard often doesn't activate properly so the track pad and/or keys don't function - so I have to pull it off and reconnect a bunch of times till it works correctly. The pen sensitivity is temperamental as to which days it will function on. Some days it will only start at like 35% pressure and others it will apply like 5% pressure when it's hovering. Strangely this actually seemed to have remedied itself. Lack of USB ports is a PITA too. A Bluetooth mouse (which I don't have), and USB splitter can ease this issue, but still kinda shit. Power brick is a little bit awkward - the connection is nice enough though. Reply 0 barry @barry Jan 20, 2017, 1:58pm I must admit that I've had very small issues with the keyboard turning the screen on or waking it up. Seems the keyboard doesn't turn on unless I press a key like the spacebar to wake up the keyboard. I hope that makes sense. With upgrading to Win10, I never had a problem with that and since it's been installed I've had no major issues at all, I did have issues with Win8 when it was installed but again they were minor or where fixed with updates. The battery life, I've never had any issues and whenever someone says it has 8 hours of life, I would work to 6 hour limit because it depends on what you are using, (chrome). The USB, I put that down to being battery life and it's meant to be very portable. Have too many devices plugged in might drain the battery faster than one would like so I personally don't mind the single USB port Reply 0 data-cain @data-cain Jan 20, 2017, 2:29pm yeah I dunno what the go was with Win10. I use it on my Desktop PC with little issue - to do get common freeze on cold boot (probably due to hardware), but a reset and it boots ok. Generally very stable after that. Yep, I understand what you mean with the keyboard; I've heard many people say the same - but for me it just doesn't do it for some reason - like it might not work at all, or it 'half' wakes so the touch pad might work, but keys don't, or vice versa. If I'm careful with apps, battery life is ok. But Chrome would literally deplete a 100% battery to forced shutdown within 90 minutes, even while closed because of the services in the background; might be better these days, I haven't really tried it as I uninstalled it to avoid the issue :P At least if they had two USB ports it would be ok. I don't use a Bluetooth mouse which makes one port annoying. :| two would make it ok. I just use a splitter atm because I can't justify buying a Bluetooth Mouse (I'm poor). Reply 0 data-cain @data-cain Jan 20, 2017, 2:34pm oh and the other thing about the battery. Standby drains the battery pretty quick. My old iPad can sit in 'sleep' mode for like 2 months and still have 50% left (and it's getting pretty old now), but my Surface which is much newer... 1 week and it might have charge left if I'm lucky, and it was like that from the start. Just annoying that it has to always be plugged in, or it'll be dead when you want it. Last edited January 20, 2017 2:35 pm Reply 0 dudeface @dudeface Jan 20, 2017, 2:25am I've been eyeing the Surface Book for a while for my more portable needs (already got a great desktop but a laptop pushing a decade old). How would it compare to similar specced 2in1s or an Ultrabook & Wacom tablet for illustration and 3D work? Lugging around a laptop and Cintiq seems like a pain with it needing its own power supply. A Laptop and regular Intuos tablet is serviceable. However, the Surface Book does look like it bundles together a decent amount of what a creative might need. It's not the cheapest thing out there but the review mentions that it would work well for creatives. Any thoughts or comments would be appreciated. Reply 0 MotorMouth @motormouth Jan 20, 2017, 10:39am If it was me, I think I'd probably prefer a Surface Pro. It is cheaper and more portable but it is definitely powerful enough for illustration. If you were using something like Mari or Z_Brush, you might need more graphics grunt but for 2d/vector illustration, a Surface Pro will be great. Reply 0 dudeface @dudeface Jan 20, 2017, 3:32pm Big cheers for the input. I'll definitely take a closer look at the Surface Pro. Time to reconsider how much 3D (Solid Works/Maya) I'll actually be doing away from the main desktop. Reply 0 kipple @kipple Jan 20, 2017, 10:20pm I bought a Surface Book for illustration but returned it because the pen is not responsive enough. If you are used to Wacom devices, you'll probably find the initial activation force of the Surface pen is too high. I will stick with my Cintiq Companion 2 until the Surface pen tech improves. Wacom has almost finished its dual protocol pen, which will work with the Surface as well as many other tablet PCs. Whether it improves the experience of drawing on the Surface remains to be seen. Reply 0 lunchbox99 @lunchbox99 Feb 2, 2017, 10:26am My take is that it's a decent product, but what I don't like is: - the price. - the wobbly top heavy balance when in laptop mode. Hard to fix when the guts are in the screen. - windows 10 tablet apps still largely suck, so the touch is most useful for writing and drawing etc, rather than the more "standard" tablet experience on android and ios. - due to app landscape and the weight/battery in tablet mode, I rate it as a poor tablet - due to the wobbly screen I rate it as a good but not excellent laptop So in many ways, my view is that in trying to do both duties it's worse than a dedicated device for either Reply 0 bigatom @bigatom Feb 2, 2017, 1:02pm The SurfaceBook is a solid bit of hardware, yeah a few software glitches when it first came out but they're all sorted now (well for me anyway). I've found that I hardly ever use the tablet mode as it's just not very comfortable, possibly fine for drawing. I'd probably go for a better spec and better priced ultra-book next time.

The chip, which went into development last year, is similar to one already used in the latest MacBook Pro to power the keyboard’s Touch Bar feature, the people said. The updated part, internally codenamed T310, would handle some of the computer’s low-power mode functionality, they said. The people asked not to be identified talking about private product development. It’s built using ARM Holdings Plc. technology and will work alongside an Intel processor. Although Apple only accounted for 7.5 percent of worldwide computer shipments in the fourth quarter, according to data from IDC, the Mac line has long set the standard for design and component improvements. Its feature additions often start new technology trends that other manufacturers rush to follow. Apple and Intel declined to comment. The development of a more advanced Apple-designed chipset for use within Mac laptops is another step in the company’s long-term exploration of becoming independent of Intel for its Mac processors. Apple has used its own A-Series processors inside iPhones and iPads since 2010, and its chip business has become one of the Cupertino, California-based company’s most critical long-term investments. Apple’s first ARM-based Mac chip, known as T1, was introduced as part of the MacBook Pro update last October. This chip powers the Touch Bar -- a screen built into the keyboard that lets users access app shortcuts, system settings and emojis -- and some security features such as the enclave that stores payment and biometric data tied to the computer’s fingerprint reader. Power Nap Apple engineers are planning to offload the Mac’s low-power mode, a feature marketed as "Power Nap," to the next-generation ARM-based chip. This function allows Mac laptops to retrieve e-mails, install software updates, and synchronize calendar appointments with the display shut and not in use. The feature currently uses little battery life while run on the Intel chip, but the move to ARM would conserve even more power, according to one of the people. The current ARM-based chip for Macs is independent from the computer’s other components, focusing on the Touch Bar’s functionality itself. The new version in development would go further by connecting to other parts of a Mac’s system, including storage and wireless components, in order to take on the additional responsibilities. Given that a low-power mode already exists, Apple may choose to not highlight the advancement, much like it has not marketed the significance of its current Mac chip, one of the people said. Building its own chips allows Apple to more tightly integrate its hardware and software functions. It also, crucially, allows it more of a say in the cost of components for its devices. However, Apple has no near-term plans to completely abandon Intel chips for use in its laptops and desktops, the people said. Intel dipped on the news and ended the day down 0.8 percent at $36.52. Apple rose 6.1 percent to $128.75 in New York. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Intel’s designs and production technology have created processors that rivals and contract manufacturers haven’t been able match. If companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. continue to narrow the gap with what Intel’s factories can make, Apple may have more scope to design its own parts. ARM-based processors dominate the smartphone and tablet markets in part because of their power-efficiency. Apple started exploring a shift away from Intel processors five years ago partly to improve laptop power efficiency, Bloomberg News has reported. The new chip may first become available in an upgraded version of the MacBook Pro laptop planned for later this year, the people said. Apple is also working on a faster version of the 12-inch MacBook and a new iMac with multi-functional USB-C connectivity for this year, Bloomberg News reported in December.

According to the report, the new Mac chip may be used for low-power tasks that currently rely on Intel’s chip to process. The report does not detail a full switch to ARM chips for the Mac, however, noting that Macs will still rely on Intel processors unlike iPhones and iPads which are totally ARM-based. Issues with Intel preparing new chips in time to be used with Macs has fueled speculation that Apple could eventually switch to ARM-based chips in the future. For now, the new ARM chip would potentially be used for dedicated tasks like maintaining background app activity which could preserve battery life. The updated part, internally codenamed T310, would handle some of the computer’s low-power mode functionality, they said. […] Apple engineers are planning to offload the Mac’s low-power mode, a feature marketed as “Power Nap,” to the next-generation ARM-based chip. The report specifies that Apple may be planning to introduce the new chip in updated MacBook Pros as soon as this year. The new chip may first become available in an upgraded version of the MacBook Pro laptop planned for later this year, the people said. Relying on a dedicated chip for specific tasks could be a benefit to battery life which has been an issue with Apple’s latest MacBooks Pro models. iPhone, for example, features a dedicated co-processor that focuses on step tracking and listening for the ‘Hey Siri’ voice prompt. Apple already includes a custom ARM chip called the T1 with its latest MacBook Pro models with Touch Bar and Touch ID. Separately, new models of the MacBook Pro are expected to take advantage of Intel’s new Kaby Lake generation chips and and step up to 32 GB of RAM on notebooks which has not yet been an option. Apple is also expected to be preparing new iMacs with updated specs including USB-C after the last refresh occurred over a year ago.

Twitter Facebook AMD sets Ryzen up for a strong start as chip battle with Intel looms AMD loyalists will grab the early Ryzen chips, and the following word-of-mouth will determine if Intel fans switch camps Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 02 February, 2017 08:34 - - - - print email Comments As a pesky underdog, AMD challenged Intel in chip innovation until the mid-2000s. AMD churned out innovations like dual-core and 64-bit chips, which kept Intel on its toes. But some disastrous technological and management decisions cost AMD dearly, and over time, buyers began to consider its processors inferior to Intel's chips. Intel ran away with PC and server chip market share. AMD now is looking to rally its dwindling fan base with a series of Zen-based chips this year for desktops, servers, and laptops. The hyped-up Zen chips are expected to be good, and even Intel readily acknowledges the stiff competition coming its way. AMD promises that Zen chips will deliver a 40 percent improvement in instructions per cycle, an important metric for chip performance. That number is impressive, considering most chips based on a new architecture have typically boasted CPU improvements of up to 20 percent. The expectations around Zen are high, and the likelihood of it being a flop is unlikely, said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. "If it shows well, we'll be going back to 1997 or 2006 when AMD was competitive with Intel," McCarron said. If that doesn't happen, it'll likely be business as usual for AMD, McCarron said. A strong start is important for AMD, and early adopters of Zen will be the committed user base of enthusiast and gamers who are AMD loyalists. AMD's first Zen-based Ryzen chips are coming in March to high-end desktops. Systems and motherboards will be available right away, Lisa Su, CEO of AMD, said during an earnings call. The first Ryzen chips will initially compete with Intel chips like Core i5 and i7, Su said. Eventually, AMD will release a full complement of Ryzen chips to take on all Intel desktop chips. "What we'll see is some pent-up demand from them in the early launch," McCarron said. Some AMD loyalists who held off PC purchases will quickly pick up Ryzen chips for gaming desktops. Following the initial rush, the word-of-mouth on Ryzen will ultimately determine if Intel desktop users start moving over to AMD chips. AMD is expecting quick returns on Ryzen chips as the gaming market is exploding, Su said. AMD also plans to release its Vega GPU in the second quarter for enthusiasts, and it could be paired up with Ryzen chips. Most gaming machines today have Intel's high-end Core chips. Gaming PC makers like Dell's Alienware and Falcon Northwest are dedicated to Intel chips. But if there's demand, those PC makers could offer Ryzen chips in gaming PCs. In the second half of the year, AMD will release Zen chips, code-named Raven Ridge, for laptops. It's more difficult to predict whether Zen will be a hit in laptops as pricing matters more than the components inside. Raven Ridge's success also depends on PC makers. If major brands don't adopt the chips, AMD's chances of success diminish, McCarron said. PC makers haven't publicly stated whether they will offer laptops with Raven Ridge chips, but a few will likely bite. HP, Dell, and Lenovo have been using AMD chips in more laptops and could be open to using Raven Ridge. Raven Ridge is a strong product for high-end notebooks and 2-in-1s, but it could also be used in desktops, AMD's Su said. Su didn't share details about the GPU that will be integrated into Raven Ridge. In between the desktop and laptop chips, AMD in the second quarter will ship the beefy Zen server processor code-named Naples, which will have up to 32 cores. The goal with Naples is to provide more threads, faster throughput, and more memory capacity in servers. But AMD will be more conservative with Naples server chip shipments, partly because it'll be more difficult to topple Intel, which has a commanding server chip market share of more than 90 percent. The server market will be "a little bit slower from design win to revenue ramp," Su said. Su indicated AMD may compete on chip pricing with Intel to gain server market share. It worked with AMD's Opteron chips, which were considered a cheaper alternative to Xeon chips. Zen-based chips for mobile devices like tablets and smartphones are not on the roadmap because the company is targeting higher-margin and higher-performance computing products. In the longer-term roadmap, AMD is developing the Zen 2 and Zen 3 chips and is preparing to make chips using the 7-nanometer process. AMD has its chips made at GlobalFoundries, which has said it will make 7-nm chips by 2018. However, fab companies often don't meet targets for mass volume chip shipments on a new process. Last week, Intel announced it will establish a pilot factory for 7-nm chips. Intel is currently making chips at the 14-nm process but will ship its first 10-nm chips, code-named Cannonlake, by the end of the year. The 7-nm chips will follow 10-nm parts. AMD has fine-tuning its operational and technical capabilities and has set itself up for a strong 2017, building on the success of GPUs like Polaris, Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, said in a research note. Moorhead was formerly employed by AMD. "It's all up to AMD to flawlessly execute this year," Moorhead said.

AMD churned out innovations like dual-core and 64-bit chips, which kept Intel on its toes. But some disastrous technological and management decisions cost AMD dearly, and over time, buyers began to consider its processors inferior to Intel's chips. Intel ran away with PC and server chip market share. AMD now is looking to rally its dwindling fan base with a series of Zen-based chips this year for desktops, servers, and laptops. The hyped-up Zen chips are expected to be good, and even Intel readily acknowledges the stiff competition coming its way. AMD promises that Zen chips will deliver a 40 percent improvement in instructions per cycle, an important metric for chip performance. That number is impressive, considering most chips based on a new architecture have typically boasted CPU improvements of up to 20 percent. The expectations around Zen are high, and the likelihood of it being a flop is unlikely, said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. "If it shows well, we'll be going back to 1997 or 2006 when AMD was competitive with Intel," McCarron said. If that doesn't happen, it'll likely be business as usual for AMD, McCarron said. A strong start is important for AMD, and early adopters of Zen will be the committed user base of enthusiast and gamers who are AMD loyalists. AMD's first Zen-based Ryzen chips are coming in March to high-end desktops. Systems and motherboards will be available right away, Lisa Su, CEO of AMD, said during an earnings call. The first Ryzen chips will initially compete with Intel chips like Core i5 and i7, Su said. Eventually, AMD will release a full complement of Ryzen chips to take on all Intel desktop chips. "What we'll see is some pent-up demand from them in the early launch," McCarron said. Some AMD loyalists who held off PC purchases will quickly pick up Ryzen chips for gaming desktops. Following the initial rush, the word-of-mouth on Ryzen will ultimately determine if Intel desktop users start moving over to AMD chips. AMD is expecting quick returns on Ryzen chips as the gaming market is exploding, Su said. AMD also plans to release its Vega GPU in the second quarter for enthusiasts, and it could be paired up with Ryzen chips. Most gaming machines today have Intel's high-end Core chips. Gaming PC makers like Dell's Alienware and Falcon Northwest are dedicated to Intel chips. But if there's demand, those PC makers could offer Ryzen chips in gaming PCs. In the second half of the year, AMD will release Zen chips, code-named Raven Ridge, for laptops. It's more difficult to predict whether Zen will be a hit in laptops as pricing matters more than the components inside. Raven Ridge's success also depends on PC makers. If major brands don't adopt the chips, AMD's chances of success diminish, McCarron said. PC makers haven't publicly stated whether they will offer laptops with Raven Ridge chips, but a few will likely bite. HP, Dell, and Lenovo have been using AMD chips in more laptops and could be open to using Raven Ridge. Raven Ridge is a strong product for high-end notebooks and 2-in-1s, but it could also be used in desktops, AMD's Su said. Su didn't share details about the GPU that will be integrated into Raven Ridge. In between the desktop and laptop chips, AMD in the second quarter will ship the beefy Zen server processor code-named Naples, which will have up to 32 cores. The goal with Naples is to provide more threads, faster throughput, and more memory capacity in servers. But AMD will be more conservative with Naples server chip shipments, partly because it'll be more difficult to topple Intel, which has a commanding server chip market share of more than 90 percent. The server market will be "a little bit slower from design win to revenue ramp," Su said. Su indicated AMD may compete on chip pricing with Intel to gain server market share. It worked with AMD's Opteron chips, which were considered a cheaper alternative to Xeon chips. Zen-based chips for mobile devices like tablets and smartphones are not on the roadmap because the company is targeting higher-margin and higher-performance computing products. In the longer-term roadmap, AMD is developing the Zen 2 and Zen 3 chips and is preparing to make chips using the 7-nanometer process. AMD has its chips made at GlobalFoundries, which has said it will make 7-nm chips by 2018. However, fab companies often don't meet targets for mass volume chip shipments on a new process. Last week, Intel announced it will establish a pilot factory for 7-nm chips. Intel is currently making chips at the 14-nm process but will ship its first 10-nm chips, code-named Cannonlake, by the end of the year. The 7-nm chips will follow 10-nm parts. AMD has fine-tuning its operational and technical capabilities and has set itself up for a strong 2017, building on the success of GPUs like Polaris, Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, said in a research note. Moorhead was formerly employed by AMD. "It's all up to AMD to flawlessly execute this year," Moorhead said. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

For Super Bowl LI, Fox will have 70 Ultra High Definition cameras placed throughout NRG Stadium to capture every angle possible, so you can "Be The Player. Intel's “Be the Player” feature allows Fox producers to request a view from inside a specific player's helmet at any point throughout the game. While there are no actual cameras inside any of the helmets, Intel has placed 38 Ultra High Definition cameras around the stadium that allow them to show what the players are seeing. The “Be The Player” feature will only be used on major plays due to the process required to compile the footage. Each 15-30 second clip uses around 1 terabyte of data and takes Intel staff two minutes to finalize it for broadcast. This technology has already been used in college football games as well as MLB and NBA All-Star games. Related Stories Betting Trends Suggest Falcons Will Cover Spread, Beat Patriots Buick Debuts Super Bowl Ad Ahead Of Game Pats Own Slight Edge Over Falcons Fox is also using a player tracking technology from Zebra Sports Solution that allows it to track acceleration, distance traveled, and speed. It will be shown at certain times throughout the game on easy to follow billboards. Fox Sports will also be making an improvement to the pylon cameras. Television companies began introducing “pylon cameras” in 2015 to give viewers an angle of the goal line and surrounding areas. For Super Bowl LI, Fox Sports will have 24 cameras installed in end zone pylons compared to the 8 usually used in a normal broadcast. These cameras will allow fans, players, and referees to be absolutely sure if a team scored a touchdown or stepped out of bounds before the end zone. While Fox is planning on using only 4k and even 8k cameras, they will not broadcast the game in 4k. Sports fans have been requesting live 4k broadcasts ever since Sony released the technology several years ago, but companies are still testing its capabilities on lesser viewed sporting events. Even without the 4k broadcast, there will be a noticeable difference in the video quality according to a Consumer Report interview with Fox Sports senior vice president of field and technical operations Michael Davies. Even without the 4k broadcast, Fox Sports is using every technology possible to encourage fans to stay home and watch events on television instead of enjoying the experience of a live event.   Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

The exhibition is entitled Women: Tech and captures portraits of a number of women working in technical roles at Intel across Ireland. The collection of images will now be displayed for the next number of months in one of the buildings at Intel’s campus in Leixlip. One of the women who features is Máiréad Breathnach from Mountrath. Máiréad grew up in Mountrath and is a past pupil of the Brigidine Secondary School, Mountrath. She received her Bachelor of Science in Applied Physics (1st Class Hons) at the University of Limerick, where she also completed her PhD on the ‘Morphology and Nanostructure in Copper Electrodeposition via Electrochemical Analysis, In-Situ Atomic Force Microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy’. Máiréad started her postgraduate industrial career as a technology development scientist at Technology from Ideas. For the past six years she has worked for Intel, both in Ireland and the U.S, where her roles have included product development engineering and device parametric engineering. Máiréads’ female technical role models include Dr. Mary Kelly (Science Teacher, Brigidine Secondary School, Mountrath), Regina Costello (Maths and Physics Teacher, Brigidine Secondary School, Mountrath) and Dr. Caitríona Jackman (U.L. peer and now Associate Professor at Southampton University). Intel say that putting its technical women on the walls at Intel is an expression of the value that they place on these women and also the value that we place on diversity and the diverse elements of our workforce. Intel Ireland’s HR Director, Anne Kelleher, spoke at the launch of the exhibition. "I hope that by sharing these images here onsite that we can create a conversation and think differently about where we work, why we are here and how we value everyone in our workforce. These images are role models for other technical women and for those that will come to work here in the years ahead," she said.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Feb 1, 2017 at 12:00PM On Jan. 26, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced its financial results for 2016 and issued detailed financial guidance for 2017, including revenue, gross margin, operating income, and earnings-per-share estimates. An Intel desktop processor. Image source: Intel. This guidance calls for "flat" revenue to the $59.4 billion that the company generated in 2016. Now, while on the surface this might be disappointing, it's not as bad as it looks. Remove McAfee and you get growth In its earnings release, Intel explicitly says that if one were to exclude revenues from the Intel Security business, a business that Intel is in the process of spinning out, it would achieve revenue growth "in the low single digits." In 2016, Intel Security generated $2.16 billion in revenue. Excluding that from the 2016 results yields total revenue of approximately $57.23 billion. Now, Intel's financial guidance for 2017 of about $59.4 billion doesn't include a full year of Intel security revenue -- just a single quarter. And, in fact, Intel CFO Robert Swan said that if the company ends up closing the spin out during the second quarter of 2017, a quarter later than anticipated, then Intel would go in and revise its full-year financial guidance to account for the additional quarter of revenue. If Intel generates the same amount of revenue in 2016 and in 2017, and if the 2017 number includes just one quarter of Intel Security revenue while the 2016 number includes four quarters of Intel Security revenue, then the business -- excluding Intel Security -- is set to grow. Client Computing Group guidance looks cautious Going into 2016, Intel had told investors to expect revenue from its Client Computing Group to either be flat or to grow by a low-single-digit percentage. This forecast assumed that the personal-computer market would be "slightly down," a forecast that Intel said at the time was more pessimistic than what the third-party market researchers had expected. However, early in the year, Intel revised its full-year financial guidance downward because of a belief that the personal-computer market would "decline in the high single digits in 2016 versus [Intel's] prior forecast of [a] mid-single-digit decline." Then, in the third quarter of the year, Intel saw better-than-expected personal computer chip sales, driving it to revise its third-quarter guidance and, shortly thereafter, its full-year 2016 numbers. And, finally, when Intel reported its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2016, it once again saw upside to its guidance because of better-than-expected personal-computer chip sales. Intel's CCG ultimately saw 2% revenue growth for the year. For 2017, Intel says its financial guidance assumes that the personal-computer market will decline at a mid-single-digit rate -- a figure the company admits is more pessimistic than third-party forecasts. It's understandable that the company is being cautious here. Remember that in 2014, Intel saw solid upside in personal-computer sales, which, in hindsight, was due to the end of life of the Windows XP operating system, which drove a substantial corporate personal-computer refresh. Intel's financial guidance for 2015 with regard to its personal-computer business called for roughly flat unit shipments, with "revenue slightly down." When the rubber hit the road that year, Intel saw notebook platform volumes drop 9% and desktop platform volumes plunge 16% -- wildly missing the company's original forecast. It's ultimately much better to set the bar relatively cautiously and then surprise investors to the upside later than to set the bar extremely high only to have to lower it later. In this case, I think the bar is low enough that there's a reasonable chance that Intel's CCG performs better than what the current guidance implies. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

The SU800 pairs Micron's 3D TLC NAND with Silicon Motion's SM2258 controller to produce an entry-level consumer SATA SSD, available in both 2.5" and M.2 form factors. We've previously reviewed the Silicon Motion SM2258 controller in the Intel SSD 540s, which uses SK Hynix 16nm TLC NAND. We also had the opportunity to test an SM2258 engineering sample/reference design from Silicon Motion that used the same Micron 3D TLC but earlier firmware and different overprovisioning settings. Silicon Motion's controllers are known for low cost and low power, and it's worth noting that their SATA SSD controllers are one of the few remaining single-core designs. Micron's 3D TLC is the first 3D NAND to hit the open market in high volume and with reasonable cost. For the moment, Micron's 3D NAND is the only viable option for most SSD manufacturers looking to move beyond planar NAND. Samsung is keeping almost all of their 3D NAND for their own very successful SSDs. Toshiba and SK Hynix are technically shipping 3D NAND but in limited supply and the poor cost effectiveness have prevented any third parties from adopting it for commercial SSDs. Toshiba and SK Hynix each have at least one or two token models in the supply chain using their 3D NAND, but still no mass-market consumer or retail availability. (Toshiba and SK Hynix have seen more success in the smartphone and memory card markets, where performance requirements are lower and the large die sizes of Micron's 3D NAND are a problem.) Micron's only consumer SSD with 3D NAND so far is the Crucial MX300, and Intel has released their SSD 600p, both using the Intel/Micron 32-layer 384Gb 3D TLC NAND flash.  The Crucial MX300 has been quite successful, with acceptable mainstream performance, great pricing, and great power efficiency. The Intel 600p is the most affordable NVMe SSD on the market and it offers real-world performance that exceeds any SATA SSD. That leaves plenty of room in the market for other models with 3D NAND, and plenty of interest from consumers seeking the benefits of 3D NAND. Gallery: ADATA Ultimate SU800 Micron's 32-layer 3D TLC NAND has a capacity of 384Gb (48GB) per die. This odd capacity means that while the SU800 has typical usable capacities like 128GB and 512GB, the die counts and raw flash capacities aren't powers of two. The 128GB SU800 has just three packages with one die each for a raw capacity of 144GiB. The 256GB and 512GB SU800s use three and six dual-die flash packages, respectively. Since the SM2258 controller has four channels for communicating with NAND, the smallest SU800 cannot make full use of the controller's capability and has reduced performance as a result. The larger capacity SU800 variants are rated to mostly saturate SATA on sequential transfers.

Reply MrSpadge - Wednesday, February 01, 2017 - link Overall a worse deal than the MX300, which itself took quite some criticism. Could you elaborate on what's "neat" about this? Reply vladx - Wednesday, February 01, 2017 - link Price is low for decent performance. This is SATA SSD targeted towards low end and mainstream market. Reply Great_Scott - Wednesday, February 01, 2017 - link The MX300 is better value given the drive sizes. I'm still trying to find a replacement for the Mushkin Reactor for desktops, but the Crucial drive is my go-to for laptops currently. Reply Arbie - Wednesday, February 01, 2017 - link Why do you guys continually fail to mention the Mushkin Reactor 1TB MLC drive ($240 at Newegg) in your SSD comparisons? It's cheaper, faster, and probably has greater endurance. You reviewed it two years ago but have hardly mentioned it since then. It seems to be a "best buy" still. http://www.anandtech.com/show/8949/mushkin-reactor... But... kudos on the clickbait. You have at least as much as any other site, and of the lowest degree. Reply vladx - Wednesday, February 01, 2017 - link Because Mushkin already refreshed their SSD line and the old Reactor is not manufactured anymore which means it will be gone any week now. Reply Great_Scott - Wednesday, February 01, 2017 - link And we will all be sad to see it go. I have a bunch of those drives, myself. Reply Flunk - Wednesday, February 01, 2017 - link They don't often put 2 year old drives in comparisons. Reply Great_Scott - Wednesday, February 01, 2017 - link That's too bad, as some context would be useful, especially considering that many people own that drive, and until recently it was still being made. Then again, a two-year-old budget drive with a very similar controller would have made the SU800 series look terrible, and we can't have that. Reply eek2121 - Wednesday, February 01, 2017 - link The Mushkin Reactor is a drastically slower drive, costs about the same, and will soon disappear from retailers. It is not a competitor.

Hardware encyclopedia Mike Jennings runs the numbers and comes to some conclusions When building a new PC, one of the components many people pay little attention to is the CPU cooler. Coolers are important because they not only keep your hardware from overheating, but also extend their life by keeping them at temperatures that cause them to deteriorate much slower. Most consumer processors come with so-called "stock" coolers in the box, which is designed to keep the CPU at stable temperatures for a little money as possible. But when does a stock cooler become a hindrance? Well, it depends on what you’re hoping to do with your PC. Instead of just providing a bit of advice and leaving it at that, I decided to get some concrete numbers so you can judge the difference for yourself. Related: Air coolers tested for heat, noise and ease of use Test criteria I wanted to maintain consistency throughout this test, so every cooler was tested using the same rig: an Intel Core i7-6800K processor, a Gigabyte X99 motherboard, 16GB of memory and a single GTX 1080 graphics card. Tests were conducted at stock speeds and with a 4.2GHz, 1.2V overclock, which was carried over to the desktop system with bespoke water-cooling. Temperatures were measured at idle, during an application test and a games benchmark, and then with the processor stress-tested at 100% load. Audio measurements were taken at idle and peak loads. Stock coolers: Always the worst option? The first question that PC builders often ask is whether they should stick with their processor’s stock cooler, or would it be better to spend a little extra cash on a third-party heatsink. Intel's stock cooler is a classic, and can be found for as little as £3 online Intel has maintained its stock cooler design for many years, and it doesn’t work with my 6800K test machine, so I’ve tested it with a Core i7-6700K to see how it performs. Bear in mind that the 6700K should be a much easier cooling job than the 6800K that I used in my main test system, so the numbers I found are quite stark. In my testing, it was immediately obvious that stock coolers are less effective than third-party ones, even when not under load. The stock Intel has a single fan and a small heatsink, so it’s no surprise that it can barely cope – its idle temperature of 32°C is higher than every third-party cooler we looked at; under load it reached a very toasty 89°C. Related: The best gaming PC builds from £500 to £1,500 In Intel’s defence, it doesn’t supply its stock cooler with overclockable chips, because it knows the cooler isn’t good enough for an overclocking job. But it’s still interesting to see what happens, especially if you have a stock Intel cooler lying around and have just invested in a new chip. AMD follows a similar blueprint to Intel: a small, square heatsink topped with a single fan. It’s no surprise that it performs similarly; it’s fine for less demanding tasks, but it’s hotter than third-party coolers when AMD’s beefiest chips are stress-tested. I tested mine with an FX-8360 and saw an idle temperature of 29°C, peaking at 78°C under extreme load. As a result of this, AMD has introduced a second cooler: the Wraith. It’s larger and includes more heat-dissipating fins and a bigger fan. It’s far more competent, knocking a few degrees off temperatures with a processor at stock and with far more headroom for overclocking. At idle, it sits at a chilly 17°C in our test setup, peaking at 70°C under load. The Wraith is AMD's upgraded stock cooler So I figured I’d take a look at some third-party coolers to see how much money you need to spend to get better performance. The answer is: not much. Are cheap third-party air coolers worth it? The cheapest third-party cooler in my group was the £24 Deepcool Gammaxx S40 (below), which has one 120mm fan. It isn’t the only affordable cooler; I also looked at the £34 Cooler Master Hyper 212 LED, which pairs its 120mm fan with a larger heatsink. There’s clear air between the two units, even though the price difference between the two is only £10. The Gammaxx is 4°C hotter than the Hyper 212, and 8°C toastier in a stress test. The gap closed during overclocking, but the pricier Hyper 212 was still cooler. The gap was pretty small during noise tests: the Hyper 212 was a little louder than its cheaper rival when idling, and only a decibel quieter when stressed. It’s a decent bill of health for both, though, as they’re significantly quieter than Intel and AMD stock coolers. The stock coolers are fine for handling mid-range and modest processors, but even the cheapest third-party units will be better at cooling such parts. Third-party coolers will handle high-end parts with more aplomb, too, and they’re crucial if you’re going to overclock or simply want to keep the noise down. Overclock performance Gammaxx S40 Hyper 212 Noctua NH-D15 Price £24 £34 £65 Idle temp (°C) 24 23 23 Application temp (°C) 56 53 50 Gaming temp (°C) 38 42 41 Peak temp (°C) 63 59 56 Idle noise (dBa) 26 26 26 Peak noise (dBa) 38 37 42 Above: My three third-party air coolers, compared Expensive Air Coolers: The best-value option There are plenty of pricier air coolers around. They’re designed for high-end CPUs and demanding overclocking – ideal if you’re building a powerful gaming PC, or a rig for intensive work. The Noctua NH-D15 is a £65 beast (which came a close third in TrustedReviews’ recent group test) that supports two fans and comes with multiple speed modes. I tested the Noctua using its standard mode, which uses a single 140mm fan – and in stock speed benchmarks it fell between the two cheaper air coolers in temperature and noise tests. The Noctua only really came into its own when I used its alternative fan modes and tested the device in tougher scenarios. It was cooler than many other devices in stress tests, and it was able to compete with liquid coolers in multiple instances. The Noctua is also far quieter than many air and all-liquid coolers in stress tests. Its best overclocked peak noise level of 36 decibels is miles ahead of several different air- and liquid-cooling options, which means it’s barely audible even when it’s pelting through high-end games and intensive workloads. The Noctua’s impressive high-end performance speaks volumes about the need for expensive cooling options. If you’re building a normal, modest rig and aren’t fussed about noise, then buying a cooler such as the Noctua is a waste of money. If you want to cut down on noise, though, or need something to keep a high-end processor chilled, then the Noctua – and other high-end air coolers – absolutely justify their cost. Just be wary about what you’re buying – don’t spend vast sums of money on a cooler that your rig just doesn’t require. Cheap liquid coolers: Not worth the money Water coolers have grown in prominence alongside air coolers, and they’re available at a huge range of prices to compete with air-based units. The Cooler Master Seidon 120V V2 (below) and Antec Kühler H600 Pro both cost £40 – only a few pounds more than their budget air coolers. Both are small cooling units with single 120mm fans. Both water-based units beat the Gammaxx air cooler; they were several degrees cooler in application and gaming tests. That pattern repeated during overclocked tests, with both water-based devices cooler than the cheapest air unit. The competition was closer with the £34 Hyper 212. That air cooler was consistently cooler in stock speed tests, but it was frequently a couple of degrees hotter in overclocked tests. The Antec and Hyper 212 had very similar noise outputs, with the Seidon slightly louder. Affordable liquid coolers, then, aren’t always worth buying – both of the examples I tested cost a little more than an air cooler, but performed at a similar level. The Antec was the better of the two affordable liquid coolers, but it only really excelled during overclocked tests, so that’s the only scenario in which I’d consider a cheaper, water-based unit. The only other reason that you should buy a liquid cooler is if you want a tidy-looking build with lower internal ambient temperatures for better overall air-cooled graphics performance, although for most people this will deliver diminishing returns and quite a lot of noise. Overclock performance CM Seidon 120V Antec H600 CM Nepton 120XL Corsair H115i Custom loop Price £40 £40 £48 £125 N/A Idle temp (°C) 26 31 27 17 21 Application temp (°C) 54 48 44 38 48 Gaming temp (°C) 47 39 36 28 40 Peak temp (°C) 60 57 53 49 56 Idle noise (dBa) 25 27 41 45 34 Peak noise (dBa) 39 37 58 52 44 Above: Three cheap air coolers and two pricey options. Note the custom setup is also cooling a pair of GTX 1080 graphics cards, making its results even more impressive Expensive liquid coolers: A better bet I’ve also tested a beefy £125 Corsair Hydro H115i (below), which pairs a 280mm radiator with two 140mm fans. I pitted it against a high-end PC with a proper water-cooling loop – a system that uses 360mm and 240mm radiators, a 250mm-tall reservoir and high-end kit from cooling experts EKWB. The extra money spent on the Corsair makes a huge difference over cheaper liquid coolers. Its stock speed idle temperature of 16°C is the best in the entire test, and it was the only cooler to dip below 30°C in gaming tests. Its stock speed peak of 44°C is the best in the group – the only one below 50°C. It was just as impressive in overclocked tests, and again became the only cooler to dip below 50°C. I can’t fault the Corsair’s cooling, but the fans produce plenty of noise. Its stock speed idle and peak noise levels of 44 and 48 decibels are the loudest in the group, and its overclocked idle figure of 45 decibels was the worst here. The Corsair Link app can be used to regulate fan speeds, but expect plenty of noise during games and intensive applications, no matter which setting is used. The EKWB cooling loop is used to chill an Core i7-6800K running at 4.2GHz, alongside two overclocked Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics cards (three complete chips that need cooling) – and it does an exceptional job. Its idle temperature of 21°C beats most of the third-party coolers in my test, and it peaked at 56°C with that overclocked processor – a figure that sees it in the middle of the pack, despite the loop having to chill so much more silicon. Related: Best gaming keyboards The water-cooling loop’s idle noise output of 34 decibels is higher than most, but its 44 decibel peak level is fine – a mid-table result. There’s plenty to like at the high-end. Expensive coolers such as the Corsair do an incredible job with high-end hardware, despite their noise output. There’s also clear evidence that a fully bespoke loop can do great work with processors and graphics cards, although this obviously requires a bigger investment and more expertise if you decide to build it yourself. That said, do consider carefully whether you require such a setup; many tasks and processors simply don’t need this level of cooling. These units are pricey and only worthwhile if you’re doing extreme overclocking or running intensive tasks such as video editing or game streaming. Conclusion I've performed dozens of benchmarks in this feature, and my exhaustive testing – and years of building PCs – have illustrated that there's no easy answer when it comes to cooling. Instead, it's better to pick a cooler based on the system you're building. For example, Intel and AMD's stock coolers – which receive plenty of flack – undoubtedly have their place. If you're building a low-end machine for work or general computing, they'll be absolutely fine. Related: Intel Kaby Lake review Similarly, there are plenty of reasons to use third-party air coolers. An affordable air cooler such as the Deepcool Gammaxx S40 is perfect for budget gaming, and high-end air coolers are great for chilling powerful, overclocked systems. I've personally used the Noctua NH-D15 in my own rigs, and it's been a long-time favourite – no surprise, given its keen balance between cooling and silence. Then, finally, there are water coolers. These tend to be louder than many air coolers, but they're easily the most effective when it comes to keeping silicon chilled. For that reason, I'd recommend shelling out on one of these larger and pricier units if you're building an extreme system with a high-end, overclocked processor. Cheap liquid units just aren’t worth it unless you’re desperately worried about temperatures inside your chassis. Noise levels will suffer as a result as well. 0 shares Read Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Free Newsletter Get TrustedReviews' award-winning reviews, opinions and advice delivered to your inbox for free!

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Feb 1, 2017 at 9:00AM Microprocessor giant Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) fastest-growing business segment in 2016 was its Internet of Things group (IoTG). Through this business unit, Intel supplies processors and other technologies into markets such as automotive, manufacturing, retail, and more. Intel executive Diane Bryant. Image source: Intel. Although this business doesn't make up a large portion of the company's sales today (it accounted for just 4.4% of the company's revenue during 2016), it is a segment that Intel has repeatedly cited as one of its key long-term growth drivers. In this article, I'd like to go over this segment's financial results during 2016 and then look at the longer-term prospects for this business. Revenue and profit growth for the year Intel's IoTG saw revenue grow from about $2.3 billion in 2015 to $2.64 billion in 2016, coming just shy of 15% revenue growth year over year. Double-digit revenue growth is a solid result, but what really makes it interesting is that this represents a meaningful acceleration in business performance compared to last year, when Intel's IoTG only grew sales by roughly 7%. CEO Brian Krzanich attributed the acceleration in growth to "strength in the video, retail, and industrial segment." Operating profit in this segment also grew this year, hitting $585 million, up 13.5% from the $515 million in operating profit that it generated last year. Investors might note that revenue grew a touch faster than operating profit during 2016, implying a modest contraction in operating profit (operating margin dropped from 22.4% to 22.2%). Intel has signaled that it is investing more into IoTG, with Intel CFO Robert Swan citing a "step function increase" in Intel's investments in self-driving cars (Intel's automotive efforts all fall under the IoTG group). The modest operating margin contraction is likely indicative of increased operating expenses within the broader IoTG group rather than any potential gross profit margin/pricing pressure. Taking a longer-term look Although Intel has done a good job thus far of capitalizing on the opportunities and market segments that exist today, perhaps the most exciting thing about Intel's IoTG is the opportunity ahead of it in increasingly smart and autonomous vehicles. It is well understood that it takes a lot of computing power to support cars that can do all the calculations necessary to emulate a human driver. Additionally, tens of millions of new cars are sold each year. The thinking, then, is that if -- over time -- most, if not all, new cars come with a significant amount of computing power built-in, and if Intel can get a solid amount of market share, then the revenue growth opportunities could be quite significant. Furthermore, today Intel is likely spending significantly on products and technologies aimed at self-driving cars that won't begin to generate revenue for quite a while yet. At some point, Intel should be able to slow down the rate at which it increases its IoTG investments while revenue from the investments that Intel is making today will finally start coming in. If that revenue is significant, then over time Intel's IoTG could see operating profit margin expansion from the roughly 22% that it sits at today to, perhaps, 30% or more. In the near term, though, I expect Intel to continue to ratchet up investments, which may keep a lid on IoTG operating margins for a while. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Ltd.) In 1958, the first integrated circuit flip-flop was built using two transistors at Texas Instruments. The chips of today contain more than 1 billion transistors. The memory that could once support an entire company’s accounting system is now what a teenager carries in his smartphone. This scale of growth has resulted from a continuous scaling of transistors and other improvements in the Silicon manufacturing process. I. HISTORY: The invention of vacuum tubes is what launched the electronics industry. These devices would control the flow of electrons in vacuum. But, after the second world war, it was observed that due to a huge number of discrete components, the complexity and power consumption of these devices were increasing significantly. As a result, the performance of the devices would keep going down. One of the examples is of a Boeing B-29 which during the war, would consist of 300-1000 vacuum tubes. Each additional component would reduce the reliability and increase troubleshooting time. A major breakthrough came in 1947, when John Baden, William Shockley and Watter Brattain of Bell labs unveiled the first functioning point contact Germanium transistor. In 1950, Shockley developed the first Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT). In comparison to a vacuum tube, transistors are more reliable, power efficient and of lesser size. The transistor is a 3-terminal device which can be viewed as an electrically controlled switch. One of the terminals acts as a control terminal. Ideally, if current is applied to the control terminal, the device will act as a close switch between the two terminals which otherwise behave as an open switch. In 1958, Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments built the first Integrated Circuit consisting of two bipolar transistors connected on a single piece of silicon, thereby initiating the “Silicon Age”. Early ICs used bipolar junction transistors. One of the drawbacks of BJT is a problem due to more static power dissipation. It means that power is drawn even when the circuit is not switching. This limits the maximum numbers of transistors that can be integrated into a single silicon chip. In 1963, Frank Wanlass and C.T.Sah of Fairchild unveiled the first logic gate in which n-channel and p-channel transistors were used in a complementary symmetric circuit configuration. This is what is known as CMOS today. It draws almost zero static power dissipation. Early ICs used NMOS technology, because the NMOS process was fairly simple, less expensive and more devices could be packed into a single chip compared to CMOS technology. The first microprocessor was announced by Intel in 1971. As static power dissipation of NMOS transistor is more compared to CMOS, the power consumption of ICs became a serious issue in the 1980s as thousands of transistors were integrated into a single chip. Due to features like low power, reliable performance and high speed, CMOS technology would adopt and replace NMOS and bipolar technology for nearly all digital applications. Throughout the next few years, CMOS scaling and improvement in processing technologies have led to continuous enhancement in circuit speeds, along with further improvement in packaging densities of chips and performance-to-cost ratios of microelectronics-based products. Here, we discuss Bulk-Si CMOS technology, the need and importance of scaling, their various effects and associated solutions. We also address the physical scaling limits of transistor materials and any new materials used in advanced technology node. Nowadays, the industry is moving from the usage of planner transistor technology due to various limitations encountered below 32nm technology node. We discuss new device structures: SOI and FinFET which replaced planner bulk transistor. II. MOSFET DEVICE OVERVIEW: Here, we first discuss the basic structure, operation and important terms related to the core unit of CMOS i.e. MOSFET or simply MOS. The first successful MOS transistor would use metals for the gate material, SiO2 (oxide) for insulator and semiconductor for substrate. For that reason, this device was named MOS transistor. The name Field Effect Transistor (FET) refers to the fact that the gate is turned on and off by the transistor with an electric field passing through the gate oxide. A. Structure of MOS: Based on the type of conducting channel, two kinds of MOS structures are evident: n-channel and p-channel MOS. Here, we will only overview the NMOS transistor because both transistors are complementary in nature. MOS transistor is a 4-terminal device having terminal drains, source, gate and body (substrate). Figure 1 shows the 3-dimentional structure of NMOS. The NMOS transistor is formed on a p-type silicon substrate (also called body). On the top center part of the device, a low resistivity electrode is formed which is separated from the body by an insulator. Generally, poly-silicons with heavy doping of either n-type or p-type is used as gate material. Here, silicon dioxide (SiO2 or simply oxide) is used as an insulator. By implanting donor impurities in two sides of the substrate, the source and the drain are formed. In Figure 1, these regions are denoted by n+ which indicate heavy doping of donor impurities. This heavy doping results in low resistivity for these regions. If two n+ regions are biased at different potentials, the n+ region which is at lower potential will act as source while the other will act as drain. So, the drain and source terminals can be interchanged as per the potential applied to them. The region between source and drain is called the channel having width-W and length-L, which plays an important role in deciding the characteristics of an MOS transistor. Figure 1. Structure of NMOS transistor B. Why Polysilicon as Gate Material ?: In the early days of semiconductor industry, the metal, Aluminum, was generally used as the preferred gate material of MOS. But later on, polysilicon has been preferred as gate material. Two main reasons were behind this transition to polysilicon as discussed below here. The early MOS fabrication process started with the definition and doping of source and drain regions. Then, the gate mask was used which defines the gate oxide region which would later form the aluminum metal gate. One of the major drawbacks of such a fabrication process is that if the gate mask is misaligned, it creates a parasitic overlap input capacitance Cgd and Cgs, as shown in figure-2(a). The capacitance Cgd is more harmful because it is a feedback capacitance. As a result of miller capacitance, there is a reduction in the transistor’s switching speed. One of the solutions to the misalignment of the gate mask is what is known as a “Self-aligned Gate Process”. This process starts with the creation of the gate region followed by the creation of the drain and source regions using ion-implantation. The thin gate oxide under the gate acts as a mask for doping process preventing further doping under gate region (channel). So, this process makes the gate self-aligned with respect to the source and drain. As a result of all this, the source and drain do not extend under the gate. Thereby reducing Cgd and Cgs as shown in figure 2(b). Figure 2. (a) Cgd – Cgs Parasitic Cpacitances, (b) Reduced Cgd and Cgs as a result of Self aligned process The doping process of the drain and source require very high temperature annealing methods (>8000*C). If aluminum is used as a gate material, it would melt under such high temperature. This is because the melting point of Al is approximately 660 degree C. But, if polysilicon is used as a gate material, it would not melt. Thus, the self-alignment process is possible with polysilicon gate. While in the case of Al-gate, it is not possible, which results in high Cgd and Cgs. Undoped polysilicon has very high resistivity, approximately 108 ohm/Cm. So, polysilicon is doped in such a way that its resistance is reduced. The other reason for selecting poly is that the threshold voltage of MOS transistor is correlated with the work function difference between the gate and the channel. Earlier, metal gates were used when operating voltages were in the range of 3-5 volts. But, as the transistors were scaled down, which ensured that the operating voltages of the device were also brought down. A transistor with such high threshold voltage becomes non-operational under such conditions. Using metal as gate material resulted in high threshold voltage compared to polysilicon, since polysilicon would be of the same or similar composition as the bulk-Si channel. Also, as polysilicon is a semiconductor, its work function can be modulated by adjusting the level of doping. C. Working Principle of MOS: For MOS transistor, the gate voltage determines whether a current flow between the drain and source will happen or not. Let’s see further. When a sufficiently positive Vgs voltage is applied to the gates of NMOS, the positive charges are placed over the gate as shown in figure-3. These positive charges will repel the minority carriers of p-type substrate i.e. holes from the substrate, leaving behind negative charge acceptor ions which create depletion region. If we increase Vgs further, at some potential level it will even make the surface attractive to electrons. So, plenty of electrons are attracted to the surface. This situation is called inversion because the surface of p-type body normally has a large number of holes but the newer surfaces have a large numbers of electrons. Drain-to-body and source-to-body are kept in reverse bias. Here in figure-3, source-to-body is kept at zero bias. As drain-to-body potential is more positive than source-to-body potential, the reverse bias across drain-to-body is larger resulting in deeper depletion under drain region compared to source side. When positive potential across drain-to-source is applied, electrons flow from the source through the conducting channel and are drained by the drain. So, a positive current Id flows from drain-to-source. Figure 3. NMOS Transistor in inversion region III. TECHNOLOGY SCALING MOTIVATION: The demand for battery-operated portable gadgets have increased day by day with tons of applications including hearing aids, cellular phone, laptops etc. The “basic requirements” of such an application are less area, lower power consumption and cheaper development. For such portable devices, power dissipation is important because the power provided by the battery is rather limited. Unfortunately, battery technologies cannot be expected to improve the battery storage capacity by more than 30% every five years. This is not sufficient to handle the increasing power needed in portable devices. In 1965, Gordon E. Moore predicted that the number of transistors in an Integrated Circuit will double every two years (widely known as Moore’s law). By making transistors smaller, more circuits can be fabricated on the silicon wafer and therefore, the circuit becomes cheaper. The reduction in channel length enables faster switching operations since less time is needed for the current to flow from drain to source. In other words, a smaller transistor leads to smaller capacitance. This causes a reduction in transistor delay. As dynamic power is proportional to capacitance, the power consumption also reduces. This reduction of transistor size is called scaling. Each time a transistor is scaled, we say a new technology node has been introduced. The minimum channel length of transistor is called the technology node. For example, 0.18 micrometer, 0.13 micrometer, 90 nanometer etc. The scaling improves cost, performance and power consumption with every new generation of technology. IV. SMALL DIMENSIONS EFFECTS: For long channel devices, “edge effects” along the four sides of the channel are really negligible. For long channel devices, the electric field lines are everywhere perpendicular to the surface of the channel. These electric fields are controlled by gate voltage and back gate voltage. But, for short channel devices, the drain and source structure are closer to the channel, especially when the longitudinal electric field in the channel comes into picture. The longitudinal electric field is controlled by drain-source voltage. The longitudinal electric field is parallel to the current flow direction. The device is called short channel device if channel length is not much larger than the sum of source and drain depletion widths. In this section, we will discuss various undesirable effects arising as a result of two-dimensional potential distribution and high electric fields in the short channel. A. Carrier Velocity Saturation & Mobility Degradation: The electron drift velocity in the channel is proportional to the electric field for lower electric field values. These drift velocities tend to saturate at high electric fields. This is called velocity saturation. For short channel devices, the longitudinal electric field typically also increases. At such high electric fields, a velocity saturation occurs which affects I-V characteristics of the MOSFET. It has been observed that, for the same gate voltage, the saturation mode of MOSFET is achieved at smaller values of drain-source voltage and saturation current reductions. Due to higher vertical electric fields, the carriers of the channel scatter off of the oxide interface. This results in the degradation of carrier mobility and the reduction in drain current. B. Drain Induced Barrier Lowering: Another short channel effect is called DIBL which refers to the reduction of threshold voltage at higher drain voltage. If the gate voltage is not sufficient to invert the surface (i.e. gate voltage < threshold voltage), the carriers in the channel will face a potential barrier that could block the flow. By increasing gate potential, we eliminate this potential barrier. But, for short channel devices, such a potential barrier is controlled by both Vgs and Vds. If this drain voltage is increased, the depletion region of the drain-body increases in size and extends under the gate. So, the potential barrier in the channel decreases leading to carriers (electrons) flowing between source and drain, even at Vgs lower than Vt. The concept of drain lowering the channel barrier and reducing the threshold voltage is called DIBL. This reduction in threshold voltage with channel length is called Vt roll-off. The current that flows under such conditions is called sub-threshold current (off-state current). DIBL causes drain current to increase with a rise in drain bias even in saturation mode. C. Punch-through: Punch-through is a severe case of barrier lowering. When the drain bias is increased, the depletion region surrounding the drain can extend further towards the source with two depletion regions merging. This condition is called punch-through. Under such conditions, the gate voltage loses its control over the drain current with rising drain current sharply. The punch-through effect increases with decreasing channel length. Due to punch-through, we cannot turn off the device, so the device becomes useless as shown in the figure 4. Figure 4. Punch through – merging of two depletion region D. Hot Carrier Effects: For smaller geometric devices, the electric field increases especially near the drain. As a result, the electrons (carriers) get a significant amount of energy which are called hot carriers. Some of them get nearly enough energy which lead to impact ionization near drain, whereby new electron-hole pairs are generated. As an effect, it gives rise to drain-to-body current (Idb). A small numbers of hot electrons may tunnel through oxide and collect themselves by gate. While some hot carriers can even damage the oxide resulting in device degradation. V. CONTROLLING SHORT CHANNEL EFFECTS: We observed in the previous section that if channel length is small compared to the depletion regions, short channel effects become intolerable. This limits the further reduction achievable in gate length. To limit these effects, the depletion region width should be reduced with corresponding reduction in channel length. This can be achieved by either increasing channel doping concentration or increasing gate capacitance, or both. Gate capacitance determines the gate’s control over the channel. Equation 1 indicates that gate capacitance can be increased by scaling (reducing) gate oxide thickness. It has been observed that a device with thinner gate oxide has reduced depletion width, and hence, improved SCE characteristics. COX = EOX / TOX (Equation - 1) Where, COX : Gate Oxide Capacitance, EOX : Electric Field of oxide, TOX : Oxide Thickness For Intel’s process nodes in the last 25 years, it has been observed that the oxide has been scaled roughly in proportion to the channel length in order to limit SCE. The relationship between channel length and oxide thickness for Intel’s technology nodes is given in Equation-2. L = 45 X TOX (Equation - 2) Where, L: Channel Length, TOX : Oxide Thickness VI. POST TRADITIONAL SCALING INNOVAIONS: A. Mobility Booster: Strained Silicon Technology One of the key scaling problems in nano scale transistors is the mobility degradation caused by the larger vertical electric field. There are many ways to enhance transistor performance and mobility. One way is to use thin germanium film in the channel because germanium has higher carrier mobility. Another way is to use strained silicon by introducing mechanical strain in the channel. The strained silicon technology involves physically stretching or compressing the silicon crystal using various means, which in turn, increases carrier (electrons/holes) mobility and enhances the performance of the transistor. For example, the hole mobility of PMOS can be increased when the channel is compressively stressed. For making compressive strain in the silicon channel, the source and drain regions are filled with Si-Ge film by an epitaxial growth. Si-Ge typically comprises of 20% germanium and 80% silicon mixture. The number of Si and Ge atoms are equal to original Si atoms. Germanium atoms are larger than silicon atoms. So when a force is created, it pushes the channel and raises the hole mobility. Increasing the mobility of the semiconductor improves drive current and transistor speed. The strained silicon techniques for MOS transistor were first used by Intel in their 90nm process technology in 2003. In this technology node, the Si-Ge source drain structure used for PMOS transistor induces compressive strain in the channel, improving current by 25%. While NMOS strain is introduced by adding high stress Si3N4 capping layer around transistor, improving current by 10%. B. Gate Leakage Reduction: High-K Dielectric The thickness of SiO2 (oxide) dielectric should be scaled in proportion to its channel length. The 65nm node, require Effective Oxide Thickness (EOT) of approximately 2.3nm (actual 1.6nm). But, if oxide thickness is reduced further below this point, the direct tunneling of carrier phenomena will be dominant. As a result of all this, the gate leakage increases to an unacceptable limit. So, the thickness limit for the oxide is approximately 1.6nm which is set by gate-to-channel tunneling leakage (also called quantum mechanical tunneling). If we look at equation-1, the only option remaining is to select dielectric material having high dielectric constant (K) to increase the oxide capacitance. Since, thicker dielectric layers can be used, we get high gate-oxide capacitance. This thicker layer results in less carrier tunneling. SiO2 has dielectric constant of 3.9. A breakthrough in gate oxide comes in 2007, the hafnium (HfO2) based High-K dielectric material was first introduced by Intel in its 45nm high volume manufacturing process. Hafnium material has dielectric constant of approximately 25 which is 6 times higher than SiO2. Figure 5. a) PMOS: Uniaxial Compressive Strain b) NMOS: Uniaxial Tensile Strain EOT is given by equation 3. The equation 3 implies that 6nm thick HfO2 provides EOT of approximately 1nm. EOT = ( 3.9 X TOX ) / K (Equation - 3) Where, EOT: Effective Oxide Thickness, Tox: Oxide Thickness, K: Dielectric Constant of Material C. Poly Depletion Elimination: Metal Gate A depletion region forms at the interface of poly-silicon and gate oxide. As the device continues to scale down, this poly-silicon depletion becomes larger and a larger fraction of the equivalent oxide thickness will limit gate oxide capacitance. The negative effects of poly-depletion is due to reduction in inversion layer charge density and a degradation of device performance. So, apart from gate oxide thickness, poly depletion layer thickness also needs to be minimized. Moreover, poly gates can also be incompatible with high-K dielectric because of effects such as threshold voltage pinning and photon scattering which make it difficult to obtain low threshold voltage and reduce the channel’s mobility. One solution to eliminate poly-depletion effect is the use of metal gate instead of poly gate. A metal gate not only eliminates poly-depletion effect, but also enables the use of high-K dielectric. Intel had first introduced 45nm node using high-K dielectric and metal gate technology. Different metals are used for NMOS and PMOS as different work-functions are required for NMOS and PMOS. A transistor process flow starts with the deposition of high-K dielectric and dummy poly-silicon. After the high temperature annealing process, the inter layer dielectric is deposited and polished to expose poly-silicon. Then, a dummy poly-silicon is removed. At last, PMOS and then NMOS work function metals are deposited in the gate trenches. VII. NEW INNOVATIVE DEVICE STRUCTURES: For conventional MOS structure, as the channel length shrinks, the gate does not have full control over the channel which is not desirable. One of its effects is to cause more sub-threshold leakage from drain to source, which is not good from power consumption point of view. In conventional MOS, the gate cannot control leakage path which is far removed from the it. This can be improved using various MOS structures which allow the scaling of a transistor beyond conventional MOS scaling limit. In this section, we will discuss two new MOS structures, SOI and FinFET. The main objective of both the structures is to maximize gate-to-channel capacitance and minimize drain-to-channel capacitance. A. Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI): The main difference between conventional MOS structure and SOI MOS structure is that SOI device has a buried oxide layer, which isolates the body from the substrate. As shown in the Figure 7, SOI transistor is a planner device. The fabrication process of SOI MOS is similar to bulk MOS (conventional MOS) process except for the starting silicon wafer. SOI wafers have three layers; 1. Thin surface layer of silicon (where the transistors are formed). 2. An underlying layer of insulating material. 3. A support or "handle" silicon wafer. Figure 6. SOI Wafer The basic idea behind buried oxide layer is, that it will reduce the parasitic junction capacitance. And the smaller the parasitic capacitance, the faster will the transistor work. Giving higher performance. Due to BOX layer, there is no unwanted leakage paths which are far from the gate. This leads to lower power consumption. Depending on the condition of the thin body during operation, SOI devices are categorized as Partially Depleted (PD) SOI and Fully Depleted (FD) SOI. Compared to PD SOI, FD SOI have very thin body structures, hence the body is fully depleted during operation. This FD SOI also called Ultra-Thin-Body SOI. For PD SOI, body is 50 nm to 90 nm thick. While for FD SOI, the body is about 5 nm to 20 nm thick. Figure 7. Structure of SOI FET Advantages of SOI Devices: Owing to oxide layer isolation, the drain/source parasitic capacitances are reduced. So, the delay and dynamic power consumption of the device is lower compared to bulk CMOS. Due to an oxide layer, the threshold voltage is less dependent on back gate bias compared to bulk CMOS. This makes the SOI device more suitable for low power applications. Sub-threshold characteristics of SOI devices are better, so leakage currents are smaller. SOI devices have no latch-up problems. Drawbacks of SOI Devices: One of the drawbacks of PD SOI device is that they suffer from history effect. In PD SOI, as the body becomes thicker, a floating body is evident. So, the body voltage is dependent on the previous state of the device. This floating body voltage can change the threshold voltage of the device. It could cause significant mismatch between two identical transistors. The other problem with an SOI device is self-heating. In SOI device, the active thin body is on silicon oxide which is good thermal insulator. During an operation, the power consumed by the active region cannot be dissipated easily. As a result, the temperature of the thin body rises which decreases the mobility and current of the device. One of the challenges with FD SOI is the difficulty in manufacturing thin body SOI wafers. B. FinFET: Former TSMC CTO and Berkeley professor Chenming Hu and his team presented the concept of FinFET in 1999 and UTB-SOI (FD SOI) in 2000. The main principle behind both the structures is a thin body, so the gate capacitance is closer to whole channel. The body is very thin, around 10nm or less. So, there is no leakage path which is far from the gate. The gate can effectively control the leakage. The basic structure of FinFET which they proposed would be a channel controlled by more than one side of channel. One of the Double-Gate Structures is shown in Figure 8. Figure 8. Double Gate Structure Modern FinFETs are 3D structures as shown in the Figure 9 also called tri-gate transistor. FinFETs can be implemented either on bulk silicon or SOI wafer. This FinFET structure consists of thin (vertical) fin of silicon body on a substrate. The gate is wrapped around the channel providing excellent control from three sides of the channel. This structure is called the FinFET because its Si body resembles the back fin of a fish. Figure 9. Fin-FET Structure In bulk-MOS (planner MOS), the channel is horizontal. While in FinFET channel, it is vertical. So for FinFET, the height of the channel (Fin) determines the width of the device. The perfect width of the channel is given by Equation 4. Width of Channel = 2 X Fin Height + Fin Width (Equation-4) (Source: Synopsys) The drive current of the FinFET can be increased by increasing the width of the channel i.e. by increasing the height of the Fin. We can also increase the device drive current by constructing parallel multiple fins connected together as shown in the Figure 10. It implies that for a FinFET, the arbitrary channel width is not possible, since it is always a multiple of fin height. So, effective width of the device becomes quantized. While in planner devices, there is the freedom to choose the device’s drive strength by varying channel width. Figure 10. Multi-Fin FinFET Structure In conventional MOS, a doping is inserted into the channel, reducing the various SCEs and ensuring high Vth. While in FinFET, the gate structure is wrapped around the channel and the body is thin, providing better SCEs, so channel doping becomes optional. It implies that FinFET suffers less from dopant-induced variations. Low channel doping also ensures better mobility of the carriers inside the channel. Hence, higher performance. One thing noticed over here is that both FinFET and SOI technologies have introduced Body Thickness as a new scaling parameter. FinFET technology provides numerous advantages over bulk CMOS, such as higher drive current for a given transistor footprint, hence higher speed, lower leakage, hence lower power consumption, no random dopant fluctuation, hence better mobility and scaling of the transistor beyond 28nm. VIII. SOI VS FINFET: As SOI technology is very close to planner bulk technology, it does not require much investment in Fab. So, existing bulk technology libraries can easily be converted to SOI libraries. Another advantage of SOI over FinFET is, that it has good back gate bias option. By creating back gate region below BOX, we can also control Vt. This make it suitable for low power applications. The primary limitation of SOI technology is the cost of an SOI wafer which is higher than a bulk Silicon wafer because it is very difficult to control the tin silicon film throughout the wafers. Another stumbling block for SOI adoption is a limited number of SOI wafer suppliers. According to Intel, SOI wafer adds approximately 10% to the total process cost. In comparison to SOI, FinFET has higher drive current. Moreover in FinFET, the strain technology can be used to increase carrier mobility. One of the downsides of FinFET is its complex manufacturing process. According to Intel, the cost of FinFET manufacturing can increase by 2-3% over bulk. Figure 11. Strengths-Weaknesses of SOI and FinFET IX. SOI-FINFET IN MICROELECTRONICS INDUSTRY: Intel introduced Trigate FETs at the 22 nm node in the Ivy-Bridge processor in 2012. Other foundries that are offering FinFET technology are TSMC, Global Foundry, and Samsung. In 2014, TSMC announced that it has produced its first fully functional ARM-based networking processor with 16nm FinFET technology. STMicroelectronics released its first FD-SOI chips for mobile processor at 28nm in 2012. Foundries that are offering FD-SOI technology are IBM, Global Foundry, and Samsung. Some of the products using SOI technology are AMD's processor, PowerPC microprocessor and Sony's PlayStation. X. WHAT NEXT?: Both FinFET and SOI structure have better gate control and lower threshold voltage with less leakage. But, when we move to lower technology node say below 10nm node, the issue of leakage starts again. This leads to many other issues like threshold flattening, increase in power density, and thermal dissipation. FinFET structure is less efficient in terms of heat dissipations, as heat can easily be accumulated on the fins. These concerns can lead to a new class of design rule - Design for Thermal, unlike other design rule like Design for Manufacturability. As these devices are approaching their limitations, eInfochips is working with Academia to come with potential solutions which include modification in device structure, replacing existing silicon material with new materials. Among them, Carbon Nanotube (CNT) FET, Gate-All-Around Nanowire FET or FinFETs with compound semiconductors may prove as promising solutions in future technology nodes. XI. REFERENCES: 1. C.

It's Looking Like The Intel Gallium3D "ILO" Driver Will Be Laid To Rest Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 1 February 2017 at 09:35 AM EST. 5 Comments Back in December was talk of dropping the (unofficial) Intel "ILO" Gallium3D driver while now it's looking like that may move forward. The Intel ILO Gallium3D driver was developed by LunarG as a sort of proving-grounds for low-level driver experiments, comparing ILO to the classic i965 Mesa driver, and more. But that ILO driver hasn't been really touched in years, doesn't properly support recent generations of Intel hardware, and has basically fallen into disrepair. In December was the proposal to remove it from the Mesa Git tree. Some possible future use-cases were talked about like using ILO in order to run the Direct3D 9 (Gallium Nine) state tracker on Intel hardware, but it looks like it's going to be put out to sea with no one stepping up to take over it. Chia-I Wu who led the development of ILO at LunarG commented, "I think it is fine to drop the driver :( Not because the driver is currently unmaintained, which is very true and is a very good reason, but that there is now a Intel Vulkan driver. Vulkan is somewhat as low-level as Gallium is (or even lower-level). The driver has most things I like to see as well (low CPU overhead, minimal/predictable heap allocation, generated register descriptions, etc.). Sorry for the confusions and burdens it bring to others, and thanks to the few individuals/groups who find it useful for their needs at various times." Edward O'Callaghan has now re-based his patch for dropping the ILO Gallium3D driver, per this Mesa-dev message. The work hasn't yet hit Mesa Git, but given the lack of opposition, it will probably land soon. Removing this unmaintained Intel Gallium3D driver lightens Mesa by around 54k lines of code. 5 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Unfortunately, just about everything down to the IPC performance remained unchanged. It could be argued Intel's accompanying 200-series chipsets saw more notable upgrades than the CPUs themselves, but even those were essentially limited to a few extra PCIe lanes and support for Intel Optane Technology. Making the release more exciting, board partners including Gigabyte and Asrock launched alongside some drool-inducing motherboards. Since then, Asrock has sent half a dozen new Z270 motherboards our way, so we thought it was about time we looked at a few of them. Starting with the Z270 Extreme4 and then we'll check out the Fatal1ty Z270 Gaming K6 which we previewed in our Kaby Lake review. Both boards feature similar layouts and designs, but we're betting there's more that separates them from Intel's standard spec as Z270 Extreme4 is priced at $150 and the Fatal1ty Z270 Gaming K6 is $170 -- not the highest-end models but also not entry-level, so we're keen to see what's hiding under the hood. Asrock Z270 Extreme4 For a $150 motherboard sporting Intel's flagship chipset, the Z270 Extreme4 seems quite feature packed and it's certainly no eye-sore either. The black PCB has been branded with a large white X which obviously points to this being an 'extreme' series motherboard. The design is very cool and the X ties in with the chipset heatsink and I/O cover. Of course none of this is really important as it doesn't improve performance, stability or reliability, it just looks cool and most PC enthusiasts will appreciate that. Moving past the Extreme4's makeup, we find a rather substantial feature set. The sound hardware alone is comprised of Nichicon fine gold series audio caps, a 120dB SNR DAC with differential amplifier, a TI NE5532 headset amplifier for front panel audio supporting up to 600 Ohm headsets, isolated PCB shielding, individual PCB layers for the right and left audio channels, 15μ gold audio connectors and support for DTS connect, courtesy of Asrock's built-in Purity Sound 4 audio solution which takes advantage of the Realtek ALC1220 audio codec. The networking support is basic but not low quality. The board features a single Gigabit LAN port and it's connected to the Intel I219V chip for Wake-On-LAN, Lightning/ESD Protection (Asrock Full Spike Protection), Energy Efficient Ethernet 802.3az and PXE support. There are plenty of USB 3.0 ports onboard as well as a few USB 3.1 (10Gb/s) ports. Asrock has also included the ASMedia ASM1074 hub which provides an additional USB 3.0 header. The I/O panel includes a USB 3.1 Type-A and Type-C port and I will talk more about the I/O panel connectivity shortly. Other unique features include a premium 45A power choke, memory alloy choke (Reduces 70% core loss compared to iron powder choke), Nichicon 12K black caps (100% Japan made high quality conductive polymer capacitors), Asrock Intel 4-Layer Memory POOL (Planes on Outer Layers) Technology, steel PCIe x16 slots and Asrock Full Spike Protection. The storage setup is also basic for a Z270 motherboard, though the Z270 Extreme4 still boasts half a dozen SATA 6GB/s ports and a pair of M.2 ports, Ultra M.2 ports in this case. The M.2 ports support type 2230/2242/2260/2280/22110 devices using either the SATA 6Gbps or PCI Express Gen3 x4 (32Gb/s) interfaces. Additionally, Asrock has included an ASMedia ASM1061 chip for an additional two SATA 6Gbps ports. Rounding out the features worthy of mention are 15μ gold contacts for the DIMM and PCIe slots, a pair of AMI UEFI BIOS chips with multilingual GUI support (1 x Main BIOS and 1 x Backup BIOS), along with the M.2 slot (Key E) supporting type 2230 Wi-Fi/BT modules. Around at the I/O panel we find a single PS/2 port support for either a legacy keyboard or mouse, four USB 3.0 ports, two USB 3.1 ports, VGA, DVI, HDMI, Gigabit LAN, five audio jacks and a S/PDIF port. Please note that the Type-C port only supports the USB 3.1 interface and not Thunderbolt 3. For Thunderbolt support users will need to purchase Asrock's Thunderbolt AIC card separately and only one card is supported. Asrock Fatal1ty Z270 Gaming K6 Having explored the 'Extreme' model, let's see what Asrock has whipped up for gamers with its Fatal1ty brand series. The Fatal1ty Z270 Professional Gaming i7 is the king of the hill for the LGA1151 socket but it's also upward of $200 so we felt the Gaming K6 version was better priced for comparison with the Extreme4. The gaming-oriented features include SoundBlaster's Cinema3 software and an extra Intel Gigabit LAN port, but beyond that we have what looks to be essentially the same motherboard with a different color scheme. Truth be told, even the audio solutions are virtually identical, the gaming model just adds support for Creative's software to provide greater control over your sound. The additional wired network connection is handled by the Intel I211AT chip while the Intel I219V is also being used again. Wi-Fi isn't included out of the box with this board either, but Asrock did add an M.2 Socket (Key E) supporting a type 2230 Wi-Fi/BT module. Gamers thinking about buying this board have to ask themselves if having an extra Gigabit network connection and Creative Sound Blaster Cinema 3 support is worth an additional $20.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek What Is a “Chipset”, and Why Should I Care? You’ve probably heard the term “chipset” tossed around when talking about new computers, but what exactly is a chipset, and how does it affect your computer’s performance? In a nutshell, a chipset acts like the motherboard’s communications center and traffic controller, and it ultimately determines what components are compatible with the motherboard—including the CPU, RAM, hard drives, and graphics cards. It also dictates your future expansion options, and to what extent, if any, your system can be overclocked. These three criteria are important when considering which motherboard to buy. Let’s talk a little bit about why. A Brief History of Chipsets Chips Ahoy! An old school IBM PC motherboard circa 1981. Back in the days of computer yore, PC motherboards consisted of lots of discrete integrated circuits. This generally required a separate chip or chips to control each system component: mouse, keyboard, graphics, sounds, and so on. As you can imagine, having all those various chips scattered about was pretty inefficient. In order to address this problem, computer engineers needed to devise a better system, and began integrating these disparate chips into fewer chips. With the advent of the PCI bus, a new design emerged: bridges. Instead of a bunch of chips, motherboards came with a northbridge and a southbridge, which consisted of just two chips with very specific duties and purposes. The northbridge chip was known as such because it was located at the top, or northern, portion of the motherboard. This chip was directly connected to the CPU and acted as a communication middleman for a system’s higher speed components: RAM (memory controllers), PCI Express controller, and on older motherboard designs, the AGP controller. If these components wanted to talk to the CPU, they had to go through the northbridge first. Motherboard design became more and more efficient as time goes on. The southbridge, on the other hand, was located toward the bottom (southern portion) of the motherboard. The southbridge was responsible for handling lower performing components such as the PCI bus slots (for expansion cards), SATA and IDE connectors (for hard drives), USB ports, onboard audio and networking, and more. In order for these components to talk to the CPU, they had to first had to go through the southbridge, which then went to the northbridge, and from there to the CPU. These chips came to be known as a “chipset”, because it was literally a set of chips. The Steady March Towards Total Integration The old traditional northbridge and southbridge chipset design could obviously be improved upon, though, and steadily gave way to today’s “chipset”, which really isn’t a set of chips at all. Instead, the old northbridge/southbridge architecture has ceded to a more modern, single-chip system. Many components, like memory and graphics controllers, are now integrated into and handled directly by the CPU. As these higher priority controller functions moved to the CPU, any remaining duties were rolled into one remaining southbridge-style chip. Intel’s X99 chipset schematic gives you an idea of its features and system potential. For example, newer Intel systems incorporate a Platform Controller Hub, or PCH, which is actually a single chip on the motherboard that assume the duties the old southbridge chip once handled. The PCH is then connected to the CPU via something called the Direct Media Interface, or DMI. The DMI is actually not a new innovation, and has been the traditional way of linking northbridge to southbridge on Intel systems since 2004. AMD chipsets aren’t that much different, with the old southbridge now being dubbed the Fusion Controller Hub, or FCH. The CPU and FCH on AMD systems are then connected to one another via the Unified Media Interface or UMI. It’s basically the same architecture as Intel’s, but with different names. Many CPUs from both Intel and AMD come with integrated graphics built-in, too, so you don’t need a dedicated graphics card (unless you’re doing more intensive tasks like gaming or video editing). (AMD refers to these chips as Accelerated Processing Units, or APUs, rather than CPUs, but that’s more of a marketing term that helps people distinguish between AMD CPUs with integrated graphics and those without.) All this means, then, is that stuff like the storage controllers (SATA ports), network controllers, and all those formerly lesser performing components now only have one hop. Instead of going from the southbridge to northbridge to the CPU, they can just hop from the PCH (or FCH) to the CPU. Consequently, latency is reduced and the system is more responsive. Your Chipset Determines Which Parts Are Compatible Okay, so now you have a basic idea of what a chipset is, but why should you care? As we outlined at the beginning, your computer’s chipset determines three main things: component compatibility (what CPU and RAM can you use?), expansion options (how many PCI cards can you use?), and overclockability. Let’s talk about each of these in a bit more detail—starting with compatibility. RELATED ARTICLE What’s the Difference Between DDR3 and DDR4 RAM? Component choice is important. Will your new system be the latest generation Intel Core i7 processor, or are you willing to settle for something a little older (and cheaper)? Do you want higher clocked DDR4 RAM, or is DDR3 okay? How many hard drives are you connecting and what kind? Do you need Wi-Fi built-in, or will you be using Ethernet? Will you be running multiple graphics cards, or a single graphics card with other expansion cards? The mind boggles at all the potential considerations, and better chipsets will offer more (and newer) options. Price is going to be a big determining factor here, too. Needless to say, the bigger and badder the system, the more it will cost—both in terms of the components themselves, and the motherboard that supports them. If you’re building a computer, you’re probably going to lay out your needs based on what you want to put into it and your budget. Your Chipset Determines Your Expansion Options Chipset also dictates how much room for expansion cards (like video cards, TV tuners, RAID card, and so on) you have in your machine, thanks to the buses they use. System components and peripherals—CPU, RAM, expansion cards, printers, etc.—connect to the motherboard via “buses”. Every motherboard contains several different types of buses, which can vary in terms of speed and bandwidth, but for simplicity’s sake, we can break them down into two: external buses (including USB, serial, and parallel) and internal buses. The primary internal bus found on modern motherboards is known as PCI Express (PCIe). PCIe utilizes “lanes”, which allow internal components such as RAM and expansion cards to communicate with the CPU and vice versa. A lane is simply two pairs of wired connections—one pair sends data, the other receives data. So, a 1x PCIe lane will consist of four wires, 2x has eight, and so forth. The more wires, the more data can be exchanged. A 1x connection can handle 250 MB in each direction, 2x can handle 512 MB, etc. A link between two PCI Express devices consists of lanes. How many lanes available to you depends on how many lanes the motherboard itself has, as well as the bandwidth capacity (number of lanes) the CPU can deliver. For example, many Intel desktop CPUs have 16 lanes (newer generation CPUs have 28 or even 40). Z170 chipset motherboards provide another 20, for a total of 36. The X99 chipset supplies 8 PCI Express 2.0 lanes, and up to 40 PCI Express 3.0 lanes, depending on the CPU you use. Thus, on a Z170 motherboard, a PCI Express 16x graphics card will use up 16 lanes all by itself. As a result, you use can two of these together on a Z170 board at full speed, leaving you with four lanes left over for additional components. Alternatively, you can run one PCI Express 3.0 card over 16 lanes (16x) and two cards over 8 lanes (8x), or four cards at 8x (if you buy a motherboard that can accommodate that many). Now, at the end of the day, this won’t matter for most users. Running multiple cards at 8x instead of 16x only decreases performance by a few frames per second, if at all. Similarly, you’re unlikely to see any difference between PCIe 3.0 and PCIe 2.0 either, in most cases, less than 10%. But if you plan on having a lot of expansion cards—like two graphics cards, a TV tuner, and a Wi-Fi card—you can fill up a motherboard pretty fast. In many cases, you’ll run out of slots before you exhaust all your PCIe bandwidth. But in other cases, you’ll need to make sure your CPU and motherboard have enough lanes to support all the cards you want to add (or you’ll run out of lanes and some cards may not work). Your Chipset Determines Your PC’s Overclocking Ability So your chipset determines which parts are compatible with your system, and how many expansion cards you can use. But there’s one other main thing it determines: overclocking. RELATED ARTICLE What Is Overclocking? The Beginner’s Guide to Understanding How Geeks Speed Up Their PCs Overclocking simply means pushing a component’s clock rate higher than it was designed to run. Many system tweakers opt to overclock their CPU or GPU to boost gaming or other performance without spending more money. This may seem like a no-brainer, but along with that speed increase comes higher power usage and heat output, which can cause stability issues and decrease the lifespan of your parts. It also means you’ll need bigger heatsinks and fans (or liquid cooling) to ensure everything stays cool. It definitely isn’t for the faint of heart. Here’s the thing, though: only certain CPUs are ideal for overclocking (a good place to start is with Intel and AMD models with K in their names). Furthermore, only certain chipsets may allow overclocking, and some may require special firmware to enable it. So if you want to overclock, you’ll need to take chipset into consideration as you shop for motherboards. Chipsets that allow overclocking will have the requisite controls (voltage, multiplier, base clock, etc.) in their UEFI or BIOS to increase a CPU’s clock speed. If the chipset doesn’t handle overclocking, then those controls won’t be there (or if they are, they’ll be all but useless) and you may have spent your hard-earned cash on a CPU that is basically locked at its advertised speed. So if overclocking is a serious consideration, then it pays to know ahead of time which chipsets are better suited for it right out of the box. If you’re in need of further direction, then there are a bevy of buyer’s guides out there, which will tell you in no uncertain terms which Z170 motherboards or X99 motherboards (or any other overclockable chipset) will work best for you. How to Comparison Shop for a Motherboard Here’s the good news: you don’t really need to know everything about every chipset to choose a motherboard. Sure, you could research all the modern chipsets, deciding between Intel’s business, mainstream, performance, and value chipsets, or learning all about AMD’s  A Series and 9 Series. Or, you could just let a site like Newegg do the heavy lifting  for you. Let’s say you want to build a powerful gaming machine with a current generation Intel processor. You would head to a site like Newegg, use the navigation tree to narrow your pool down to Intel motherboards. You’d then use the sidebar to further narrow down your search by form factor (depending on how big you want the PC to be), CPU socket (depending on which CPU(s) you’re open to using), and maybe even narrow it down by brand or price, if you want. From there, click through some of the remaining motherboards and check the “Compare” box under the ones that look good. Once you’ve picked a few, click the “Compare” button and you’ll be able to compare them feature-by-feature. Let’s take this Z170 board from MSI and this X99 board from MSI, for example. If we plug them both into Newegg’s compare feature, we see a chart with a ton of features: You can see some of the differences due to chipset. The Z170 board can accommodate up to 64 GB of DDR4 RAM, while the X99 board can take up to 128GB. The Z170 board has four 16x PCI Express 3.0 slots, but the maximum processor this it can handle is a Core i7-6700K, which maxes out at 16 lanes for a total of 36. The X99 board, on the other hand, can accommodate up to 40 PCI Express 3.0 lanes if you have an expensive processor like a Core i7 6850 CPU. For most users, this won’t matter, but if you have a bunch of expansion cards, you’ll need to count lanes and make sure the board you pick has enough bandwidth. Obviously the X99 system is more powerful—but as you look through these comparison charts, you’ll need to ask yourself what features you actually need. The Z170 chipset will accept up to eight SATA devices and this particular motherboard includes a wealth of other features that make it an attractive prospect for a powerful gaming PC. The X99 chipset is only necessary if you need a serious CPU with four or more cores, more than 64 GB of RAM, or you need a lot of expansion cards. You may even find, as you compare motherboards, that you can dial things back even further. Maybe you end up considering a more modest Z97 system, which will handle up to 32 GB of DDR3 RAM, a fairly capable 16 lane Core i7 4790K CPU, and one PCI Express 3.0 graphic card running at full speed. The tradeoffs between these chipsets are apparent, with each ascending chipset, you have a choice of better CPUs, RAM, and graphics options, not to mention more of each. But the costs rises appreciably as well. Thankfully, you don’t have to know the ins and outs of every chipset before diving in—you can use these comparison charts to compare feature-by-feature. (Note that, while Newegg is likely the best site to do your comparisons, there are lots of other great stores to buy the parts from—including Amazon, Fry’s, and Micro Center). The only thing these comparison charts won’t discuss, usually, is overclocking ability. It may mention certain overclocking features, but you should also dig into reviews and do a little googling to ensure it can handle overclocking. Remember, when considering any components, motherboard or otherwise, make sure you do your due diligence. Don’t just rely on user reviews, take some time to Google actual hardware reviews to see how the pros feel about them. Beyond the absolute necessities (RAM, graphics and CPU), any chipset should address all your essential needs—whether it’s onboard audio, USB ports, LAN, legacy connectors, and so on. What you get, however, is going to depend on the motherboard itself and the features the manufacturer decided to include. So if you absolutely want something like Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, and the board you’re considering doesn’t include it, you will have to buy it as an additional component (which will often take up one of those USB or PCI express slots). System building is an art in and of itself, and there’s quite a bit more to it than what we talked about here today. But hopefully this gives you a clearer picture of what a chipset is, why it is important, and some of the considerations you need to take into account when choosing a motherboard and components for a new system.

Another great, informative and well written article. Thanks very much! February 1, 2017 Matt Klein You're welcome and thank you for the feedback! February 2, 2017 Pradip Shah Regardless of the functionality, features or reliability the actual implementation is what finally determines the quality of the built system. I have always built my own systems and those for the friends and family. A couple of years back I built 3 systems for i3 processor built around H77E chipset. I managed to get 2 motherboards made by AsRock which have been functioning flawlessly, including ALL usb 2 and 3 ports as well as the Berg headers. However for the third one I could get only an Intel DH77EB motherboard that sucked from day one. USB 2 pors on the back could not even reliably drive port powered USB 2 drives drawing less than 450ma. The usb 3 ports on the back could not drive USB 2 drive drawing just about 550 ma. Could not use the USB 3 header for additional front / back ports for more than a year until the bios was upgraded twice. Even the on board Sata ports would lose connection to the hard drive. It even dropped connection to the 2 Via Chipset based USB 3 add-on cards! The disconnected USB drives could not be brought on line again without rebooting the system. If it ever went to sleep it would wake up on keyboard or mouse movement only if it was my lucky day. At least 8 to 10 attempts at installing trial versions of Win 10 ended it total failures. BTW AMD is was/is no better in this USB department. Out of frustration I simply dumped it in favour of an Asus H61M-CS mother board which only lacked on board USB 3 ports by comparison. For the past 10 days the system has been working for 16+ hours every day with not one single glitch. It even goes to sleep with I believe practically zero power to the CPU with its fan turning off and also putting non-resumable apps to sleep. Slightest movement of the mouse will now wake up the system gracefully and continue from exactly where it had hone to sleep. Reconnect ALL the USB devices, I have 5 external drives connected to 2 add-on USB 3 cards and a USB 2 wifi dongle, with ZERO error. So back to chipsets. The only absolutely reliable one came ONLY from VIA. Only competitor to it was SYS based systems. I maintain systems with these chipsets that are anywhere from 8 to 10 years old. May be they are 10% slower but 100 % functional and rock solid. I even have a C-7 cpu based mini-itx system which is 8 years old and going strong. As an aside Intel could not even design a reliable 230 Mhz Pentium cpu until they acquired Digital and its technology and patents which already had 500+ Mhz fully functional processor. Got Feedback?

It’s able to do that because of its stable of established hardware designs. Take the Lenovo Yoga 710 15-Inch for example. You’d never know that aluminum-clad machine isn’t a regular notebook by just glancing at it. Advertisement The Lenovo Yoga 710 15-Inch is more than a notebook, though. It gets its “Yoga” designation thanks to two hinges that allow its display to lay flat on its back. Even if the idea isn’t fresh and new, the high-end feel of the machine is. Add in some upgraded Intel hardware and a fingerprint reader and you’ve got a machine that handles well and looks nice for a perfectly reasonable $829.99. Lenovo Yoga 710 15-Inch Review: Design & Internals Lenovo makes a lot of notebooks besides the Lenovo Yoga 710 15-inch. Almost none of them are as attractive and elegant looking. Advertisement The notebook’s cover and body are all sculpted pieces of aluminum. Mixed in with all of this slick black surface area are silver accents that glisten in the sunlight. These silver edges run around the 15.6-inch display. They run around the perimeter of the keyboard deck, too. Their smartest use is as visual markers for where you should place your finger when using the touchpad and the fingerprint reader. Despite being a fingerprint magnet, the aluminum looks nice. Advertisement Lenovo calls this color, Black Pearl, which is fitting, I suppose. Priced at $849, the company is hoping that this notebook will appeal to shoppers for whom design is just as important as how the hardware inside performs. To underscore that further, the machine comes equipped with JBL Stereo speakers and an NVIDIA 940MX graphics card with 2GB of dedicated RAM. The keyboard also has backlighting, which is something usually left out of less costly machines. The Yoga 710 15-inch is attractive and stunning, but it’s not light. It weighs 4.41 pounds. That’s definitely a minus for anyone that’s trying to use it as a tablet mainly. Of course, I doubt those users would be in the market for something with a 15.6-inch display anyway. On the positive side, the machine is relatively thin for a 15-inch notebook. From front cover to back cover, the Yoga 710 15-Inch notebook measures just 0.71-inches. Gotta Be Mobile’s review unit of the Yoga 710 15-Inch came loaded with a 7th Generation Intel Core i5 Mobile processor and Intel HD Graphics 620. It also had an NVIDIA GeForce 940 MX graphics card with 2GB of dedicated memory. There was 8GB of RAM and 256GB of solid state storage. Every one of the machines comes with 802.11AC wireless technology and Bluetooth 4.0. Everyone gets a 720P web camera, 2 full-size USB 3.0 ports, micro-HDMI, a media card reader and a headset jack too. Advertisement The media card reader, headset jack and power plug all sit on the left edge. The other ports are aligned on the right with the side-facing power button. The power button is there for easy access in Tablet Mode. Lenovo Yoga 710 15-Inch Review: Performance & Experience The Lenovo Yoga 710 15-Inch’s claim to fame are those new internals and fingerprint reader. I’m happy to say that both are valid reasons to buy this notebook. The fingerprint reader is managed by Windows 10. By scanning your finger, you’re able to login to the PC without typing your password or PIN code. The fingerprint reader in the Yoga 710 worked well. It recognized my fingerprint every time. What’s more, it supports using multiple fingers. For the best experience, I programmed it with my entire right hand. Apps in the Windows Store make use of the fingerprint reader for logins too. I was worried that I wouldn’t be able to rely on the fingerprint reader because I switch in and out of tablet mode regularly. Luckily, the fingerprint reader is in the perfect position for both form factors. It stays on in Tablet Mode despite the keyboard being disabled. Advertisement It’s also worth pointing out that Lenovo has ditched the usual touch-sensitive Windows button below the display in this device. Though tapping on the on-screen Windows button may take some adjusting to, the company is right to do so. I always managed to accidentally trigger the touch-sensitive button when handling older Yoga devices in portrait mode. Intel’s 7th Generation Core i5 processor allows the Lenovo Yoga 710 15-Inch to run mostly quietly and eek out 8-hours of battery life from its internal battery. I never once felt like the notebook was struggling with a task I gave it. Photo editing and splicing together a few short video clips went well. Web browsing and using Windows 10 felt effortless. When people see or hear NVIDIA GeForce, they think gaming. While the Lenovo Yoga 710 15-Inch wasn’t explicitly designed with gaming activity in mind, the latest games run on the system. Users just have to keep them tuned down to their minimum settings because there’s only 2GB of dedicated video RAM. Less demanding games like Minecraft and the casual stuff in the Windows Store run just fine. Expect lots of fan noise and heat. Don’t look for anything above 30 frames per second in high-end games either. Advertisement   Windows 2-in-1s designed to be notebooks first have to get heat management right. You don’t want to hear a fan when you’re snuggled up to your tablet trying to watch a movie. You certainly don’t want hot air from its processor spilling onto your hand as you hold it to read either. Neither are an issue for this notebook. Unless it’s really being pushed, the fan is silent and the notebook stays very cool. A tight hinge ensures that the Yoga 710 15-inch doesn’t fall prey to a problem that’s ruined a few other devices in its category. Only when you tap the screen pretty high up in Notebook Mode do you get a lot of screen wobble. You’ll struggle a little against the hinge the first time you turn it into a tablet, but it’s not too tight. Some of the design decisions that make it a look like an unassuming notebook also make it feel pretty awkward one you hold it in Tablet Mode. That curved edge below the screen is one of those things. With this design, such compromises are necessary. It’s  a notebook first and tablet second. The JBL speakers and spacious 15.6-inch display on this machine make it a video watching powerhouse. For devices that are meant to be used outside of a corporate environment, Lenovo usually goes with a glossy display that makes colors look vibrant and pop. It has done that here to great effect. The display’s brightness is going to take some people time to get used to, though. At 50% it’s sometimes not capable of withstanding the screen glare its glossy display cover creates. At minimum, you’re going to want to keep this machine at 75% brightness. Sadly, that’s going to eat into that promised and totally obtainable 8 hours of battery life. Lenovo Yoga 710 15-Inch Review: Specifications Processor & Graphics Intel 7th Generation Core i5-7200U Mobile Processor, Intel HD Graphics 620, NVIDIA GeForce 940MX with 2GB of dedicated RAM Memory & Storage 8GB of RAM, 256GB of Solid State Storage Display 15.6-inch 1920 x 1080p IPS Display Ports & Extras Bluetooth 4.0, 802.11 AC Wireless, Backlit Keyboard,2 JBL Speakers, 2 USB 3.0 Ports, 1 micro-HDMI port, 720p web camera, card reader, headset jack, fingerprint reader Battery Life 8 Hours Dimensions & Weight 14.13-inches x 9.57-inches x 0.71 inches, 4.41 pounds. Lenovo Yoga 710 15-Inch Review: Should You Buy? Lenovo revealed its first Yoga around the same time that Microsoft launched Windows 8. In that time, it’s slowly refreshed everything about them. The keyboards aren’t too shallow anymore. Power button placement has improved. More importantly, Intel has managed to create processors that get rid of unwanted fan noise and excessive heat. There’s nothing so wrong with the Lenovo Yoga 710 15-inch that you shouldn’t buy it. It’s taken some time, but the company is hitting a decent stride with this line of devices. The notebook does have a tad too much screen for shoppers that are going to use it in Tablet Mode often, but that speaks more about buyers than the device itself. The Lenovo Yoga 710 15-inch is a well-functioning, well designed Windows 10 notebook. 2 Responses 01/01/2017 Baris Reply I have an i7 with 16GB of RAM. With all current drivers and bios this laptop still has a fan noise problem. Even at moderate temperatures of 40-45C, the fan is noisy. This problem is compounded by the placement of dual array microphones which face directly against the fan exhaust at a distance of about 1cm, making any sort of video conferencing impossible. As of 2/1/2017 there is no solution. There is a thread on this issue on the Lenovo forums; https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Lenovo-Yoga-Series-Notebooks/Yoga-710-Constant-Fan-Noise-even-when-idle/td-p/3354501 02/01/2017 Mr R Reply Hey Baris, try this https://www.reddit.com/r/Lenovo/comments/5gph66/lenovo_yoga_710_fan_fix_using_notebook_fan_control/ Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

We look at how these massive companies have competed over the years, how they failed to foresee smartphones and tablets, and what they're doing about it. AMD is still the underdog, but there's life in both companies yet By Dave Stevenson | 01 Feb 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments Intel vs AMD: which is best? These are interesting times for CPU makers. Gone are the days where a few hours’ laptop battery life was considered efficient and where the only computers people had in their homes were noisy, hot desktop PCs. Now, the pre-built desktop PC is all but a dead man walking: in 2013 the market collapsed with desktop sales falling 9.8 percent globally. In emerging markets the story was even worse: a fall of 11.3 percent as users sought smaller, cheaper, less-power hungry devices. In 2014 there was a bit of a boost as businesses replaced PCs when support for Windows XP ended, but in 2015 shipments again fell. According to analysts, there will only be a "moderate decline" overall because more Windows tablets and hybrids - 2-in-1 laptop/tablets - were sold. Overall, the result has been upheaval for the silicone industry’s main players. Less than a decade ago, Intel and AMD had the world at their feet. Intel’s distinctive audio logo rang out wherever laptops were sold and AMD’s future was considerably bright thanks to its 2006 acquisition of graphics powerhouse ATI. These chip giants haven't quite kept up with the times, though. The tech landscape is fast changing and Intel and AMD's apparent slowness to switch focus to mobile computing has allowed other chip manufacturers – most notably ARM but also the likes of VIA and Qualcomm – to dominate this huge new market. Update February 2017: Both Intel and AMD are in the process of releasing their latest generation of CPUs. Intel is now on its seventh generation of Core processors - codenamed Kaby Lake - and AMD appears to have a stormer on its hands in the form of Ryzen. Intel's Kaby Lake range covers everything: desktops, laptops, tablets, 2-in-1s and servers. What we haven't yet seen is the ultra-high-end enthusiast chips (dubbed Kaby Lake X). For more details, see our Intel Kaby Lake news roundup. AMD, on the other hand, is going after the resurgent PC gaming market. Its brand new Ryzen chips are all overclockable and in very early benchmarks has matched or beaten Intel's 6th generation Core i7 chips. Given that the 7th-gen Kaby Lake doesn't really offer much of a performance improvement, there's excitement that gamers might well choose an AMD processor and motherboard for their next upgrade. Intel vs AMD: Why it matters If you’re buying a traditional laptop or PC, AMD and Intel are your only choices for processors, but don’t make the mistake of thinking the PC’s slump in popularity means either company is sliding towards irrelevance. Intel doesn't make all its money from PC and laptop processors, of course. It also produces graphics processors, wired and wireless network adaptors, server and workstation processors and components, plus set-top box parts. While you won't find an Intel processor in many smartphones or tablets, the firm does produce many SoCs for mobile devices. AMD is the smaller of the two companies by some margin. For one thing, while Intel builds its own chips in over a dozen fabrication (fab) plants in the USA, Ireland, Israel and China, AMD sold off its last fab in 2009. Today, just like ARM, VIA, MediaTek and others, AMD designs its own chips but outsources the manufacturing. Producing microprocessors is formidably expensive and AMD’s revenue pales in comparison to Intel’s: merely $1.3bn in Q3 2016 against Intel's $15.8bn. Intel vs AMD: History and breakthroughs Both companies have a history of innovation. When Intel produced the 8080 processor in 1974, it lay the groundwork for the x86 processors which provided the foundations for desktop PCs for nearly 30 years. It’s an astute marketeer, too: its mid-2000s Centrino platform, consisting of a low-power processor, a wireless chip and a mobile chipset, took the market by storm with its reputation for desktop-class computing power and long battery life. Its shift from the x86 brand to “Pentium” (copyrighting a series of numbers proved impossible) was a similar stroke of PR genius. The ability of Intel’s marketing department to outspend and out-think others continues. The success of Intel’s Ultrabook trademark might be perilously tied to Microsoft’s stumbling efforts with Windows 8, but the company’s understanding that consumers need short, snappy brands rather than clock frequencies and other jargon endures. AMD’s position as underdog is a consistent one. Marketing consultant Mercury Research reported AMD hit a record 22 percent share of the market in 2006; now the company hovers around the 17 percent mark, thanks in part to its dominance of the console market: both the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 have custom 8-core AMD 'Jaguar' processors at their hearts. Arguably, AMD’s largest recent innovation was its acquisition of Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) manufacturer ATI in 2006. The $5.6bn transaction (about £3bn) saw AMD join Intel in being able to deliver integrated graphics chips - that is, GPUs that live on the same chip as the CPU. The result is less graphical horsepower, but vastly reduced power draw and heat output. Forget fire-breathing, discrete graphics cards (last year's Radeon R9 280X drew around 250W at its peak and needed two cooling fans) – AMD understood that the future of silicone lay in reducing power consumption and size as much as in increasing computational power. These days, people don't need more power: they want better battery life from portable devices. AMD vs Intel: Challenges On the face of it, both AMD and Intel were well-placed to answer the needs of users as the sales of mobile devices exploded. The desktop PC market was in steady decline, laptop sales were on the rise, and the mobile phone was begging for reinvention. Intel already had an incredibly strong reputation with its laptop Centrino platform, and while AMD’s Turion competitor was a distant second, the race was on to win a market that knew mobility was the future of computing. Intel started strongly. Remember the netbook? Before the netbook, spending less than £500 on a laptop would net you something slow and bulky with limited battery life. The first netbooks – the likes of the Asus Eee PC 701, released in the UK in 2007 – cost under £200, weighed under a kilo and, while unlikely to be seen at many LAN gaming parties, offered enough processing power to run basic work applications and – critically – applications that ran in web browsers. The processor at its heart? An ultra-low voltage version of the humble Celeron. The netbook was a critical and commercial success, and Intel capitalised with its Atom processors. This was Intel silicone at its cheapest: bought in batches of a thousand the earliest Atom CPUs were reputed to cost manufacturers under $30, and for a few years the netbook ruled. Consumers wanted small, cheap computers and Intel, with its wealth of experience in mobile processors, was perfectly placed to answer the call. The problem arrived in tablet form.“We don't know how to make a $500 computer that's not a piece of junk,” said Steve Jobs in 2008. “Netbooks aren’t better than anything,” he added at the 2010 launch of the first generation iPad. Apple’s chief operating officer Tim Cook agreed, describing netbooks as “not a good consumer experience”, and thus the iPad came to be. The issue for Intel and AMD was not that they failed to anticipate consumer’s preference for mobile devices. The problem was the form factor: the iPad sold 300,000 units on the first day of its availability in 2010. In picking traditional form factor laptops and netbooks, with traditional desktop operating systems built around traditional x86 hardware, Intel and AMD had backed the wrong horse. In fact, Intel, Microsoft and HP had tried to make tablets a success years before the iPad, but the combination of Windows (an OS designed for the keyboard and mouse), short battery life and chunky, heavy hardware meant no-one wanted to use them. The problem for Intel and AMD wasn’t that the iPad – and following tablets from the likes of Sony, Samsung and others – didn’t need processors. It was that they needed a new type. And the kingdom of the SoC (system on a chip) – in which a computer’s entire functions are embedded on a single chip – was already ruled by British processor giant ARM. ARM’s processors are a completely different architecture than the traditional chips favoured by Intel and AMD. ARM’s Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) processors are physically simpler than x86 processors, which means they cost less and draw less power. As the iPad – and the stampede of tablets which followed – took off, it seemed AMD and Intel had missed a significant boat. Fast forward to 2015 and the netbook is dead, slain by high-quality tablets that perform well, offer long battery life, and cost much less than a standard laptop. Intel vs AMD: New form factors Even Microsoft, long-time ally of x86 hardware, piled on the misery for Intel and AMD. Windows RT, released in late 2012, was the first version of Windows that would run on ARM-powered devices, theoretically giving Microsoft access to low-cost tablets and – potentially – freezing Intel out even more. However, the Windows RT platform flopped: in 2013 Microsoft had to take a $900 million write-down on its unsold Windows RT devices, and the company’s chief financial officer Amy Hood understated things spectacularly when she said “we know we have to do better, particularly on mobile devices.” Fast forward to 2017, and Microsoft has again demoed Windows (this time Windows 10) running on an ARM processor. Intel isn’t hanging its hopes on Microsoft, of course. It is shifting focus to new technology, such as wearables. The Curie module, above, is a button-sized module for wearable devices. This uses the Quark SE SoC which can be powered by a coin battery. Plus, it is also dabbling in drones, having produced the Aero Compute Board and combining this with its RealSense cameras. For its relatively slow start in the world of tablet, wearable and ultra-portable computing, Intel still has plenty left in the tank. Intel vs AMD: Gaming Gaming is worth around £1.72bn to the British economy according to the Association for UK Interactive Entertainment – and here it's AMD which holds the more dominant position. Intel does produce 3D graphics chips, of course, but its expertise lies in integrated graphics. Integrated graphics are ideal for small laptops: an integrated graphics processor doesn’t add much to the price of a laptop, doesn’t draw too much power and – contrary to popular opinion – does offer enough 3D processing oomph for the odd game. For anyone looking to play the latest releases at detail settings that put the latest consoles to shame, though, discrete graphics cards have always been the answer, and it’s here that AMD has a significant edge. AMD’s current crop of graphics card run the gamut from low-profile, passively-cooled cards up to its latest Radeon RX 480 card, which costs around £200. Discrete graphics aren’t the only gaming arena AMD’s strong in, either. As well as having its chips in both the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, it also supplies the GPU in Nintendo’s Wii U. It might not have much to shout about in developing platforms such as tablets or hybrids, but gamers have plenty to thank it for. Intel vs AMD: Which should you buy? If you’re building a desktop PC, the choice between AMD and Intel is as real as ever. The choice is as complicated as ever, too: visit any well-known online retailer and you’ll be faced with a choice of hundreds CPUs. If you’re driven by budget, AMD has a strong command of the lower price-points, but if you opt for AMD it doesn’t mean you exclude yourself from high-end computing: the brand new Ryzen processors put up a tough challenge to Intel’s flagship Core i7 CPUs. However, it's still early days for Ryzen: the processors aren't on sale just yet and the only benchmark results have come from either AMD or the odd journalist which has managed to get hold of an early pre-production sample. Until AMD can prove it's worth the upheaval of a new motherboard, chipset and socket, Intel will remain dominant, though, and across mid-range and high-end processors there’s an enormous amount of choice. For powerful, everyday computing the Core i5 continues to serve well. True power users – those editing video, rendering 3D animations, or those who simply want to get to the top of the SETI@home leaderboard, can opt for Intel’s Core i7 chips. For gaming, though, you're better off with a mid-range CPU and spending what you've saved on a better graphics card: the vast majority of games still don't take full advantage of multi-core processors, especially those with more than four cores.

The Linux Foundation IPv6 has been around for a long time. The first IPv6 RFC was released more than 20 years ago, and we began exhausting the IPv4 address space in 2011. Thiago Macieira from the Intel Open Source Technology Center began his talk at LinuxCon Europe by saying that he didn’t think he would still need to be talking about this today, and he wished we had already solved this problem. But, many people have not yet made the switch to IPv6, so his talk contained a brief introduction to IPv6 and some of the differences compared to IPv4.  Macieira says that one of the reasons things haven’t completely fallen apart yet is because we’ve created some workarounds, but they are just workarounds, and we still need to plan our move to IPv6. The biggest difference is the address size, with IPv4 containing only 32 bits of address space compared to 128 bits for IPv6. To put this in perspective, IPv6 would give us many trillions of addresses for every square centimeter on the planet. Another difference is that multicasting goes from optional in IPv4 to mandatory in IPv6 allowing one-to-many communication commonly used for things like Multicast DNS, which is what, for example, Apple uses to discover other devices on your home network. Other differences include a higher minimum Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) and maximum packet size along with fragmentation at the origin (instead of at the router) and privacy extensions. StateLess Address Auto-Configuration (SLAAC) in IPv6 provides a way for devices to configure themselves, even over the Internet, and communicate with each other without requiring a DHCP server. This is accomplished securely, while still protecting privacy, by using temporary addresses or stable, but opaque addresses, Macieira explained. However, you still need to make sure that your firewall is correctly configured using ip6tables, not iptables keeping in mind that addressable from the world does not mean that your device is reachable from the world. Macieira points out that when using an API, there are two things to keep in mind. First, always use an IPv6 API. They are actually simpler to use and will still support IPv4, so if an API doesn't support IPv6 already, stop using it. Second, don't assume anything about the address. The talk concluded with a number of interesting things that you can do with IPv6. Watch the entire video of the talk to learn more about how and why to use IPv6.

Supermodel Miranda Kerr and Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton are in front of a Buick Encore, left and a Buick Cascada for a 2017 Super Bowl commercial from Buick. (Photo: Buick) Buick is teaming up with NFL quarterback Cam Newton and Australian supermodel Miranda Kerr in a lighthearted Super Bowl ad aimed at convincing customers that the brand's cars and crossovers are surprisingly good looking. The ad, titled “Pee Wee,” takes place during a Pee-Wee football game where two dads are watching their kids play. "If that's a Buick then my kid's Cam Newton," one of the dads says as a woman steps out of a Buick in the parking lot.

Kerr makes a similar entrance later in the ad. The 60-second ad was scheduled to debut tonight during a CBS special titled "Super Bowl's Greatest Commercials," and will air during the first quarter of Super Bowl LI. Buick spokesman Stuart Fowle said CBS approached Buick and asked if it could debut the Buick ad along with an ad from another company during Tuesday's special. Buick agreed, since it was already planning to release the commercial before the game. The commercial was created by Engage M1, an ad agency that is a partnership between Leo Burnett Detroit and DigitasLBi. This is the second consecutive year that Buick has decided to spend big bucks to advertise during the Super Bowl. It now costs, on average, about $5 million for a 30-second ad during the Super Bowl, according to widely published media reports. Advertisers spend that because of audiences that can top 114 million people and the special attention that is paid by viewers to the commercials. Automakers  often are among the biggest spenders. Manufacturers often say the commercials are worth the money,  especially for brands that are trying to redefine themselves. That's the case with Buick. GM's premium brand has been trying to win over new customers with a campaign commonly called "That's a Buick?" since March 2014.

Supermodel and actress Miranda Kerr was the first Australian to become a Victoria's Secret Angel. "The commercial is fun and filled with some unexpected surprises, and showcases how beautiful and cool the Buick Cascada and Encore are," Kerr said in a statement.

Here are some of the best you can get in Australia. There are plenty of options out there, but we have based our best-of list on the most impressive. Some contain future proof specs that make them market dominators, others are great all rounders or entry level machines, and some are just so stunning that you can't help but do a double take. We have something for just about everyone here. HP Spectre x360 Combining carbon fibre, a sexy piston hinge and gold detailing — this laptop is designed to look stunning. But it isn't just about the aesthetics. The rich screen display and tactile keyboard means that it will be future proof for awhile. It's also the lightest available laptop on the market, making it an incredibly competitive option. It also offers USB Type-C and a great charge speed, which is perfect for convenience and productivity at work at uni. It's going to help you stay connected. It's also considered to be a bit of a challenge to Apple. Not only does it encroach on the 'pretty' territory, it packs more power than the latest MacBook and is sold at a lower price point. Check it out here. Display: 13.3-inch, 1920x1080 or 1840 x 2160 backlit multi-touch CPU: Intel Core i5 – i7 RAM: 4GB – 16GB GPU: Intel HD 620 Storage: 128GB – 512GB Dimensions: 324.8mmx218.44x15.24mm, 1.82kg Dell XPS 13 Image: Supplied At 13.3 inches and 1.29kg, it is one of the most compact models out there, but doesn't compromise on decent specs. Its latest incarnation continues to impress with its updated Kaby Lake processor, quick SSD and decent GPU offering with Intel HD Graphics 620. Adding a stylish rose gold option, the high quality finishes continue to hardy and not easily scratched. The carbon fibre keyboard also offers a sweat free experience for long periods of use. Clearly not wanting to fix something that wasn't broken, the thoughtful tweaks made to the new XPS 13 continues to keep it at the top of its game. Check it out here. Display: 13.3-inch, 1920x1080 or 3200x1800 CPU: Intel Core i5 – i7 RAM: 4GB - 16GB GPU: Intel HD Graphics 620 Storage: 128GB – 512GB SSD Dimensions: 304x200x9-15mm, 1.29kg Asus ZenBook UX305 Image: Supplied If you're looking for an entry level machine at a decent price point, the Zenbook UX305 is a good choice. It isn't particularly innovative and its CPU is a relatively low-powered Core M one, but it's affordable and you'll do well with it if you don't opt for anything too hardcore. It also sports a respectable amount of flash storage and a sizable trackpad and keyboard. Its aluminum finish and attractive lid pattern are also impressive. Sure, there are cheaper models that you could opt for, but they won't be as capable. Check it out here. Display: 13.3-inch, 1920x1080 pixel or 3200x1800 pixel QHD+ CPU: Intel Core M3-6Y30 – M7-6Y75 RAM: 8GB GPU: Intel HD Graphics 515 Storage: 256GB – 512GB SSD Dimensions: 324x 226x12.3mm, 1.2kg Apple MacBook Pro 13 Inch Image: Apple Apple has some serious competition in the ultrabook market these days, but its most recent MacBook 13-inch offering proves that it is still near the top for a reason. It's thinner, lighter and more powerful than the previous generation, as well as providing that sleek finish that we have come to expect from the brand. Its Intel Core i5 processor enables it to handle some heavy duty processing, which is good news for anyone working with video. If you need something even more hardcore, you may want to look at the 15-inch. The coolest aspect of the latest Pro is the dynamic Touch Bar. Replacing the function keys the displayed icons change depending on what apps you're using. Just be aware that the entry level 13-inch model doesn't have this feature. The only real downsides to the 2016 Pro is that it's sorely lacking in ports, offering only 2 Thunderbolt 3 ports and a headphone jack. Although this means you can charge your devices quickly, it may prove inconvenient if you still still HDMI out or even SD support. Check it out here. Display:13.3-inch, 2560x1600 pixels CPU: Intel Core i5 RAM: 8GB GPU: Intel Iris Graphics 540 Storage: 256GB - 512GB SSD Dimensions: 304.1x212.4x14.9mm,1.37kg Microsoft Surface Book Image: Supplied Microsoft's revolutionary Surface Book wowed the world when it was launched. With its great battery life and high-end specs in the new Performance Base variant, this is one of the most powerful thin and light Windows 10 machines on the market. What makes this all the more impressive is that it's a 2-in-1, offering versatility to suit whatever situation you're in at the time. The only downside is that it's a little bulkier than most 13-inch machines due to its novel hinge design — but that may be worth it for you considering the specs. Check it out here. Display: 13.5-inch, 3000x2000 pixels CPU: Intel Core i5 – i7 RAM: 8GB – 16GB GPU: Intel HD 520 – Nvidia GeForce Storage: 128GB – 256GB PCIe3.0 SSD Dimensions: 312x232x13mm, 1.51kg Razer Blade Stealth Image: Supplied A brand usually geared at gamers, the Razer Blade Stealth is perfect for anyone looking for an ultra book that exerts raw power. Geared with a brand new seventh-generation Intel Kaby Lake processor, Intel HD Graphics 620, optional 4K resolution and up to 16GB of RAM — this is a rig for someone who means business. Perhaps literally. This is capable of so much more than simple Office Suite and Photoshop use — and all in a compact 1.29kg package. Even though the charger is rather large and inconvenient, the battery life does balance out this feature. Check it out here. Display: 12.5-inch 2560x1440 –- 4K 3840x2160 CPU: Intel Core i5 – i7 RAM: 8GB – 16GB GPU: Intel HD Graphics 620 Storage: 128GB – 1TB SSD Dimensions: 321x206x13.1mm, 1.29kg HP Spectre Image: Supplied This is the kind of 2-in-1 that makes you feel more stylish just by being in its presence. The tactile keyboard feels gorgeous to touch and pairs nicely with the rich screen display — an exercise in forward thinking that will most likely pay off for the brand. Rounding the entire rig off with its attractive piston hinge, incredibly thin and light design and solid specs, this is the perfect choice for someone who wants to get stuff done and look good while doing it. Check it out here. Display: 13.3-inch, 1920x1080 pixels CPU: Intel Core i5 - i7-6500U RAM: 8GB GPU: Intel HD 520 Storage: 256 - 512GB SSD Dimensions: 325x229x10.4mm, 1.11kg Lenovo Yoga 900S Image: Supplied Yet another challenger to the 12-inch MacBook, this 2-in-1 from Lenovo combines style with performance. The watchband hinge is a beautiful way to convert from laptop to tablet mode, proving that practicality can be pretty. Learning from its previous generations, the Yoga 900S offers more battery life, and more powerful precessor and improved graphics. It also one ups Apple on the port offerings, still opting to have full-sized USB 3.0. Check it out here. Display: 13.3-inch, 3200x1800 pixels CPU: Intel Core i7 RAM: 18GB - 16GB GPU: Intel HD 520 Storage: 256GB – 1TB Dimensions: 324x225x14.9mm, starting at 1.29kg Comments MotorMouth @motormouth Feb 3, 2017, 9:44am You have all but totally ignored one of the biggest factors in choosing a laptop - connectivity. Many of these machines are hampered by a lack of ports, or the wrong kinds of ports, while others have plenty and/or a good variety. One of the biggest factors in me choosing an XPS 13 was it's mix of USB 3 and USB Type C, which will allow me to transition from the older standard to the newer in my own time, without having to make a clean break or buy a handful of dongles. Reply 0 vlad @vlad Feb 3, 2017, 1:20pm Could someone make a review of XPS 13" All-in-One, please? With sound quality comparison. Reply 0 red_t_rex @red_t_rex Feb 3, 2017, 3:51pm My office uses a mix of the HP Spectre x360 and the Dell XPS 13 and 1 surface book. The Surface Book is nice, especially the resolution but very pricey. Also the need to disconnect the screen and turn it around is clunky but I understand why they did it in the design as can be seen from the keyboard marks on the screen in the Spectre X360 when you are using the touch screen. It also requires an adaptor for HDMI for presentations. I can say that overwhelmingly the choice among staff is the Spectre x360. We have had lots of usability issues with the Dell although to be fair a number of these stem from trying to use a dock to support Dual monitors and external keyboard while in the office. We have also had driver issues after updates. The Spectre also comes with full size HDMI port which is great for connecting to display for presentations or at home or while travelling. The other 2 require adaptors. The main downside of the Spectre for me is the resolution specifically for presentations but otherwise the battery life is good and the versatility is great and it is extremely light for travel (although most of the contenders above are similar in their low weight).

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 31, 2017 at 6:00PM In Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) most recent quarter, the company reported some interesting results for its Data Center Group (DCG) business, which supplies processors and other components for use in applications such as cloud and enterprise servers and networking appliances, among others. Intel's 10-core Ivy Bridge server processor. Image source: Intel. The company reported $4.67 billion in DCG revenue, up about 8.4% year over year -- but that wasn't the unusual part. Intel had told investors last quarter to expect "high-single-digit" revenue growth in DCG for the entirety of 2016, and that's exactly what the chipmaker delivered. Where things got a little bit murky was in the operating profit of the segment. Intel reported that DCG operating income came in at $1.88 billion, down from the $2.11 billion in operating profit that it threw off one quarter ago.  Now, Intel has been very straightforward about its expectation that its operating margins in DCG were going to come down on a year-over-year basis over the past several quarters because of a couple of factors: increased product costs as it moved its product line from older 22-nanometer manufacturing technology to newer 14-nanometer manufacturing technology, and increased investment levels. However, the strange thing is that its operating profits compared with a quarter ago were down from the prior quarter even though revenue was up. Further, the "known" margin headwinds already described would have been in effect in the third quarter of the year, as well as in the fourth quarter of the year. So, clearly, something unexpected took a serious toll on DCG's operating margins this quarter. To that end, Intel clarified on the earnings call that the unusually low operating margin for DCG in the fourth quarter was caused by two "one-time" factors. Let's take a closer look at them. A cross-license agreement and a quality issue The first factor that CFO Robert Swan described was that Intel "entered into a long-term cross license agreement and patent purchase agreement, particularly in the [communications] space in the quarter." He said DCG was "affected by a portion of that cost in the quarter." The second factor -- and one that Swan described as "a little more significant" -- was a so-called "product quality issue." Swan didn't go into too much detail, but he did say that it had to do with "slightly higher expected failure rates under certain use and time constraints." To deal with this, Swan said the company "established a reserve to deal with that" and was confident that the problem was "well bounded with a minor design fix." The good and the bad For those looking for the bright side, here it is: When the fourth quarter of 2017 rolls around, Intel will have a much easier baseline against which to compare. Since operating profit and margin were unusually low, Intel will be able to boast about significant operating margin expansion a year from now. Additionally, one of these factors is related to intellectual property and patent licensing, so it doesn't represent an execution problem on Intel's part, and one would hope that this agreement will save Intel from messy litigation down the road. Now, here's the not-so-bright side. Even though it appears the design flaw that caused the second factor to come into play is going to be taken care of quickly, it does represent an execution problem on Intel's part. No chips are designed perfectly, but given how experienced Intel is at building data center chips, it's surprising that it made such a mistake. Let's hope the company is more careful in the future.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

It's Now Possible To Disable & Strip Down Intel's ME Blob Many free software advocates have been concerned by Intel's binary-only Management Engine (ME) built into the motherboards on newer generations of Intel motherboards. The good news is there is now a working, third-party approach for disabling the ME and reducing the risk of its binary blobs. Valve Developer Posts New AMD GPU Debugging Tool, Part Of Improving Linux Driver Another Valve developer has begun contributing to the open-source AMD Linux graphics driver stack. Besides posting some RADV Vulkan patches last week, today he's announced a new GPU debugging tool he's been working on for AMD's driver/hardware. Firefox 51 Released With FLAC Audio Support, WebGL 2.0 By Default Firefox 51.0 just hit Mozilla's FTP servers for those wanting the latest version of this open-source web-browser. PulseAudio 10.0 Officially Released Well, that happened sooner than anticipated. WireGuard Secure Network Tunnel Is Eyeing Mainline, Running On Android Back in June we reported on WireGuard as a next-generation secure network tunnel for the Linux kernel. We haven't heard much on WireGuard in recent months, but this New Year's morning we received a message from their lead developer with a status update. A Look Back At Some Of The Best Features Added To The Linux Kernel In 2016 Going from the Linux 4.5 kernel merge window that was open in last January to the Linux 4.10 merge window that closed this past Christmas, here is a look back at the prominent features added to the kernel in 2016. VK9 - Direct3D-Over-Vulkan - Reaches New Milestones The VK9 project that's working to implement Direct3D 9 over Vulkan that's been under heavy development the past few months has reached new development milestones. Debian Stretch Enters Its Soft Freeze, Full Freeze In One Month The soft freeze is now upon us for Debian 9.0 "Stretch" while the full freeze will happen in February. AMD Kaveri vs. Intel Skylake With The Latest Linux/Mesa Open-Source Drivers I'm in the process of testing a lot of my different CPUs/APUs in preparation for some Kaby Lake Linux benchmarks next week with the Core i5 7600K and Core i7 7700K. Along the way with the different CPU benchmarks I've also been running some fresh integrated Linux graphics tests on the newer and interesting hardware. And the most-viewed featured articles: Intel Kabylake: Windows 10 vs. Linux OpenGL Performance For those curious about the current Kabylake graphics performance between Windows 10 and Linux, here are some OpenGL benchmark results under each operating system. Windows 10 Pro x64 was tested and the Linux distributions for comparison were Ubuntu 16.10, Clear Linux, Antergos, Fedora 25 Xfce, and openSUSE Tumbleweed. GCC 7.0 vs. 6.3 vs. 5.4 vs. 4.9 Compiler Benchmarks On Linux x86_64 With GCC7 feature development ending, this week I conducted some benchmarks of the latest GCC 7 snapshot against that of the past three major release series of the GNU Compiler Collection: 6.3.0, 5.4.0, and 4.9.4. All tests were done on Ubuntu Linux x86_64 with an Intel Core i7 6800K processor. Linux Memory Performance With Intel Kabylake From DDR4-1600 To DDR4-3333MHz For those that may be thinking about picking up an Intel Kabylake processor and trying to justify if DDR4-2400 memory is worthwhile for your budget, or even faster DDR4 memory via XMP profiles / overclocking, here are some tests using a Kabylake CPU and testing DDR4 memory at frequencies from 1600MHz up to 3333MHz. GCC 7.0 vs. LLVM Clang 4.0 Performance (January 2017) LLVM Clang 4.0 is set to be released in February while GCC 7 will be released as stable in March~April. For those curious how both compilers are currently performing, here is our latest installment of GCC vs. LLVM Clang benchmarking on Linux x86_64. Open-Source Nouveau Linux 4.10 + NvBoost vs. NVIDIA Proprietary Linux Driver Performance Earlier this week I posted some benchmarks showing the open-source NVIDIA (Nouveau) driver performance on Linux 4.10 with the new NvBoost capability for finally being able to hit the "boost" clock frequencies with Kepler graphics cards when using this reverse-engineered driver. While the manual re-clocking and enabling NvBoost is able to increase the Nouveau driver's performance, how do these results compare to using the closed-source NVIDIA Linux driver? These benchmarks answer that question. 26-Way Intel/AMD CPU System Comparison With Ubuntu 16.10 + Linux 4.10 Kernel In preparation for Intel Kaby Lake socketed CPU benchmark results soon on Phoronix, the past number of days I have been re-tested many of the systems in our benchmark server room for comparing to the performance of the new Kaby Lake hardware. For those wanting to see how existing Intel and AMD systems compare when using Ubuntu 16.10 x86_64 and the latest Linux 4.10 Git kernel, here are those benchmarks ahead of our Kaby Lake Linux CPU reviews. AMD & NVIDIA: Open vs. Closed-Source Driver Performance Continuing on from this weekend's open-source Nouveau vs. closed-source NVIDIA Linux driver performance are results now added in with showing AMD's open-source vs. closed-source driver performance with the same tests. Antergos vs. Fedora vs. Ubuntu vs. openSUSE vs. Debian 9 vs. Clear Linux For Early 2017 At the end of December I posted a number of Linux workstation/server distribution benchmarks while this article has the results from the more desktop-focused (non-graphics) Linux distribution benchmarks. Up for benchmarking off a Skylake NUC in this article was Antergos, Fedora 25, Ubuntu 16.10, openSUSE Tumbleweed, Debian 9 Testing, and Intel's Clear Linux. Fedora vs. Ubuntu vs. openSUSE vs. Clear Linux For Intel Steam Gaming Performance With this week Clear Linux now being able to run Steam, I was excited to see how this performance-minded Linux distribution out of Intel's Open-Source Technology Center would compare to other more popular Linux distributions when it comes to Intel Linux gaming performance. Here are some benchmarks of this traditionally workstation/server-oriented Intel Linux distribution running some Steam Linux games. Radeon Ubuntu Linux Users Have A Lot To Gain By Upgrading Mesa For those curious about the performance difference if upgrading to third-party PPAs from Ubuntu 16.10 when using a modern AMD Radeon graphics card with the open-source driver stack, here are some fresh numbers.

That’s according to a summary of the Thursday meeting provided to employees. The Oregonian/OregonLive obtained a copy. Intel initially said it would cut 12,000 jobs in last year’s restructuring, but subsequent financial filings put the total at 15,000. The cutbacks, known internally as “Accelerating Change and Transformation,” were effective, Krzanich told employees. He said they met the company’s goals for moving Intel away from its dependence on the PC market and toward fast-growing opportunities in data centers, the Internet of Things and memory chips. Asked to give the restructuring a letter grade, though, Krzanich said it was a “C.” The meeting summary didn’t specify why Krzanich was displeased. He told employees he takes responsibility for “the fact that we had to do it.” Last year, Krzanich said he felt the cutbacks had been too “harsh and quick.” After job cuts during both 2015 and 2016, Intel employees complained the criteria for determining layoff eligibility had changed without notice. Krzanich said last summer that the company planned to revamp its exacting annual review process, called Focal. On Thursday, Krzanich told employees that the Focal overhaul is off the table — at least for now. Instead, he said, Intel will focus on unspecified management problems first, then reconsider whether to make any changes in Focal. The chipmaker plans a new “Managing at Intel” program for all 13,000 of the company’s managers, according to Krzanich. He didn’t say what the program will involve, but said details are coming soon. Intel is getting a new human resources chief as company vice president Richard Taylor retires. His successor is Leslie Culbertson, a longtime Hillsboro executive who had been Intel’s director of finance. The chipmaker is Oregon’s largest private employer, with 19,500 people working in Hillsboro before last year’s job cuts began. On Thursday, Krzanich acknowledged a lasting hangover from last year’s restructuring but hailed Intel’s strong fourth-quarter financial results as an indication the company is moving forward. “We’re still recovering as an organization, but I think we’re making pretty good progress,” he said.

(KOIN) PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) — Companies like Nike and Intel have denounced some of President Donald Trump’s executive orders, but other local business owners are banking on new policies coming out of the White House to give them a boost. On Monday, Trump signed an executive order aimed at significantly cutting regulations for small businesses. White House officials called the directive a “one in, 2 out plan” that requires government agencies requesting a new regulation to identify 2 regulations they will cut from their own departments. The order resonated with Portland’s David Thompson, the CEO and founder of TEC Equipment, the largest multi-point truck and trailer dealership in the western U.S. “I make no bones about it, I’m a moderate when it comes to my political views,” Thompson said. “I believe I’m socially responsible, I try to provide great jobs.” TEC Equipment CEO David Thompson hopes Trump’s executive order on business regulations will help him provide more jobs, January 31, 2017. (KOIN) Thompson tells KOIN 6 News he supports Trump’s promise to reduce regulation, saying it can only help create and streamline common sense business practices. “We are beat up on regulations,” he said. “With 1,200 employees, it gives us an opportunity to grow the company even bigger and, of course, with more jobs comes a wider tax base.” He says he’s “dismayed” by how many regulations it currently takes to run a business. While Thompson backs the president’s business-related moves, other Oregon CEOs have denounced Trump’s travel ban on 7 countries with ongoing terrorist activity. In a rare political email to employees, Nike CEO Mark Parker announced that his company “stands together against bigotry and any form of discrimination.” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich told his employees, “this is not a policy we can support.” “At Intel we believe that immigration is an important part of our diversity and inclusion efforts. Inclusion is about making everyone feel welcome and a part of our community,” Krzanich wrote. “There are employees at Intel that are directly affected by this order.” Columbia Sportswear CEO Tim Boyle said his company “does not judge people based on their religious beliefs.” He told employees, had his family been barred from entering the U.S., Columbia Sportswear would not exist. “This message, like our company, has roots that reach back to 1938. That’s when Columbia Sportswear Company was founded — the year after my family fled Nazi Germany and my mother and grandparents settled safely in Portland,” Boyle wrote. “We are here because the United States was open and tolerant enough to let us in.” Thompson says he believes everyone is entitled to their opinion. He says his goal is simply to provide well-paying jobs and benefits to as many people as he can. He hopes Trump will help him achieve that. “The rate of travel we’ve seen on regulations and movement out of Washington is unprecedented,” Thompson said. “We’re still learning what this president is really going to be about when it’s all done.” Trump has promised to repeal 75% of federal regulations on businesses, which is something Thompson says he would like to see happen.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Apple is working on custom ARM-based Mac chips for future laptop models Yoni Heisler BGR NewsFebruary 1, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share After nearly falling into bankruptcy in the late 90s, Apple under the masterful command of Steve Jobs began to take a keen interest in owning as much of the underlying technology in its products as possible. In turn, rumors of Apple designing its own chips for the Mac — something it already does for the iPhone — have persisted for quite some time, especially as Apple’s prowess in the chip-design space has progressed. Don't Miss: The Galaxy S8, iPhone 8, and Google Pixel 2 will all share one key component In a new Bloomberg report which signals that Apple is aggressively trying to lessen its reliance upon Intel, Mark Gurman and Ian King relay that engineers at Apple are hard at work designing a new ARM-based chip for upcoming laptop models that will reportedly live alongside Intel processors. The chip itself is said to be a variant of the T1 SoC Apple first introduced on the recently released TouchBar MacBook Pro. While the T1’s duties aren’t exactly all-encompassing — it handles TouchBar and Touch ID related functions — Apple new chip is being designed to carry more of the system load for certain tasks. Apple engineers are planning to offload the Mac’s low-power mode, a feature marketed as “Power Nap,” to the next-generation ARM-based chip. This function allows Mac laptops to retrieve e-mails, install software updates, and synchronize calendar appointments with the display shut and not in use. The feature currently uses little battery life while run on the Intel chip, but the move to ARM would conserve even more power, according to one of the people. Apple of course is always looking for ways to increase power efficiency, especially given that the company still remains intent on rolling out increasingly svelte devices, a design choice which inherently limits the battery capacity of its notebooks. Looking ahead, there is no indication that Intel chips will be leaving the Mac anytime soon. Still, it’s a safe bet that abandoning Intel at some point in the future is a scenario being tossed around among Apple executives, especially given the frustration Apple has experienced with Intel with respect to various processor delays.

The Super Bowl is appointment viewing each year for football fans, pitting the final two teams standing against each other to determine that season's NFL champion. But for non-football fans, the Super Bowl is also a must-watch experience, if for nothing else than the ads throughout the game. How do you know that everyone will be watching? Just look at what advertisers are willing to pay to get their 30-second spot in front of a Super Bowl audience: Buying a 30-second spot will cost over $5 million on average, according to Variety. While some advertisers wait to make their big reveal during the game and others come up with a unique plan on how to make every penny spent count (more on that in a minute), others make their ads available to watch before kickoff. Below is more on what you can expect to see on Super Bowl Sunday, as well as the best and worst Super Bowl commercials of all-time. Commercials for Super Bowl LI Snickers This isn't the actual Snickers ad, but there's a very good reason for that: the company will be shooting their commercial, which features "Star Wars" star Adam Driver, live. Here's their teaser for the spot: Advertising Age reports that it's the first time a commercial will be shown live during the Super Bowl since 1981, when Schiltz ran a live taste test during Super Bowl XV. Intel The tech company enlisted Patriots quarterback Tom Brady for their commercial: Intel also managed a little bit of luck, as they debuted their commercial well before Brady and his team earned their spot in the big game. Buffalo Wild Wings B-Dubs is teaming up with Packers great Brett Favre on a series of spots leading up to their commercial during Super Bowl LI. Here's the first: You can follow the man himself on Twitter to keep up with the campaign. Squarespace The website builder/domain hosting company follows John Malkovich's quest to sign up for a URL: Squarespace's Super Bowl spots have previously featured Jeff Bridges, Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele. Lexus The car manufacturer is going with a dance-themed ad to promote the 2018 LC 500 performance coupe. Here's an extended version of the spot: If the performer looks familiar, it's because Lil' Buck is also in the Apple AirPods commercial that debuted this January. Skittles The candy company may wind up with the biggest buzz of all Super Bowl commercials by the time the game is over. Here's a look: It's already appeared on YouTube's list of trending videos and had amassed more than 500,000 by Wednesday afternoon after going live the previous day. GoDaddy After years of being known for their risque ads, the Internet service provider has gone lighter in recent years. They appear to be continuing in that vein with this year's spot. Here are several teasers for their Super Bowl ad: The actual Super Bowl ad will turn "The Internet" into a person. Don't anticipate a famous celebrity playing the role, per Advertising Age. TurboTax The tax preparation company dropped their first teaser during Sunday's AFC Championship Game, featuring none other than Humpty Dumpty: Two additional teasers are scheduled leading up to the company's 45-second Super Bowl spot, per Advertising Age. Wix.com The website builder's ad answers a very important question: What happens when Wonder Woman meets The Transporter? The ad above debuted on YouTube Live and Facebook Live amassed more than 2 million views on YouTube in the eight days since its release. Kia The auto company will be advertising its 2017 Kia Niro during the game, but they dropped a 15-second teaser this week: Melissa McCarthy, star of the long-running CBS sitcom "Mike & Molly," features in the spot. Mr. Clean The official cleaner of Super Bowl LI, Mr. Clean released their official Super Bowl commercial on YouTube: It's Procter & Gamble's first Super Bowl ad ever for the iconic character, USA Today reports. Avocados from Mexico The avocado awareness organization features Jon Lovitz in their hypnotic teaser for this year's offering: The organization earned plenty of buzz for its first Super Bowl ad in 2015 featuring the "First Draft Ever." Mercedes-Benz The car company debuted a 1-minute version of their Coen Brothers-directed Super Bowl ad on YouTube on Friday: Peter Fonda stars in the ad for the Mercedes-AMG GT Roadster. Top five Super Bowl ads ever 5. Volkswagen (2011) Of all the more recent ad spots, this one sticks out: Can you get any more adorable than a mini-Darth Vader trying to use The Force? 4. Budweiser (1989) The first Bud Bowl was held during Super Bowl XXIII: The spot would have seven sequels throughout the '90s in arguably the most memorable long-running ad campaign in Super Bowl history. 3. Apple (1984) While not as sports-centric as most of the top ads on this list, there's no denying the debut of the Apple Macintosh its spot: The Super Bowl spot was the only time Apple ran this ad, which is arguably among the top commercials of all time. 2. McDonald's (1993) The fast-food company landed a pair of iconic NBA stars to battle over their burgers and fries: I'd watch these two go at it in a head-to-head shooting contest today. Get on it, McDonald's. 1. Coca-Cola (1980) Could it be anything else? Often imitated but never duplicated, Mean Joe Greene's Coke commercial launched 37 years of must-see Super Bowl commercial viewing. Worst Super Bowl ad ever Fortune.com has a great list of terrible Super Bowl ads worth checking out. While many didn't work due to insensitive takes on race, death and other topics and deserve consideration, one was proud to declare itself the worst commercial ever. Despite having no reason to offend, Lifeminders.com is just that: Unsurprisingly, the website didn't stick around for the long haul.

Buick Hey look, it's Cam Newton playing Pee Wee football! Miranda Kerr also shows up to coach the NFL star in the spot for the auto company. Wonderful Pistachios The pistachio company will run two 15-second ads during the Super Bowl, including a new spot called "Treadmill": The ad will run during the first quarter, per Advertising Age. Wendy's The fast-food restaurant drew attention recently for roasting critics on social media, and the spat that started it all gets a callback for their Super Bowl spot: Lesson: Be sure you know your facts before you engage in Twitter trollery. Nintendo The video game company is debuting its first ever Super Bowl commercial to promote their new gaming system: Longtime fans of the company should love all the details crammed into the spot. Sprint Going morbid hasn't worked out well for companies (which we'll get into in our Worst Ad Ever section), but that didn't stop Sprint from scheduling this spot for the Super Bowl: The cell carrier plans to release an alternate version after the game, per Advertising Age. Ford Rather than promote a specific vehicle, the auto company will try and intrigue with its vision of the future: In related news, Ford announced its "FordHub NYC" experience. LIFEWTR PepsiCo's new bottled water breaks out the star power for "Inspiration Drops": Two-time Oscar winner Robert Stromberg directs the spot with music from John Legend. King's Hawaiian This will be the first-even Super Bowl ad for the Hawaiian food company: Look for it in the fourth quarter. Audi The auto maker jumps into the political fray with their spot about equal pay: "Daughter" is slated to air during the third quarter. FIJI Water The Wonderful Company is reportedly using an existing ad for the water brand's first-ever Super Bowl spot: It'll be the second spot of the day for the company, known for its pistachios. Budweiser In the commercial sure to stir up the most debate at your Super Bowl party, the beer giant is tapping into the recent immigration debate with "Born the Hard Way": Filmed in New Orleans, the spot is sure to spur a visceral reaction for many. Febreze The odor-buster attempts to capture the thing everyone at your Super Bowl party is thinking with "Halftime Bathroom Break": Turning away from the TV at halftime, of course, means missing a chance to see Lady Gaga's performance. KFC One Colonel Sanders isn't enough for the fast-food company in this Super Bowl spot: That's Rob Riggle, who has previously starred in KFC's ads, and Billy Zane. T-Mobile The cell company calls upon Rob Gronkowski, Terrell Owens and a bespectacled Justin Bieber for this year's Super Bowl spot: Send T-Mobile your touchdown dances and they could be retweeted by Bieber himself, which is something. Tiffany & Co. The jewelry company is tapping Super Bowl LI halftime performer Lady Gaga for their spot. Here's a preview: You can read more about Gaga's plans for halftime here.

Intel DRM Driver Prepping For HDMI 2.0 With Geminilake Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 1 February 2017 at 08:55 AM EST. 1 Comment Intel's forthcoming Geminilake hardware has a native HDMI 2.0 controller and as such the open-source Intel Linux driver developers are working on proper HDMI 2.0 support within their kernel driver. Geminilake is the successor to Apollo Lake for low-power Atom/Celeron/Pentium SoCs. Geminilake hardware should be shipping later this year. Details are still limited on Geminilake SoCs, but now at least we know (thankfully) there will be native HDMI 2.0 support. Six patches posted today are for enabling HDMI 2.0 scrambling in the DRM layer. Scrambling though, fortunately, isn't DRM related as it may sound. Shashank Sharma of Intel explained, "HDMI 2.0 spec defines a method to reduce the RF footprint while operating at higher pixel clocks, which is called Scrambling. Scrambling can be controlled over a new set of I2C registers which are accessible over existing DDC I2C lines, called SCDC register set." The 500+ lines of new code add the HDMI 2.0 scrambling support along with allowing HDMI 2.0 clock rates (up to 594Mhz) for Geminilake. These patches are presumably too late for Linux 4.11 but should be material for Linux 4.12. HDMI 2.0 increases the TMDS throughput, supports 4K video @ 60Hz, support for up to 32 audio channels, support for more audio streams, greater 3D support, and other new functionality. 1 Comment Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Component / CPU / AMD’s Ryzen confirmed for early March launch AMD’s Ryzen confirmed for early March launch Jon Martindale 2 days ago CPU, Highlights V AMD has confirmed that it will be launching its new-generation CPUs, called Ryzen, in early March this year, giving us our first real concrete launch date for the technology. We were previously told to expect the new chips in the first quarter of this year, but now we know for sure it’s just a few weeks away. The AMD Zen architecture is a hotly anticipated hardware launch that many have high-hopes for. Although many remain cautious considering AMD’s history of over-hyping launches and under-performing with high-end processors, Ryzen CPUs seem very impressive from pre-release benchmarks and reveals. They have the potential to compete directly with Intel’s high-end CPUs, which if true, would be the first time AMD has done as such in more then a decade. That’s why knowing when they are set to launch is so exciting and why AMD CEO Lisa Su’s comments have people talking (via SeekingAlpha): “I think we have Ryzen launching in early March and then we’ll have Vega, our enthusiast GPU launching in the second quarter,” she said during an earnings call yesterday, 31st January. “We should see Ryzen doing very well in the high-end,” Su said, “as well as Vega and by nature, since both of those high-end markets are markets that we don’t have significant presence today, there will be an opportunity to both gain share as well as increase attach rates in those markets.” Ever since the much more competitive days of the AMD 64 and Pentium 4 chips, AMD has struggled to offer significant competition to Intel’s top-of-the-line processors. It always offered good value for money, but for gamers and enthusiasts Intel has been the dominant force for a long time. Real competition between the two biggest desktop chip makers has the potential to drive down prices and encourage significant innovation. Discuss on our Facebook page, HERE. KitGuru Says: Are you guys as cautiously optimistic about Ryzen as we are? If for no other reason, we hope it sparks a new rivalry in the desktop space that sees some significant performance gains. Intel’s last few generations have barely raised the bar in comparison to generations past.

Mesa 13.0.4 Released While Waiting For Mesa 17.0 Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 1 February 2017 at 06:33 AM EST. 2 Comments Mesa 13.0.4 was released today by Collabora's Emil Velikov while the Mesa 17.0 debut is still on track for later this month. Mesa 13.0.4 mostly has fixes to the Intel i965 and AMD RadeonSI drivers. There is also some ANV Vulkan driver fixes / minor updates and a glxgears fix for Freedreno. Some of the specific work includes the RADV/ANV Vulkan drivers supporting v3 loader interface, some Assembly code updates to support x32, and a slew of other ANV/RADV fixes. The listing of Mesa 13.0.4 fixes can be found via this Mesa-announce post. Mesa 17.0 is set to be released likely within the next week or two, once the release candidates finish ironing out the bugs. Emil Velikov has been using this tracker bug for listing blocker bugs, but has mostly been used by for tracking Intel issues. Mesa 17.0 is shaping up to be a fantastic release albeit we are already attracted to the bleeding-edge work found in Mesa 17.1-devel. 2 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Hot Stocks | Tue Jan 31, 2017 | 5:01pm EST UPDATE 1-AMD posts smaller loss, gives strong forecast on graphic chips demand (Adds shares, details, background) Jan 31 Advanced Micro Devices Inc on Tuesday posted a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss and gave a strong revenue forecast for the current quarter, boosted by demand for its graphic chips used in gaming consoles and a stabilizing PC market. The company's next hotly awaited release is the new Ryzen processors for PCs, aimed at gamers and others who need a high-performance processor as well as dislodging Intel Corp's near monopoly. AMD has said in October that it expects to release the processor in the first half of this year. Deutsche Bank had said in a note on Monday that sales in the quarter could be hit as customers hold off till the new processor is launched. But not only did the Sunnyvale, California-based chipmaker give a strong forecast, it also posted a healthy revenue increase for the fourth quarter. AMD's shares, which have surge more than 370 percent in the last twelve months, were up 4.5 percent at $10.84 after the bell on Tuesday. AMD said it expects first-quarter revenue to increase 18 percent at the midpoint of its forecast range. Analysts on average were expecting revenue to rise 15.7 percent, gaining for the fourth quarter in a row, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. AMD's revenue increased a better-than-expected 15.4 percent to $1.11 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31, beating analysts' estimates for the sixth quarter in a row. Net loss narrowed to $51 million, or 6 cents per share, from $102 million, or 13 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, AMD lost 1 cent per share. Analysts on average were expecting a loss of 2 cents and revenue of $1.07 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. AMD said sales rose 3.7 percent at its unit that makes processors for servers and gaming consoles. The unit makes chips used in Microsoft Corp's Xboxs and Sony Corp's PlayStations. The company's sales in its unit that makes processors such as the Polaris chips used in PCs jumped nearly 28 percent. Last week, Intel reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit, driven in part by a stabilizing PC market. AMD faces stiff competition from NVIDIA Corp in the gaming market and from Intel in the PC market.

PRAGUE (Sputnik) – Stropnicky said that it is very difficult to detect those responsible for the cyberattacks. "I had a short conversation with him [Foreign Minister Lubomir Zaoralek] about that. According to my information, it is very difficult to reveal that. Maybe the minister [Zaoralek] knows more but experts say it would be very difficult to reveal that quickly," Stropnicky said. He also warned against cause panic by reports about Russian cyberattacks. © Sputnik/ Natalia Seliverstova Czech Claims of Russian Trail in Cyberattacks Tied to Intel Services BillAt the same time, Stropnicky said he was sure that the information campaign would target the Czech Republic during the election campaign. Earlier in the day, media reported, citing an intelligence source, that a group of unknown hackers had cracked the emails of the Czech foreign minister and his deputies and had stolen thousands of user accounts, as well as classified data. Zaoralek suggested that a foreign state could be behind the cyberattacks and compared them with those that hit the US Democratic Party. A source in the Russian Foreign Ministry told Sputnik that the allegations that Russia was behind the cyberattacks on the Czech Foreign Ministry were tied to discussion of the draft bill extending the authority of the Czech intelligence services to control the Internet. ...

In our Czech republic the government wants to give more cyberpower (place black boxes to internet providers ...) to several bodies and there is(was) some opposition to that. And it just so happen that right at the same time the Foreign Minister comes with "we were hacked right now - we need more power" Funny that the same scenario goes on in our neighbor Poland, where they also are creating new cybersecurity body and they also have been "hacked right now". They also use the same phrases that the "attack reminds them the attack on the democratic party in US so it was probably you know who".

But things have changed enough in the Windows 10 era to tempt fate again. By Ross Rubin | February 1, 2017 -- 18:57 GMT (10:57 PST) | Topic: Microsoft Windows 10 will run on Snapdragon processors. Debuting in October 2012 as a version of Windows 8 for ARM processors, Windows RT powered some pioneering devices such as the first Lenovo Yoga and the first Surface tablet. These and other Windows RT devices had significant cost and battery life advantages over Windows 8 devices. Moreover, RT represented enough of a threat to Intel that the x86 giant finally made its chip architecture a viable tablet option. But its bundled version of Office sat atop a tacked-on crippled desktop that couldn't run other Windows desktop apps. That led Dell and HP to avoid supporting it, and ultimately, its doom. Windows RT had no upgrade path to Windows 10. More Windows 10 Microsoft's latest Windows 10 Creators Update test build has lots of fixes for PC users Microsoft gives Windows device makers their 2017 marching orders Windows 10 tip: Repair your Windows 10 installation ​Microsoft Edge for Windows 10 Creators Update: New tab controls, more VR, payments, and e-books FAQ: How to install, reinstall, upgrade and activate Windows 10 Microsoft: Windows 10 will stop a ransomware epidemic when antivirus fails In hindsight, though, Windows RT was just a misstep in Microsoft's long quest to move Windows beyond x86 processors. Having got Windows at large back on course with Windows 10, Microsoft announced in December that it would develop an ARM Windows architecture explicitly for Qualcomm Snapdragon processors. It's unusual for Microsoft to work with one vendor in an open architecture, but Qualcomm represents an ideal in terms of a neutral provider with strong market presence that wants its chips in the most powerful third-party mobile devices. While NVIDIA, for example, was behind the first two Surface tablets, the company has largely turned its attention away from the tablet market following the demise of RT. Philosophically, Microsoft seemed better positioned to make Windows-on-Snapdragon a better product than RT was. As became clear over the course of Windows 10's development, the company has re-embraced and advanced the desktop after neglecting it in Windows 8. Understanding customer demand to run whatever Windows apps they want, it promises that a new emulation capability will provide satisfactory performance for x86-native apps. But an interesting wrinkle recently surfaced in the news that the company may be working on a "Windows 10 Cloud" that would drop support for legacy apps. This appears to address an opportunity I noted back in 2014, when I wrote that Microsoft "might have had an opportunity to position against Chrome OS with Windows RT." If this operating system were meant to take on Chrome OS, it would make a great deal of sense to support it on ARM processors, but then Windows 10 Cloud on a Snapdragon processor would seem very close architecturally to Windows RT. Why would Microsoft repeat history's mistake? The reason is that things have changed enough to minimize Windows RT's interface inconsistency and app paucity. For example, there are far more "universal" Windows 10 apps available now than there were for Windows 8/RT. Most important among these (at least for Microsoft) is Office, the main reason for Windows RT's fractured interface. Windows 10 Cloud would likely still provide a desktop that'd be useful for traditional laptop scenarios, but Windows 10 switches between default and "tablet mode" in a much more sensible way than Windows 8/RT did. In addition, as I wrote regarding Microsoft's Chromebook response, the company is loath to embrace a web-only approach when it wants developers to keep supporting native apps. (That said, a first-rate web browser is important to educators and other customers that might want to lock down local apps. Microsoft didn't have a great story to tell there in the late days of Internet Explorer. It does now with Edge.) In this, Google has actually come closer to Microsoft's thinking without exactly moving the ball to Microsoft's court. It has shifted the Chromebook proposition from web purity to local app platform by promising Google Play and its Android app trove in all future Chromebooks. Rumors swirl that a converged Chrome OS-Android could vastly improve the integration. Indeed, Windows 10 Cloud would join Android-supporting Chromebooks as an interface work-in-progress. While Windows 10 has done more to reconcile desktop and touch environments, it is still not as optimized a slate experience as the iPad or even Android tablets heavy on scaled-up phone apps. Windows 10 still dips into a Windows 7-like lack of concern for touch optimization, particularly when one is tweaking system settings and other nerdy matters off limits on an iPad. It will likely take Microsoft some time to completely shift Windows 10 to where all features are available in both environments. In the interim, though, they can at least restrict apps that don't take them both into account. In many ways, a Windows 10 Cloud-on-Snapdragon would break with Windows RT. But as with Windows RT, Microsoft is promising a bevy of tantalizing devices (a Surface 4 sounds like a lock) that break ground in connectivity and mobility. It's simply asking customers to sacrifice less to adopt them.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Gaming Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 PC System Requirements Revealed On Steam By Francesco De Meo Jan 30, 2017 26Shares Share Tweet Submit Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, the latest entry in the series developed by Capcom, is still today one of the most popular fighting games ever released, thanks to its unique and somewhat crazy gameplay experience. Back in December, the game has been released on PlayStation 4, and soon enough it will reach PC and Xbox One. While not much has been said about the Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 PC version, the system requirements have been revealed by the game’s Steam page. As expected out of a game originally developed for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, a powerful machine won’t be required to run it. Advertisement MINIMUM: OS: Windows® 7 SP1 / Windows® 8.1 Processor: Intel® Core™ 2 Duo 2.4 GHz, or better Memory: 2 GB RAM Graphics: NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX260, or better DirectX: Version 9.0c Network: Broadband Internet connection Storage: 16 GB available space Sound Card: DirectSound compatible (must support DirectX 9.0c or higher) Additional Notes: Genuine Xbox 360 PC compatible controller recommended. RECOMMENDED: OS: Windows® 7 SP1 / Windows® 8.1 Processor: Intel® Core™ 2 Quad 2.7 GHz, or better Memory: 4 GB RAM Graphics: NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 560, or better DirectX: Version 9.0c Network: Broadband Internet connection Storage: 16 GB available space Sound Card: DirectSound compatible (must support DirectX 9.0c or higher) Additional Notes: Genuine Xbox 360 PC compatible controller recommended. A new entry in the series, called Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite, is currently in development for PC and consoles. Not much has been said about the game following its announcement back in December, but it should feature a sick roster with an obscure Capcom villain. Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 launches on PC and Xbox One next month. We will let you know precisely when the game will release as soon as more comes in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.

Here are the 12 greatest Super Bowl commercials. Sports https://www.earnthenecklace.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Greatest-Super-Bowl-Commercials-of-All-Time-300x300.jpg 12 Greatest Super Bowl Commercials of All Time By : Ashmeet Bagga - February 1, 2017 Photo: Tim Warner / Stringer / Getty Images When it comes to the Super Bowl, rival teams are not the only ones working around the clock to make sure the night is memorable. Whether or not you are a football fan, there is a good chance you tune in to check out the commercials. Here are some of the top Super Bowl commercials. Even if you are not a fan of the sport, you will likely tune in on February 5 to catch the best Super Bowl commercials of 2017. Advertisers pay a lot of money to get their 30-second clip aired during the Super Bowl, and the results rarely disappoint. Reports suggest that companies pay an average of almost $5.0 million for their 30 second clip to be played in front of the Super Bowl audience. Though most companies decide to wait until the big night to reveal their Super Bowl commercials, there have been some who air their ad a day or two early. Below are some of the best Super Bowl commercials. 12 Greatest Super Bowl Commercials Mr. Clean Commercial This commercial will definitely entice men to clean the house. The latest Mr. Clean Super Bowl commercial features our favorite animated spokesperson flexing and wowing the lady of the house with his cleaning skills. Her reaction is enough to get any man wanting to pick up a mop and bucket! Wix.Com This commercial is more than just the handsome Jason Statham and the gorgeous Gal Gadot in an action packed scene; it is also extremely well done. Wix is a web site development company and is back for their second round of Super Bowl commercials. They launched their Super Bowl ad campaign through Facebook Live on January 17, and this commercial was directed by Louis Leterrier (who also directed The Transporter and its sequel). Avocados from Mexico Featuring John Lovitz If you, or someone you know, is not the biggest avocado fan, maybe John Lovitz’s hypnosis will change your mind? Reliving Marilyn Monroe’s Moment with Snickers One of Marilyn Monroe’s most iconic moments is when she poses on top of a subway grate in New York City. This classic Snickers commercial relived that moment with the brilliant Williem Dafoe, as part of its latest advertising campaign. Intel with Tom Brady Intel was the first brand to release their teaser for their 2017 Super Bowl commercial campaign. The ad features Tom Brady showcasing Intel’s 360 replay as he gets ready to start his day. Pepsi’s 1996 “Your Cheatin’ Heart” Video Nobody can ever forget this timeless commercial. It shows the security tapes of a Coke employee refilling the Coca-Cola fridge. When he wants a break, however, he goes for the Pepsi fridge beside him —until a sea of cans come spilling out! Everybody Loves Skittles The candy company announced that this year’s Super Bowl commercial will feature Adam Driver and will also be the first live Super Bowl commercial. Budweiser’s Frogs This clever ad first aired in 1995 and is still counted as one of their best commercials. We all know a chilled beer and the Super Bowl is the best combination, and apparently, we are not the only species to think so! McDonald’s Commercial This McDonald’s commercial was from the 2011 Super Bowl, and still reigns as one of the best. Puppymonkeybaby with Mountain Dew Kick start your game by watching this commercial. This Mountain Dew ad features a Puppymonkeybaby and a catchy beat. This commercial was a major hit last year and we hope that Puppymonkeybaby makes a comeback this year. Victoria’s Secret Although this commercial was targeted to a different demographic, it was played during the 2015 Super Bowl, and we wonder what Victoria’s Secret will come up with this year. Mercedes-Benz Fable Advertisement In 2015, Mercedes-Benz released an advertisement featuring their take on Aesop’s fable, “The tortoise and the Hare.” Mercedes-Benz is making a comeback with Super Bowl commercials for their Easy Driver, and are reportedly going to “pay homage to a series of legends: true to the original of the cult film from 1969, no-one else except its main actor and Mercedes-Benz fan Peter Fonda and the song ‘Born to be wild’ by the band Steppenwolf were eligible.” Oh, and their commercial will be directed by Oscar-winning duo Joel and Ethan Coen.         Presented by Revcontent Latest Articles Big Sean’s New Album 2017: “I Decided” Is Officially Available Online for Download!

(AMD) Stock Won’t Stop at $12 AMD stock is surging on Q4 earnings, but expect gains to extend to the $13 level amid greater GPU adoption and rising margins By Richard Saintvilus, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Feb 1, 2017, 12:35 pm EST     Popular Posts: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Won’t Stop at $12 The Snapchat IPO: The Next Facebook Inc (FB) … Or Twitter Inc (TWTR)? Here’s Why General Electric Company (GE) Stock Will Definitely Gain 20%-Plus Recent Posts: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Won’t Stop at $12 Here’s Why General Electric Company (GE) Stock Will Definitely Gain 20%-Plus Why Under Armour Inc (UAA) Stock Is Under Siege View All Posts Once left for dead, semiconductor giant Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), has come back over the past two years, proving the doubters wrong. With gains of 400% over the past year, AMD stock has punished those who bet against it. But is it now time to take profits? Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr Nope. AMD stock had a slow start to 2017, off about 6% before Tuesday night’s fourth-quarter earnings report, is back in the black thanks to a Wednesday surge after showing off some of the operational dominance it sported in a rip-roaring 2016. Expectation for the Quarter For the quarter that ended December, Wall Street expected the company to report a loss of 2 cents per share on revenues of $1.07 billion. AMD beat on both fronts, recording revenues of $1.11 billion and a loss of just 1 cent per share. Recent results from Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) hinted that Advanced Micro might be in for a Street-beating quarter. On Friday John Vinh, analyst at Pacific Crest noted that Intel’s results, which reflected less-bad personal computer trends, suggests strong growth for the sector. Notably, Vinh cited AMD as benefiting from “strength in gaming and high-end PCs.” To that end, the analysts also said the improvements in high-end PCs could reduce concerns about high-end GPU inventory at desktop graphics card manufacturers. Well, a beat is what we got, and that came on the power of AMD’s graphics chips, which saw revenues grow 15% year-over-year. The Key to AMD: GPUs GPU, or Graphics Processing Unit, is a big business for AMD. Those chips render images, animations and video for display on computer’s screens. And the strength of that business has been a key component of AMD’s turnaround. In the third quarter, reported in October, AMD posted a 23% year-over-year jump in revenue of $1.3 billion. The company benefited from strong growth in its popular Radeon line GPUs as revenue from that segment rose 11% year over year. This quarter, GPUs helped once more. Revenues in Computing and Graphics grew 28% year-over-year, thanks in part to higher average GPU selling prices. The company recently announced that its FirePro server GPUs have been selected by Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to power its cloud platform in 2017. All told, AMD’s GPU strength has begun to gain traction in different verticals, which should help it narrow the market share gap with leader Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Bottom Line for AMD Stock AMD’s report was full of other positives, such as an expansion of gross margins from 30% to 32%, and slight gains in its Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom business (4%). Still, graphics and high performance are the name of the game. AMD stock surged 14% higher on Wednesday’s reaction to fourth-quarter results, putting shares at highs last seen in 2017. The stock has returned more than 400% in 12 months — better than the 20% one-year gain in the S&P 500. And even still, AMD is showing that there’s little let-up in the growth ramp. I expect AMD stock to reach $13 in 2017, delivering 22% gains on the back of greater GPU adoption and rising margins. As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) gave authorisation for the flight took just two minutes to complete from take-off to parcel drop, with the drone taking the parcel, weighing 250 grams, from the shoreline to a boat at sea almost 200 metres away. The parcel contained medical supplies: an emergency thermal blanket, an Epi-pen, bandages, plasters, thermometer, first aid leaflet, gloves, wipes and burn dressings. It also contained food and a drink in the form of a high-energy bar and water. The supplies were attached to the underside of the drone in a waterproof container. The flight was organised by Belle Moore (10 years old), a student of Alexandra College Junior School, Milltown, as part of her research for her project on drones for the Intel Mini Scientist Competition. As well as roping in Pony Express and the IAA, Belle had assistance from FlyRyte Drone Academy who train commercial drone pilots in Ireland. Gearóid Ó Briain, Head of Training at FlyRyte helped Belle by controlling the delivery drone. Although Pony Express are not planning on offering a drone parcel delivery service in Dublin or Ireland any time soon, they are keen to be at the leading edge of all new developments in their section. “We were delighted to be involved in Ireland’s first drone parcel delivery and we’re proud that we, as an Irish company, are trialling the technology.” said Audrey Browne, Operations Manager of Pony Express. Audrey thinks that the delivery of low value, urgent items such as takeaway food, especially to remote rural areas is highly likely. However important city deliveries such as the majority of our same-day express services could not be trusted to drones yet, the possibility of interception, loss or damage would be too great. When parcel delivery by drone can be proven to work safely in an urban context, then we will revaluate the situation, but for now Ponly Express will continue offering parcel delivery by o traditional methods of bicycles, motorbike, vans and trucks james 19 hours ago Reply well done that 10-year old. the amount of drone-related news i’ve seen, touting it’s validity for delivering nothing larger than a 10-pack of cigarettes, or the usefulness of receiving a fire-stick in less than 15 minsr, then this young girl comes along with this idea for taking emergency supplies to ships off shore. bravo. hope she received top marks for this project.

We round up all of the rumours about a new MacBook Air in 2017, including its likely UK release date and tech specs, as well as rumoured new features. Here's everything you need to know about the new MacBook Air in 2017 by Ashleigh Macro | 01 Feb 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents UK release date Will the MacBook Air be discontinued? When was the MacBook Air last updated? Price Dimensions  Specs & new features When will Apple release a new MacBook Air in 2017? What tech specs and new features will the new MacBook Air get? Is the 'Air' brand being killed off? Will the new MacBook Air get a Retina display at last? Apple did technically update the MacBook Air in 2016, but it was a minor and frankly disappointing update - merely including what had been an optional RAM upgrade in the standard package for the 13in model, and not touching the 11in model at all. Will 2017 see a proper update to the MacBook Air lineup? Or will the MacBook Air be killed off for good? In this article we round up all the rumours, hints and clues about the new MacBook Air release for 2017, including the new MacBook Air's UK release date, tech specs, new features, design, along with speculation that Apple may be phasing out the 'Air' lineup completely.

But instead, Apple used the event to show off the iPhone SE and the iPad Pro with 9.7in screen. We had to wait until 19 April for Apple to release new MacBooks and the updated MacBook Air. But the MacBook Air update was underwhelming, to say the least. While the MacBook got a power boost and a new Rose Gold colour option, the MacBook Air simply got a new 8GB onboard memory standard, and that was for the 13in model only. So when will we get a proper update to the MacBook Air line-up? If the lineup isn't getting the chop, we assume that Apple will stick to its yearly upgrade cycle and should release the new MacBook Air at some point in early 2017, possibly between March and May as has been the case in previous years. But it does seem likely that the MacBook Air line is being quietly wound down.

After the March event and its derisory MacBook Air update, and the subsequent Apple event that took place on 27 October 2016, it's unclear if the MacBook Air line will ever be updated again. No new MacBook Air was announced in October and the new MacBook Pro 2016 was compared in size, performance and weight to the MacBook Air. The new MacBook Pro is smaller in dimensions, and is also thinner than the existing MacBook Air, which was launched with portability in mind. It should also be noted that the 11in MacBook Air has now been discontinued, with the 13in variant receiving a £100 price bump - taking the basic model from £849 up to £949 and the 256GB model up from £999 to £1,099. (This price increase is most likely due to Brexit.) Some have taken this as gentle way of bringing the Air product line to a close, as not many people will want a costly Air with more powerful, and thinner, Mac laptops available. Following the October 2016 Mac event, there are strong suggestions that the MacBook Air line will be completely discontinued. This does mean that the entry-level MacBooks are now a little more appealing, but does mean that an 11in MacBook Air will now be missed by some who were hoping for it to be replaced by a similar variant - we presume Apple didn't see a huge market for 11in laptops and thus decided to axe the product line. However, the 11in model may not be the only MacBook Air to be discontinued. We suspect that Apple is about to discontinue the MacBook Air line altogether. Tech Blogger Jack March claims to have spoken with a source close to the situation who says that Apple is about to ditch the Air brand completely, including the MacBook Air and iPad Air products in its lineup. Right now, we think Jack could be absolutely right. There are rumours that Apple won't release an iPad Air 3 now that the iPad Pro has a 9.7in option, and the MacBook Air doesn't seem to fit naturally in Apple's line-up now that the new MacBook is here and is thinner and lighter than ever. With the advent of the 12in MacBook and the 12.9in iPad Pro, it's no surprise that rumourmongers are starting to predict that at least the 11in MacBook Air, with a smaller screen than either of those devices, will be discontinued. The iPad Pro may indeed be viewed by Apple as a replacement for the 11in MacBook Air if Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments to the Telegraph are taken into account (published on 1 December 2015). Following the launch of the iPad Pro, Cook told the Telegraph: "I think if you're looking at a PC, why would you buy a PC any more? No really, why would you buy one? "Yes, the iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many, many people. They will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else, other than their phones." However, should Apple discontinue the 11in MacBook Air, it does remove the lower price of entry from the line-up. But as mentioned, it may not just be the 11in MacBook Air that is discontinued. When the new MacBook launched on 9 March 2015, analysts began to suggest that the MacBook Air might not be around for much longer. "This wasn't the MacBook Air, but instead leaped past the Air," said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. "They kept the MacBook Air around just as they do with older iPhones, but the MacBook is now in the same position as the newest iPhone. That makes me wonder if the Air will go away over time." Carolina Milanesi, chief of research and head of US business for Kantar WorldPanel Comtech, also predicted a contraction of Apple's line-up. "All [notebooks] need to be more mobile, so something like the Air doesn't need to be branched out any more," she said of the differentiation Apple made for the line since its introduction more than eight years ago. "And it's to Apple's benefit not to have so many 'families' of Macs." More recently, KGI Securities analyst and Apple guru Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that Apple is planning on launching a 13in MacBook to sit alongside the 12in MacBook, which would serve as a replacement to the MacBook Air going forward. In a note obtained by AppleInsider, the analyst forsees an end to the meaningful development of the MacBook Air. Apple won't remove the line from its stores just yet, though - it'll serve as an entry-level device for Apple adopters, much like it did with the original MacBook before it was discontinued in 2011. Over time, it seems likely that the MacBook Air range could be discontinued and eventually replaced by a Retina MacBook range at a lower price. In January 2017, DigiTimes cited Chinese site Economic Daily News and said Apple is going to drop the price of the non-Touch Bar 13in MacBook Pro and discontinue the MacBook Air, which only exists now in the 13in size. It added: "Apple is expected to unveil a new 12-inch MacBook in early second quarter with an additional memory option of 16GB" - this would all but render the Air unnecessary to Apple, even if consumers might lament the absence of its lower price point. We don't expect the 12in MacBook to drop in price. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: When was the MacBook Air last updated? We originally expected the MacBook Air to be updated with a Retina display back on 9 March 2015 at Apple's Spring Forward event. And were quite surprised when we got something else: a Retina MacBook, yes, but one with a 12in display and a USB-C port (and very few other ports), a new strand of products for Apple's MacBook laptop line-up. Less glamorously, Apple's MacBook Air did get an update at the same time, with new, faster processors, faster flash storage and better graphics, and was updated more recently in April 2016 with increased RAM, but the screen and overall design remained the same, with no Retina display for the Air line. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Price The last time that there was a Mac laptop that had more advanced specs than a more expensive model was the old MacBooks (aluminium, then white and black, and then eventually aluminium again). These older MacBook models were eventually discontinued and the price of the MacBook Air was reduced to make it the new entry level (when the MacBook Air initially launched it was quite overpriced for the specs, just like the current Retina MacBook). It seems likely that the same will happen with the new MacBook models eventually replacing the MacBook Airs, at a lower price, but for now that seems a long way off. The 11in MacBook Air started at £749, while the entry level 13in model was £849 - this has now changed with the 11in axed - making the new 13in model, with a £100 price hike start at £949. If the 11in MacBook Air is removed from the line up perhaps the cost of entry of the 13in model will reduce to the level that the 11in model is currently, with a rumoured 15in model coming in at a higher price at some point in the future. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Dimensions  If Apple does update the MacBook Air range, what dimensions should we expect? As mentioned above, rumours suggest that the 11in MacBook Air will be discontinued, after all, the 11in MacBook Air is both smaller than the MacBook and the new iPad Pro, and didn’t receive an update when the 13in model did. However, 9to5Mac points out that the new 13in and 15in MacBook Air models could be additional sizes to the MacBook range. That site predicts that some time in 2017 we will have just two ranges of Mac laptops: the MacBook at the ultraportable level, and the more advanced MacBook Pro. Maybe the 17in MacBook Pro will make a comeback too, with a 4K display. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Specs & new features These new MacBook Air models are said to be thinner and lighter, with internal spec enhancements. Apparently, the new MacBook Air will feature new batteries, cooling modules, and chassis, according to the Economic Daily News. We also expect to see USB Type-C across the range, especially now that Intel has integrated Thunderbolt 3 into USB-C - more on that below. Processors The next-generation MacBook Air is likely to feature next-generation Intel processors, as well as graphics and RAM upgrades. Intel has started shipping its Kaby Lake processors - that's the generation of chips after Skylake, and offers support for Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2. But here's a leftfield alternative. The Dutch-language site Techtastic has posted a reference in the kernel of macOS Sierra to "ARM HURRICANE", a chip family that is now supported. This isn't a chip that anyone has heard of, but it would make sense for this to be an Apple custom ARM chip, fitting in as it does with the company's previous naming conventions: the A7 (in the iPhone 5s) was codenamed Cyclone, the A8 Typhoon and the A9 Twister. Those are iPad/iPhone chips, of course, so does this mean Apple is going to let iDevices run macOS Sierra? Certainly not - but it might be about to put ARM chips in the MacBook Air. Image courtesy of Techtastic New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: E-ink keyboard Rumours are rife concerning Apple's 2016 MacBook Pro and, more specifically, its OLED touch bar. The OLED touch bar is rumoured to provide contextual shortcuts to the user based on the application that they're using at the time - but the most recent report suggests Apple isn't happy enough with the feature. 9to5Mac and TrustedReviews report that Apple has been in talks to use a laptop variant of Sonder Design's dynamic keyboard technology. Sonder Design is famous for developing an E-ink keyboard, using E-ink to change the key labels on the fly. This means that the entire keyboard is customisable, providing multiple languages as well as contextual shortcuts from a single keyboard. It allows users that are, for example, editing in Final Cut Pro to look down at the keyboard and see exactly which tool they need to use without having to memorise them before hand. What isn't clear is how Apple is planning on implementing the software, or which laptop it could be featured on, leading us to believe that it could possibly make an appearance on the 2017 MacBook Air. Sonder has confirmed that talks between Apple and the company has taken place, although it won't comment on whether or not it's a deal - it has only confirmed that it's "closing B2B procurement contracts" with three laptop makers. New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Retina display When Apple updated its MacBook Air in March of 2015, we had been convinced that the company was about to give the laptop a Retina display. Instead, it launched a brand-new MacBook line that's super-thin, super-light and does offer that high-resolution display, but does that mean Apple won't enhance the MacBook Air with a Retina display in the future? With the 2016 update only adding more RAM to the basic 13in model, it may be the case. The suggestion that the MacBook Air will feature a Retina display has been long running but those rumours were prior to the launch of the 12in Retina MacBook and the iPad Pro - suggesting the sightings of the Retina display some thought was destined for the MacBook Air was instead for these models. Does this mean that there will be no Retina display on the new MacBook Air when (or if) it launches? If Apple wants to keep the price down maybe not. Or perhaps the newly rumoured 15in Macbook Air will feature a Retina display, while the 13in model will lack the high-res display, but come in at a lower price, one similar to the older 11in MacBook Air. Read more: What is a Retina display? New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: MacBook Air to feature USB-C port While we assumed the next MacBook Air would feature USB-C ports, a recent report from Taiwanese website DigiTimes seems to confirm our theory - if believed, anyway. The publication claims that Apple is planning to release a MacBook Air with USB-C ports in future, but doesn't provide a launch timeframe for the upgraded laptop.  "Currently, Apple has decided to adopt the USB Type-C interface for its MacBook Air, while Asustek Computer and Hewlett-Packard (HP) are upgrading one of their notebooks' regular USB port to the Type-C. Lenovo, Acer and Dell are still evaluating the option." The issue with DigiTimes is that it isn't always accurate - the site has previously claimed that Apple would start shipping ultra-thin 13in and 15in MacBooks by the end of Q2 2016, which ended in June with no appearance, although the site's sources have proven reliable at times in the past. So, how accurate is this report? We're not 100 percent sure, but we imagine that if Apple wants to keep the MacBook Air alive, this is the road it'll be headed down.  However, Bloomberg reported in August 2016, one week before the reported iPhone 7 launch, that Apple is preparing a MacBook Air update "as soon as October". This might mean that the MacBooks are announced at the 7 September event, but won't ship until the following month. This seems a logical step; the MacBook has just one USB-C port and the rumoured new MacBook Pro will also feature this connection type. It would still represent a bold move overall for Apple however - it'd mean all of its laptops would no longer support standard USB-A connections, a move sure to annoy a few people, but ultimately shape the future of mobile computing.  New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Apple Pencil-enabled Trackpad While this isn't a new patent (it was originally filed back in 2014), a patent application has recently been granted that allows the Apple Pencil to work with Mac trackpads. What is most interesting about the patent is that it depicts a more sophisticated Apple Pencil than the one currently available, suggesting that the accessory is due to get an overhaul at some point in the future. It even goes as far to describe the Pencil being used as a general input device like a joystick or an 'air mouse'. "Inertial sensor input may be gathered when operating the stylus in one or more inertial sensor input modes such as an air mouse mode, a rotational controller mode, a joystick mode, and/or other inertial sensor input modes." What isn't clear is if the upgraded Apple Pencil will only work with certain trackpads - if this is the case, we imagine that the technology would make its way to the next-gen MacBook Air. However, Apple has a habit of applying for a patent and then doing nothing with it, so it isn't set in stone that we'll be seeing this featured on the next MacBook Air - but we can sure hope.  New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Touch ID and Force Touch We expect this feature to come on the Air model - if it isn't already discontinued!  There are also reports to suggest that it'll boast Touch ID within its Trackpad, which may also get the Force Touch upgrade that was given to the 13in MacBook Pro back in March 2015, and comes with the new MacBook. Touch ID is the fingerprint sensor that's built into the Home button of the iPhone 5S, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. It's also used to make Apple Pay more secure and with the recent announcement of Apple Pay coming to Mac as part of macOS Sierra, this rumour makes a lot of sense. According to an Independent report, Touch ID for the Mac line would require a dedicated chip to be built into the device. The rumour started with Taiwanese blog AppleCorner, which cited sources in the supply chain. Apparently the Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad may get a biometric update too, enabling users to make Apple Pay payments on the web, but both those accessories were updated alongside the launch of a new 4K iMac so that seems unlikely to happen any time soon.  We'll be updating this article as more information about the rumoured Retina MacBook Air emerges so check back from time to time for the latest news.

The same source also mentions prices for the upcoming processors which are allegedly on the high side. AMD Ryzen Processors To Have 8 Core and 4 Core Variants – No 6 Core SKU In The Works, Rumors Allege It looks like AMD is finally going to launch Ryzen in a few months with a full fledged AM4 lineup. We know that the AMD Ryzen family is internally known as Summit Ridge. Details of the processors were first leaked several months ago which pointed to three variants. The high-end variants were labeled as AMD Zen SR7, the mid-tier variants were labeled as Zen SR5 while the entry-level variants were labeled as Zen SR3. The naming scheme points the performance and pricing of each tier. The Zen SR7 variants will feature 8 cores and 16 threads. The Zen SR3 variants will feature 4 cores and 8 threads. Zen SR5 was previously rumored to feature 6 cores and 12 threads but that is not the case as the new rumor alleges. Advertisement According to Zolkorn, the Zen SR5 chips will feature 8 cores and 8 threads. These chips will not have SMT enabled which means that while the performance will be affected over the SR7 variants, these would still be faster than the SR3 model with twice the amount of Zen cores. Actual branding of these processors are not known yet but Zen “SR” is an older, internally used codename. Actual chips based on Zen will be branded as Ryzen and will come with an unlocked multiplier across all cores. Ashes Of The Singularity Benchmark of AMD Ryzen Sample With 4.0 GHz Turbo Leaks Out WCCFtech AMD Naples AMD Summit Ridge Zen Cores 32 8 Threads 64 16 L1 Instruction Cache 32 KB x 32 32 KB x 8 L1 Data Cache 64 KB x 32 64 KB x 8 L2 Cache 512 KB x 32 512 KB x 8 L3 Cache 64 MB 16 MB Base Clock 1.4Ghz 3.2Ghz Turbo Clock 2.8Ghz 3.5Ghz Market Enterprise Desktop AMD Ryzen Enthusiast Flagship Processors May Cost Up To $720 US The second part to this story is also a rumor coming from Zolkorn which alleges that the top SKU in the Ryzen family may cost between $580 to $720 US. Judging the performance of the Ryzen sample which AMD tested against the Core i7-6900K, this may in fact be the case. The top-end SKU which is clocked beyond 3.6 GHz at the base clock and boosts beyond that was demonstrated at multiple events against the Intel based chip. Not only was Ryzen on par with the other 8 core, 16 threaded processor but in some cases, it surpassed the Intel chip in direct benchmarks. The point to ponder is that Intel’s chip costs up to $1100 US and AMD knows that they have a chip and platform just as capable as their competitor. Plus the fact that the Ryzen chip is rated at 95W while Intel’s chip is rated at 140W. Based on the performance and power metrics, AMD may price the chip around the rumored range which is still less than the 6900K. We should also account for the price difference of the AM4 platform versus the X99 platform which should be a lot. So users going for AMD will be getting the same amount of performance for a much lower price. The remaining 8 core and 4 core variants would definitely cost less than the enthusiast models.

This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe Angela Bonnici, 33, works in public relations and is happy to be single. “I haven’t met the right person and have also been very focused on my education and career,” she explained. In the U.S., 45 percent of those who are over 18 years old are currently single, according to the Census Bureau. Whether they are divorced or have never married, that figure represents 102 million Americans. “People are holding off getting married and having families as they pursue their careers,” said Rebekah Barsch, vice president of planning and sales at Northwestern Mutual. “We’re seeing more adult households that are single, while the divorce rate remains relatively steady.” These singles have different priorities and concerns than married couples do, according to Northwestern Mutual’s 2016 Planning and Progress Study, a report that explores Americans’ attitudes toward finances and planning. The report found that singles of both genders worry about money more than married people do, but single men and women have different outlooks. Financial Anxiety Is Common The Planning and Progress study found that 55 percent of single women and 49 percent of single men were unhappy with their financial situations. In fact, single people were almost twice as likely as married people to not feel financially secure. What’s more, around 45 percent of single men and 50 percent of single women felt moderate to a lot of anxiety about their personal financial security. This isn’t a surprise to Bonnici, who says that her finances are “the first thing I think about when I wake up and the last thing I think about before I go to sleep.” “Single people feel more anxiety about their financial situation because they are going it alone,” said Barsch. “They’re sole breadwinners and so feel a lot of responsibility for supporting themselves, paying their bills and supporting their families.” While single men and women share financial concerns, the study showed that they valued financial security for different reasons. Single men were much more likely to choose “freedom to pursue my dreams” as the top benefit of being financially secure, and that rings true for Dan Nainan, 35, a comedian and corporate speaker. He is a great example of someone who prioritizes having a career he loves and pursuing his dreams. A former engineer at Intel, he left because he was passionate about comedy. He was able to do so, however, only because he had a degree of financial security from his previous job. “It took me two years of doing comedy to make my first five dollars,” he said. “I was very fortunate that I had savings and proceeds from stock options at Intel when I was first starting out.” On the other hand, single women were more likely to choose “relief from financial obligations” as the biggest benefit of being financially secure. Sixty percent of them say that their number one goal was not to have to worry about day-to-day bills. “Women tend to be bigger worriers,” Barsch said. “So, it makes sense that women’s main priority is not having to worry about making enough to cover their expenses.” Proper Planning Helps Both Men and Women While men and women might have different reasons for wanting financial security, Barsch says that the research has found that the solution to their worries is the same. “For single men and women especially, I would suggest that they find a financial advisor so that they’ve got somebody in their corner who can help them to plan for their future,” she said. “This is important for everyone but particularly for single people who don’t have someone else’s income to help support them.” Unfortunately, two-thirds of singles don’t have a financial advisor, and half of singles have never spoken to anyone about their retirement. Nainan, who has an unpredictable income stream, worries that the phone could stop ringing tomorrow. That’s one of the things that motivated him to seek out a financial advisor, and he’s a good example of how having a plan can help control financial worries. “There’s a direct correlation between the amount of anxiety someone feels about their finances and whether or not they actually have a plan that they’re following through on,” said Barsch. “You get peace of mind by knowing where you’re headed and knowing how you’re going to get there.” Get more insights like this at Northwestern Mutual Insights & Ideas.

Skylake is Intel's sixth-generation Core processor, built on a 14nm process, and succeeds the Broadwell micro-architecture. Intel says it will be branded as Xeon processor E3 v5 for single-socket server and workstation systems. The Skylake CPU will deliver performance and power-efficiency improvements over Broadwell micro-architecture. Supermicro will start seeding its customers with early Skylake-based X11 series product this quarter with a full launch in its September quarter. Production ramping, using the Purley platform, will begin in March, with some shipments in the June quarter. Stifel analyst and MD Aaron Rakers says he thinks there will be "50+ motherboard designs available at launch and significantly more than its competitors". Skylake CPUs have a more than 80 per cent increase in (LGA 3647) socket pins compared to previous LGA 2011 sockets. The LGA 2011 socket uses dual latches to fasten the CPU. These go away with the heavier and physically larger LGA 3647 assembly, which has the CPU affixed to a heatsink, the CPU-heatsink unit plugged into the sockets using guide pins, and then fastened in place with screws. Also "the new Skylake platforms will expand power consumption (up to 205W) and increasing PCIe lanes from 40 to 48 – this results in new motherboard layouts." Rakers says the complexity of all this has caused some Supermicro customers, who previously took Supermicro components and built their own systems, to now take full systems from Supermicro. Because Skylake CPUs are physically larger than existing server CPUs then multi-socket servers will likely increase in physical size over current products. ® Tips and corrections 7 Comments More from The Register Fancy a wee quasi-DRAM?

PUBLIC SPEAKING Refuse to Lose Your Next Presentation With These Super Bowl Inspired Speaking Warm Ups Learn pre-game rituals from Super Bowl champions and warm up like a pro.

Watching Sunday Fun-day is a crash course in marketing tips from the multi-million dollar ads to the genius strategies of the businesses behind them. The same tactics used to win football games can even help you win at business. But when do all executives need to win the day? Presentations. Public speakers need to bring their A-game to a presentation--just like the players at the Super Bowl. It's do or die, down to the wire when you walk out on the field or the stage. Super Bowl players have preparation techniques for optimal performance. Speakers can adapt those best practices for equally high stakes performances: speaking engagements. Most live events have the capacity to teach the savvy speaker-in-training, and the Super Bowl is no exception. Strap on your uniform and grab your mic--it's game day. But first... let's warm up. Here are three warm-up tips inspired by Super Bowls past and present: 1. Channel Pregame Jitters Football players tend to feel a little pressure when they get ready to walk on the field during a Super Bowl. Super Bowl 50 was, at one time, the most-watched television program in the history of television (it has since been eclipsed by the Game 7 championship in the most recent NBA Finals). You know what the pros do with their nerves before a big game? They turn that anxiety into excitement. As a speaker, you can do the same. Instead of fighting the physiology of your body and its fight-or-flight response, use the similarity between flight and fight to fight--just like the pros do. Sports psychologist Charlie Maher believes football players experience anxiety all season long, and that keeping their usual routine helps players stay focused mentally and emotionally before a big game like the Super Bowl. Think like a winning athlete before by channeling nervous energy into usable energy. Tell yourself "I'm pumped up! I can't wait to share my message!" Leave any limiting self-beliefs on the side lines by creating a pre-presentation mantra that you're excited to get on stage. The difference between bringing your speaking A game and looking like a nervous wreck may be as simple as your own inner dialogue. 2. Physically Warm Up Being psychologically prepared is one thing, but a speaker's instrument is her voice and body, just as a football player's instrument is his body. The Atlanta Falcons, who are about to play in their first Super Bowl since 1998, incorporate the psychological with the physical by getting excited and warmed-up with their pregame routine. A thorough warm-up ensures you enter your presentation space loose and relaxed--nervous energy lives in your muscles. Warm-ups are just as useful for your body as your voice to let all of that tension out, saving you from freezing up on stage. Find a private place before you present to stretch, shake and jump up and down. Any physical activity that gets your blood flowing and your muscles moving will help you feel energized yet grounded when you speak. Add in a few tongue twisters, facial stretches and yawns to warm up your mouth and you'll soon be speaking like a seasoned actor. 3. Review Your Playbook and Strategize Just as football teams review the plays they need to win, you need to go over the items that will make you succeed. Coaches eyeball the field before any play commences. They help the team become acquainted with the space and where they will be executing each movement. Speakers should do the same, guaranteeing their speech isn't the first time they've assessed their environment. Get there early and take a lap around the area. Where should you stand to best engage your audience? Is your technology set up and working properly? Coach Don Shula who led the Miami Dolphins to two Super Bowl wins had this to say about his pregame speeches to his teams: "What you try to do is do the things that got you to where you are... you don't want to be someone that you're not. The thing I tried to do is summarize what it took to get there." This Super Bowl, be sure to watch the game with a careful eye. Take note of the players' best practices and keep them in mind for your next presentation. If all else fails, football might help you sweat more in preparation, bleed less in battle.

Vs Michael Grothaus 11:02, 1 Feb 2017 facebook twitter google+ Which is the TRUE laptop replacement: Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 or Apple's iPad Pro? The tech and mobile industry is a pretty rapidly changing landscape, but although the devices and technologies change up quite a bit every few years, what remains consistent is the rivalries. New competitors do occasionally pop-up, with the likes of OnePlus appearing from nowehere, and LG upping its game to the point where it's now a thorn in Samsung's side, but meanwhile the same old veterans are still slogging it out in the same old feuds, some of which have been going for decades now. Apple and Microsoft are pretty much the ultimate example of this, with the duo competing head-to-head pretty much since home computing became a thing. While the spat may be over twenty years old, the duo are always clashing on new battlefields. These two tech titans once crossed swords over desktop and laptop personal computers, but now it's all about mobile; smartphones, tablets, and software and service ecosystems. Up until now, however, Windows devices haven't fared as well against iOS-based hardware (or Android, for that matter), so much of Apple's fight in the mobile space has been against Google. But where Microsoft has really excelled, at least, conceptually, is in its vision of how computing machines will function in the future. It saw that people will eventually want dualistic machines, a tablet and a laptop in one, and set about unifying its OS and developing its Surface line of products. And while it took awhile for Microsoft to lock-down the design and functionality, the company’s Surface Pro 4 is arguably in a league of its own in this market niche. Now the market is shifting towards less interest in pure tablets, and more interest in hybrid tablet/laptop/PC kit - particularly for businesses and professionals. Microsoft spotted this trend a LONG time ago and upped its game with Windows 10, and is already way ahead on the hybrid front with its refined, fourth generation Microsoft Surface Pro. Apple is hot on its heels though, with the iPad Pro. You now have another option, though, when it comes to buying a hybrid tablet from Apple in the form of the iPad Pro 9.7, which Apple launched alongside the iPhone SE at its Town Hall meeting on March 21. As the name suggests the iPad Pro 9.7 is essentially the same as the iPad Pro just with a smaller, 9.7in display and a smaller keyboard accessory. It has the same specs and the same awesome features, just in a more portable chassis.  “iPad Pro is a new generation of iPad that is indispensable and immersive, enabling people to be more productive and more creative. It’s incredibly fast, extremely portable, and completely natural to use with your fingers, Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard. And now it comes in two sizes,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “The 9.7-inch iPad Pro has a new Retina display with True Tone technology, four-speaker audio system, blazing fast A9X chip, 12-megapixel iSight camera, 5-megapixel FaceTime HD camera, faster wireless, and support for Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard. It is the ultimate upgrade for existing iPad users and replacement for PC users.” Despite this Apple's iPad sales are down 20% year on year. Here's a quote from Tim Cook about Apple's iPad sales from the company's recent Q1 earnings call:  “We have some exciting things coming on iPad. I still feel very optimistic about where we can take the product,” said Tim Cook during the call. “The customer satisfaction numbers are through the roof at 99 percent. I see a lot of good things and hope for better results. We are still currently in a shortage issue now and we’re not projecting to get out of that totally during the next quarter…. I’m very bullish on iPad.” But which is the better hybrid solution -- Microsoft's or Apple's? We aim to find out. iPad Pro vs Microsoft Surface Pro 4: Design and Specs Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Display: 12.3-inch 2736 x 1824 pixel at 267 pixels per inch Storage: 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB Processors: Intel Skylake Core M3, Core i5, or Core i7 RAM: 4GB, 8GB, or 16GB OS: Windows 10 Pro Cameras: 8MP front, 5MP rear Connectivity: 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.0, USB 3.0, microsSD Size: 292 mm x 201 mm x 8.45 Weight: 786 grams iPad Pro (12.9in) Display: 12.9-inch 2732×2048 pixel at 264 pixels per inch Storage: 32 and 128GB Processors: 64-bit A9X and M9 RAM: 4GB OS: iOS 9.1 Cameras: front 1.2MP 720p HD camera and a rear 8MP 1080p HD camera Connectivity: 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, optional 4G Size: 305 mm × 220 mm × 7 mm Weight: 710 grams iPad Pro (9.7in) Display: 9.7-inch 1536×2048 pixel at 264 pixels per inch Colors: Silver, Space Grey, Gold, Rose Gold Storage: 32, 128GB, and 256GB Processors: 64-bit A9X and M9 RAM: 4GB Touch ID: yes Cameras: front 5MP 720p HD camera and a rear 12MP 4K HD camera Connectivity: 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, optional 4G Size: 240 x 169.5 x 6.1 mm Weight: 437 grams Look, I’m going to be honest from the get go and say I’m a HUGE Apple fan. I think the iPhone and the Mac are some of the best computing devices you can buy. That being said, from a quick rundown of the specs alone it really does look like the Surface Pro 4 handily beats the iPad Pro if you are looking for a tablet/hybrid device that will allow you to do away with carrying around a separate laptop. The biggest difference between the two is that the Surface Pro 4 comes in many more options than the iPad Pro. The iPad Pro essentially gives you three options: one 32GB sized model and two 128GB sized models (one without 4G and one with). All three models have 4GB of RAM and the same A9X chip (although that is supposed to be INSANELY fast). But the Surface Pro 4, on the other hand offers three chip options (a relatively weak Intel Skylake Core M3 or Core i5, and a much more powerful Core i7). The Surface gives you the option of an insane amount of storage to: 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB. And RAM? You’ve got the option of 4GB, 8GB, or a crazy 16GB. The Surface Pro also gives you plenty of more ports including a full sized USB 3.0 port and a microSD card slot. However, the downside is that what the Surface doesn’t give you is a cellular connection–yep, there’s still no 4G option. But still this is hardly a deal-breaker. My Chromebook doesn't have one either and that's never really bothered me.  Finally, on the camera front, both the iPad Pro 12.9 and Surface Pro 4 have 8MP rear cameras, but the Surface Pro also offer a 5MP front camera where the iPad Pro only gives you 1.2MP. I also generally prefer the overall look, feel and design of the Surface Pro. It feels like a machine you can get stuff done on -- mostly because it is just that. The iPad Pro, conversely, looks and feels like, well... a big iPad.  However, the new iPad Pro 9.7in has quite an impressive camera setup, borrowing the same refined module from the iPhone SE. This includes a 12MP sensor for the primary with a wide f/2.2 aperture and 1/3" senor size, phase detection autofocus, dual-LED two-tone flash, simultaneous 8MP still and 4K video capture. The secondary camera is also uprated with a 5MP sensor. iPad Pro vs Microsoft Surface Pro 4: Display The display of the iPad Pro is physically larger at 12.9-inches, compared to the Surface Pro’s 12.3-inches. Both come in at a similar pixel density of 264 and 267 ppi, respectively. But the iPad Pro has a slightly higher resolution at 2732×2048 pixels versus the Surface Pro’s 2736 x 1824. Overall there's not a lot in it, but you could argue the Surface is a bit more portable, while the iPad Pro has that bigger, ever-so-slightly sharper display for presenting things to people. Swings and roundabouts. Personally speaking, I find the size and gait of the Surface Pro 4 infinitely preferable. I don’t need to buy a new satchel to fit it inside, I like the familiar, laptop-style format and it has an array of ports for connecting it to things like external monitors and other accessories. Mostly, though, the Surface Pro 4 is a machine I can do work on — it looks, feels and performs in a manner I am used to. The iPad, for me, has always been about consuming media, not creating it. I know Apple wants to change this with the iPad Pro but I just can’t see how that will happen while it is still running iOS?   The iPad Pro 9.7in has a few key differences from the others, though. While the iPad Pro 12.9in features Apple's pressure-sensitive 3D Touch, this is absent on the 9.7in iPad Pro (and the iPad Air 2, in fact), however, the iPad Pro 9.7in instead features a much more advanced display using an oxde TFT "True Tone" panel; Apple says it is considerably brighter and less reflective than previous iPads and in fact any other tablet on the market, while the "True Tone" label refers to the display ability to use on-board sensors to measure the ambient light colour in the room and adjust the display colour gamut accordingly. iPad Pro vs Microsoft Surface Pro 4: OS This is another area where–if you are comparing the iPad Pro and Surface Pro as hybrid “we don’t need no laptops anymore” devices–then the Surface Pro wins hands down. That’s because it runs Windows 10, a full desktop OS along with desktop-class apps. The iPad Pro runs iOS 9–while there’s a lot of apps for that, it doesn’t compare to being able to run a full desktop OS like Windows 10 or OS X on the Mac. iPad Pro vs Microsoft Surface Pro 4: Accessory Support Again, we're looking at these two devices as laptop replacements–and again the Surface Pro wins here. That’s because it supports an insane amount of accessories. The iPad Pro works with Apple’s new Pencil Stylus and Smart Keyboard Cover (both will cost you extra), but that’s it. "Apple Pencil has two emitters in the tip that enable the iPad Pro to determine the pencil nib's angle and orientation relative to the display, and adjust the pen stroke according to iFixit. iPad Pro has a digitizer that likely determines the distance from each emitter to the screen," reports Mac Rumors. "At the core of the Apple Pencil is a tiny 0.329 Wh lithium-ion rechargeable battery that holds just 5% of the charge of an iPhone 6s battery, next to a small cylindrical black and gold antenna. There is also a small ribbon cable that connects the Apple Pencil's battery with its Lightning connector for charging." On the subject of specs, the report said: "On the other side of the battery is the Apple Pencil's tiny folded logic board that weighs just one gram, yet houses more than five components, including an ST Microelectronics low-power 32-bit ARM-based Cortex-M3 microcontroller and Qualcomm Bluetooth 4.1 chip from Cambridge Silicon Radio." The Surface Pro includes the stylus when you buy it and also offers an optional keyboard cover. However, it’s keyboard cover also features a glass trackpad–meaning you can use the Surface as you can a laptop, that is: how you’re used to. The Surface Pro also supports mice (just plug it into the USB port or connect via Bluetooth). iPad Pro vs Microsoft Surface Pro 4: Price & Verdict As a laptop or desktop replacement, the Surface Pro 4 blows away the iPad Pro. It is a TRUE laptop replacement because it runs a desktop class OS and apps and offers a wide range of accessories and ports. On the flipside, if you opt for a Surface Pro 4 over an iPad Pro you’re going to be paying for it. But given the aforementioned benefits and the fact that the iPad Pro is a first generation device -- and Apple's first generation devices are never the one you want to opt for -- then this should not be a dealbreaker for you.  The iPad Pro costs £679 for the 32GB Wi-Fi model, £799 for the 128GB Wi-Fi model, and £899 for the 128GB Wi-Fi + Cellular model. That's without the keyboard and pen though, add those on top and you're looking at just over a grand all-in. The Surface Pro ranges from £740 for the relatively weak entry level model (128GB, Intel Core m3, 4GB RAM) all the way up to £1799 for the top of the line model (512GB, Intel Core i7, 16GB RAM). For that amount of money, the Surface better be both a true top of the line tablet and also a laptop replacement. This is where things get a little murky, though, as Microsoft’s Windows 10 platform has WAY more functionality than Apple’s iOS platform, which is predominantly designed for use on phones (and traditional tablets). Microsoft’s Windows 10 platform is a 100% desktop-grade operating system. It is ultra-powerful, supported globally by the biggest software brands and has all the bells and whistles you’d expect from a modern PC operating system.

(AP) — A Vermont dog will appear alongside New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady in an ad that’s set to air during the Super Bowl. The 5-year-old boxer named Jack filmed the ad with Brady for technology company Intel outside of Boston last year. NECN reports that in the ad set to air Feb. 5, the dog wakes up with Brady, who later beats the dog to a fallen pancake. The ad tells viewers that the new Intel technology makes “anything look epic.” Owner Nina Daniel, of Starksboro, says she is “so proud” of Jack. The dog has been training at Show Me The Biscuit in Williston since it was a puppy and has appeared in several television commercials.

Last week's Persistent Memory Summit in San Jose, organized by the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) as part of its Solid State Storage Initiative (SSSI), included a presentation by Steve Pawlowski, vice president of advance computing solutions at Micron, outlining how computing architectures must change to get the right data to the processor efficiently and how persistent memory such as NVDIMMs can play a role. EE Times spoke to Pawlowski following his SNIA keynote on why new computing architectures must support current software applications, the current roadmap for NV-DIMMs, and what might be the non-volatile memory of choice down the road. EE Times Memory Designline: What are your thoughts on the current JEDEC roadmap for NVDIMMs? Steve Pawlowski:It's going to take time. The platform support is coming. It's good to start with DDR4. When you start talking about NVDIMM-P, in which latency is non-deterministic, there had to be changes made to the DDR4 and the DDR5 protocol, which is at JEDEC right now. I'm going out on a limb, but you're going to see DDR5 platforms close to the end of the decade. There are some DDR4 platforms today; the question is, will they be able to implement the protocol to allow an NVDIMM-P to sit right into the platform itself? Overall, we'll see still a lot of NVDIMM-N solutions. Over time, we'll start to see more penetration of the smaller DRAM/larger NAND footprint, NVDIMM-P devices. EE Times: In your presentation at the SNIA Persistent Memory Summit, you mentioned that Micron has put a big focus on minimizing the impact on existing software applications when developing new architectures around persistent memory. Why is this necessary? Pawlowski: Intel is doing a good job of building persistent memory files systems, and I think that there are other customers out there doing the same thing. But persistency is really a new concept. So you need to apply new hardware and new capabilities in a manner so that there's benefit for people willing to use it, put it in their platform, and are willing to spend whatever money they need to in order to make that happen. The idea with persistent memory is that if you can get the cost per bit as good or better as what you can with NAND — although I don't think anything ever will, as NAND is pretty efficient in terms of cost per bit — or there is a power improvement, you want to make sure that if somebody's going to put it in their platform, the software they currently have just runs. You want to make sure that, when an application runs and there are some dependencies in terms of latency, they are comprehended by the hardware so things just don't break. EE Times: How does Micron make sure that these new systems will support existing software applications? Pawlowski: The first thing you have to do is configure these systems in a simulation environment or do some prototyping. We tend to do it in the simulation environment and then run application traces and systems traces against that to see what we need to do and how we have to configure the system so we limit the impact on performance. It's really critical once you have the simulator that, as you are going through the design, you're constantly verifying the changes. If we don't validate it from an architectural perspective, it can have a pretty substantial impact on performance. EE Times: What kinds of constraints does this impose on the development of systems? Pawlowski: : The people who have been buying systems over the years have been doing so based on performance. The tendency has been trying to get a 45% improvement in performance from one platform generation to the next. That ended up to be 2X every two years. People are kind of used to that. If you're going to put in a new capability like [persistent memory], the first thing you have to make sure is that you're not deprecating that performance story. There may be some individuals who are okay to live with a 10% performance impact because there are other benefits that they can get, but there are certainly others who say that they don't want to see any performance impact whatsoever. EE Times:: How conceivable is it that someone might be willing to build entirely new software in order to take advantage of a new architecture? P: You have to recognize that the market penetration you're going to get is really very small. That value proposition has to be that there's nothing there that you are competing with initially, or it has to be so much better that somebody is willing to take that gamble, and your investors are aware that it's not going be a market sensation overnight. EE Times: The trend in recent years has been a convergence of memory and storage. At what point do you feel the latency between the memory and storage became pronounced enough that it needed to be addressed? Pawlowski: When I started out, the actual latency for DRAM access was fast enough directly. As the industry was able to take advantage of Moore's Law and push higher and higher performance and higher clock rates, the DRAM started to not keep up. It really focused on density and didn't push much in terms of latency. What really exacerbated the problem was multi-core. It became a core war in terms of how many cores you could put in. But at the same time, we weren't focusing on the memory bandwidth and capacity per core. This may be controversial to some people in the industry, but the system really needs to be designed with memory and the storage subsystem first and foremost. When the cores are running real applications and waiting on the memory subsystem to deliver as fast as it can, they're starving. There's a crisis in the world in that we're creating more data. Moving that data is expensive from an energy perspective, and regardless of how much compute you have, if you can't move the data quickly and efficiently, your systems are going to be struggling in terms of real-world performance. We've got to start to think about computing architectures, not the CPU, as the central element. You have data where it sits, and you move whatever compute you need closer to the data to be able to do that. Memory and storage now become the focal point of the system architecture. EE Times: What your thoughts on what will be the non-volatile memory of choice? Pawlowski: There's always NAND. You're taking a huge latency impact, but on a cost-per-bit basis, and the density you can get in on the DIMMs, NAND is an attractive option. Regardless of what technologies come sooner or come later, be it 3D Xpoint or others, you will still see strong support for NAND. We'll get clever to see how we can minimize the latency impact. I do see 3D Xpoint playing a role here. When that happens is yet to be determined. It's a pretty capable technology. And then there are others that we and other memory vendors are working on that would be beyond 3D Xpoint. —Gary Hilson is a general contributing editor with a focus on memory and flash technologies for EE Times.

Without a paper trail they wouldn’t have to worry about any substantial leaks from NSC staffers that would interfere or cripple their foreign policy objectives. The lack of accountability isn’t very confidence inspiring considering the role NSC played during Iran-Contra but I don’t find FP’s concern trolling to be genuine. As if the foreign policy apparatus hasn’t plowed the country into multiple quagmires/disasters already.

McCarthy would have fallen eventually, but his dispute with the Army hastened his downfall. Reply ↓ Andrew Watts February 1, 2017 at 1:29 pm The difference is that McCarthy was a drunk and Bannon is a self-described Leninist. Apparently Bannon got a little tipsy at a party and spilled his personal baggage.

Bannon wants to destroy government so that rich people and corporations can have free rein to do whatever they want. So in that restricted sense, he shares something with Marxists like Lenin. When he described himself as a “Leninist”, I think he was being a smart a$$ who enjoyed shocking the person he was talking to Maybe I’m wrong; perhaps he sleeps with a deluxe bound edition of The State and Revolution under his pillow. Reply ↓ Lambert Strether February 1, 2017 at 2:28 pm I’m told that many on Wall Street read Lenin. At least, they think, he understands the uses of power, and he writes with admirable clarity. (I’m not sure communism is a thing or has any doctrines any more. For my money, it’s all been peeled back to Capital, because Marx fought his way through to the idea that capitalism means crisis, as opposed to this equilibrium bullshit. Harder leftists than I am may feel free to disagree… I should also say that I’m also digestign some of the wonderful new scholarship on capitalism and slavery, which was not available — experts correct me — at the time Marx wrote. Reply ↓ OpenThePodBayDoorsHAL February 1, 2017 at 3:02 pm What’s remarkable is how communist central planning crept into our money systems, Keynes and Harry Dexter White (who designed the global money system after WW II) were both fans of Stalin’s Soviet Union. “I’ve seen the future…and it works!” they gushed. In every other domain the concept of top-down centralized planning has collapsed into a heap of hilarity and ridicule, but for our money we still labor under a system where a prescient Politboro of plutocrat Ph.Ds (try to) predict the future for us. Their success rate is 0.00%… but nevertheless: “Forward Soviet!” Reply ↓ DarkMatters February 1, 2017 at 4:02 pm I keep reading descriptions like “communist central planning” as above, as if central planning is the core feature of communist government that explains all its evils (in contrast to sunshiny laissez-faire, I suppose). This has been quite the learning experience, since before this, I had no idea that the civilizations that planned the pyramids, the ziggurats, from Sumer to Akkad to Babylonia, or the Roman roads and aqueducts, had so misguidedly anticipitated nineteenth century Leninist and Marxist collectivism by so many millenia! Nor that the power vacuum of the middle ages, where a few entrepreneurial good ol boys from Normandy were free to run amok in Europe, was such a social paradise. Please, someone, is there an enunciable definition of communism (and socialism, for that matter) that lets me characterize a government or policy before I’m supposed to hate it, instead of after? Reply ↓ Brad February 1, 2017 at 7:55 pm Yep, the magic marketplace conjured all those aqueducts into existence. Just like it did with…the Erie Canal. Interestingly, the classical Latin word for “the market” – forum – also referred to a public space. Hence “turba forensis” – “public disturbance”. The ancient Romans recognized the marketplace as a public, social construction. Tributary familial relations were the space of the private world. The mass wage labor market is the basis for its present mystification. The privately owned railroads were its historical inflection point in the US. “Central planning” is a typical liberal bugbear. As if there can’t be decentralized or distributed planning. The liberal market boils down to waiting for individual capitalist despots and clique hangers-on to impose *their plans* upon the rest of us in “the forum”. As each capitalist clique pushes a plan that must reinforce a despotism centered around themselves, the plans often clash. As we see at present with Trump and his class comrade opponents. That clash of despotisms is called “freedom and democracy”. Reply ↓ Elasmobranch February 1, 2017 at 4:46 pm Walmart is a central command economy. And nearly a state unto itself.

Reply ↓ Procopius February 1, 2017 at 8:45 pm Actually, “planning,” not necessarily “central planning,” was extremely popular among intellectuals during the late ’20s and the ’30s. It seems to me to have come from the perceived failure of “free market” capitalism, the dog-eat-dog competition, and the inability of the central government to halt deflation. Lots of people thought the Depression wa the result of overproduction. In the Midwest, farmers formed unions to try to halt shipment of milk to the cities, in an effort to raise the price. Everybody was impressed by the success of the German General Staff’s success with central planning during World War I. Reply ↓ Tigerlily February 2, 2017 at 4:38 am Great comment. What few now remember is that in the 1930s, in the wake of both World War 1 and the Great Depression, capitalism’s credibility was in tatters and people were searching for alternatives, the two most promising of which were fascism and communism. It is only “obvious’ in retrospect that the center would hold and the radical alternatives fail…or at least fail first. Small correction: central planning required the expertise and resources of the entire state bureaucracy, it was not exclusively or even primarily an achievement of the General Staff alone.

Worse is TPP and TISA which with their ISDS and hefty intellectual property provisions have far more to do with restricting trade than with freeing it.

Reply ↓ Jim Haygood February 1, 2017 at 7:36 am The audacity of chutzpah: Israel approved 3,000 more housing units in the occupied West Bank late Tuesday. Emboldened by the new Trump administration and internal battles at home, Israel announced plans for the new units in about a dozen settlements a week after approving 2,500 homes in the West Bank and 566 in East Jerusalem. “This is a government of settlers that has abandoned the two-state solution and fully embraced the settler agenda,” said Husam Zomlot, strategic affairs adviser to Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority. http://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/world/middleeast/israel-3000-homes-west-bank.html A couple of mayors of illegal settlements were actually invited to the US presidential inauguration, according to the NYT.

Reply ↓ PlutoniumKun February 1, 2017 at 8:24 am I think in many ways its a relief that there is a POTUS who no longer even pretends he cares about the Palestinians. BHO did huge damage to region by his supposed neutrality, which actually enabled Israeli extremists. I read somewhere an Israeli liberal writer who said that Israeli’s are the only people not shocked by Trump because they’ve been living with a Trump type in power for years. He and Netanayu will get on very well. In an odd sort of way I think its long term good news for the Palestinians. With Trump in power the Israeli hard liners are almost certain to overplay their hand. It will, in short, be a clarifying situation and so the world won’t be able to hide behind supposed US neutrality. Things will get worse in the short term but it will hopefully at last force the world to stand up to apartheid in Israel, just as it took decades for the world to finally stand up to it in South Africa. Reply ↓ funemployed February 1, 2017 at 8:54 am While we’re talking long-term Israeli politics, rarely mentioned is the power of the ultra-orthodox political faction and their birth rate. Because the ultra-orthodox basically only vote in parliament based on religious concerns, they wield disproportionate power which ensures that the state will continue to support them in their religious studies. What do they do with all that free time and state money – make babies. As such, their population is growing at a much faster exponential rate than the non-orthodox population (though immigration offsets this a bit, if I remember right). With regards to Palestine, the ultra-orthodox think it was deeded to them by God, so no winning that argument. The demographic and political trends are clear. Israel is moving away from even the pretense of democracy and toward an unapologetic and absolute theocratic apartheid state. Don’t really see any way this trend changes in the coming decades. Even without US support, Israel will continue to dominate that neck of the woods militarily for the foreseeable future.

It dominated its neck of the woods, pounding SWAPO at will. But military strength ultimately did not win the mind game. In the waning days of apartheid, I met plenty of ‘europeans’ (a ZA euphemism for ‘whites’) who despite their racial entitlement did not feel the bantustan system was fair or sustainable.

Reply ↓ John Wright February 1, 2017 at 9:59 am I had a couple of business trips to Israel in 2013 and, to borrow a Tom Friedman completely unscientific polling method, listened to a Tel Aviv cab driver complain about the Ultra Orthodox. From what I was told, the Ultra Orthodox do not serve in the Israeli Defense Force and are paid by the state to study the Torah. The cab driver mentioned having “A black lady” in his cab (the orthodox dress in black, even the children) who defended the Ultra Orthodox by saying “we pray to God for you”. The cabbie said, “I told her, if I want to talk to God, I’ll do it myself”. Perhaps the internal resentment of the Orthodox will change some government subsidies and military service laws, muting their power. Reply ↓ NotTimothyGeithner February 1, 2017 at 10:40 am The Orthodox have an arrangement with Likud similar to the GOP and the evangelicals, the Catholic Church and state authorities traditionally, and the Wahaabiists and the House of Saud. Like so many religious outfits they will slither to the next regime when their current clients look shaky. Many of these privileges were put in place during the Era of Kibbutzes, partially to keep the Jews who weren’t 19th and early 20th century immigrants happy as the local Orthodox were never big on Zionism. Reply ↓ PlutoniumKun February 1, 2017 at 12:55 pm I know some Israelis (generally younger, fairly liberal) and they really loath both the ultra orthadox and the newer Russian immigrants. The former they see as small minded reactionaries, the latter they tend to see as barely Jewish and too extreme in their politics.

But she does support socially liberal actions that will burnish her “moderate” label while not costing her “real” supporters anything. She is slightly to the left of Hillary Clinton, in that Feinstein, while voting for the AUMF (Authorization to Use Military Force in Iraq), did vote for the Levin amendment to pursue a diplomatic solution first. Hawk HRC supported the AUMF and did not support the Levin amendment. Perhaps the protesters had a good time in their attempt to influence Feinstein.

As for #4 – donations to grantmaking foundations. Well, I’ll leave y’all to speculate about the average wealth of people who choose to donate to a foundation as opposed to, well, any of the other choices. On to health and human services – most of these donations go to fundraising, administrative stuff, and “raising awareness.” Typically, somewhere between 0 and 12 percent of those donations go to either a) providing material benefits to people in need or b) funding actual research.

So while I admire and encourage those who are protesting outside Schumer’s residence, I am worried that they still think Schumer and many others like him are actually moved by so-called electoral pressure. They are not. Schumer would rather lose his senate position and take up his lucrative lobbying position sooner than expected than do anything to betray the overlords who will later hire him directly. Don’t protest Schumer, primary him. Reply ↓ Left in Wisconsin February 1, 2017 at 11:45 am there is serious blowback to this man building if he doesn’t start changing his ways moving forward. IDK.

All of this is supposed to be paid for by sales of popcorn and soda as 90 percent of the ticket receipts go to the movie studios in the first few weeks when most films make their money. Also since all movies are now digitally projected you are seeing a 2k or 4k picture that is no sharper than a home blu ray (2k) or the coming 4k televisions. That other nato (National Association of Theater Owners) has been worrying about the demise of movie theaters for decades. But it may finally be about to happen. They do still have those giant screens where Pauline Kael “lost it at the movies.” Reply ↓ voteforno6 February 1, 2017 at 9:09 am I don’t know…the downturn in filmgoing may be content-related more than anything. There are some films, such as Arrival, Hidden Figures, and La La Land that have been doing pretty well. The studios seem to have geared themselves more toward franchises, which tend to be expensive productions. The above films, not so much. I think a few years ago Universal had its most profitable year ever, and what was unique about it was that they didn’t have any franchise films that year. I still enjoy the experience of going to films. I’ve been lucky, though, in that there’s an Alamo within easy driving distance of where I live. That chain is quite obviously run by people who enjoy going to films. Reply ↓ Roger Smith February 1, 2017 at 10:03 am A huge problem has been the substitution of art and creativity with data analytics. So many box office films these days are crap churned out on a spreadsheet (so it hits every possible demographic) and okayed by producers who signed a director they can blame when it gets bad reviews. The problem here is these films are still making a boatload of money. Data analytics and content crapification only tell a part of the story. But I don’t necessarily think this commercial degradation is isolated to film or even media either (check out our politics!). I think there is a general wave of crapification going on that is based on the uneven concentration of wealth and influence. Reply ↓ Praedor February 1, 2017 at 10:10 am Yup. We rarely go to the theater anymore but it isn’t because we only want to watch things on the small screen at home, it is because we don’t often see something worthy of the effort, small as it is, to go to the theater and enjoy it. Some movies are good enough and some are best on a big screen. There are simply some movies that do not work well small screen. Some movies completely DIE when not in the theater (Rocky Horror Picture Show REALLY sucks if you try and view it at home…it REALLY needs the entire experience that can only be had in a theater). Reply ↓ voteforno6 February 1, 2017 at 10:18 am That probably explains why I didn’t care much for Rocky Horror when I watched it at home. I supposed I could go see it in the theater, but I’m not sure if I’d enjoy being pelted by toast thrown by men dressed in drag.

Not one for superhero movies myself which seem to be about all Hollywood puts out these days. I’m guessing one can only watch men prancing around in colored tights blowing shit up so many times before it starts to get a little boring. There are lots of new stories to tell – Hollywood should try it more often. Reply ↓ Left in Wisconsin February 1, 2017 at 11:53 am Hey, I have a survey question. In my yuppie-town, it used to be that one of the theaters had an Ultra-Screen TM, which was a big ass screen where you got to watch the movie in reclining barca-loungers. Well, in the last year or two, that theater has gone full baca-lounger in all of its (16?) theaters, even the ones with the tiny screens. And the other big theater on my side of town is doing the same thing. One the one hand, I think they have raised ticket prices overall. (In the old days, it cost more to see Godzilla on the US than in one of the regular theaters.) On the other, it has dramatically reduced the number of seats in each theater. Which, to my observation, has led to another fee-extraction service, which is increased inducement to buy tickets ahead of time on line because of the heightened risk of the theater being sold out if you wait to buy in person. Is this happening everywhere? Reply ↓ Carolinian February 1, 2017 at 12:17 pm They are trying to make the theater more like that living room you aren’t in. There is also now a chain (chains?) that has waiters and waitresses who bring popcorn in bowls and serves alcoholic drinks. Obviously the thinking is to retain theaters as a boutique experience for those who don’t mind paying higher prices for the privilege. They are reading the handwriting on the wall as it were. Really the only thing keeping movie theaters alive is the “release window” which ensures that the theaters have exclusive access to new product for a period of time. They thereby reap the social media advantage of having the new thing that everybody wants. The movie companies still make a lot of money from exhibition so they like it too.

Schumer does too, but he seems too smooth and smart for the rise of righteous leftists to harm him. Feinstein is a dino-saur that needs to go, and from what’s been happening in California, she is going to get primaried hard. My understanding is that Bernie supporters are doing a great job of taking over the basement jobs in the California Democratic Party, and Justice Democrats HQ is in Los Angeles, so let’s hope this is her swan song. Reply ↓ JohnnyGL February 1, 2017 at 1:07 pm Schumer seems like more of a chameleon. He’ll see the changing wind direction and he’ll play ball. DiFi is the type of corrupt oligarch that needs to go down in flames, as publicly as possible, to send a message to the rest that we’re not putting up with the usual BS anymore. When Tea Party claimed Eric Cantor as a scalp, it was clear that the dog had gotten off the leash and turned on its owner. Us lefties need to claim a big name scalp to send a message that the game has changed. Wasserman-Schultz would have been a nice one, but that district of hers was gerrymandered to perfection. This, of course, is why the Eric Cantor primary was such a shocker. The political class thought they had carved out defensible fiefdoms for themselves in the House after 2010. Senators are juicier targets and they’re easier targets, too, since they’re state-wide and not hand-crafted to avoid accountability. I hope you’re right, armchair! It seems she’s up for election in 2018. :) Reply ↓ Waldenpond February 1, 2017 at 2:17 pm Start counting coup. Anyone the democrat base forces out is +1 point.

I’m worried now. There was an article yesterday linked to Moon of Alabama, and while it was about “librul” hypocrisy, buried in the comments there was a link to a recent congressional act that gives Trump the ability to use military force to prevent Iran’s quest for a nuclear bomb. The link: https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-joint-resolution/10/text Should I (we) be worried about a false flag that will be blamed on Iran? Certainly, the “attack” on the Saudi frigate that the Pentagon believes was meant for US is not related to Iran’s nuclear quest, but I doubt that would stop Trump’s itchy twitter finger from pushing for some retaliation when/if something happens….ugh! Reply ↓ PlutoniumKun February 1, 2017 at 1:03 pm That article repeats the long debunked lie that the Iranians are behind the Houthi’s. Any connection between the two is very tenuous at best. If Trump is building up for action against Iran, expect to hear a lot more about the supposed Iranian connection in Yemen. Reply ↓ uncle tungsten February 1, 2017 at 11:19 pm I posted earlier on this so apologies for reiterating: There is a report in press of the pentagon saying the successful Houthi attack “was intended for a US warship”.

Myron Ebell, who has denied the dangers of climate change for many years and led Trump’s transition team for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) until the president’s recent inauguration, also said he fully expected Trump to keep his promise to withdraw the US from the global agreement to fight global warming. I did not know that having clean air and water is the greatest threat to my freedom and prosperity. This must be one of those alternative facts that I’ve been reading about. Reply ↓ jrs February 1, 2017 at 11:58 am And here I thought environmentalists were just spoiled brats living in their mom’s basement and being funded by the Russians who really just need to get a life. Now they are the greatest threat to freedom and prosperity as well! Reply ↓ Carolinian February 1, 2017 at 12:41 pm Sounds like he’s talking more about climate change than clean air or water. Not that being an AGW denier is a good thing, but the blame for that is a bit more universal–like when I start my car. And the reality is a true movement against carbon might very well threaten “prosperity” as it is defined in consumption crazy America.

Slippery customer.

The former secretary of State has also been busy writing, and she’ll release two new books this fall. Simon & Schuster will publish a collection of personal essays by the former Democratic presidential candidate, as well as a children’s picture book version of her 1996 bestseller “It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us.” The essay collection, as yet untitled, is inspired by Clinton’s favorite inspirational quotations, the publisher said in a news release. “These are the words I live by,” Clinton said. “These quotes have helped me celebrate the good times, laugh at the absurd times, persevere during the hard times and deepen my appreciation of all life has to offer. I hope by sharing these words and my thoughts about them, the essays will be meaningful for readers.” I just can’t even. A feeling that will no doubt get worse when I find out what ridiculous amount of money she will be paid to do it. The only thing that would make me feel better is if the subtitle is “Musings about my Alternative Reality.” I wonder if her author byline will be “Popular Vote President Hillary Clinton.” Reply ↓ Portia February 1, 2017 at 1:49 pm that’s been her narrative and she’s sticking to it. people like her are helpless pawns in the nasty doings of Empire.

Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef February 1, 2017 at 4:29 pm Wasn’t there a poll (or a couple) that showed that close to half supported the temporary 7-country ban? One third (regardless effectiveness) is much smaller than 48% for the ban (vs. 42% against). It’s easy to get confused into thinking 1/3 of American voters support the ban. Typically, the top survey question is ‘Do you support Hillary’ and not ‘Is Hillary more productive.’ You don’t expect to see that latter the last few days before an election. Reply ↓ Tracie Hall February 1, 2017 at 6:48 pm Great positioning of those photos! :-) Reply ↓ UserFriendly February 1, 2017 at 9:44 pm Re Swing left. I have been getting links for that colossal waste of time for days now. So I finally took the time to write out a response to them abut what they could do that would actually be productive: This is pointless. Even if there was some tsunami that gave dems the house in 2018 it wouldn’t madder nearly as much as taking back state house, state senate, and governorships. The reason Dems haven’t had a shot in the house [1] since 2010 is because democrats didn’t vote in 2010 and let the GOP take over key states just in time to have control of redistricting. Winning a bunch of house races in 2018 won’t do much if the GOP keeps getting to draw the maps. Not to mention that the democratic party is so pathetically weak right now that the GOP is crazy close to being able to pass constitutional amendments by straight party line votes. They don’t need the federal government to do that. It only takes 34 states calling for a constitutional convention. They are just 6 states shy of calling for one to enact a balanced budget amendment. Which would crash the economy immediately but they think it’s a good idea because both parties scaremonger about the national debt, something that is totally irrelevant, and should be increased, if anything. You should come up with a list of state house and state senate races that were close, that would be useful (Daily kos has one they are working on; some states have 2016 so far some don’t, ballotpedia should have the rest). These states use commissions, not their legislatures, so don’t worry about them: HI, CA, AZ, WA, ID, NJ Gerrymandering isn’t really effective till states have 6 or so districts so I wouldn’t worry about: DE, VT, HI, NH, RI, CT, OR, NV, NM, ME, MS, IA, AK, MT, ID, SD, ND, WY, NE, WV, AK, KS, UT, OK Every other state legislative seat is worth fighting for. Governors races that will be important in redistricting too (not all states let governors have any say, NC, FL, MD, CT, MS don’t). Here is the layout of our chances for all of the governor’s races coming up. Key winnable Governors races to work on that effect redistricting 2017 & 2021 VA 2018: WI, MI, PA, OH, CO, MN Longshots: TX, TN, GA, SC, AL 2020: Stretch: IN, MO Sorry if that is confusing, this site does a better job of explaining how states do their redistricting, Just make sure to focus on states with 6+ districts that don’t have a commision. The rest is just whether to try and get governors or legislatures. But if you insist on sticking with short term wins in congressional districts then here is a list of targets for you: Trump’s Fast Start Likely Puts the House in Play in 2018 And some data on congressional districts. Daily Kos Elections presents the 2016 presidential election results by congressional district It is embedded with about 11 links and I don’t feel like copying them and skynet would probably eat it anyways. So here is the original, if you have a Quora ac0count I would love the upvote to make sure they see it. Reply ↓ Ahimsa February 1, 2017 at 11:46 pm I truly respect your site but I find it interesting that while you are vehemently against Indian IT firms (and engineers) undermining pay of American engineers, you still disparage American physicians income and criticize the protections afforded to them in the licensing and credentialing process and not unlike many from Wall Street have also argued that these trade barriers created by doctors’ lobbies need to go. Any comments? Reply ↓ Yves Smith Post authorFebruary 2, 2017 at 1:26 am You are misrepresenting our position in a big way. We don’t have a problem with physician’s incomes. We do have a big problem with the incentives (payment for procedure, which is basically piecework) which has been documented to lead them to overtest and overtreat. Separately, it has been widely discussed b public health experts that the US is not producing enough primary care physicians, because it costs a lot to get educated here and doctors make a ton more money in a speciality. Even MDs who might prefer being a primary care doctor often can’t afford it. We have never advocated bringing in foreign MDs. Once in a while we link to posts by Dean Baker, who points out that professions like doctors and lawyers have what amount to unions and no one in the economics biz has much of a problem with that, but they are perfectly happy to not support unions for other workers. Moreover, there is tons of evidence (I’ve seen it on Slashdot for over a decade) that computer sciences grads can’t get entry level jobs as a direct result of H1-B visas. This isn’t just bad from a US economy perspective; it’s also strategically foolhardy. We are not creating the net generation of computer professionals. We perceive IT to be an area of US leadership, yet we are setting out to lose that in a generation by not giving grads job opportunities. Reply ↓ Ahimsa February 2, 2017 at 3:10 am I appreciate your argument and regret my misunderstanding of your position in this regard. However I would like to bring a few facts to your attention that would perhaps make you reconsider the incentive issue and physician incomes. This tendency to oversimplify the situation is not something I expect from people I hold in such high esteem. By 2016 only 1/3 of all US physicians will remain in private practice (source: Accenture). And this decline is going to continue as hospitals, venture funds and insurance companies continue to absorb the remaining practices. Newly graduating physicians are no longer taught how to set up independent practices. They are only taught how to negotiate contracts. So unless one accepts the premise that physicians are being pressurized by their employers to order more tests and overtreat, should we should not see a huge drop-off in health expenditures going forward? Second, the median income of Canadian Internal Medicine specialists and subspecialists is $396,105 (source: Canadian Institute for Health Information 2013/2014 Canada). In a single payer system overtesting and overtreatment should not be an issue. This income is comparable to what US physicians make. So can we really attribute pay-per-procedure as the dominant corrupting influence in physician behaviour. The crapification of medicine taking place through MACRA, so elegantly described by Lambert on your site, is strongly geared towards enhancing income of primary care physicians in a budgetary neutral exercise that will almost certainly result in slashing of specialist incomes. Promotion of Federally Qualified Rural Health Clinics is another example of public health policy that is rapidly going astray as cost-based per-patient reimbursement per-visit at these clinics ranges from $80-$200 or more! However when one talks to physicians, one realizes that in an effort to measure outcomes, the policymakers have missed the forest for the trees. Physicians are being increasingly stressed to spend more time looking at screens to meet reporting targets to meet bonus/penalty goals, than spend time with patients. I cannot see any good coming of this Finally, in rural Kentucky which is where I live, the job of rendering primary care has increasingly been outsourced from physicians to physician extenders. This is unlikely to save costs in the long run as the quality of graduates, many of whom qualify using online courses, is very variable. Malpractice has not been a concern till now but as physician assistants and nurse practitioners increasingly seek independent practice and prescriptive authority, the expenditures associated with defensive medicine will only rise exponentially.

The base board, already equipped with a broad variety of interfaces, can be expanded further with a wide range of options, add-ons and interfaces. The base of MPL's embedded computers is the CPU board which is currently available with low performance Intel CPU up to i7 Quad Core. The base CPU board comes with standard connectors and a rugged aluminum housing with DIN-Rail or flange mount. Optional available are also M12 or MIL 38999 connectors. With this base, any requirement can be fulfilled, even meets standards like EN50155, IEC60945, and MIL-STD-810. With this new LEGO concept, the base configuration of MPL's embedded systems can now be enhanced with the following expansion options: Power Options: Standard input power range is 9-36 VDC with highly efficient on-board power circuitry. Current available expansions: Redundant input, galvanic separation from 9V up to 160VDC, integrated UPS system for a temperature range from -40°C to +75°C. Networking Options: Four LAN ports are integrated on the base board. Current available expansions: Smart fiber converter, 4 port PoE+ GigE LAN controller, 5-port managed switch, 10-port managed switch, 10Gbit fiber ports. Mass Storage Options: Four SATA and one mSATA ports are integrated on the base board.

Staff photo by Angela Rowlings. comments Thousands of Bay Staters halted by President Trump’s controversial immigration order include hundreds of tech employees, medical researchers and university students, say top business and education leaders who are rallying around Attorney General Maura Healey’s lawsuit challenging the executive order. Carbonite chief executive Mohamad Ali listed the names of immigrants whose contributions led to successes at Apple, Intel and PepsiCo, before blasting the “detrimental” travel ban as “morally and ethically beneath our American values.” “This immigration order is damaging to business and innovation, economic growth and job creation,” Ali said. Mike Sroczynski of the Massachusetts Health and Hospital Association said the order temporarily banning travel from seven Muslim-majority countries and halting all refugee resettlements is causing “a deep sense of fear” at health care centers in the state he proudly describes as “a medical Mecca.” “Such a travel ban could only cause a chilling effect on talented and dedicated clinicians and care-givers and the related health care community from coming to our country,” Sroczynski said. “As these hospitals rely on an influx of international medical professionals, we know that the current travel ban will have a disproportionate and significant impact on the health care sector here.” The Democratic attorney general’s opening legal volley against Trump’s executive order asks the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts to declare the travel ban unconstitutional and extend a temporary halt on detaining travelers and deportations. In joining an ACLU case stemming from the detainment of two University of Massachusetts engineering professors from Iran who have permanent legal status, Healey argues the order violates the right to equal treatment under the law, due process, freedom of religion and the Tenth Amendment that reserves certain rights to states. Attorneys general in New York, Virginia and Washington are also suing Trump over the ban. Healey said her message to Trump is simple: “No one is above the law.” Republican Gov. Charlie Baker backed Healey’s action on behalf of the state. “Massachusetts is a global community and we all benefit from the shared experiences of our partners from around the world to support our economy and educational institutions to make our state the best place to live, work and raise a family,” Baker said in a statement. “The recent executive order puts this at risk, will not improve our security, and the lack of guidance associated with such an abrupt and overwhelming decision is problematic for all involved.” Related Articles Faith leaders unite against crackdown Gelzinis: Living with ‘psychological torture’ The Latest: Ivanka Trump visits Chinese Embassy More On: Donald Trump Maura Healey ACLU Share this Article Join the Conversation Herald Columnists Bob McGovern McGovern: Boston U.S. Attorney facing tough battle Joe Battenfeld Battenfeld: Media swings and misses with skype softball snipe Joe Fitzgerald Fitzgerald: Mob mentality snares Marty Walsh, too Howie Carr Carr: Hotline proved a rude awakening for Maura Healey Tom Shattuck Shattuck: NFL's message clear; no politics Peter Gelzinis Gelzinis: Living with ‘psychological torture’ Trending Now AG Healey and her partner both looking at pay hike ‘Powerless’ will rise: Vanessa Hudgens shines in superhero comedy Police: Two juveniles in custody after shot fired at BPS headquarters Today is Groundhog Day Boston Herald Archives Punxsutawney Phil #HeraldArchives #GroundhogDay Will he see his shad… Police say a 15-year-old boy is in custody after firing a semi-automatic handgun in a Boston Public Schools buildin… Divorced dad shot to death in targeted attack outside 4-year-old son’s school Donald Trump on Roger Goodell: ‘He’s a stupid guy’ #NFL Tweets by @bostonherald Boston Herald News Local Coverage Local Politics Columnists National US Politics International Offbeat News Obituaries Opinion Op Ed Letters to the Editor Editorials Send a Letter Sports Red Sox Patriots Celtics Bruins Columnist College Soccer Golf High School Other Entertainment Inside Track Celebrity News Arts & Culture Movies Music Television LifeStyle Food & Beverage Style & Fashion Travel Health & Fitness Business Automotive Real Estate Technology Markets More… Classifieds Radio Horoscope Lottery Crossword Contests Weather RSS Feeds Archives Log In Legal Notices Advertise Purchase Back Copies Send a News Tip Contact Us Home Delivery e-Edition Mobile Apps Herald Newsletters Send a Letter to the Editor Boston Herald In Education Mass Literacy ©Copyright by the Boston Herald and Herald Media No portion of BostonHerald.com or its content may be reproduced without the owner's written permission.

They will have disappeared into mergers, acquisitions or extinction." This is not a new trend. According to the American Enterprise Institute, nearly ninety percent of Fortune 500 companies that existed in 1955 are no longer with us. Modern emphasis resides on the speed at which companies change and disappear. This has increased the Corporate Burn Rate which is indeed running at high levels. Yet even here we are not in uncharted territory. A company from the first half of the Twentieth century could expect a lifespan of at least fifty years. By the Seventies, that had dropped to roughly thirty years. We can look to the Seventies as the first definable major milestone in this trend. The rise of business machines, automation and other technologies were creating a new breed of company. Those were the years that saw the rise of Microsoft, Intel and other technology game-changers. The mainframe computer had graduated from high-end hardware used by militaries and governments to a mainstream business tool. Consumers were starting to enhance their lifestyles with cheap televisions, ATMs, microwaves, economical cars and a bevy of other innovations. The world was changing rapidly, and with it, companies rose and fell on their ability to respond. The eighties and nineties became the eras of rapid productivity. Based on US figures from the Heritage Foundation, productivity has doubled while the average hourly rate has declined from 1970 to 2010. This is both good and bad, but it illustrates with certainty, the impact of productivity technologies during the last decades of the Twentieth century. From spreadsheets to email to switchboards to fax machines to ERP suites: these were productivity's catalysts. Eventually though, every pendulum has to reverse course. Those innovations started attracting complexity. In the early nineties you were lucky to get an email a day. Today you are lucky if you can read a hundred emails and get through your daily workload. The same systems that have granted us more space to accomplish, have also grown bloated. This is not new either: the reason why technologies in the Seventies boosted productivity, is because they were replacing overwhelming complexity. The mainframe was so popular since it was a lot simpler to use than the boxes of punch cards demanded by older systems. Then it became cumbersome, eventually challenged by leaner desktop and server PCs. Today we are at that stage again. The standalone server is being replaced by the cloud. Email is being joined by collaboration suites and messenger apps. The spreadsheet is making way for dashboards and analytical machine learning. Why? Because complexity is at a saturation point and the world is demanding simplicity to drive new levels of productivity. It is important that we appreciate the nature and inevitability of the sea-change that companies are currently experiencing. Now to my point: your business processes have been born and honed through those productivity technologies. Your fax machine sits idle - all that has shifted to email. If your email ceases to function, several of your processes will grind to a halt. Thus, it is paramount that you take stock of your processes, consider what powers them, and see if there is a better way. Let's consider the highly impactful example of data. Your company generates a lot of data, which until now, has likely languished in storage or was sent to the afterlife of deletion. But today data is a differentiator. Your ability to understand your data is crucial to your success, while the speed at which you access those insights defines your productivity. So it's a simple question: are you making use of your data? There are many more examples: can the cloud improve the speed and expansion of your products? Can machine learning automate manual processes, freeing up your staff and time? How are you using mobile devices to empower your workforce and yourself? Do you understand the benefits of in-memory computing? Is there a role which technologies such as Blockchain can play in your organisation? What you are looking for is Corporate Cholesterol: the fatty bits that have started to narrow your company's arteries. What are those processes and technologies that once made the enterprise's heart beat, but now threaten to choke it off? As a guideline, I can recommend three areas to consider. Firstly, look at how your customer experience drives your strategy. Customers are often familiar with innovations that make life easier. If you aren't appealing to them, your processes are lagging. Secondly, don't view your decision and the resulting transaction as separate entities. They feed from each other, so rather ponder on how you can enhance that relationship and learn from it. Thirdly, remember that data is the new centre of gravity, and speed matters. If your organisation is not responding as fast as your market expects it to, you need to address that. No such transition is easy. There are challenges in terms of security, regulation uncertainty, skill-sets, creating new mega-processes, disruption and more. But the only people who experience smooth sailing all the time are those who never leave the harbour. The storms of change cannot be avoided. However, they are key to ensuring business longevity. Cast a critical eye on your processes and contemplate on how new technology can help cut the bad fat.

Unsurprisingly, there was no changelog available at the time; however, the company seems to be improving its time to publish one, as it's now available. Here's what's new: Windows Update History Name Device Manager Name Intel Corporation – Display – 20.19.15.4568 Intel(R) HD Graphics Family 20.19.15.4568 improves Miracast and docked video performance. Intel(R) Display Audio 6.16.00.3197 improves Miracast and docked video performance. Microsoft - System Firmware update Surface Pro UEFI 3.11.2050.0 improves system performance for the latest Windows versions. The company also added a "value indicator" table, which presumably is to show the areas on which the update improves. Value Indicator Score Security + Reliability + Connectivity NA Compatibility NA Performance + Battery Life NA One thing to note about this update is that it's only for devices that are running Windows 10. If you're still using Windows 8.1 on your Surface Pro 3, you won't see anything that's new. If you are on Windows 10, you can grab the update through Windows Update, as usual, by heading to Settings -> Update & security -> Windows Update.

If anything, the numbers Apple released Tuesday highlight the company’s growing dependence on the iPhone, whose sales tower above Apple’s other current offerings. The company hasn’t managed to come up with another breakthrough product since its chief visionary, Steve Jobs, died in 2011. Read more: Apple, Microsoft and Intel buoyed by cloud boom Apple’s iPhone sales expected to rebound, move away from iPhone 7 Article Continued Below Meanwhile, Apple’s rivals have been rolling out new products in other promising fields such as augmented reality, virtual reality and artificial intelligence. Apple currently trails in those areas, although many analysts believe the company may try to catch up with products featuring those trendy technologies later this year. Selling more iPhones has been getting tougher as more people hold on to older models for longer periods and competitors such as Samsung and Google entice customers with sleek devices running on Android software. The trend led to three consecutive quarters in which iPhone sales fell compared to the prior year, causing Apple’s total revenue to sag as well. Apple bounced back in the quarter ending in December, buoyed by a positive response to the late September release of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. That device featured a better camera, which drew rave reviews, and no jack for headphones, which irked some consumers and befuddled others. Apple shipped 78.3 million iPhones in the latest quarter, a 5 per cent increase compared to the previous year. It benefited from a year-end quarter consisting of 14 weeks, one more than the previous year period. If not for the calendar quirk, the iPhone sales slump might not have ended. Apple sold an average of 5.6 million iPhones per week in the latest quarter compare to 5.7 million iPhones per week in the previous year. The Cupertino, California, company also was helped by a recall of Samsung’s Note 7 phones, which were plagued by battery fires. That problem drove some people switch to other models such as the iPhone. About 17 per cent of all iPhones are now 7 models, according to the research firm Localytics. Most of the rest are older iPhone 6 or iPhone 5 models. Apple could have sold more iPhone 7 Plus, which boasts a bigger screen and an extra camera, but couldn’t keep it in supply, chief financial officer Luca Maestri told The Associated Press. iPhone sales could slip yet again. Anticipation is building for the expected release of a 10th anniversary iPhone of some sort this summer or fall. Many smartphone owners could hold off until they get a good look at this year’s iPhone, says Daniel Ives, a senior vice-president for the mobile research firm Synchronoss Technologies. “It’s like a drum roll while everyone waits for the curtains to roll back to unveil the next iPhone,” Ives says. “There is a lot of pent-up demand out there, so this has the potential to be a game changer.” In Sept. 2016, Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, talks about the pricing on the new iPhone 7 during an event to announce new products, in San Francisco.  (Marcio Jose Sanchez)   The iPad, a tablet that became a smash hit after its 2010 debut, remains mired in a three-year sales slump, further magnifying the iPhone’s importance to Apple. The company shipped 13.1 million iPads in the past quarter, a 19 per cent drop from the previous year. “Remember when Apple called itself Apple Computer Inc.?” says BGC Financial analyst Colin Gillis, harking back to the company’s identity until 2007. “They may as well call themselves Apple Phone Inc. now.” Propelled by the iPhone, Apple Inc.’s revenue edged up 3 per cent to $78.4 billion in the quarter. But its profit dipped 3 per cent to $17.9 billion. It was Apple’s biggest quarterly revenue in its 40-year history, but it doesn’t erase the question that has nagged Tim Cook since he succeeded Jobs as CEO nearly five-and-half years ago: What’s next? Cook had high hopes for Apple’s smartwatch when he unveiled it in 2014, but that gadget remains more of a novelty. In interviews, Cook hinted Apple is exploring opportunities in augmented reality, which casts holograms and other digital images onto the real world around you. Apple also has been buying companies and hiring engineer specializing in artificial intelligence, a niche focused on teaching computers to think and talk more like humans. Gillis believes Apple already has wasted too much time trying to figure out what to do next. “When your iPhone juice runs down, you should already be ready to ramp up your next product,” he says. “What have we gotten after all the billions that Apple has spent on” research and development?

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 31, 2017 at 6:00PM In Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) most recent quarter, the company reported some interesting results for its Data Center Group (DCG) business, which supplies processors and other components for use in applications such as cloud and enterprise servers and networking appliances, among others. Intel's 10-core Ivy Bridge server processor. Image source: Intel. The company reported $4.67 billion in DCG revenue, up about 8.4% year over year -- but that wasn't the unusual part. Intel had told investors last quarter to expect "high-single-digit" revenue growth in DCG for the entirety of 2016, and that's exactly what the chipmaker delivered. Where things got a little bit murky was in the operating profit of the segment. Intel reported that DCG operating income came in at $1.88 billion, down from the $2.11 billion in operating profit that it threw off one quarter ago.  Now, Intel has been very straightforward about its expectation that its operating margins in DCG were going to come down on a year-over-year basis over the past several quarters because of a couple of factors: increased product costs as it moved its product line from older 22-nanometer manufacturing technology to newer 14-nanometer manufacturing technology, and increased investment levels. However, the strange thing is that its operating profits compared with a quarter ago were down from the prior quarter even though revenue was up. Further, the "known" margin headwinds already described would have been in effect in the third quarter of the year, as well as in the fourth quarter of the year. So, clearly, something unexpected took a serious toll on DCG's operating margins this quarter. To that end, Intel clarified on the earnings call that the unusually low operating margin for DCG in the fourth quarter was caused by two "one-time" factors. Let's take a closer look at them. A cross-license agreement and a quality issue The first factor that CFO Robert Swan described was that Intel "entered into a long-term cross license agreement and patent purchase agreement, particularly in the [communications] space in the quarter." He said DCG was "affected by a portion of that cost in the quarter." The second factor -- and one that Swan described as "a little more significant" -- was a so-called "product quality issue." Swan didn't go into too much detail, but he did say that it had to do with "slightly higher expected failure rates under certain use and time constraints." To deal with this, Swan said the company "established a reserve to deal with that" and was confident that the problem was "well bounded with a minor design fix." The good and the bad For those looking for the bright side, here it is: When the fourth quarter of 2017 rolls around, Intel will have a much easier baseline against which to compare. Since operating profit and margin were unusually low, Intel will be able to boast about significant operating margin expansion a year from now. Additionally, one of these factors is related to intellectual property and patent licensing, so it doesn't represent an execution problem on Intel's part, and one would hope that this agreement will save Intel from messy litigation down the road. Now, here's the not-so-bright side. Even though it appears the design flaw that caused the second factor to come into play is going to be taken care of quickly, it does represent an execution problem on Intel's part. No chips are designed perfectly, but given how experienced Intel is at building data center chips, it's surprising that it made such a mistake. Let's hope the company is more careful in the future.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

Or are all the stars and planets (including Earth and everything and everyone on it) just simulations in some colossal video game? What sounds like a silly question is actually one that some scientists have begun to take seriously. It's hard to come up with a way to tell for sure whether we're simulated beings living in a simulated universe. But the ancient story of the king and the chessboard may shed some light on the matter. In the story, a craftsman requests payment from the king in grain, starting with but a single piece placed on one square of the chessboard, and for twice as much grain each day until all the squares are filled. Day two has two grains, day three has four, day four has eight…and then 16, 32, 64, 128 to finish the first row. To the king's dismay, the payment on the 64th and final square amounted to more than 18 quintillion grains. That's enough to make a pile of grain extending up past Proxima Centauri, the nearest star outside our solar system. Related: The 5 Biggest Questions About the Universe Something similar — and more closely tied to the question at hand — can be seen with Moore's Law, which holds that the capacity of a computer chip doubles every two years or so. The law (actually an observation first made by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore back in the 1960s) has been consistently accurate for decades. If that continues into the distant future, at some point — perhaps within centuries — microchips might become so powerful that the video games that use them can simulate not just the simple scenarios seen in today's games, but something as complex as the entire cosmos. Microchips might become so powerful they can simulate something as complex as the cosmos. From here, it's not difficult to argue that we might all exist within a video game being played by something of intelligence far more advanced than our own. We're used to intelligence being in physical bodies, but as I've written about elsewhere, Fred Hoyle's 1957 novel "The Black Cloud" imagines an interstellar cloud made largely of electrons that has intelligence. So just what form this game-playing superintelligence might take is something we can't yet fathom. Let's assume we are simulated beings living in a simulated universe. Should we worry that we're being controlled by some superkid's fingertips? If we're left alone, why should we? So the question becomes: Would we be left alone? Perhaps our superintelligent controller would choose to test us — for example, by gradually increasing the level of carbon dioxide in our simulated atmosphere. Is it possible that this explains our global warming problem? Related: Are Humans the Real Ancient Aliens? Another intriguing possibility is that we exist within in one of multiple games going on in parallel — essentially a version of the "multiverse" concept that has enthralled some cosmologists. My point is that if our extension of Moore's Law suggests that it might eventually be possible to simulate one universe, surely that must make it possible to create alternative universes. Are there really multiple universes out there, each with its own distinct physical characteristics? Lord Rees of Ludlow, England's Astronomer Royal, has written a book entitled "Just Six Numbers" that lists a few basic parameters that control our universe. One of these is what scientists call the "fine structure constant," which governs how atoms are put together (and which is being tested by astronomers who study quasars, the brightest and among the farthest objects in the universe). If any of these parameters were different, we wouldn't have evolved a sun and an Earth that has lasted long enough — 5 billion years so far — for our kind of intelligent life to exist. In fact, without the right parameters, the planets and stars that make up our universe might never have formed. Then we must consider the question of life itself. Cosmologists talk of the anthropic principle: the notion that our universe is hospitable to life only because we are here. After all, if the universe weren't hospitable to life (whatever it is), then we wouldn't be here to ponder the question. If we're in a simulation, we must be in one of the versions that is detailed enough and lasts long enough to allow the existence of our kinds of life. Related: How Computers Are Learning to Predict the Future Another work of fiction that relates to our discussion is Mark Twain's "Extract from Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven." In this story, Twain describes a spaceship that races with a comet to arrive at a part of heaven that is not the normal location. He shows succinctly just how pedestrian our ideas are of our location in the universe really are. And scientists have done essentially the same thing with their research. In the 16th century, Copernicus correctly took Earth out of the center of the universe with the publication of his book "On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres." In the 20th Century, Harlow Shapley used the Mt. Wilson Observatory's 100-inch telescope in California to take the sun out of the center of our Milky Way galaxy (by noticing that almost all the globular clusters were off to one side of our view), and Edwin Hubble used the same telescope to take our galaxy out of a special place in the universe (by using Henrietta Leavitt's discovery that the brighter examples of a certain rare type of variable star took longer to go through its cycle than dimmer ones). "It’s not difficult to argue that we might all exist within a video game being played by something of intelligence far more advanced than our own." imaginima / Getty Images More recently, we've learned that the very matter we're made of is only about 5 percent of everything there is; most of the universe is made of dark matter and dark energy (some of my research decades ago found approximately that 5 percent number, though we didn't know to invoke dark energy and dark matter for the other 95 percent). And last year we discovered that electromagnetic radiation — gamma rays, x-rays, ultraviolet, visible light, infrared, and radio waves — is not the only way we can interact with distant parts of space. As was announced about a year ago, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) detected gravitational waves, tiny wiggles in space-time that in this case traveled across a vast distance to show the merger of two black holes more a billion years ago. Related: 11 Surprising Predictions From Some Top Names in Science If the 20th century astronomical discoveries and the epochal discovery of gravitational waves in the early 21st century revolutionized our ideas about the universe in a mere hundred years, we can hardly imagine what intelligent beings might be capable of a thousand or a million years in the future. So could we really be simulated beings living in a simulated universe? I don't see why not.

Its stock rose 2.3 percent during regular trading on Wednesday, and then jumped by more than 2 percent in after-hours trading when it reported better-than-expected earnings of $1.41 per share, 10 cents ahead of estimates. Revenues rose 53 percent from last year, also ahead of estimates, thanks to some very impressive user metrics. If the gains hold, the rise will be enough to push FB up and over its October high into new record territory -- continuing a relentless four-year uptrend and representing an 18 percent climb out of the social media titan’s late December low. Facebook’s rise represents just the latest mega-cap tech stock to go vertical in response to solid quarterly numbers: Apple (AAPL) gained 6.1 percent Wednesday after reporting a return to growth for the iPhone, and Netflix (NFLX) surged in mid-January on the best quarter of net subscriber additions ever.  Of course, there have been a few duds as well, with the likes of Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT) and Intel (INTC) posting weakening earnings. Investors, obviously, are reacting emotionally to results whether good or bad. During the quarter, Facebook benefited from intense user engagement leading up to and following the contentious U.S. presidential election. Daily active users increased 18 percent from a year ago in December. Monthly active users increased 17 percent to a record 1.86 billion. And monthly mobile active users climbed to 1.74 billion (chart above). To put this into perspective: As of this moment, more than quarter of the world’s population logs into Facebook one way or another at least once a month. Investors seem to be setting aside pre-earnings worries about revenue growth heading into the middle of 2017 after management warned it would be investing heavily in its business to create new growth in areas like virtual reality via its Oculus division. Investment spending came in at $4.5 billion for 2016, and management has warned that this number would grow “substantially” this year. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved.

In development since last year, the chip, codenamed T310, is said to be similar to the chip used to power the Touch Bar in the new 2016 Macbook Pro. It's built using ARM technology and will work with the standard Intel processor, handling "Power Nap" low-power mode functionality. Apple engineers are planning to offload the Mac's low-power mode, a feature marketed as "Power Nap," to the next-generation ARM-based chip. This function allows Mac laptops to retrieve e-mails, install software updates, and synchronize calendar appointments with the display shut and not in use. The feature currently uses little battery life while run on the Intel chip, but the move to ARM would conserve even more power, according to one of the people.Apple's 2016 MacBook Pro uses an independent ARM-based chip called the T1 to power the Touch Bar, the Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the Touch Bar, and the secure enclave that stores payment and biometric data. According to Bloomberg's report, the upcoming ARM-based chip will "go further," connecting to storage and wireless components to take on additional power management capabilities. Apple could begin using the new chip in an upgraded version of the MacBook Pro set to launch later this year, but it could be introduced as a quiet update with little fanfare as the chip that powers the Touch Bar was not promoted by Apple. Despite Apple's plans to offload some tasks to a new ARM chip, Apple is said to have no intention of abandoning Intel chips in its laptop and desktop computers.

Disney and three of its units are the last remaining defendants in a class-action lawsuit alleging that the studios conspired to suppress wages through a "gentleman's agreement" to not recruit workers. Attorneys for Disney and employees submitted a court filing on Tuesday seeking approval of the settlement. Comcast's DreamWorks Animation previously agreed to a US$50 million settlement, while two Sony Pictures units and Blue Sky Studios reached deals totalling US$19 million. Apple, Google, Intel and Adobe Systems paid US$415 million in 2015 to resolve their part in a similar case that was brought against Silicon Valley technology companies that had been investigated for collusion by the US Justice Department. University of San Diego law professor Orly Lobel predicted that Disney's settlement would win approval because it satisfied requirements that the agreement be fair, reasonable and adequate. "Given that this was the last hold-out, there are already proxies of what should be the lump sum and it seems within the range," Prof Lobel said. A US$100 million settlement for one large company is proportional to the US$415 million agreed to by several technology giants in the previous case, and the much smaller earlier settlements, she said. A Disney spokesman did not immediately respond to a call seeking comment.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | February 1, 2017 -- 20:34 GMT (12:34 PST) | Topic: Networking AT&T announced on Wednesday that it's rolling out so-called 5G "evolution markets" in Austin and Indianapolis this summer, as part of a broader push to upgrade its networks. This showcase markets will start out with theoretical peak speeds of 400Mbps. That's five times faster than what AT&T currently offers in terms of wireless connectivity, AT&T CTO Andre Fuetsch noted at an event in San Francisco, Calif., on Wednesday. However, it doesn't meet the typical standard for 5G, which is supposed to reach 1Gbps. AT&T said it expects to enable theoretical peak speeds of up to 1Gbps in some areas by the end of the year. Additionally, the company announced it's building two new 5G testbeds that will go on-air this spring at the AT&T Labs in Austin. This comes on the heels of the 5G network test AT&T launched at Intel's Austin office last year. The new testbeds will support the 5G trial it's starting for DirecTV NOW customers in Austin, Texas. They include dedicated 5G outdoor and indoor test locations and will feature flexible infrastructure, allowing for updates as 5G standards develop. AT&T announced its 5G developments as part of "Indigo" -- its plan to upgrade and enhance its networks with 5G capabilities, software-defined networking, big data, AI, and improved security. As part of its Indigo rollout, AT&T also announced that its new goal of hitting 55-percent network virtualization by the end of 2017. The company has already converted 34 percent of its network functionality to SDN and is on track to hit 75 percent by 2020. Additionally, AT&T announced that ECOMP, the orchestration platform created to power its software-defined network, will be part of an open source project hosted by the Linux Foundation. Special Feature Next Generation Networks The rising tides of big data, video, and cloud computing are driving tremendous demand for faster and more efficient networks.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Feb 1, 2017 at 1:40PM Shares of Silicon Motion Technology (NASDAQ:SIMO) recently dipped after the SSD controller and specialty RF IC maker's robust fourth quarter growth was overshadowed by soft guidance for the first quarter. The company's fourth quarter revenue rose 47% annually to $144.2 million, beating estimates by $2.5 million. Earnings per ADS surged 73% to $0.95 per share, topping expectations by $0.06. Image source: Getty Images. But for the first quarter, Silicon Motion expects 7% to 14% annual sales growth, which missed the consensus estimate for 20% growth. CEO Wallace Kou attributes that slowdown to tightening supplies of NAND chips, which store data in the company's Shannon and Ferri SSDs. Kou noted that sales of its SSD controllers wouldn't be affected, but the company's broad 2017 sales forecast for flat to 10% growth indicates that its top line growth could be lumpy this year. However, Silicon Motion's soft first quarter guidance is great news for Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), one of the largest NAND suppliers in the world. Let's take a look at why Silicon Motion's pain could generate big gains for Micron this year. What does Micron Technology do? Micron is the fourth largest maker of NAND chips and the third largest maker of mobile DRAM chips in the world. Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) is the top player in both markets. Up until last quarter, Micron's revenues had declined annually for six straight quarters, due to sluggish PC shipments, the commoditization of the smartphone market, and a global glut of NAND and DRAM chips driving down prices. That waning cyclical demand caused Micron stock to plummet from the mid-$30s in late 2014 to less than $10 last May. But there are clear signs that supplies are tightening up and prices are rising. Last August, HP CEO Dion Weisler warned about shortages of memory chips across the industry. In December, Trendforce's DRAMeXchange noted that rising smartphone shipments, higher demand for SSDs, and the increase in the average memory density of eMMCs and eMCPs were all causing a global shortage of chips. The firm estimated that the NAND shortage would cause prices of SSDs and eMMCs to rise "by over 10%" sequentially in the first quarter of 2017 -- which is now reflected in Silicon Motion's first quarter guidance. Investors are already bullish on Micron Silicon Motion's weak guidance shouldn't have surprised investors who were watching the memory chip market. While the confirmation of tightening supplies is a positive development for Micron, investors are likely wondering if that optimism has already been baked in given the stock's 120% rally over the past 12 months. Analysts currently expect Micron's revenue to rise 42% this year, compared to a 23% decline last year. Its non-GAAP earnings are expected to soar from $0.06 last year to $2.42 on stronger sales and pricing power. Based on these estimates, Micron trades at just 9 times forward earnings. But mind the headwinds... However, there are also some major headwinds on the horizon. Samsung, Toshiba, and Western Digital's (NASDAQ:WDC) SanDisk could hurt Micron in the NAND market with their superior scale. Toshiba owns a NAND joint venture with WD, but it could soon sell its stake to WD to offset steep losses at its nuclear power division -- making WD a dangerous foe for Samsung and Micron. Samsung and SK Hynix could apply similar pressure on Micron in the mobile DRAM market. Lastly, Micron has warned that Chinese chipmakers could flood the market with cheap memory chips in the near future. To widen its moat against these rivals, Micron has developed next-gen memory technologies like 3D NAND and 3DXpoint with its longtime partner Intel. It's also acquired smaller memory chipmakers like Inotera Memories to grow its market share. The key takeaway The memory chip market is a notoriously fickle and cyclical one, so investors shouldn't simply assume that tightening demand and rising prices will lift Micron stock to fresh highs. But if Micron can stay ahead of the tech curve and keep growing inorganically, I believe that its shares could keep rising this year.   Leo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The dreams of companies such as Amazon.com Inc. to deliver packages via drone or of mobile-phone companies to check their towers in urban areas with them depends on the Federal Aviation Administration crafting this new rule. The FAA failed to meet a promised deadline of issuing the rules by the end of 2016 as the agency encountered objections from law enforcement. Industry now may face further delay as President Donald Trump put a hold on all new regulations pending a review by the White House. “There was a lot of frustration,” Lisa Ellman, a lawyer at Hogan Lovells US LLP who co-directs the Commercial Drone Alliance, which represents companies including Time Warner Inc.’s CNN cable network. “It’s counter intuitive to think that rules will create economic activity, but in this case it does.” While business groups often oppose regulations because they impose what are seen as costs or burdensome requirements on companies, the drone industry has done the opposite. It broadly supports new regulations from the FAA. Without new regulations to expand how drones can be used, the industry can’t grow and may lose its competitive edge to non-U.S. companies, they argue. FAA Administrator Michael Huerta told a trade show this month that the proposed rule’s release was postponed while officials worked with other agencies over issues related to law enforcement. Currently, almost all drone flights over people’s heads are prohibited because of fears that the craft aren’t reliable enough to ensure that they won’t plummet into crowds and cause injuries. A regulation allowing flights over people is needed before they could be used for a wide range of commercial activities in populated areas. “None of this makes any sense to me,” said Michael Drobac, head of the Washington-based Small UAV Coalition, a drone advocacy group that includes Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Intel Corp. among its members. UAV refers to unmanned aerial vehicle. The FAA plans to release a proposed rule, which would would have given national security and law enforcement agencies a chance to raise their concerns before the rule became final, he said. Drone-advocacy groups have been in contact with officials associated with the Trump administration to urge them to move forward, Drobac and Ellman said. Regulations Welcomed The world’s largest drone manufacturer, China’s SZ DJI Technology Co., believes “new regulations are very welcome,” Brendan Schulman, the company’s vice president for policy and legal affairs in the U.S., said in an interview. While the proposed new regulations aren’t expected to immediately darken the skies with hovering drones, they would lay the ground work for expanded flights by companies like Amazon that are trying to perfect automated unmanned package delivery and other businesses such as utilities and the news media. An advisory panel of drone and aviation industry representatives last year recommended that the FAA adopt a tiered approach to unmanned flights over people. The group suggested creating a category of micro drones weighing no more than about a half pound (250 grams) that could fly near people because they were so light they couldn’t harm anyone. Close Encounters Larger drones would be permitted over people under a variety of arrangements designed to ensure no one could be hurt, such as by setting impact standards, limiting how close they can come to crowds and ensuring reliability, the group recommended. Speaking Jan. 6 at the consumer electronics show CES 2017, the FAA’s Huerta said security issues were chiefly the reason for the rule’s delay. “As drone flights over people become more and more common place, imagine the challenge of a local police officer who is trying to determine which drones are properly there to photograph the festivities and which might be being operated by individuals with more nefarious purposes,” he said. Working with other U.S. agencies to iron out these issues “is taking time,” he said. In addition, meetings with people in the unmanned industry had raised unspecified additional issues that needed ironing out, he said. The FAA is working as quickly as it can to get the rules published, Huerta says. The FAA didn’t respond to requests for further comment this week.

Sometimes, we look for movies on Netflix to make us laugh or to scare us, and other times we just want a captivating story that reflects the real world. Hit films like Caddyshack are great for a laugh-out-loud evening, but movies like Glengarry Glen Ross are a better fit to help inspire someone to sell more (and not to steal from their company). Some of the Netflix titles listed below are documentaries; others are blockbuster hits, and some are movies from yesteryear, but they all center on the business world. The Big Short This film puts a comedic tone on the very true and unfortunate story of the housing bubble collapse during the mid-2000s. This Oscar-winning (Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay) feature is one of the most popular selections on Netflix, and it is regarded as one of the best movies of 2015. The film features an all-star cast of Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Marisa Tomei, Karen Gillan, and Brad Pitt. Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room Corporate corruption has never been showcased more than in this riveting documentary on Netflix. Alex Gibney wrote and directed this film that feels more like a Hollywood feature thanks to some stunning footage and a top notch soundtrack. This movie not only tells the unbelievable story of the former company, but it serves as a warning of what happens when a corporation is built on faulty and fraudulent business tactics. [Image by Magnolia Pictures] Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview If you need the inspiration to innovate, then there may be no better example than the late Steve Jobs. Plenty of high-quality documentaries and movies have been made about the Silicon Valley pioneer, and a couple of them are available on Netflix, but this film is exceptionally special at is it features an hour long interview with the tech icon. The interview took place in 1995, and Jobs candidly discussed his competition with Microsoft, his early life, and what he envisioned for the future. Glengarry Glen Ross Perhaps no film is more appropriate for the business-minded, or for anyone who loves a movie built on dialogue than Glengarry Glen Ross. Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alec Baldwin, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Jonathan Pryce, and Kevin Spacey star in this film based on David Mamet’s Pulitzer Prize-winning play of the same name. It received an impressive score of 94 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, and the site provides the premise for one of the best movies on Netflix. “David Mamet’s award-winning play about a group of desperate real estate agents comes to the big screen from director James Foley. In a role created specifically for the movie, Alec Baldwin appears as a sales motivator, informing the group of hard-luck salesmen that they must compete in a sales contest where the losers will be fired. The agents work their same tired leads, until one hatches a scheme to burglarize the office, steal the leads, and sell them to a rival.” This feature is regarded as one of Jack Lemmon’s greatest performances, and given his amazing and lengthy career, that’s saying a lot, but many feel that Baldwin’s brief appearance stole the show. Older generations will love revisiting this gem, and younger viewers can discover why one should “always—be—closing.” [Image by New Line Cinema] Something Ventured Apple, Intel, Cisco, Google, and several more of the largest companies in the world exist today because of venture capitalism. This riveting documentary highlights the individuals who had the foresight to invest in some of the most innovative ideas. It covers the highs and lows of building companies from the ground up, and it shows the behind-the-scenes drama that occurred within some of the most famous companies.

(Bloomberg)—CCC Information Services Inc., a provider of software for auto-insurance claims, is exploring a sale that may value the company at $3 billion, people with knowledge of the matter said, more than five times what it fetched three years ago. Backers TPG and Leonard Green & Partners are working with an adviser to find a buyer for the Chicago-based company, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. A spokesman for TPG declined to comment. Spokesmen for Leonard Green and CCC didn't respond to e-mails seeking comment. CCC was founded in 1980 by Howard Tullman, the first of a series of startups he would launch before becoming CEO of tech incubator 1871. Tullman, then an attorney, invested $300,000 in CCC, took it public 1983 and sold it for almost $100 million in 1989. Leonard Green agreed to buy CCC from Bahrain-based Investcorp SA in November 2013 in a deal valued at $550 million. The firm then almost immediately sold a 50 percent stake in the company to TPG, with plans to expand in Asia. TPG, which raised $10.5 billion for its seventh buyout fund last year, has been an active acquirer in the software market. The group, led by Bryan Taylor, bought a 51 percent stake in Intel Corp.'s computer-security unit, McAfee, in September, and agreed in December to acquire Mediware Information Systems Inc. from Thoma Bravo. CCC, founded in 1980, also operates the brands DriveFactor and Auto Injury Solutions. The company's client base includes more than 350 insurance companies and more than 22,000 repair facilities, according to its website.... To see the full article, subscribe or log in.

Jack Detsch Staff writer | @JackDetsch February 1, 2017 —The US should retaliate more strongly against Russia for its digital attacks on American political organizations, more than three-quarters of Passcode’s Influencers said. Earlier this month, the US intelligence community released a report that blamed President Vladimir Putin for ordering a campaign of cyberattacks, propaganda, and fake news to undermine public confidence in the democratic process and discredit Hillary Clinton’s campaign. In light of this, Passcode’s group of digital security and privacy experts said President Trump should roundly condemn the hacks – and impose serious consequences. “If the Russians had physically sent agents into the offices of the Democratic National Committee to steal files or into polling stations to stuff ballot boxes, they would have done so certain of consequences if those agents were caught: they’d be imprisoned and probably tried,” said Nate Fick, chief executive officer of Endgame, a cybersecurity company. “Until the US government makes explicitly clear that the full weight of American power is available to respond to hostile cyber adventurism, we can expect the assaults on our institutions to continue.” The Obama administration’s response included economic sanctions, the expulsion of 35 diplomats, the designation of voting systems as critical infrastructure, and strong hints of covert retaliation. Yet some members of Congress criticized Mr. Obama’s response to the hacks – coming six months after suspected Russian breaches into the Democratic National Committee were detected – as too slow. Follow Passcode! Cybersecurity news and analysis delivered straight to your inbox. It’s not yet clear how Mr. Trump plans to deal with the issue. The new commander-in-chief has said he agrees with the intelligence community’s united assessment that Moscow was behind the suspected digital attacks and leaking of confidential emails to the antisecrecy site WikiLeaks, but has so far declined to publicly condemn Russia for its actions. Some Trump advisers have suggested the post-hack sanctions may even have gone too far – though some of Trump’s cabinet choices, such as CIA Director Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary James Mattis, have taken a harder line. Some Influencers are worried that Trump might not act – and are calling on Congress to step in. “Congress should pass bipartisan sanctions against Russia to inflict additional costs and prevent those costs from being easily reversed by the Trump administration,” said Chris Finan, chief executive officer of Manifold Technology. Peter Singer, a senior fellow at New America think tank, sees the next phase as a test for the Republican-controlled government. “The Obama administration’s recent moves to sanction Russia for targeting US democracy were a good start, albeit too little and too late — criticism that the Republican congressional leadership was quick, and right, to make,” Mr. Singer says. “A test of its sincerity will be whether Congress backs its words with action, by turning the sanctions into law and strengthening them further.” For his part, Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus cochair Rep. Jim Langevin (D) of Rhode Island says he supported the Obama administration’s actions – but will advocate in the legislative branch for more action. “I do believe that the actions made public to date are not commensurate with the enormity of the attack on the fundamental underpinnings of our democracy,” Mr. Langevin said. “I will continue to support efforts by the Congress and the new Administration to ensure that Russia does not again threaten our electoral systems.” The US has a variety of tools besides sanctions at its disposal. One Influencer is calling for a “tit-for-tat” response. “There should be a price for their actions, and it should involve doxing powerful Russians connected to the Kremlin so they get the point,” said the expert, calling for a kind of cyberattack ultimately aimed at exposing sensitive information. (Passcode’s Influencers can choose to keep their responses anonymous to preserve their candor.) A lack of a strong public response will only encourage “bolder behavior” from Russia, added Eric Burger, a computer science professor and director of the Center for Secure Communications at Georgetown University. The US arsenal ranges “from hacking back and exposing Botox use all the way through kinetic warfare, with things like sanctions, public shaming, and the like in between,” he adds. The probe into suspected Russian digital interference into US elections isn’t over yet: The House and Senate Intelligence committees are investigating the hack. Even so, Passcode’s experts largely believe that by taking a strong stand now, the US can play an important role in creating rules of the road for cyberspace – or internationally accepted norms of behavior. That process has moved slowly in international bodies such as the United Nations, but experts say a public response to the high-profile hacks could spur some momentum. “Let’s call it what it is: a digital attack on one a foundational element of societal confidence,” said Steve Weber, a professor at the School of Information at the University of California at Berkeley of this summer’s cyberattacks against the DNC and other Democratic political organizations. “Now is the time to set some norms about how states use the internet to create corrosion in the social contract of other states. We shouldn’t wait for norms to ‘evolve’ – we should state clearly what we consider out-of-bounds behaviors, not engage in them ourselves, and punish those who do with serious costs and pain.” However, some experts insist it’s too early to begin talking about further penalties for the suspected Russian digital attacks. A small but vocal 24 percent minority of Influencers said it wasn’t the right time to respond, given a lack of what they said was compelling evidence. “Until we actually see the evidence of Russian political hacking, this entire episode remains unverified.” says Sascha Meinrath, who heads up X-Lab, a Washington-based venture focused on technology policy and innovation. “Anyone promoting retaliation is doing so in ignorance.” While the intelligence community’s declassified report on Russian hacks featured some technical indicators, such as internet protocol addresses, the public evidence did little to satisfy some security researchers. Some of Passcode’s experts think that by retaliating more strongly – or mounting a digital counterattack against Russia – the US could make itself vulnerable by exposing its own digital espionage operations to potential criticism.  “Offensive operations are a critical part of nation-state intelligence,” says Nick Selby, from US cybersecurity firm Secure Ideas. “Feigning outrage at operations results in embarrassing propaganda campaigns in which we must ‘demonstrate’ how awful it all is.” The US intelligence community in its report found that Russian digital interference in global politics could be the “new normal.” With suspected Russian cyberattack campaigns potentially targeting elections in Germany, France, and the Netherlands this year, some Influencers say it’s time to buckle in for the long haul – and focus on defense. “It was inevitable that traditional espionage would evolve to utilize the Internet,” says Scott Montgomery, vice president and chief technical strategist at Intel Security. “The energy spent on ‘retaliation’ would be better served improving defensive posture and training personnel.” What do you think? VOTE in the readers’ version of the Passcode Influencers Poll.

Comments: YES “While not endorsing direct retaliation, the US should and could do more to protect our networks. Constructive policies include creating legal frameworks that protect the important work done by legitimate security researchers and policies that strengthen and facilitate the use of encryption in the public and private sectors. So let’s talk about how we ‘protect’ against political hacking so we don’t have to ‘retaliate’ against it.” – Abigail Slater, Internet Association “But only if it is part of a cohesive approach to all nation states. The Russian hacks are important, but should not divert us from the bigger picture. For example, China has waged a largely unanswered cyber offensive against our country that has caused significant economic harm and damaged our national security. In terms of cyber damage, China makes Russia look like amateurs. We need a comprehensive approach, and we needed it yesterday.” – Jenny Durkan, Quinn Emanuel “And we should not confine our response to the digital domain.” – Influencer “I caution the US against CyberSaberRattling. Things can escalate very quickly in cyberconflict and spill into physical domains. The US often forgets we are the most connected nation and therefore stand the most to lose. We have too much indefensible [information technology] which can affect free and democratic elections – and even public safety and critical infrastructure. We need to either be ‘less dependent’ and/or ‘more defensible.’” – Joshua Corman, Atlantic Council “Those who trafficked in US election tampering must be held accountable and dissuaded from considering a repeat offense.” – JJ Thompson, Rook Security “It needs to be part of a larger coherent strategy that addresses Russia’s broad non-kinetic campaign that includes attacks on the Ukraine and others. They are incrementally executing a high level strategy that is integrated and patient.” – Influencer “Congress should pass bipartisan sanctions against Russia to inflict additional costs and prevent those costs from being easily reversed by the Trump administration.” – Chris Finan, Manifold Technology “[The] Obama administration response to the foreign interference in our election can only be characterized as ‘too little, too late.’ The response did nothing to get the Russians to stop the leaks during the election and will do even less in deterring future activities. The President and his team abrogated their responsibility to protect the integrity of the election process.” – Influencer “Last month’s Russia sanctions and related activities were an important first step, but were only a first step - we’re going to need to do more if we want to deter further Russian interference. In addition to deterrence, this experience should be a catalyst to drive an expanded focus on security solutions not just for large organizations, but also for smaller organizations (like the DNC) that today often cannot afford the type of security that they need.” – Nathaniel Gleicher, Illumio “First of all, no response encourages further, bolder behavior. Second, remember the U.S. has a full arsenal of options to respond, ranging from hacking back and exposing Botox use all the way through kinetic warfare, with things like sanctions, public shaming, and the like in between.” – Eric Burger, Georgetown University “We first need better clarity around attribution to the Russian government. There could certainly be classified information from [human intelligence] or other sources that the US government can’t expose, but based on public information, there just isn’t enough to definitively draw a conclusion. If the US government is certain based on other evidence, we need to take a tougher stance. At a minimum, we need to be proactive about locking down our political apparatus to avoid a similar breach, regardless of the actor, in the future.” – Jay Kaplan, Synack “Materially strengthening existing economic sanctions is in order. Under no circumstances should existing sanctions be lifted.” – Influencer “But it should have come when the initial sanctions were announced, which came too late after the attribution.” – Adam Segal, Council on Foreign Relations “And the Intelligence Community should keep it’s [darn] mouth shut about what exactly it is we are doing.” – Influencer “The Chinese found our sanctions somewhat underwhelming, indicating they don’t have a deterrent effect.” – Dave Aitel, Immunity “The United States should also have responded earlier in 2016, rather than at the tail end of the Obama Administration.” – Influencer “Our current lack of deterrence effectively condones the exploitation of computer systems in government and critical private sector enterprises.” – Amit Yoran, Tenable Network Security  “The US should act based on the facts provided from the intelligence.” – Influencer “The full scope of actions are still unknown, but meddling in our democratic process should not be taken lightly.” – Joel de la Garza, Box “Tit for tat. There should be a price for their actions, and it should involve doxing powerful Russian’s connected to the Kremlin so they get the point. MAD.” – Influencer “Our response to Russia’s political hacking has an audience far beyond the walls of the Kremlin. It’s important to signal to other cyber aggressors on the international level that we hold sacred the integrity of our domestic elections at all levels of government.” – Dave Weinstein, State of New Jersey “US has not, at least publicly, shown enough power and ability in cyberspace operations to act as a deterrent.” – Influencer “I strongly supported the Obama administration’s response to the information warfare operations targeting faith in the US elections. In particular, the announced actions span a range of domains including diplomatic, economic, and cybersecurity effects. Using a comprehensive approach to counter these unprecedented attacks is a vital step in norm building and puts the world on notice that when they attack US interests in cyberspace, we will respond. That said, I do believe that the actions made public to date are not commensurate with the enormity of the attack on the fundamental underpinnings of our democracy. I will continue to support efforts by the Congress and the new administration to ensure that Russia does not again threaten our electoral systems.” – Rep. Jim Langevin (D) of Rhode Island “Beginning with voting machines, a thorough audit needs to be conducted, and a time machine needs to be invented to travel back and set up a paper audit trail to verify the results. The US intelligence community has a rare general consensus that Russian hacking of the US election occurred. We need to start by believing them and preparing to create public-facing evidence for the future.” – Influencer “I am in favor of return fire for any and all. If there is any implication in the question that somehow this episode was the worst, then I reject the question and change my answer.  What we are seeing is the weaponization of the data dump and nothing more since, after all, there was nothing fabricated in the DNC e-mails if you want to get down to that level. All in all, the episode means exactly two things: (1) do not put so [darned] much data online and (2) never let data dumps go unpunished even if there is collateral damage in the process or if the perpetrator wraps him or herself in a greater good.” – Dan Geer, In-Q-Tel “Bullies only back down when they get punched in the nose.” – Influencer NO “It was inevitable that traditional espionage would evolve to utilize the internet. The energy spent on ‘retaliation’ would be better served improving defensive posture and training personnel.” – Scott Montgomery, Intel Security “Based upon the lack of verifiable evidence that can differentiate between state and non-state actors, the US [government] should refrain from any action that could be seen as an escalation.” – Jeffrey Carr, Taia Global “How can you retaliate against an entity consisting of unwilling victims who unknowingly shuffle attack traffic, launched by a mob of patriotic actors, and directed by a nebulous Russian entity?” – Günter Ollmann, Ablative Security LLC “Retaliation isn’t a constructive approach, but deterrence is an important capability in any consideration of ways to minimize this sort of activity. We should remember that there were reports of a different foreign nation-state fostering hacks into U.S. political organizations in the 2008-2010 timeframe. We’re not hearing as much noise about those for one reason - the actor didn’t seem to leak their findings. I’m actually less comfortable with that than a case where the actor chooses to at least let us know in a material way some of what they have obtained illicitly. Whether one chooses to view this as an actual new domain for conflict or not, it is not an area in which to operate precipitously or lightly. We have reached a point where proliferation of capabilities is a real concern, and setting an example for measured investigation, attribution, and response is a worthwhile idea.” – Robert Stratton, security entrepreneur, investor, and consultant “This isn’t as simple as a yes/no question. Should they do more? Perhaps. Are we doing more? Quite likely. Will we or should we know about it? Not necessarily.” – Influencer “At the end of the day, hacks are going to continue to happen. Organizations will continue to be infiltrated, no matter what the retaliation strategy. Organizations need to arm themselves with the best tools of defense - which secure the network from the inside out, can genuinely self-learn what’s ‘normal’ for a network, and spot anomalies at their nascent stages. While there is no silver bullet to security, it is the only chance we have to stay on top of an ever-evolving threat landscape that is growing in sophistication.” – Influencer What do you think? VOTE in the readers’ version of the Passcode Influencers Poll.

By Jack Wallen | February 1, 2017, 8:06 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStock Many data centers rely on virtual machines (VMs). In some cases, those VMs are powered by the popular and free VirtualBox. VirtualBox admins enjoy a lot of flexibility, but what about performance? Follow these tips to help your VMs boost the performance of your guests. Data Center Must-Reads Microsoft's Brexit warning: We could halt UK datacenter expansion if tariffs are too high IBM offers the only cloud secure enough for the US Army Inside Amazon's clickworker platform: How half a million people are being paid pennies to train AI (PDF download) Subscribe to our Data Center Trends newsletter 1: Use fixed size disks Generally speaking, when we allot storage space for our VMs, we stick with the default dynamically allocated disk types. This makes sense, especially when you are limited in space and aren't certain how much space you'll need for your VM. However, the dynamically allocated disk is not nearly as efficient as the fixed disk. Why? Because as you use space on a dynamically allocated virtual hard disk, VirtualBox must accommodate and adjust the VM's storage space, which causes the performance to take a hit. Instead of using dynamic disks, opt for fixed disks (Figure A) and give the disk plenty of space. Note about this: The performance increase will be significant when used with spinning hard drives and less so with solid state drives. Figure A Creating a fixed size disk for a VM. 2: Allocate RAM and CPUs wisely When creating a new VM, your inclination might be to bump up the RAM used to ensure a smooth running guest. Although that will work in some cases, there might be instances where more processors would be advantageous over a significant amount of RAM. If you're setting up a VM for a server that demands heavy processor use, your best bet is to up the amount of CPUs VirtualBox will hand over to the VM. With the VM powered down, you can do this in Settings | System for the VM by sliding the Processor(s) slider to the right to increase the CPUs (Figure B). Figure B Increasing the CPUs for a VM. When you commit resources for the guests, do not overextend your RAM and CPUs in such a way that you leave the host grinding to a halt. Your host machine should have at least 1 GB of RAM and plenty of CPUs remaining so the host OS and VirtualBox can function smoothly. 3: Install the Guest Additions You should consider installing the VirtualBox Guest Additions a must for every VM you create. The Guest Additions are additional device drivers and system applications, installed on the guest machines, that optimize the guest operating system for better performance and usability. How you install the Guest Additions will depend upon what operating system is running the Guest, and if you're using VirtualBox with a GUI desktop or a console-only server. If you're installing with a GUI, start the VM and, once it is up and running, click Devices | Insert Guest Additions CD Image (Figure C) and walk through the presented steps. Figure C Installing the Guest Additions on a Ubuntu GNOME guest. 4: For Windows guests, use the Intel PRO/1000 network drivers If you're running Windows guests, to get the most out of networking, be sure to select the Intel PRO/1000 network driver in Settings | Network | Advanced (Figure D). You have a choice between Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop and Intel PRO/1000 Server—choose accordingly based on your needs. Figure D Selecting the proper networking adapter will increase your VM performance. 5: Use video memory wisely If you're working with a Desktop VM, you don't need to give that VM more than 128MB of vRAM. Conversely, do not waste your vRAM on a GUI-less server, as they will function fine with 9MB of vRAM. You can set this option in Settings | Display | Screen (Figure E). Figure E Setting the vRAM for a desktop or server can increase performance for either the guest or host. Running smoothly Your VirtualBox VMs should now be running smoothly and reliably. It doesn't take much to achieve this bump in performance, as long as you work wisely and use care when creating or configuring your VMs. For more networking tips and tricks, subscribe to our Data Center Trends newsletter.

A person at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, watches a documentary in a virtual reality headset. AMD, which has a presence in Central Florida, had a strong quarter in its virtual reality processor business. (VALERIE MACON / AFP/Getty Images) Marco SantanaContact Reporter The roller coaster that is AMD’s stock price surged again Wednesday morning as it reached levels it hasn’t seen in more than nine years. By 11 a.m., the stock sat at $11.60 per share, up more than 10 percent from its closing price Tuesday of $10.37. An earnings report Tuesday showed a net loss of $51 million for the company but President and CEO Lisa Su said the company plans to release two new processors this quarter. AMD has been battling two rivals to build processors that power some of the world’s more-advanced technology, including virtual reality and artificial intelligence. Its Ryzen computer processor should be available in March. “We remain on track to launch Ryzen in early March, with widespread system and channel availability expected on Day 1,” Su said, according to a transcript of the earnings call. AMD, which employs roughly 200 in Central Florida, has been steeped in a battle for control of the microprocessor market with Intel and Nvidia. It’s been a decades-long battle that has been recently dominated by Intel, which in November held roughly 71 percent of the market share. AMD held 13 percent of the market and Nvidia 16 percent in November. At that point, the company was trading in the $8.50 to $8.75 range. “We have been on a fairly deliberate path to ensure that we got to a very competitive roadmap,” Su said.

You can get our headlines via email as well, or follow us on Twitter. The annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) show saw all kinds of new and freaky gadgets, from smart hairbrushes to automated toasters. Not everyone needs them of course, but this kind of out-the-box thinking is what drives innovation. The 50th annual convention didn’t disappoint the tech aficionados gathered to preview the best and biggest trends this year, and it didn’t disappoint real estate professionals either – what follows are three trends from CES 2017 that are likely to impact commercial real estate in the months and years to come. AI assistants Artificial Intelligence was king at CES 2017, with Amazon’s Alexa leading the way by popping up in all kinds of smart cars, refrigerators, televisions, phones, lamps and more. Google was there too, with its own AI embedded into Smart TVs and Google’s Home speaker, among others. For real estate, the AI invasion is only just beginning. The technology has great applications for the industry, including analytics, scheduling applications, chatbots, enhanced CRM platforms, and of course, enabling smarter buildings. AI is going to be everywhere in the next few years, controlling everything, and will probably become a must-have feature for modern commercial spaces. VR & AR Virtual reality and augmented reality are catching on fast, and devices are getting cheaper. At CES we saw headsets like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 going wireless, while Intel’s Project Alloy headset lets users view real world objects in a virtual world for the first time. Microsoft was there too with its Hololens, which demonstrated holograms superimposed over the real world. For real estate VR and AR have an obvious application, allowing prospective buyers to explore as yet unfinished spaces, or view a virtually staged property. Internet of Things IoT is booming in real estate now, just as it is all over the world. The technology is most useful for enhancing energy efficiency inside buildings – IoT gadgets exist to monitor the temperature and humidity, and occupancy of a building. It also helps to control and adjust the automated lighting, lock the doors and many more applications. Some future products that could apply to commercial real estate range from ceiling tiles that wirelessly charge electronic devices within range to smart radiator valves. Imagine asking a mirror what time it is and the weather conditions outside, or using a small drone to take a real-time virtual tour of a space.

How a Trade War Could Affect Your Portfolio By John Persinos on February 1, 2017 Just login with your email address to instantly generate a PDF of this content. Privacy Policy Worried about a trade war? Well, here’s at least one bit of encouraging news: Scottish-made haggis may soon come to a table near you. President Trump wants to lift the trade ban on British meat that’s been in effect since the “Mad Cow” epidemic in Britain in 1986 — and haggis makers in Scotland are thrilled. In case you don’t know, the Scottish delicacy of haggis is comprised of sheep offal (heart, liver and lungs) stuffed inside the animal’s intestine. Trump, whose mother was born in Scotland and who operates a golf course there, reportedly promised the Scots that he would lift the meat ban. For other industries, though, the situation is less upbeat. President Trump threatened last Thursday to slap a 20% tax on imports from Mexico to help pay for his promised border wall, an announcement that triggered anxiety on Wall Street, punished U.S. stocks, and caused Mexico’s president to cancel his planned trip to the United States. Trump also has threatened to punish China for supposed trade violations by imposing a 45% tariff on Chinese imports. What’s it all mean for your portfolio? Let’s turn for insights to Jim Pearce, chief investment strategist of Personal Finance and Director of Portfolio Strategy for Investing Daily. The Art of (Trade) War… Jim Pearce accurately predicted that Trump’s first order of business would be to shelve the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Signing the executive order against TPP was easy. But as Jim explains, now comes the tough part: “The difficulty comes from replacing it with something Congress and our Asian trading partners can all agree on, a feat that will require extraordinary tact and diplomatic finesse. Because this will be the first time these nations will negotiate with our new president, they will want to set terms that they can live with for at least the next four years. For that reason, I don’t expect to see the trade pact replaced with a new deal this year. The upshot will be a disruption in trade, with large multinational consumer goods manufacturers and many information technology companies hurt the most. To placate these businesses, many of which currently hold large sums of cash overseas to avoid U.S. taxes, Trump will dangle tax reform as a carrot… If a tech trade war between China and the United States materializes, the Chinese already have a ready stable of Asian vendors to ply its markets with almost all the hardware it needs…” Who wins, who loses? Trump has pressured U.S.-based companies to keep and create jobs in this country and has lambasted via tweets several American businesses that have operations abroad. Some analysts warn that if a trade war erupts, no one wins and you should dump stocks altogether. We wouldn’t go that far. But keep in mind, particularly at risk would be U.S.-based multinationals with extensive operations and revenue sources in China and Mexico. The most serious ramifications would occur in the world’s second-largest economy, China. Topping this list of vulnerable global players are familiar Big Pharma names such as Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), Merck (NYSE: MRK) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ). Probably the worst affected stock would be Chicago-based aerospace/defense giant Boeing (NYSE: BA), the largest manufacturer of aircraft in the world and America’s number one exporter. If Trump slaps China with high tariffs for “unfair” subsidies and trading practices, China would almost certainly retaliate and give its substantial aircraft business to Boeing arch-rival Airbus Group (OTC: EADSY). Of course, other companies would suffer as well — and many of them are blue chip stocks popular in retirement portfolios. Caught in a trade war crossfire would be sales of aircraft jet engines made by General Electric (NYSE: GE); autos made by General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Ford (NYSE: F); iPhones and laptops made by Apple (NSDQ: AAPL); soybeans and corn grown by Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE: ADM); and consumer products made by Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) and Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE: CL). Just to name a few. However, Trump intends to offset the pain of trade restrictions by granting global corporations significant tax cuts on cash hoards that are repatriated from overseas. That would be a boon for a few of the aforementioned companies, specifically General Electric, Apple and Pfizer, as well as IBM (NYSE: IBM), Microsoft (NYSE: MSFT) and Intel (NSDQ: INTC). Lower taxes on repatriated cash would especially benefit Silicon Valley, because deep-pocketed technology giants probably would use the proceeds to launch a wave of acquisitions, which in turn would stimulate innovation and job creation. As you can see, sorting out the winners and losers of a trade war isn’t so simple. For now, sit tight and don’t make any impulsive moves based on fear. Our investment strategists are monitoring these fast-moving developments; continue following their advice. We’ll provide guidance as events warrant. In the meantime, who knows? Perhaps haggis will one day show up on the White House menu. Got any questions about how a trade war could affect your investments?

 Apple is spending billions on secret R&D projects — and it keeps spending more Kif Leswing Feb. 1, 2017, 10:49 AM 9,543 facebook linkedin twitter email print REUTERS/Robert Galbraith Apple revealed on Tuesday that it continues to invest increasingly more money on research and development. Apple spent $2.8 billion on R&D last quarter. That's up from $2.4 billion a year ago. In total, Apple spent $10.39 billion on R&D in 2016 — its highest annual spend ever. Last year, as Apple's overall revenue was dropping, it seemed as if Apple might cut back on R&D spending. Reports about Apple refocusing Project Titan, its electric self-driving car project, also suggested that perhaps the company would cut back on R&D spending. But this recent quarter dispelled that notion — Apple may even be accelerating its R&D spending.  Take a look at these charts:  BI Intelligence BI Intelligence This doesn't mean that Apple is one of the biggest R&D companies in the tech industry. As a percentage of revenue, Apple's R&D spending lags behind companies like Facebook, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Qualcomm, and Intel.  Apple also spent more on stock buybacks in 2016 than it did on research and development.  It's undeniable, however, that Apple continues to spend more money on research and development as it looks for a new product to compliment the iPhone as its main growth engine.  Here's what Apple could be spending its R&D money on:  The long-rumored Apple Car. Although reports suggest that Apple is focusing on self-driving software instead of a full electric car, it still has hundreds of employees working on the project.  Something in augmented reality, technology that integrates computer graphics and the internet into the real world. AR is a key focus for Apple and the company is working on a pair of AR glasses. Something in the medical world — perhaps a new way to communicate with doctors or improvements to the health functions on the Apple Watch.  Chips. One of Apple's key strengths is its chip designers, and it recently opened a R&D center in Israel focusing on chips. It frequently patents new techniques for manufacturing chips.  In fact, Apple has recently opened or announced plans to open R&D centers in Japan, China, Indonesia, France, Japan, Sweden, and the UK. Keeping the lights on in those facilities and paying employees can add up.  Last year, Apple CEO Tim Cook was asked about the increase in R&D spending. He said: "The products that are in R&D, there is quite a bit of investment in there for products and services that are not currently shipping or derivations of what is currently shipping. So I don’t want to talk about the exact split of it, but you can look at the growth rate and conclude that there’s a lot of stuff that we’re doing beyond the current products.” Apple's reluctance to spend a ton on R&D goes all the way back to founder Steve Jobs. "Innovation has nothing to do with how many R&D dollars you have," he said in 1998.  BI Intelligence BI Intelligence SEE ALSO: There's a bull case for Apple — but the company won't tell you about it More: Apple R&D facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru Apple is spending billions on secret R&D projects — and it keeps spending more Apple is spending billions on secret R&D projects — and it keeps spending more Apple revealed on Tuesday that it...

(AP Photo) Share Written by Roger Melko Computational quantum condensed-matter physicist Obsession Machines with Brains February 01, 2017 I work in computational quantum condensed-matter physics: the study of matter, materials, and artificial quantum systems. Complex problems are our thing. Researchers in our field are working on hyper-powerful batteries, perfectly efficient power transmission, and ultra-strong materials—all important stuff to making the future a better place. To create these concepts, condensed-matter physics deals with the most complex concept in nature: the quantum wavefunction of a many-particle system. Think of the most complex thing you know, and this blows it out of the water: A computer that models the electron wavefunction of a nanometer-size chunk of dust would require a hard drive containing more magnetic bits than there are atoms in the universe. I started thinking about how machine learning and artificial intelligence could help our field when Google DeepMind defeated world champion Lee Sedol in the ancient game of Go. Many computer scientists would tell you that this achievement—comparable to the historic chess match between Deep Blue and Garry Kasparov in 1997—happened years ahead of predictions. But chess is a relatively simple game; it can be “beaten” by algorithms specifically designed to search for the best outcome based on a given move by an opponent. In contrast, the complexity of Go is many orders of magnitude greater. So complex, in fact, that scientists and engineers were unsure it was technologically possible to produce hardware powerful enough to solve Go. Machine learning is the modern version of the “give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime” parable. Instead of hard-coding programs for a specific singular task, we can now teach machines to learn and adapt themselves for different tasks at hand. This advance in programming philosophy makes a computer capable of beating a human at Go, but compared to the future advances, these achievements are still child’s play.  One small breakthrough in condensed-matter physics could change everything. One small breakthrough in condensed-matter physics could change everything. Complexity, and the challenge of tackling complex problems with existing technology, is what keeps me up at night. The most complex problem is understanding the wavefunction of a many-particle quantum system with sufficient accuracy to design new quantum materials and devices. When DeepMind beat Sedol, I began to wonder: Could machine learning help us solve the most complex problem in physics? The most complex problem in physics could be solved by machines with brains. One of the most exciting things we are working towards creating is the first true quantum computer, which will harness the unique properties of the quantum world to process information. Quantum computers are expected to drastically outperform their classical counterparts on certain difficult problems, such breaking encryption protocols. This level of theoretical understanding could eventually lead to major advances in medicine, cybersecurity, communications, and more. We’re getting ahead of ourselves though, as we don’t yet have a quantum computer; physicists don’t even agree on the construction material to build one. There will be countless scientific and engineering dead-ends, innovations, and breakthroughs before we have any chance of building an artificial quantum brain. But, just as today’s giants of Silicon Valley use machine learning in many aspects of chip manufacturing, machine learning will be an integral part of the inevitable scientific and industrial processes leading to a quantum computer. So just how will machine learning be able to help us solve some of the biggest problems in physics? Researchers are already re-purposing existing machine-learning algorithms to “learn” features of phases of matter, just as algorithms learn to recognize features in a photograph. With this knowledge, we can adapt them to handle other complex problems arising in condensed matter, especially in cases where quantum mechanics plays a role. To condensed-matter physicists, solving these notorious complex problems is a holy grail, on par with beating a human at a game of Go. From this understanding could spring the theoretical breakthrough needed for designing a new superconductor, or a replacement for silicon, or a quantum bit—the applications of which could spark technological revolutions.  Progress requires people willing to step outside the confines of their subfields in search of unifying principles. And we’re on our way. In August 2016, I organized a conference at Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Ontario, which aimed to explore the potential of machine learning in quantum research. Perimeter Institute is built on the idea that breakthroughs happen at the intersections between fields, and our conference epitomized this idea. Attendees included researchers from academia, industry giants like Google and Intel, Silicon Valley start-ups, and government organizations. It was a challenging week spent debating ideas, finding common ground, and defining what we hope will become a richly rewarding field. The experience reminded me of the well-worn story of the transistor, which was the technology that started the computer revolution (and won a Nobel Prize). Transistors were invented at Bell Labs nearly 70 years ago by a theoretical physicist, an experimentalist, and an industrialist. This breakthrough would never have been possible without people from very different backgrounds working together. As physicists, computer scientists, and AI researchers, we’re still searching for what unifies us; many physicists, myself among them, are excited by the possibilities of combining disruptive software technology (machine learning) with potentially disruptive hardware technology (quantum computers). But we all agree that the cross-fertilization of ideas more often than not seeds breakthroughs. Progress requires people willing to step outside the confines of their subfields in search of unifying principles. For now, machine minds can be great at chess and even Go, but these are just the beginnings of a much larger revolution. What we’re seeing now shows that machine learning has the power to advance science, technology, and society in profound ways. You can follow Roger on Twitter at @rgmelko.

Disney Ends Animation Anti-Poaching Suit With $100M Deal by Dominic Patten February 1, 2017 7:53am 0 Business Breaking News Legal Disney DreamWorks Animation Sony Pictures Animation With DreamWorks Animation, Fox’s Blue Sky Studios, Sony Imageworks and Sony Pictures Animation all having come to multi-million dollar settlements with animation workers in the over two-year class action suit over wage-fixing and anti-poaching allegations, it was all down to Disney. While the House of Mouse is infamous for almost never settling lawsuits, last night proved the exception as The Walt Disney Company, Pixar, Lucasfilm and Two PIC MC filed paperwork to offer a $100 million deal to end the legal action. Related Disney Spins Out New & Final 'Beauty And The Beast “The Court should preliminarily approve the proposed settlement as fair, reasonable, and adequate because it provides for the class a cash payment of $100,000,000,” says a notice of motion filed on the media giant’s behalf on Tuesday evening in federal court (read it here). “That amount is approximately 33.5 percent of plaintiffs’ expert’s calculation of the damages attributable to Disney Defendant employees in the certified class based on plaintiffs’ November 16, 2016 merits expert report on damages.” With a hearing earlier this month on DWA’s $50 million settlement of last October in the case moving things forward on that front, the Disney gang want a March 9 meeting with Judge Lucy Koh on their proposal. There were no specifics in the motion on January 31 of how much the lawyers would get out of this settlement but they won’t be getting dough off the top. “The settlement requires payment of attorneys’ fees solely out of the Settlement Fund,” says the paperwork from a team of the trio of firms for the plaintiffs. Yesterday’s move by Disney comes after years of fighting the action that started when ex-DWA visual effects artist Robert Nitsch Jr. first filed his case on September 8, 2014. The animation studios involvement in this antitrust behavior was born out of another anti-poaching case  – the Judge Koh overseen and now settled $415 million Department of Justice investigation into tech companies Apple, Google, Intel, Adobe and Intuit. Those big boys all had an agreement to not snare each others employees and to keep what people were paid at a certain agreed upon rate – which is what the ‘toon studios did too. At one point, all looked lost for the animation workers when the matter was tossed in April 2015 – but it was revived not long afterwards. It was only after suffering some serious legal losses that looked to tip the balance in favor of original plaintiffs Nitsch, David Wentworth and Georgia Cano  that the ‘toon studio wall broke with Fox’s Blue Sky Studios becoming the first defendant to back down on March 31 last year and reach a nearly $6 million settlement in the potentially sprawling case aSony Pictures Imageworks Inc. and Sony Pictures Animation Inc. followed next in early may 2016 when they came to a $13 million settlement with the plaintiffs. The now NBCUniversal owned DWA offered up its deal last fall, putting Disney alone on the hook for what could have been a messy court case. Now it’s all over but the fine print – hopefully. Daniel A. Small of DC’s Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll PLLC; Steve Berman of Seattle’s Hagens Berman Sobel Shapiro LLP; and Marc Seltzer of LA’s Susman Godfrey LLP are the main lawyers for Wentworth, Nitsch and Cano in the case.

Hyundai Hyundai's 2017 Super Bowl ad is a break from the usual: they are filming this year's spot after kickoff. (Photo: Hyundai) When Hyundai Motor America told the NFL about the concept for its Super Bowl ad, it told the league the best moments at this year’s game would happen off the field. “Believe me, that wasn’t an easy comment to make to the NFL,” says Eric Springer, chief creative officer of the ad agency Innocean USA. “It caused them to go back on their heels until they heard the idea. And then they said: ‘Yeah, it makes total sense.’” Hyundai is throwing a Super Bowl party for a battalion at a U.S. military installation at an undisclosed location overseas, with big TV screens and all the fixings. Three soldiers selected by the military will experience the game in individual 360-degree immersive pods that will make them feel as if they are in a luxury box at NRG Stadium. And the 90-second commercial will be filmed beginning after kickoff — and then air in the post-gun slot just after the game ends. AD METER: Vote on all the Super Bowl ads!  “The moment will happen in the hearts of those who make the Super Bowl possible — our troops,” Springer says. An ad that normally gestates over 13 to 18 weeks will come to fruition in about an hour and 15 minutes so that it can be filmed and edited — and approved by the military, the NFL and FOX — in time to air after the confetti flies. “This is not a stunt,” Springer says. “It’s in the soul of the brand.” Hyundai won USA TODAY’s Ad Meter last year for best ad in the Super Bowl, as selected by consumer vote. The next day, Hyundai’s creative team began working on this year’s ad. (It’s not eligible for Ad Meter this time; ads that air between the coin toss and the two-minute warning are eligible.) Last year’s winning ad played to big laughs with Kevin Hart as a dad handing over the keys to his new Hyundai Genesis to a young man taking Hart’s TV daughter on a first date. “How do you make people laugh with your brand?” says Dean Evans, Hyundai’s chief marketing officer. “That’s what we really pulled off. And what you can see from the onslaught of what’s happening this year, there’s a lot of comedy, a lot of comedians, a lot of celebrities — a lot of the formula we used last year — across the table. So I’m really glad that we’re zagging this year while everyone is zigging.” Springer says the concept was born long before anyone knew how deeply divided the country would be today, but he says Hyundai is happy to have a commercial that can be enjoyed by all sides of the nation’s political divide. Hollywood director Peter Berg (Friday Night Lights and Lone Survivor) is directing the commercial on the fly and says the project combines his greatest passions — football and the military. “You have to come to the game and make people either laugh or cry,” Evans says. “You really have to entertain them. They really expect, more than ever before, to be moved.” VIDEOS: Super Bowl ads released thus far CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Honda | 1:00 Yearbook photos of celebrities such as Steve Carell, Tina Fey, and Magic Johnson come to life in this ad, a celebration of the 20th birthday of the Honda CR-V. 1 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: T-Mobile | 1:00 Justin Bieber, Rob Gronkowski, and Terrell Owens take us through the history of the touchdown dance. 2 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Bud Light | 1:31 Bud Light Icon Spuds MacKenzie returns in the new Super Bowl Ad as a man's best friend to show that it was never about the parties, but friendships made along the way. 3 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Top Games | 0:30 Actors Aaron Eckhart, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, and Fan Bingbing star in "The Battle of Evony" a short movie promoting the mobile game Evony: The King’s Return. 4 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Audi | 1:00 Audi's Super Bowl ad, featuring a man watching her daughter win on the race track, advocates for equal pay. 5 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Sprint | 0:30 A man fakes his own death to get out of his Verizon contract before being convinced to switch to Sprint. 6 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Nintendo | 0:30 Nintendo introduces the new Switch console with clips from the game The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. 7 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Wonderful Pistachios | 0:15 Ernie the Elephant, voiced by WWE star John Cena, discovers the benefits of Wonderful Pistachios. 8 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Ford | 1:43 Narrated by actor Bryan Cranston, Ford's Super Bowl LI ad focuses on the automaker's future plans. 9 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Squarespace | 0:30 Actor John Malkovich struggles to secure the domain name JohnMalkovich.com in Squarespace's new ad. 10 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: King's Hawaiian | 0:30 A man trying to stash away his King's Hawaiian rolls chooses a hiding place that isn't as secret as he thinks it is. 11 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: LIFEWTR | 0:30 John Legend and PepsiCo's new LIFEWTR bottled water brings color to a drab world. 12 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Kia | 0:00 With the help of the new hybrid Kia Niro, actress Melissa McCarthy saves the world.

If so, you’re among the almost two-and-a-half million viewers who have seen it on YouTube alone. The 60-second spot encapsulates the story of company co-founder, Adolphus Busch, who immigrated from Germany to the United States in 1857. The ad comes at a time when there is political upheaval about new travel bans that restrict immigrants from certain countries, provoking multiple lawsuits from several states that challenge the executive order. The advertisement is certainly poignant, with images of Busch’s dangerous journey by sea, being told to go back home by locals, and traveling with an African American who represents freedom after the Civil War, all the while planning his brewing company that would eventually become Anheuser-Busch. This year’s Super Bowl ads cost a whopping $5 million per 30-second spot, with companies such as Intel, Mobile Strike, Skittles, Snickers and TurboTax already releasing their expensive interstitials or teasers before the event. On YouTube, the Budweiser commercial can be viewed in HD resolutions of 720p (HD) or 1080p (Full HD) depending on internet bandwidth and preferences. Check it out below.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending Buying Guides MWC 2017 LG G6 Samsung Galaxy S8 iPhone 8 Nintendo Switch iOS 10.2 News Best unlocked smartphones in the US Best unlocked smartphones in the US By Lewis Leong Mobile phones   These SIM-free phones can be used with no contract Shares Buying an unlocked smartphone in the US can be a smart move, whether you want to travel the globe or simply don’t want to be tied to a single carrier like AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile or Sprint. You’ll be able to swap in SIM cards between various carriers and use the phone anywhere in the world. Say goodbye to expensive roaming charges. However, there are a few drawbacks with these no contract, unlocked phones. They’re typically expensive since you don’t sign up for a normal two-year contract. You're no longer subsidizing the full price of the phone (no, it doesn't really cost $199), so the upfront cost will be much higher.  There's a second caveat: most SIM-free unlocked phones support only GSM networks like AT&T and T-Mobile. There are only a few CDMA-capable unlocked phones that can also connect to Verizon and Sprint, and we’ll cover those notable exceptions in our comprehensive list. If you want the freedom of buying a new phone without a contract that binds you to one carrier and one country, these are the best unlocked smartphones you can buy in the US today. 13. HTC 10 Not 10/10, but the best phone for music by far Carriers: AT&T, T-Mobile, other GSM networks | Weight: 161g | Dimensions: 145.9 x 71.9 x 9 mm | OS: Android Nougat | Screen size: 5.2-inch | Resolution: 1440 x 2560 | CPU: Snapdragon 820 | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 32GB/64GB | Battery: 3,000mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 5MP Excellent audio quality Fantastic design Camera isn't impressive Speakers aren't stellar If you’re a music lover, you’re going to love the HTC 10. This Android smartphone is capable of playing back Hi-Res audio with its 24-bit DAC. This means the HTC 10 is capable of playing back music like it was supposed to sound in the recording studio.  HTC didn’t skimp on video and image quality either. The HTC 10’s 5.2-inch 2K display features gorgeous colors and is high enough resolution to enjoy VR on the go. Combined with the powerful Snapdragon 820 processor and 4GB of RAM, the HTC 10 should fly through any task you throw at it. The HTC 10 is also extremely well built with an all aluminum unibody design. HTC nails the look and feel of the device as the phone features a subtle curve to make comfortable in the hand. Will it work for me? Unlocked, the HTC 10 supports GSM networks like AT&T, T-Mobile and MetroPCS. There are two separate CDMA-capable versions for Verizon and Sprint, but they’re locked to their respective networks even if you buy them at full price through Best Buy or their respective carrier stores. Check out the full list of supported carriers before buying. Read the full review: HTC 10 12. OnePlus 3T A genuine flagship killer Carriers: AT&T, T-Mobile, other GSM networks | Weight: 158g | Dimensions: 152.7 x 74.7 x 7.4 mm | OS: Android Nougat | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1080 x 1920 | CPU: Snapdragon 821 | RAM: 6GB | Storage: 64GB/128GB | Battery: 3,400mAh | Rear camera: 16MP | Front camera: 16MP Premium design Dash charging Mediocre camera No waterproofing A flagship killer for $440? The OnePlus 3T offers tremendous value for the money when comparing performance to flagship phones that cost twice as much. OnePlus may be a burgeoning company but it’s already disrupted the market with the OnePlus 3T.  Performance is impressive and on par with flagship phones. That shouldn’t be a surprise as the 3T takes advantage of the new Snapdragon 821 chip and a ridiculous 6GB of RAM. OnePlus didn't skimp on design or materials either. Some may think it looks too similar to an iPhone or HTC, but its aluminum unibody feels great in the hand. Just don’t dunk the OnePlus 3T in water, as the phone isn’t water resistant like some of the competition.  Will it work for me? Unlocked, the OnePlus 3T supports AT&T and T-Mobile as well as MVNOs that use their infrastructure. There’s an unofficial worldwide carrier support list in the OnePlus forums so check that out before buying.  If you’re on a budget but want flagship performance, the OnePlus 3T should be at the top of your list. Read the full review: OnePlus 3T 11. ZTE Axon 7 A cheap Android phone that doesn't cheap out on specs Carriers: AT&T, T-Mobile (Sprint & Verizon pending) **Weight:** 175g | Dimensions: 151.7 x 75 x 7.9 mm | OS: Android Marshmallow | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1440 x 2560 | CPU: Snapdragon 820 | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 64GB | Battery: 3,250mAh | Rear camera: 20MP | Front camera: 8MP Inexpensive, yet well designed Generous 64GB of internal storage Slippery in the hand Not on all US carriers Continuing with budget flagship killers, the ZTE Axon 7 rivals the best phones on the market today, and even outdoes the OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T when it comes to features. The Axon 7 packs the same Snapdragon 820 and 4GB of RAM like many other phones on this list, but its 1440 x 2560 pixel screen one-ups the OnePlus 3T, which has a 1920 x 1080 display. This phone is ready for Google Daydream View VR. The ZTE Axon 7 also features front facing speakers and 64GB of on-board storage with the ability to add more via microSD. The all-metal body is also beautifully constructed, though it is slippery in the hand so be careful.  Will it work for me? Unlocked, the ZTE Axon 7 has all of the necessary radios to support AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon, but Sprint and Verizon are not officially supported.  ZTE could one day release a software update to enable support on all four major US carriers, but it’s really up to Verizon and Sprint to certify the patch. Unofficially, users have gotten the phone to work on Verizon, but there are some quirks. Read the full review: ZTE Axon 7 10. Huawei Honor 8 An extraordinarily shiny Android phone that’s extra ordinary Carriers: AT&T, T-Mobile, and other GSM carriers | Weight: 153g | Dimensions: 145.5 x 71 x 7.5 mm | OS: Android Nougat | Screen size: 5.2-inch | Resolution: 1920 x 1080 | CPU: Kirin 950 | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 32 or 64GB | Battery: 3,000mAh | Rear camera: Dual 12 MP | Front camera: 8MP Alluring reflective glass design Neat fingerprint sensor gestures Illogical software choices No OIS on the camera Another top contender for best budget unlocked smartphone is the Huawei Honor 8. This all glass and metal phone looks and feels premium, and features dual cameras and takes better pictures than the mid-range competition.  Where the Honor 8 lets us down is in its software. Huawei chose to load up the Honor 8 with its own Android skin, creating a confusing mess with few benefits. For example, Huawei decided to get rid of the iconic Android app drawer, replacing it with an iOS-like approach of dumping all of your apps onto the home screen. However, we did enjoy the fingerprint reader gestures.  Although the phone uses Huawei’s own Kirin 950 chip, its performance is comparable to that of the Snapdragon 820 found in other Android flagship phones. We found the graphics chip to be weaker than the competition, so mobile gamers and VR enthusiast should look elsewhere.  Will it work for me? Currently, the Honor 8 only supports GSM networks like AT&T and T-Mobile and other GSM-based carriers. It’s another phone that misses Verizon and Sprint compatibility. Read the full review: Honor 8 review 9. Huawei Honor 6X Honor updates one of its best Carriers: AT&T, T-Mobile, and other GSM carriers | Weight: 162g | Dimensions: 150.9 x 76.2 x 8.2 mm | OS: Android Marshmallow | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1920 x 1080 | CPU: Kirin 655 | RAM: 3 or 4GB | Storage: 32 or 64GB | Battery: 3,340mAh | Rear camera: Dual 12 MP | Front camera: 8MP Premium build Powerful processor set up Outdated software No USB-C If $400 is still too much to pay for a “budget” flagship killer, then the Huawei Honor 6X should appeal to you. This $250 phone packs great value for the money as it still packs a fingerprint sensor, dual cameras and a 5.5-inch full HD display. Where Huawei compromises is in screen quality, lack of USB-C and slower hardware than the flagship Honor 8. Huawei’s awkward to use and clunky software still remains on the Honor 6X, so Android purist would be happier with the lightly skinned Moto G4 Plus. Will it work for me? Unlocked, the Honor 6X, like its non-identical sibling, the Honor 8, only supports GSM networks in the US like AT&T and T-Mobile. Sorry, Verizon and Sprint customers. Read the full review: Honor 6X review 8. Moto Z An ultra-thin modular phone from Motorola Carrier support: AT&T, T-Mobile, and other GSM networks | Weight: 136g | Dimensions: Height: 153.3 x 75.3 x 5.19 mm | OS: Android Nougat | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1440 x 2560 | CPU: Snapdragon 820 | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 32/64GB | Battery: 2,600mAh | Rear camera: 13MP | Front camera: 5MP Best modular phone ecosystem Incredibly thin No 3.5mm headphone jack Short battery life The Motorola Moto Z is an incredibly thin smartphone that also happens to have the best ecosystem of modular phone accessories. Whether you want to attach the Moto Z to a pair of extremely loud JBL speakers or a projector to share your videos with, the Moto Z’s Moto Mods have you covered. As with other flagship smartphones, performance is excellent from the Snapdragon 820 chip and 4GB of RAM. The Moto Z flies through any task you throw at it. Motorola has also brought the latest version of Android, 7.0 Nougat, to the Moto Z which brings increased battery life, split-screen multitasking and more. It’s not a perfect phone, as its slim body means the phone houses a smaller battery than the competition. This means mediocre battery life which can thankfully be solved with a Moto Mod battery pack. The Moto Z also ditches the 3.5mm headphone jack, but does include an adapter in the box. However, don’t expect to listen to wired headphones while charging. Will it work for me? The unlocked Moto Z works on GSM networks like AT&T and T-Mobile. Check out Motorola’s full list of compatible US networks to see if your carrier is supported.  Read the full review: Moto Z review 7. Moto G4 Plus It's a Plus, but not in the way you think Carrier support: AT&T, T-Mobile, and other GSM networks | Weight: 155g | Dimensions: Height: 153 x 76.6 x 9.8 mm | OS: Android Nougat | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1920 x 1080 | CPU: Snapdragon 617 | RAM: 2, 3 or 4GB (larger storage options get more RAM) | Storage: 16, 32 or 64GB | Battery: 3,000mAh | Rear camera: 16MP | Front camera: 5MP Smooth performance Good camera No NFC for Android Pay Plastic body In addition to its pricey Moto Z flagship, Motorola released the Moto G4 Plus as an affordable mid-range phone. The Moto G4 Plus may not have the latest or greatest processor, but the Snapdragon 617 is still plenty capable for everyday tasks. There are three variations of the phone that include different amounts of storage and RAM. The 16GB model gets 2GB of RAM, the 32GB model gets 3GB or RAM and the top of the line 64GB model gets a whopping 4GB of a RAM. Not bad for a budget smartphone. At $250, the Moto G4 Plus is an incredible value and shows that the performance gap between flagship and budget phones is continuing to shrink. Will it work for me? The unlocked Moto G4 Plus is compatible with all four of the major US carriers. The G4 Plus includes radios for both GSM and CDMA networks, making it one of the most versatile phones on this list. Read the full review: Moto G4 Plus 6. Google Pixel XL The iPhone 7 killer made by Google Carriers: All major US networks | Weight: 168g | Dimensions: Height: 154.7 x 75.7 x 8.5mm | OS: Android 7.1 Nougat | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1440 x 2560 | CPU: Snapdragon 821 | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 32/128GB | Battery: 3,450mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 8MP One of the best smartphone cameras Useful Google Assistant Expensive No stereo speakers or waterproofing The Pixel and Pixel XL are smartphones that are designed entirely by Google. The search giant has finally taken the reigns with the Pixel phones to take on Apple’s iPhone. As a result, the Pixel phones are some of the best smartphones you can buy period. The Pixel XL features one of the best smartphone cameras on the market today, taking images in low light without problem. The Pixel is powerful thanks to the Snapdragon 821 processor and 4GB of RAM. And since Google has tight control over the software on the Pixel, the phone avoids that nasty slowdown you may experience with other Android phones. The Pixel XL is the model you should choose if you want a bigger screen and better battery life. And if you intend to buy the Google Daydream View VR headset, the XL's higher resolution screen automatically makes it the better choice – the screen is much less when it's two inches from your face. If none of that matters to you, save your money by getting the smaller version. Will it work for me? Unlocked, the Google Pixel XL works on all four of the major US carriers. It contains radios for both GSM and CDMA networks, despite the fact that it's marketed with Verizon-branded commercials. Read the full review: Google Pixel XL review 5. Google Pixel The perfect phone for Android aficionados Carriers: All major US networks | Weight: 143g | Dimensions: 143.8 x 69.5 x 8.5mm | OS: Android 7.1 Nougat | Screen size: 5-inch | Resolution: 1080 x 1920 | CPU: Snapdragon 821 | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 32/128GB | Battery: 2,770mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 8MP Buttery smooth performance Excellent display and camera Mediocre battery life Under baked Google Assistant If you want a smaller phone than the plus-sized models in this list but don’t want to compromise on features, the Google Pixel is for you. The Pixel is Google’s answer to the Apple iPhone and it's one of the most polished smartphones you can buy right now. Google’s control over the hardware and software means the phone simply flies. The Pixel features the latest Snapdragon 821 chip with 4GB that make split-screen multitasking is Android 7.0 Nougat a reality. It also has one of the best smartphone cameras on the market today. The only major downsides the smaller Pixel are slightly shorter battery life and less pixel-packed display. The 2,770 mAh battery will get you comfortably through most days, but you’ll want to bring a charger if you’re using the phone heavily. The 1080p Full HD screen won’t impress you as much as the XL’s Quad HD display when trying out Google Daydream View VR content. But the price is why we have it one space ahead. Most people won't need extras like a VR-ready display when, at most, they're just flirt with Google's budding virtual reality platform. Save yourself $100. Will it work for me? Yes. While the Google Pixel only sold on contract in Verizon stores, you can buy an unlocked version from Google’s site that works with all major US carriers.  Read the full review: Google Pixel review 4. iPhone 7 Apple's one-handed masterpiece Carriers: All major US networks | Weight: 138g | Dimensions: 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1mm | OS: iOS 10 | Screen size: 4.7-inch | Resolution: 750 x 1334 | CPU: Apple A10 Fusion | RAM: 2GB | Storage: 32/128/256GB | Battery: 1,960mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 7MP Great camera in low light Water resistant Unimpressive battery life Lacks clear upgrades While the iPhone 7 series has gotten flack for being iterative, it’s still the best iPhone you can buy today. Apple’s legendary build quality remains with the iPhone 7, and does one better by making it all waterproof. You won’t have to worry about spilling a drink on your iPhone, but you shouldn’t swim with it. Camera performance has always been impressive on the iPhone and that remains true with the iPhone 7. While its bigger brother, the iPhone 7 Plus, gets a fancy dual-lens camera setup, the single lens iPhone 7 still manages to take excellent shots, especially in low light. If you want fancy zoom functionality, you’ll have to step up to the iPhone 7 Plus. If you’re upgrading from an older iPhone, you’ll love the iPhone 7. Just remember to bring your wireless headphones or wired headphone adapter, as Apple got rid of the 3.5 mm headphone jack in the iPhone 7. Will it work for me? You can buy the iPhone 7 unlocked from the Apple Store, or at least get the Verizon version. The reason? The Verizon version contains Qualcomm’s modem that supports both CDMA and GSM networks. You can cross over anytime with the any SIM card. Sprint's iPhone 7, also a CDMA-based network, has the same modem and antenna advantage, but the carrier's unlocking rules can trap you into a temporary, 50-day contract, even when it’s bought at full price. Unlocked iPhone 7 models from AT&T and T-Mobile feature Intel’s modem, which only supports GSM networks, making them more limited if you ever decide to switch to a new carrier, or give it to a friend or family member when the iPhone 8 comes out. It’s also less valuable when it comes time to sell.  Read the full review: iPhone 7 review iPhone 7 Plus The best iPhone available right now Carriers: All major US networks | Weight: 188g | Dimensions: 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3mm | OS: iOS 10 | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1080 x 1920 | CPU: A10 Fusion | RAM: 3GB | Storage: 32/128/256GB | Battery: 2,900mAh | Rear camera: 12MP+12MP | Front camera: 7MP Speedy performance Excellent camera Very expensive No headphone jack The iPhone 7 Plus is the best iPhone you can buy right now. The larger brother of the iPhone 7 has an advantage in the battery life and camera departments since there’s physically more space in the phone. The iPhone 7 Plus features a 2,900 mAh battery versus the 1,960 mAh battery you get in the smaller iPhone 7. The Plus also gets a dual-lens camera system that allows you to seamless zoom in on subjects. The iPhone 7 Plus is an excellent performer thanks to Apple’s latest A10 Fusion chip and seamless iOS 10 software. Combined with slick hardware, water resistance and an excellent camera, the iPhone 7 Plus is the phone to beat. There are a few downsides with the iPhone 7 Plus though. First of all, it’s very expensive. Secondly, it removed the 3.5mm headphone jack so you’ll be forced to buy wireless headphones or use the included headphone adapter that prevents you from charging at the same time. Will it work for me? You can buy the iPhone 7 Plus unlocked and SIM-free from Apple, but if you have to lean toward one carrier, get the Verizon version. That’s because the phones from Verizon (and Sprint) contain Qualcomm’s modem that supports both CDMA and GSM networks, and Verizon has a less stringent contract (Sprint has a 50-day activation period before it can be unlocked). The unlocked iPhone 7 from AT&T and T-Mobile contains Intel’s modem, which only supports GSM networks, making them more limited and less valuable when it comes time to resell your no contract smartphone.  Read the full review: iPhone 7 Plus review 2. Samsung Galaxy S7 One of two five star phones from Samsung Carriers: All major US carriers | Weight: 152g | Dimensions: 142.4 x 69.6 x 7.9 mm | OS: Android Marshmallow | Screen size: 5.1-inch | Resolution: 1440 x 2560 | CPU: Exynos 8890 | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 32GB/64GB | Battery: 3,000mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 5MP Improved, waterproof design Fantastic screen and performance Expensive Fingerprint magnet Sure, the Samsung Galaxy S7 may look nearly identical to the Galaxy S6 but it’s the subtle tweaks that make the Galaxy S7 an improved experience. The Galaxy S7 still features a glass back but is now curved, making the phone feel extremely comfortable in the hand. Samsung even made the Galaxy S7 slightly thicker to accommodate a larger battery. But the biggest change from the Galaxy S6 is waterproofing. The Galaxy S7 can survive a dunk in a pool or spilled drink without problems. Not happy with 32 or 64GB of internal storage? Samsung brought back microSD card support to the Galaxy S7, meaning you can add up to an additional 200GB of storage. Performance is excellent, even with Samsung’s TouchWiz skin on top of Android. The company has worked to make TouchWiz less intrusive but you’ll still be waiting months for the latest Android version. The good news is that the phone flies and its camera is excellent, even when compared to newer phones like the Google Pixel. Will it work for me? Unlocked, the Samsung Galaxy S7 (SM-G930U) supports all major US carriers. The advantage of buying an unlocked Galaxy S7 is that you won’t get any carrier branding or bloatware installed. Plus, Samsung Pay will work, unlike unlocked international variants. Read the full review: Samsung Galaxy S7 review 1. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge The best smartphone in the world - it's a work of art Carrier support: All major US carriers | Weight: 157g | Dimensions: 150.9 x 72.6 x 7.7 mm | OS: Android Marshmallow | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1440 x 2560 | CPU: Exynos 8890 | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 32GB/64GB | Battery: 3,600mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 5MP Incredible camera Beautiful screen and blazing performance Expensive Slightly plastic feel Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge features the same curved screen as the Galaxy S6 Edge, but there are subtle changes beneath the sloped glass that help refine the experience. The hardware feels better in the hand thanks to a curved back and slim bezels. This means the Galaxy S7 Edge feels smaller than its screen size would suggest. Samsung packed the Galaxy S7 Edge with the same excellent camera found in the smaller Galaxy S7, which focuses quickly and captures lots of lights in dim environments. It doesn’t have the fancy dual lens systems of other phones on this list but the image quality speaks for itself. On the software front, Samsung still offers its TouchWiz skin on top of Android, but the company has worked to scale back the intimidating amount of options and customizations. You’ll still be waiting months to get the latest version of Android, but the tweaks and features Samsung offers over stock Android may be worth it to some. Will it work for me? Unlocked, the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (SM-G935U) supports all major US carriers, including Verizon, Sprint, AT&T and T-Mobile. The other advantage of buying an unlocked Galaxy S7 Edge is that you won’t get any gaundy carrier branding or bloatware installed and Samsung Pay works without a hitch.

Hyundai Hyundai's 2017 Super Bowl ad is a break from the usual: they are filming this year's spot after kickoff. (Photo: Hyundai) When Hyundai Motor America told the NFL about the concept for its Super Bowl ad, it told the league the best moments at this year’s game would happen off the field. “Believe me, that wasn’t an easy comment to make to the NFL,” says Eric Springer, chief creative officer of the ad agency Innocean USA. “It caused them to go back on their heels until they heard the idea. And then they said: ‘Yeah, it makes total sense.’” Hyundai is throwing a Super Bowl party for a battalion at a U.S. military installation at an undisclosed location overseas, with big TV screens and all the fixings. Three soldiers selected by the military will experience the game in individual 360-degree immersive pods that will make them feel as if they are in a luxury box at NRG Stadium. And the 90-second commercial will be filmed beginning after kickoff — and then air in the post-gun slot just after the game ends. AD METER: Vote on all the Super Bowl ads!  “The moment will happen in the hearts of those who make the Super Bowl possible — our troops,” Springer says. An ad that normally gestates over 13 to 18 weeks will come to fruition in about an hour and 15 minutes so that it can be filmed and edited — and approved by the military, the NFL and FOX — in time to air after the confetti flies. “This is not a stunt,” Springer says. “It’s in the soul of the brand.” Hyundai won USA TODAY’s Ad Meter last year for best ad in the Super Bowl, as selected by consumer vote. The next day, Hyundai’s creative team began working on this year’s ad. (It’s not eligible for Ad Meter this time; ads that air between the coin toss and the two-minute warning are eligible.) Last year’s winning ad played to big laughs with Kevin Hart as a dad handing over the keys to his new Hyundai Genesis to a young man taking Hart’s TV daughter on a first date. “How do you make people laugh with your brand?” says Dean Evans, Hyundai’s chief marketing officer. “That’s what we really pulled off. And what you can see from the onslaught of what’s happening this year, there’s a lot of comedy, a lot of comedians, a lot of celebrities — a lot of the formula we used last year — across the table. So I’m really glad that we’re zagging this year while everyone is zigging.” Springer says the concept was born long before anyone knew how deeply divided the country would be today, but he says Hyundai is happy to have a commercial that can be enjoyed by all sides of the nation’s political divide. Hollywood director Peter Berg (Friday Night Lights and Lone Survivor) is directing the commercial on the fly and says the project combines his greatest passions — football and the military. “You have to come to the game and make people either laugh or cry,” Evans says. “You really have to entertain them. They really expect, more than ever before, to be moved.” VIDEOS: Super Bowl ads released thus far CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Honda | 1:00 Yearbook photos of celebrities such as Steve Carell, Tina Fey, and Magic Johnson come to life in this ad, a celebration of the 20th birthday of the Honda CR-V. 1 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: T-Mobile | 1:00 Justin Bieber, Rob Gronkowski, and Terrell Owens take us through the history of the touchdown dance. 2 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Bud Light | 1:31 Bud Light Icon Spuds MacKenzie returns in the new Super Bowl Ad as a man's best friend to show that it was never about the parties, but friendships made along the way. 3 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Top Games | 0:30 Actors Aaron Eckhart, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, and Fan Bingbing star in "The Battle of Evony" a short movie promoting the mobile game Evony: The King’s Return. 4 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Audi | 1:00 Audi's Super Bowl ad, featuring a man watching her daughter win on the race track, advocates for equal pay. 5 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Sprint | 0:30 A man fakes his own death to get out of his Verizon contract before being convinced to switch to Sprint. 6 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Nintendo | 0:30 Nintendo introduces the new Switch console with clips from the game The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. 7 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Wonderful Pistachios | 0:15 Ernie the Elephant, voiced by WWE star John Cena, discovers the benefits of Wonderful Pistachios. 8 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Ford | 1:43 Narrated by actor Bryan Cranston, Ford's Super Bowl LI ad focuses on the automaker's future plans. 9 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Squarespace | 0:30 Actor John Malkovich struggles to secure the domain name JohnMalkovich.com in Squarespace's new ad. 10 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: King's Hawaiian | 0:30 A man trying to stash away his King's Hawaiian rolls chooses a hiding place that isn't as secret as he thinks it is. 11 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: LIFEWTR | 0:30 John Legend and PepsiCo's new LIFEWTR bottled water brings color to a drab world. 12 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Kia | 0:00 With the help of the new hybrid Kia Niro, actress Melissa McCarthy saves the world.

Yes, net 1 Feb 2017 at 14:07, Paul Kunert Industry execs are paid to put on a brave face when outlining company financials, and AMD’s CEO Lisa Su kept up her end of the bargain last night when the broken business reported a net loss of $497m for 2016. This was progress of sorts: in the prior year ailing AMD filed losses of $660m. Despite the latest numbers, the stock market price barely moved, such were Wall Street’s expectations. Su, who is paid $950,000 a year with an equity award target valued at $7m, spelt out the positives in the year. She pointed to “growing discrete graphics share”; “regaining client compute share”; and “strengthening the financial foundation of the company by achieving annual non-GAAP operating profitability, reducing debt and increasing cash”. Long term debt fell to $1.44bn versus $2.23bn, she added. All of that was true, and work to boost the technical, operational and fiscal footing over the past couple of years will feed into the numbers very soon, the exec assured analysts on a conference call. “We entered 2017 with strong revenue growth and margin expansion opportunities as we prepare to launch our Zen-based CPUs and Vega GPUs that can return AMD to the high performance markets, where we have not materially participated in recent years. The production ramp, customer adoption and ecosystem support for our Zen-based desktop processor, Ryzen, are all mapping to our plans.” Ryzen is due to launch in early March; system builders in the channel and integrators will get shipments earlier than “more traditional hardware vendors” who will get it “later”. This is the CPU AMD will position against nemesis Intel’s Core i5 and i7 units. The next two versions, Zen 2 and 3, are being developed under 7nm manufacturing. AMD ended the year on a relative high as revenue claimed 15 per cent year on year to $1.11bn. Divisional revenues in Computing and Graphics were up 28 per cent to $600m fuelled by a sales uplift in GPU and PC processors, the highest in 11 and seven quarters respectively. The Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom unit sold $506m worth of components, up 4 per cent. Demand for AMD-powered consoles from Microsoft and Sony helped out and embedded processor sales were up double digits. The total operating loss for Q4 was $3m compared to $49m and the net loss was $51m, half of the loss reported a year ago. For the year, revenues grew to $4.27bn from $3.99bn, operating losses came in at $372m compared to $481m, and net loss fell to $497m from $660m. AMD said the 2016 “operating loss improvement was due to higher revenues, lower restructuring charges (related to lay-offs) and an IP monetisation gain, offset by the WSA charge”. A five-year amendment to its Wafer Supply Agreement with Global Foundries saw AMD stump up $340m to the chip fab giant. Turnover for the current 13-week quarter is an 11 per cent sequential decrease in turnover. ® Tips and corrections 25 Comments More from The Register AMD virty encryption not quite there, claim boffins Updated Don't put your VMs in a spook-controlled cloud 7 Comments AMD will sell server CPUs at Happy Meal prices so you can supersize servers ARM vs. x86 can wait as first decent Xeon alternatives in ages pressure Chipzilla 26 Comments AMD promises code fix for power-hungry Radeon RX 480 GPU Intel's punching bag says it's working on a patch 38 Comments AMD is a rounding error on Intel's spreadsheet and that sucks for us all Zen biz's only hope is to avoid Chipzilla's wrath, it seems 54 Comments AMD chief architect Jim Keller quits chipmaker – again Industry veteran mysteriously exits after three-year return from Apple 18 Comments Official: AMD now stands for Avoiding Miserable Death Officially on El Reg, that is – Mini-chipzilla in the black after strong console chip sales 17 Comments Whitepapers Machine Learning Delivers Better IT Insights Learn how predictive analytics and machine learning can improve application performance.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Epic’s Tim Sweeney isn’t thrilled… Epic’s Tim Sweeney isn’t thrilled about the locked nature of Windows 10 Cloud By Kevin Parrish — February 1, 2017 5:31 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you Tim Sweeney raises a good point: the rumored "cloud" version of Windows 10 may prevent customers from installing Steam and traditional PC games. Epic Games’ co-founder and Unreal Engine creator Tim Sweeney jumped on Twitter to voice his opinion about Microsoft’s rumored “cloud” version of Windows 10. He calls it “Windows 10 Crush Steam Edition” because this version of Microsoft’s platform apparently locks the end user down to the Windows Store, preventing the installation of traditional software sold elsewhere. “Looks like Microsoft was waiting till after the election to see if they could get away with their lockdown,” he said. Windows 10 Cloud was originally thought to be a cloud-based version of Windows 10 that would stream to devices of any size and architecture. But sources stated that Microsoft is creating a version of Windows 10 to compete directly with Google’s Chrome OS platform installed on Chromebooks. Windows 10 Cloud would be lightweight, highly responsive, and would only rely on apps distributed through the Windows Store. More: Epic Games founder Tim Sweeney: Oculus storefront is anything but ‘open’ That has seemingly pushed Sweeney to jump back on his Windows 10 soapbox — he has been very vocal about the Windows Store and how it presents a “walled garden.” Software sold through Microsoft’s embedded storefront must meet specific guidelines, and must use the company’s Universal Windows Platform model. Thus, unlike Steam and Amazon, Windows 10 users browsing through the Windows Store can’t purchase just any piece of software. To some degree, Microsoft is treating Windows 10 like a hybrid platform. On the one hand, it’s pushing self-contained “mobile” apps through a platform-locked storefront. On the other hand, the company enables Windows 10 users to install (side-load) traditional desktop software that can be purchased anywhere. However, Windows 10 apps sold through the Windows Store take advantage of special features not offered to traditional software developers. But with the possible introduction of Windows 10 Cloud, customers won’t have the option of installing the Steam client and purchasing traditional PC gaming software. It’s reminiscent of the days when Microsoft sold Surface devices with Windows RT, which was designed for the ARM processor architecture and could not run traditional desktop software (Win32) based on the x86 processor architecture (Intel, AMD). “The trouble started when Microsoft began shipping some PCs and regular Surfaces that were so locked down that you couldn’t run Win32 apps; you could only run apps that had been bought from their store. That is a complete travesty.” Sweeney said last year. Sweeney thinks that Microsoft doesn’t believe in the openness the company is preaching with Windows 10. He thinks the company is performing a series of “sneaky maneuvers” with Windows 10 that will make using traditional software difficult on the platform, driving users into the Windows Store. “Slowly, over the next five years, they will force-patch Windows 10 to make Steam progressively worse and more broken,” he said. “They’ll never completely break it, but will continue to break it until, in five years, people are so fed up that Steam is buggy that the Windows Store seems like an ideal alternative.” But with Windows 10 Cloud, there won’t be any possibility of using Steam. Is Sweeney’s prophecy coming true?

The next time you're driving from New York to Boston on I-95, you should make a little detour in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, to visit the Old Slater Mill national historic landmark. It’s the site of what is considered to be the first successful water-powered textile spinning mill in America. That feat was made possible by Samuel Slater, an immigrant to the US who came here at the age of 21 in 1789 from England — a country with which we had just fought a long, bitter war. He had the mill going only a few years after the signing of the US Constitution, and is sometimes referred to as the "Father of the American Industrial Revolution." The textile industry became a huge deal in 19th century America, kind of like the tech industry is today. And that immigrant tradition continues, especially in tech, America’s most dominant and dynamic industry today. In fact, if you were drawing up a business plan for countries back in 1789, you couldn’t have done better than the American founders did by, among other things, welcoming the most ambitious people from around the world to build lives here as full participants in the American experiment. For me, it is this long, deeply ingrained tradition of American immigration — and the huge benefits it has paid to our country — that makes President Trump’s executive order restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries deeply worrisome. Yes, I understand it is supposedly meant to buy time to develop a better system to block terrorists from entering our nation. Yes, I understand that our government has clamped down on immigration from time to time in the past, sometimes shamefully excluding specific peoples, like the Chinese. Nativism is un-American, and bad for innovation But the Trump action carries with it the unmistakable scent of nativism, the idea that immigration is a bad idea. And that is just un-American, and bad for innovation to boot. That isn’t to say that refugees fleeing horrors in Syria or elsewhere and seeking asylum must be computer programmers or biochemists to be admitted. We should admit as many as we can, after proper vetting, simply because they are refugees. That’s reason enough. It will forever be a stain on our history that we turned away some Jewish refugees fleeing Hitler. The same goes for average immigrants who aren’t refugees, but are simply seeking economic opportunity. Not all are Samuel Slaters. Like native-born Americans, only a few will change the world. But you never know which foreign-born barista putting herself through school might one day build a great business or invent a great product. Just by pulling up roots in another country and coming here, she’s already shown grit, ambition, and a strong work ethic. Immigrant ingenuity The immigrants who did important, world-changing things did them here because this country welcomed them when others shunned them, or weren't as open. And the tech industry, America’s most famous worldwide, is a prime example. Our lives and our culture have been significantly changed and improved by hardware, software, and services developed by immigrants. Who co-founded Google? Sergey Brin, a Russian-born Jew whose family fled anti-semitism in the Soviet Union to settle here and who considers himself a refugee. Brin showed up at the San Francisco airport to protest the Trump order. “We are able to build products for everyone because we attract talent from around the world.” Who runs Google today? Sundar Pichai, a man born and raised in India but who received his advanced education here. I asked Pichai, who has spoken out against the Trump order, about American immigration more broadly. “In Silicon Valley, being an immigrant doesn't matter,” he replied via email. “It's the ideas that matter. We are able to build products for everyone because we attract talent from around the world. Immigration is a strength for this industry and our country — it's one of our defining characteristics.” Exactly. And it’s not just Google. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk was born in South Africa. Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang was born in Taiwan. Oracle CEO Safra Catz was born in Israel. And Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, like Google’s Pichai, was born and raised in India. In remarks this week during a Q&A with Microsoft employees, Nadella said, “It is the enlightened immigration policy of this country that even made it possible for me to come here in the first place, and gave me all this opportunity. And so I always think about that. I will always advocate for that America that I know and that I’ve experienced.” The giants Perhaps the greatest technology icon of our time, the man responsible for so many tech innovations, the late Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple, was the biological son of a Syrian immigrant. And one of Jobs’ mentors, a seminal figure in Silicon Valley, was the late Andy Grove, one of the three creators of Intel, whose processors are in nearly every desktop and laptop computer today. Mr. Grove was a Hungarian whose family fled Communist repression. As he once wrote: “By the time I was twenty, I had lived through a Hungarian Fascist dictatorship, German military occupation, the Nazis' "Final Solution," the siege of Budapest by the Soviet Red Army, a period of chaotic democracy in the years immediately after the war, a variety of repressive Communist regimes, and a popular uprising that was put down at gunpoint… [where] many young people were killed; countless others were interned. Some two hundred thousand Hungarians escaped to the West. I was one of them.” Rank and file, too And it isn’t just so many of the famous CEOs of tech who were immigrants. In my 25 years of covering the industry, it’s become routine to encounter product managers, engineers, and startup founders from Russia, India, Pakistan, Israel, Britain, France, and so many other countries. Just two well-known examples. The chief designer of your Apple iPhone, iPad, and Mac? It’s Jonathan Ive, native of the United Kingdom. The new head of virtual reality at Facebook and former senior Android team member at Google? That would be Hugo Barra, native of Brazil. A little skepticism Of course, like every other government policy, immigration laws can be abused. I wouldn’t bet my life that every single H-1B visa issued to the tech industry fully meets its intended purpose of allowing in skilled foreign workers for specialty jobs only after failing to find an American worker for the slot. And there certainly are some tech jobs US companies base abroad that could be filled with native-born labor at home. What’s more, a strong belief in immigration doesn’t relieve us of our responsibility for better education and training for US workers so they can do all those “specialty” jobs — and many others — and few H-1B visas will be needed. Bottom Line But, overall, the American technology industry is a shining example of the wisdom of the founding fathers, and the example of Samuel Slater over 200 years ago. The moral of their story is that being open to immigration is not only the right thing to do, but the smart thing as well. It’s a humane good and a competitive advantage, all rolled into one. If President Trump is as good a businessman as he says, and not a short-sighted nativist, he should understand that.

(Photo: Avocados from Mexico) Jon Lovitz is a man in the middle. He was a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice, where President Trump has an executive producer credit. And Sunday he’ll be on a Super Bowl ad for Avocados from Mexico, which could soon face an import tariff from the Trump administration. "I’m just a comedian and an actor,” Lovitz tells USA TODAY Sports, wisely waving off talk of politics. He’d rather talk guacamole, which he says he tries to eat every day. Avocados from Mexico will advertise in the Super Bowl for a third consecutive year. This time the emphasis is they’re good for you. AD METER: Vote on every Super Bowl ad! "We are high in good fats, not bad fats,” says Alvaro Luque, president of Avocados From Mexico. “We are using the biggest stage out there to say we are a healthy brand.” Lovitz gets a funny cameo in an ad that plays with the notion that we live in a culture where we can’t keep secrets. That goes for Super Bowl ads, too, many of which are released before the game. "The oversharing is something you want,” says Jay Russell, chief creative officer of GSD&M Advertising. It brings early buzz, he says, plus those who’ve already seen it will tell others at Super Bowl parties to watch when they see one they like come on. Russell can’t remember what teams played in the Super Bowls his ads have been in. To him, the real competition is what happens during commercial breaks. "You watch your commercial play and you look at your phone and you know within seconds if you were great or a horrible failure,” he says. “We live in this Twitter world. I go straight to social media and you know instantly” where you stand. “I don’t drink a beer until I see a good result. Then I can finally eat the guacamole we’ve been advertising.” PLAYLIST: Super Bowl ads released thus far CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Honda | 1:00 Yearbook photos of celebrities such as Steve Carell, Tina Fey, and Magic Johnson come to life in this ad, a celebration of the 20th birthday of the Honda CR-V. 1 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: T-Mobile | 1:00 Justin Bieber, Rob Gronkowski, and Terrell Owens take us through the history of the touchdown dance. 2 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Bud Light | 1:31 Bud Light Icon Spuds MacKenzie returns in the new Super Bowl Ad as a man's best friend to show that it was never about the parties, but friendships made along the way. 3 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Top Games | 0:30 Actors Aaron Eckhart, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, and Fan Bingbing star in "The Battle of Evony" a short movie promoting the mobile game Evony: The King’s Return. 4 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Audi | 1:00 Audi's Super Bowl ad, featuring a man watching her daughter win on the race track, advocates for equal pay. 5 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Sprint | 0:30 A man fakes his own death to get out of his Verizon contract before being convinced to switch to Sprint. 6 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Nintendo | 0:30 Nintendo introduces the new Switch console with clips from the game The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. 7 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Wonderful Pistachios | 0:15 Ernie the Elephant, voiced by WWE star John Cena, discovers the benefits of Wonderful Pistachios. 8 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Ford | 1:43 Narrated by actor Bryan Cranston, Ford's Super Bowl LI ad focuses on the automaker's future plans. 9 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Squarespace | 0:30 Actor John Malkovich struggles to secure the domain name JohnMalkovich.com in Squarespace's new ad. 10 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: King's Hawaiian | 0:30 A man trying to stash away his King's Hawaiian rolls chooses a hiding place that isn't as secret as he thinks it is. 11 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: LIFEWTR | 0:30 John Legend and PepsiCo's new LIFEWTR bottled water brings color to a drab world. 12 of 24 CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share EVERY SUPER BOWL 2017 COMMERCIAL AS THEY ARE RELEASEDAd Meter 2017: Kia | 0:00 With the help of the new hybrid Kia Niro, actress Melissa McCarthy saves the world.

Williams Follow Following Rate the news Super Bowl commercials 2017: ad time costs about $5 million [Video] Television commercials have become a fundamental part of the entertainment during the big game. { YouTube Screen Grab - Best Commercials } Advertisements Super Bowl LI will be played in Houston, Texas between the Atlanta Falcons and New England Patriots, on Sunday, Feb. 5, 2017. The big game promises some of the most outrageous advertisements in football's history, and of course, Lady Gaga’s highly anticipated halftime performance. Marketers spend large amounts of money on a 30-second spot for the opportunity to grab the attention of about 115 million viewers. For game fans and non-football enthusiasts, the Super Bowl is a must-see experience, to find out which commercials everyone is going to be talking about on Monday morning. Big game commercial season has officially started Companies spent months planning, dedicated to creating an ad that will stand out on Game Day. To grab more observers at Houston’s NRG Stadium on Sunday, Some advertisers are going to wait to release their commercial during the game, others have a different idea and will make their ads available to see before kickoff -- New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady is going to appear in Intel's 30-second clip on game day showing the company's new "360-degree replay technology" while he gets ready in the morning. And many of the other advertisers have already released the promotion they’ll run on February 5th. The goal is to make the commercial go viral and have people talking about it for a long time. Sky's the limit for the budget Each year, as Game Day approaches, millions of dollars are spent, and companies will pay for celebrities, movie mockery, little old ladies, and cute animals. The New York Times reported that advertisers paid an average cost of over $5 million to get their 30-second spot on Super Bowl Sunday. Companies like Wix, Budweiser, Kia, Skittles, and Snickers have already announced that they bought ad time this year. Mercedes-Benz invested in Oscar-winning directors the Coen Brothers for the 60-second Mercedes-AMG GT Roadster ad, in which Hollywood legend Peter Fonda addresses what happens when a driver’s car gets blocked in at a bar. Some Super Bowl ads are complete duds, others are interesting, but the great ones stick with us for years. Those are the commercials that fans can watch over and over again. #Television #Superbowl #NFL Advertisements Lala Kent is embarking on a new project, excited to show fans who she really is Whitney Thore of 'My Big Fat Fabulous Life' makes fans wonder if she miscarried 'Shahs of Sunset' Mike Shouhed and Jessica Parido caught kissing after divorce?

(AMZN) Stock on This Q4 Earnings Dip Facebook Inc (FB) TV App Is More Trouble Than You Think Can GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Escape Its Bearish Dogma? View All Posts Computer security should be easy money. Everyone needs it, and that need grows every year. Source: David via Flickr (Modified) Serving the need is not that simple, though. High-end computer security is a complex, fast-changing business. If your approach is popular, investors will come running. But, once that changes, it’s hard to get them back. FireEye Inc (NASDAQ:FEYE) is known for its “sandbox” approach, sold as the Multi-Vector Virtual Execution (MVX) system. Think of MVX as one of those boxes soldiers put suspected bombs into. It executes and analyzes suspicious software, and this is supposed to be a $3.5 billion business in 2019. It might be. But, in terms of profit, it may also be a dry hole. Where Is the Profit? FireEye has not delivered the results its hype led people to expect. Revenue has grown, but expenses have grown just as fast, and in 2016 revenue growth slowed. For the first three quarters of 2016, FireEye had revenue of about $530 million and was on pace to beat last year’s $632 million, but it wasn’t enough to beat expenses, $297.76 million having been spent on $186.41 million in third-quarter revenue alone. There is a “flavor of the month” quality to these stocks, based on their differing approaches to the subject of security. They go into fashion, but then go out of fashion. FireEye was very much in vogue in 2014, but it has lost 60% of its value since the start of 2015. Palo Alto Networks Inc (NYSE:PANW) and its “next generation firewall” was the choice in 2015, but it’s down 16% since the start of 2016. Fortinet Inc (NASDAQ:FTNT) and its “security fabric” was last year’s choice, and while all three of these stocks are up so far in 2017, that may not last. Part of the problem is that, while start-ups rushed into computer security early in this decade, because mainstream vendors weren’t offering what the market wanted, those vendors are now on the case. While their products are not up to scratch, their promises — and profits in other areas — are enough to keep investors happy. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) had all announced that computer security was a focus of their efforts in the last year, and all are up. The specialty firms, however, are down. Solutions Remain Elusive A real solution to the computer security problem remains elusive. This can lead to analysts clutching at straws, lost amid the hype. The bullish case is “nuanced,” our James Brumley notes. InvestorPlace‘s Josh Enomoto says it’s this year or never for FEYE stock. Our Will Ashworth says there are better plays out there such as Cyberark Software Ltd (NASDAQ:CYBR), which has maintained profitability as it has grown. That’s true, but Cyberark hasn’t grown, much. The Israeli company had revenue of $160 million in 2016 and $103 million in 2015. That’s a small fraction of FireEye’s take, and FEYE is still considered a minnow in this field. But, profit is the flavor of this month. The Bottom Line FireEye has a niche, yet management still hasn’t found a way to generate profit on that niche, so FEYE keeps investing in hopes of a breakthrough. The company could earn a profit for that niche if it could get its administration and selling expenses down. Lately it has been making some progress on that, but at the expense of slower growth. The solution seems simple: sell out to one of the majors. FireEye’s sales and losses would be lost inside the books of a larger rival, and those administrative expenses would practically disappear if a larger company took over. That, to me, is the only reason for you to buy FireEye today — hope for a buyout tomorrow. A deal would probably draw speculation in the buyer, and at this point the premium to FEYE stock owners would not be enormous. Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

Paul Dillien, Principal, High Tech Marketing 1/31/2017 12:20 PM EST  0 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet It's the time of year for forecasts, inaugurations, and awards, so here is an irreverent take on some of the news over the past few weeks. Around each year's end, we have the spectacle of industry pundits "fine tuning" their earlier semiconductor forecasts for the year about to end, coupled with their expectations for the year ahead. As late as December, some thought that 2016 would be a down year, but as Dylan McGrath recently reported, Gartner has calculated that the industry grew 1.5% during 2016, which is good news. World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) confirmed that 2015 had been a down year, so if 2016 had also ended negatively, this would have set a disappointing trend. Call me cynical or just perverse, but I enjoy comparing results with predictions from the previous year to see how accurate they were. Back in December 2015, forecasts ranged from a decline of 3% to an increase of 4% (not as far off as in some previous years). WSTS forecast that 2016 would show a 1.6% growth, which now seems spookily accurate. However, you may recall that, by mid-2016, everything was doom-and-gloom with expectations that the 2016 number would fall by 2.4%. A stronger final quarter seems to have surprised everyone. Now we hear that 2017 is forecast to grow between 5% and 8%, depending on who's making the prediction. This surprises me, as I've been reading the column inches devoted to lamenting how the industry is maturing and consolidating. Of course, there are lots of uncertainties that remain about the year ahead, including concerns about the slowdown in smartphone sales and the rate of decline of PC purchases. It is also difficult to predict the effects of recent massive mergers and acquisitions (M&As). The future is inherently unknowable, and -- obviously -- unforeseen events can have major impacts on any forecast. Who knows the effects of a Trump Presidency on topics like trade or repatriating overseas profits? China is also striving to build up its indigenous semiconductor industry through building new fabs and acquisitions of companies like Lattice Semiconductor. Here in the UK, we worry about the effects of Brexit on our electronics industry. Within the semiconductor markets, there are -- of course -- always winners and losers. The prime driver for growth in 2017 is given as memory, and memory vendors are expected to enjoy large dollar increases. The spate of M&As is targeted at efficiencies of scale, R&D alignments, and streamlining of product portfolios, all of which can take time to manifest in increased sales. In contrast, it is often the medium and smaller companies that are both innovative and nimble, thereby allowing them to be faster when moving into new markets. These companies often achieve the largest percentage increases. Overall, if the 2017 forecast proves to be correct, it will add around $20B to the semiconductor market. What's my take-away? Well it's that forecasting is more of an art form than a science, but we all need some guidance, I guess. Bringing things closer to home, currently we're wading through the December 2016 quarterly earnings reports, and it will be fascinating to review how the FPGA vendors have performed against the wider semiconductor background. Since its acquisition by Intel in December 2015, Altera has been incorporated into the Programmable Systems Group. It will be interesting to see how it has performed in its first full year under new management. Speaking about things programmable and innovative small companies, I found an email from last year lurking in a dark corner of my inbox. This email concerns a company called Lime Microsystems that I know well. Lime, which is linked to Intel, took the brave decision to expand from making programmable RF chips into software defined radio (SDR) boards. These include a dual radio transceiver chip and a Cyclone FPGA, and won the Frost & Sullivan 2016 Global Software Defined Radio Technology Innovation Award. F&S said Lime's SDR board won because it is "accessible at a price point with mass market potential" and "offered carrier-class performance of its full-duplex RF chain." The defining characteristic of the LimeSDR is that it is open source and is described as app-enabled, which means that users can download Linux-based code onto their PC, plug the SDR into a USB port, and create an LTE base station, a weather satellite monitor, a LoRa transceiver, or... the list is potentially endless. This board was supported through crowdfunding and attracted over 3500 pledges, so coming to a PC near you perhaps? While analysts focus on the prospects for the larger corporations, it is probable that smaller, innovative companies will outperform them in terms of percentage growth. Once all the FPGA results are in, I'll look at the performance of each company over the last twelve months and offer my verdict. Until then, I welcome your comments and questions.

This year’s game is being live streamed on the Fox Sports Go app. You can download it for iOS and Android, but there are also versions for the big screen. Get it for Apple TV, Roku and Amazon Fire TV. I recommend setting it up and testing before you invite your friends over. The best part is that this year you can watch the game - and the commericals - for free, without a cable login. FOX Sports today announced that it will offer a live, non-authenticated stream of Super Bowl LI on FOX Sports GO, the streaming platform that showcases all of FOX Sports’ live events and studio programming. For the Super Bowl broadcast, users will not need to enter their pay TV credentials for viewing. Inside the app you’ll also be able to watch cool replays using new “be the player” technology. This basically puts you inside the pro's helmets thanks to some fancy 360 virtual tech from Intel. Speaking of replays - you can create your own with an app called Clippit. It lets you easily share video clips from live TV. Just find a moment you like and it does the heavy lifting. It will share your unique clip in a  format that’s easy for your friends on Facebook and Twitter to enjoy. Don't forget to check out the front page of the app where you can browse through popular clips currently trending. Finally - see those amazing Super Bowl ads once again, on YouTube. Their annual Adblitz lets you rewatch them all. This year you can use your voice to accomplish some Super Bowl tasks! If you have a newer Apple TV with Siri, you can simply ask Siri to "Watch the Super Bowl” and she will tune in live to the game. If you don't have the FOX Sports Go app installed she will help you get it. You can also ask Siri all kinds of Super Bowl questions including trivia and stats. If you have an Amazon Echo, you can try ordering Pizza with Alexa! Domino's and Pizza Hut offer voice ordering through the virtual assistant.

Pune, India - February 1, 2017 /MarketersMedia/ -- The mobility on demand market is driven by factors such as growing need for personal mobility in wake of rising urbanization and fall in car ownership. The factors which restrain the markets are low internet penetration in developing region and complex regulatory policies. Complete report on mobility on demand market spread across 149 pages, profiling 15 companies and supported with 64 tables and 61 figures is now available at http://www.reportsnreports.com/reports/836533-mobility-on-demand-market-by-service-type-e-hailing-car-sharing-station-based-car-rental-data-service-navigation-information-payment-connectivity-3g-4g-5g-wi-fi-and-v2v-v2i-v2p-v2n-vehicle-type-st-to-2025.html . Station based mobility market is expected to grow at the fastest CAGR. Station based mobility is incentivized by governments across the world and dedicated tracks are laid in various countries for station to station mobility. Car sharing is the second fastest growing segment. Growth of car sharing is attributed to its benefits such as getting benefits of a private vehicle without the costs and responsibilities of car ownership. Navigation service has the largest market size in data service for mobility on demand market globally. Navigation guides driver and passenger regarding location and route. Also mapping and traffic data helps better user experience. Use of navigation service is imperative for mobility on demand service.

He makes the case for businesses to take a stand. [Photo:Flickr user 5chw4r7z] More from Creative Conversations Meet The Music Nerds Behind The Tunes You Hear At Starbucks The Secret To A Perfectly Tailored Suit? For The Black Tux, It's Machine Learning "Valley Of The Gods" Recounts The Wild Ride Of Peter Thiel's Fellows Cale Guthrie Weissman 02.01.17 5:00 AM President Trump's executive order barring citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering into the U.S. has caused a lot of pushback. Hundreds of thousands of people took to both the streets and airports to protest the order this week. Lawyers worked tirelessly to help travelers enter the country. Leaders around the world denounced the policy. The response from the business community has been mixed. While some CEOs have come out strong against the ban, others have given pat, noncommittal statements, while still others have remained noticeably silent. Laszlo Bock, Google's former HR head who left the company last July, felt an imperative to take a strong line against the ban. He took to Twitter Sunday night to call for other leaders to follow suit: I spoke with him to hear more about his thoughts on the executive order, his background as a political refugee, and what leaders should do in these strange times. What follows is a transcript of our conversation. It's been edited for space and clarity. Can you give a little bit of background about the tweets you sent, and why you sent them? It's important to speak against the kind of trend in our culture to disregard the rights of people who are just as human as any of us. As somebody who worked hard and has been fortunate to end up in a position of some authority, status, and power, it's particularly important that I and people like me use our voices. I feel I have a responsibility to say something if something is wrong. You can't stand by and watch that happen. "It's particularly important that people like me use our voices." Can you talk a little bit about your background as a Romanian refugee? My father's first memories are from 1945 in Romania, hearing on the radio that "the Americans are coming . . . the Americans are coming." Eventually the communists took over Romania. For his entire life he wanted freedom—freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, freedom to think and do what he wants, freedom of religion. All these things weren't allowed under the communist regime. In the early '70s, when I was quite young, (my brother and I) had tourist visas to go from Romania to Czechoslovakia for vacation. And instead my father and my mother took us to the border of Austria, and we snuck across the border and applied for political asylum in a refugee camp in Austria. And that refugee camp is still there, housing Syrian refugees, today. From there we applied for refugee status from the United Nations, and then came to the United States. And then both my parents started their own businesses. My brother started his own business. They employed lots of people. I went into technology, because in business school I observed that technology is an industry where there's not a premium placed on lots of experience. You don't have to have 20 or 30 years' experience to have an impact and get up to speed because the field changes so quickly. And I wanted to be part of something dynamic. Eventually I got recruited by Google to lead People Operations. Do you think that tech companies specifically have an imperative to respond to what’s happening right now? I don't think tech companies are alone in having an imperative to speak out when things are happening that are wrong and unjust.From a self-interest perspective, in the long term, it's in their interests to actually make sure there is freedom—both in terms of markets, but also in terms of how people can behave and act. Innovation and creativity come from the freedom to have lots of ideas; it comes from having people literally from all over the world bringing their best ideas to this country. In a way, one of the most insidious things that's happening is the current administration is sending a tremendous signal to the rest of the world that the best, smartest people should not come to America. John Doerr [of the Kleiner Perkins venture firm] famously said that everybody from a foreign country who gets a PhD in the U.S. should get that PhD with a green card stapled to the back of it. Today, the best, smartest, most creative people—and by the way, this is true of any job, not just for white collar jobs; the people who come here and end up as landscapers—are also people who are incredibly hard working. They take enormous risks. They come here to work hard, to have a positive impact. "The current administration is sending a tremendous signal to the rest of the world that the best, smartest people should not come to America." I think it's easy to look at the tech industry and say, ‘Well, they have a special link because they employ a lot of people who come from other countries.’ But there's a couple problems with describing it that simply. That's absolutely true for the tech industry—but the agriculture industry employs a tremendous number of immigrants; the automotive industry, financial services, employ a lot of immigrants. They all have an interest in this particular issue, as well as a lot of other political issues. Do you think there’s a double standard with tech companies being asked to respond, compared to other industries? First, credit where it's due: Howard Schultz put out a pretty bold statement to his employees, this beautiful letter that talks about how they're going to hire 10,000 refugees in the next five years. I think that that is tremendous leadership. That said, yeah there's a difference. The tech industry seems to be more vocal on this and a lot of other issues. And it's important that the tech industry be vocal about it. I can draw a parallel to roughly four or five years ago at Google, when the decision was made to start disclosing diversity numbers, and the rest of the industry followed suit. [editor's note: Google first released its diversity report in 2014; the only company of a similar size to release data earlier is Intel.] And ever since, there's progress made, but not as much as people would like—not as much as I would have liked when I was in that job. [Now] the industry gets beat up for not doing enough on diversity. "Innovation and creativity come from the freedom to have lots of ideas; it comes from having people literally from all over the world bringing their best ideas to this country." I'm impressed that the tech industry is weighing in on this issue, just like I'm impressed that Howard Shultz and Starbucks are weighing in on this issue. It's a shared issue across lots of organizations, large and small, and just like the diversity issue, when you look beneath the covers, every company has the same issues. As a company, there are clear incentives not to speak up because you don't want to get pilloried in the press. You don't want to offend whatever regulators there might be. And you draw attention to by speaking up. But the fact is, on the diversity issue, the tech industry has made slow and modest but real progress in a way that has not happened in other industries. And on the issue of immigration, the industry needs to keep pushing in that direction. "If you're a company that wants to keep the best people, the best people generally want to work for companies that do care about these kinds of issues." On the issue of immigration I expect to see the same. And it would be amazing if other industries that had exactly the same interest and perhaps even the same set of values spoke up in a similar way. And, by the way, it's what their employees want. This is driven by people in the companies saying, ‘I want to work for this kind of company.’ Another layer of self-interest is, if you're a company that wants to keep the best people—even if you don't care about immigration—the best people generally want to work for companies that do care about these kinds of issues. And they're going to end up there. So what’s next? We have this executive order, people initially responding. What do business leaders do now? I think there's a set of business leaders who have the ear of the administration or have connections and influence. And they should use that to have a positive, constructive conversation and try to end up in a more sensible, realistic place. It's important to make public statements because it sends a signal to the rest of society about what's important. And silence sends a signal about what is not important. It's important for companies to take care of their own people. And it's important for them to support efforts to advance not just what's right, but also what is in their own business interest in the long term, and in the interest of their employees. "It's important to make public statements because it sends a signal to the rest of society about what's important." They do that by [making] donations to nonprofit organizations. I know a lot of people who are attorneys who are volunteering time, doing a tremendous amount of pro bono work. There's a lot that can be done. The human beings being held at airports who legally are entitled to representation, they should be afforded representation. And for a large company, it's a rounding error if people take a day off to help with this kind of thing. It's a lot of small, incredibly meaningful ways to provide support. Anything else you think is important to mention? The one other thing is [that] obviously there's always a wide range of issues that companies care about when it comes to their relations with the government. There's trade issues, there's security issues, privacy issues. There's a lot of issues. And organizations tend to be pretty thoughtful about weighing on which issues are the most important. And they also have to walk a very careful line around serving all of their customers. And for every organization, they have customers from every political belief, every orientation, every religion. So you need to be thoughtful about focusing on your business and making sure you are in touch with all of your customers. But this question of immigration is a relatively straightforward entry point for organizations. It's a discussion that is pretty tightly tied to their businesses. There's others like trade and free speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, that don't have as an immediate day-to-day impact on a business's operation, but have much more profound implications on long-term operations. Organizations should be thoughtful about when they want to weigh in on all of these issues. But sooner is generally better, because even though it's difficult for companies, it's relatively easy compared to others to weigh in on the question of immigration or work visas or refugees.

(AMD): The Turnaround Is Legit! AMD stock surges higher on the back of solid Q4 earnings, led by spot-on investments that target major market opportunities By Tom Taulli, InvestorPlace Writer & IPO Playbook Editor  |  Jan 31, 2017, 5:06 pm EST     View All   Popular Posts: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Is Too Dangerous Ahead of Earnings Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): The Turnaround Is Legit! Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Cracks All-Time Highs With a Big Q4 Beat Recent Posts: Warning: Don’t Sell Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Short! Should I Buy Chevron Corporation (CVX) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Cracks All-Time Highs With a Big Q4 Beat View All Posts Turnarounds usually aren’t neat, orderly affairs, but Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) just keeps building momentum as the semidconductor firm continues to remake itself. Fourth-quarter earnings out Tuesday evening launched AMD stock by another 5% in after-hours trading, continuing a roughly yearlong run that hasn’t seen much in the way of pullbacks. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr For Q4, AMD posted an adjusted loss of 1 cent a share on revenues of $1.11 billion, which were up 15.4% year-over-year. While earnings were in line with Wall Street expectations, sales beat by about $40 million. Also driving AMD stock higher was upbeat earnings guidance for the current quarter. Advanced Micro Devices forecasts revenues to range from $955 million to $1.02 billion. Using the midpoint, AMD would be looking at an 18% increase to $989 million — well above analyst expectations for $964 million. Some additional highlights from AMD’s fourth quarter: The Computing and Graphics unit saw its revenues jump by 28% to $600 million. The cash balance increased by $6 million, for a total of $1.26 billion. The company announced the brand of its new chips, called Ryzen. One example of the technology’s power: Combined with its Vega GPU, it allows a desktop to run Star Wars: Battlefront – Rogue One at 60 frames per second in 4K. The company announced a collaboration with Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) for the Radeon GPU technology for cloud computing. AMD announced Radeon Instinct, which allows for high-end deep learning. The product is expected to hit the markets in the first half of this year. AMD Is Primed for Growth UDPATE: Management typically is conservative when it comes to earnings guidance, so we can anticipate nice traction in 2017, driven by Ryzen. For the most part, the technology looks like it has better performance and power usage compared to Intel Corporation’s (NASDAQ:INTC) 8-core, 3.2GHz Core i7-6900K that came out in May — and it’s cheaper. No surprise, then, that Alphabet has teamed up with AMD. But don’t expect the large-cap tech partnerships to end there, and instead expect them to extend to the likes of Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) and Salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM)? Headline-making deals like this could very well drive AMD stock in 2017. From CEO Lisa Su: “As we enter 2017, we are well  positioned and on-track to deliver our strongest set of high-performance computing and graphics products in more than a decade.” So, should bulls exercise any caution? Well, AMD stock has already staged an amazing rally, and yes, we probably won’t see a repeat of 2016’s triple-digit gains.

Google hopes you are while you also spend time watching Super Bowl LI. The NFL football championship between the Atlanta Falcons and the New England Patriots will also see the company show off its Google Home connected speaker as part of the huge TV commercial festivities. See also: Watch two Google Home speakers share a deep conversation 4 weeks ago Ad Age reports that Google is keeping the content of the Google Home ad a secret until the big game itself on Sunday, Feb. 5. Advertisers are spending $5 million for each 30-second Super Bowl commercial, so you would think Google has something pretty cool to show off, especially since the speaker itself has been available to buy for a few months now. Google joins a number of tech companies who will be running ads during Super Bowl LI. They include wireless carriers Sprint and T-Mobile, chip maker Intel, and software services like GoDaddy, SquareSpace, Wix.com and TurboTax. It will also feature an ad for the mobile game strategy game Evony: The King’s Return, and that particular commercial is supposed to be full of celebrities.

(Mike Rogoway/The Oregonian) Print Email Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive By Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive The Oregonian Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 31, 2017 at 8:10 PM, updated January 31, 2017 at 8:17 PM comments Puppet, Portland's biggest young technology company, said Tuesday that it will work to support refugees following President Trump's order to ban migration from seven countries where a majority of the population is Muslim. "The recent immigration ban that has placed travel restrictions on people who make important contributions to global and U.S. economies has impacted most businesses, countless individuals and families," new Puppet chief executive Sanjay Mirchandani wrote on the company's website. An immigrant himself, Mirchandani attended school in India and said he became a U.S. citizen at the first opportunity. He promised Puppet would match employee donations to the American Civil Liberties Union, up to $25,000. The ACLU is among the organizations that has filed legal challenges to Trump's ban. Puppet did not say it opposes the ban, but said it will work to support refugees. "Though we're a small company with limited resources, there's a lot we can do," Mirchandani wrote. "We're in the process of identifying how our employees at our offices around the world can support the refugees in our communities." Several tech companies have expressed varying degrees of opposition to Trump's order. Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich told employees over the weekend that the immigration ban "is not a policy we can support." Columbia Sportswear and Nike have issued strongly worded denunciations of Trump's action. And on Tuesday, the Portland Business Alliance and Oregon Business Council said they find the immigration ban "deeply troubling." Puppet makes technology to help organizations manage large computing systems. It employs more than 500, most of them at its downtown Portland headquarters. -- Mike Rogoway; twitter: @rogoway; 503-294-7699   Inside Silicon Forest About Mike Rogoway Email Mike Rogoway Follow @rogoway Most Read Active Discussions About Us About OregonLive.com Our Journalists Contact the newsroom Join our team Frequently Asked Questions Subscriber Services Advertise with us Subscribe Today The Oregonian Email Newsletters Already a Subscriber Manage your Subscription Delivery Feedback Place a vacation hold Make a payment OregonLive.com Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Opinion Obituaries Videos Weather Sitemap & search Your Regional News Pages Clackamas County Gresham Portland Washington County Mobile iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps More on OregonLive.com Classifieds Jobs Autos Rentals Real Estate Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sponsor Content Local Deals Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Pinterest | Instagram | Tumblr Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2016 Oregon Live LLC.

Su specified the target date during the companys fourth-quarter earnings call Tuesday afternoon. There will be widespread system availability from day one, Su said during the call. Channel vendors will receive the first Ryzen chips, along with system integrators. More traditional hardware vendors will come later, Su added. That statement implies that vendors like Dell or HP (neither of which have been officially confirmed to be using the Ryzen chip) will be asked to wait, while AMD caters to boutique PC vendors. Ryzen will take on Intels highest-end Core chips, specifically the Core i5 and Core i7 processors, Su said. Sus comments seemingly back up what a Game Developers Conference presentation revealed earlier: that Ryzen would launch before March 3. ( http://www.pcworld.com/article/31566...p-reveals.html ) (Su didnt specifically confirm our report sourced from the GDC document, however.) Su also revealed that its Zen-based server product, Naples, will launch in the second quarter. Whats new, though, is a Vega timetable: Su revealed that the Vega GPUs will ship during the second quarter as well. In the second half of 2017, AMD still plans to launch a Zen-based APU, codenamed Raven Ridge, primarily designed for notebooks but also some desktops Source and complete info: http://www.pcworld.com/article/31635...-vega-gpu.html Last edited by chispy; 02-01-2017 at 04:42.     chispy View Public Profile Find all posts by chispy     (#2) chispy Ancient Guru     Videocard: eVGA GTX1070 SC @ EK H2O Processor: i5 3570K @ Swiftech H2O Mainboard: ASRock Z75-Pro3 Memory: G.Skill RJX 2400Mhz 16GB Soundcard: X-Fi Titanium HD PSU: Rosewill Photon-1200W 02-01-2017, 04:40 | posts: 7,320 | Location: In Paradise :) Finally we have some more accurate info on the release date.

While it might be great for AMD if they have a competitive 8 core CPU priced at $800, it's hardly going to have the disruptive influence we all hope it will. "High end" is admittedly very vague, and I hope I'm reading too much into this, but it *might* suggest higher pricing on Ryzen than we're all hoping for.     rhysiam View Public Profile Find all posts by rhysiam   (#9) Cityhunter1 Newbie   Videocard: Titan X Maxwell Processor: i5 5675c Mainboard: Memory: Soundcard: PSU: Corsair SFX 02-01-2017, 12:25 | posts: 1 I disagree, I've been holding off building a highend workstation rig.

Hi there I must disagree, dual socket motherboard still have space on market, although Intel killed that by not allowing i7 or i5 to be used on these boards in dual CPU configuration and due this no allowing them to OC, last good OC dual socket motherboard has been SR2 from EVGA which allowed people to use Xeon CPU and OC them although no i7 or i5 Some task you can do on GPGPU, but not every one, same can apply to rendering, some rendering SW doesn't support GPU rendering I disagree with there aren't really any CPU bound workstation tasks, you are not used probably for while some SW which use multiple cores, I've used E5-2683v3 which 14c/28t CPU and have used that chip mostly for rendering and for production works etc, my i7-5820k is fast enough but in some tasks E5-2683v3 has been lot better than i7 If prices will be good enough I will go too with dual socket board Hope this helps Thanks, Jura     jura11 View Public Profile Find all posts by jura11   (#19) schmidtbag Maha Guru     Videocard: HIS R9 290 Processor: AMD FX-6300 @ 4.5GHz Mainboard: GA-890FXA-UD5 Rev 2.0 Memory: 8GB DDR3 Soundcard: Realtek ALC889 PSU: Apevia 700W 02-01-2017, 17:11 | posts: 1,173 | Location: MA, USA @Jura Like I said, there isn't much of a purpose for multi-socket workstations, but there is plenty of highly relevant uses for multi-socket servers, even if it's just a small one next to your workstation. Though I understand what you're saying, a lot of what you're referring to could easily be offloaded to server(s). If your application is not able to offload processing power to a separate PC, I would find that application very questionable. I'm not aware of any serious applications that use more than 16 threads and cannot offload calculations to another computer. Generally, you don't want to be doing any serious rendering or calculations on your workstation; you want to offload it to something else. Assuming the work you're doing is important, you don't want heavy calculations slowing down your workflow and you don't want to risk anything crashing. So, getting a separate rendering server is usually the best bet.     schmidtbag View Public Profile Find all posts by schmidtbag   (#20) Ryu5uzaku Ancient Guru     Videocard: 980ti gaming 1490/7700 Processor: 3770K @ 4.4 stock voltage Mainboard: z68 crap Memory: 16GB Soundcard: Meridian 2G PSU: 850W SF platinum 02-01-2017, 19:04 | posts: 6,250 | Location: Finland So march I can finally ditch this mess of a pc.

Just like ps4 at first they will loose some money but as they sell more and more they will start making a profit while hitting intel where it hurts. IF they dont price agressively they are in great trouble. Many people have went intel route for pc gaming as they offer best performance and amd knows this. They are aiming to take back the customers they lost when phenom-till current cpu's dont compete well with intel. I believe their will be a price war between these two great companies. I can't wait to see how this all fairs out in the next year for amd. I am hoping they will push intel into corner where they have to produce some new cpu's (not just refreshes like the last couple years) or risk following amd's footsteps.     dudecat64 View Public Profile Find all posts by dudecat64   (#24) DeskStar Master Guru     Videocard: x4 eVGA GTX TITAN SC Processor: i7-3970x @ 4.5ghz 1.41v Mainboard: ASUS RIVE X79 Memory: 65gb G Skill RJ's @ 2133 Soundcard: Corsair Headset PSU: X3 1500watt PSU's Yesterday, 15:12 | posts: 178 | Location: MI Quote: Originally Posted by kilyan I have the fx 8350 and i'm very satisfied with it. Maybe you have core parking active? you have to disable it if it is enabled, to get max performance. Or why you say is not so good? There is obvious draw backs to using (as of now) AMD processors when paired with a high end GPU. A multitude of videos on YouTube showing the compared performance of AMD vs Intel when paired with one or more high end gpu's. It is actually pretty horrendous if you must know. I've been trying to hold off for quite some time on building a new computer. I'm talking that I've literally had the cart full online and "something" happens during checkout that does not allow the order to go through. Took it as an omen and decided to hold off. Especially after seeing how bad the performance to watts were with current AMD setups. I am hoping for big, wonderful amazing things with AMD this go'round.     DeskStar View Public Profile Find all posts by DeskStar   (#25) DeskStar Master Guru     Videocard: x4 eVGA GTX TITAN SC Processor: i7-3970x @ 4.5ghz 1.41v Mainboard: ASUS RIVE X79 Memory: 65gb G Skill RJ's @ 2133 Soundcard: Corsair Headset PSU: X3 1500watt PSU's Yesterday, 15:14 | posts: 178 | Location: MI Quote: Originally Posted by GhostXL If Ryzen can prove faster than my cpu/mb/memory and be cheaper than Intel, I may give AMD a go this time.

I've been scratching this itch of wanting to build another system for over a year now and it is getting progressively harder and harder each day.

Preview of 2017 Super Bowl commercials: Budweiser takes on immigration by: Rodney Ho, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Updated: Jan 31, 2017 - 9:01 PM Twtter Companies are reportedly paying Fox up to $5 million per 30-second ad in hopes of reaching more than 100 million viewers at any given moment during the Super Bowl on Sunday. There are about 70 slots available during the game. >> For complete coverage of Super Bowl LI, click here To maximize exposure, marketers  are less and less likely to “surprise” viewers on Super Bowl Sunday. Rather, they are often releasing ads or “trailer” teasers of ads in advance in hopes to capture buzz on top of those 30 seconds. We in the media play into the interest by writing about the ads, which are usually a mix of maudlin and humorous, with celebrity names thrown in for good measure. Here are a few ads already out there. Budweiser is a perennial and its ads frequently top the favorites list every year. This one below focuses, coincidentally or not, on the immigrant experience, which also includes a little xenophobic comment as the founder of Budweiser enters the United States from Germany. “You’re not wanted here!” some dude says to him. “Go back home!” But he stays and creates Budweiser. Snickers is trying something different by shooting its ad live during the game featuring actor Adam Driver, who has had roles in the "Star Wars" sequel trilogy and HBO comedy-drama series "Girls." Skittles is going for humor, too, and this one’s amusing, with a gopher thrown in for good measure. It’s already received 3.5 million views as of Tuesday evening. Intel smartly hired Patriots quarterback Tom Brady for an ad before knowing he’d be in the Super Bowl. SquareSpace, a website builder, blog platform, hosting service and domain name registrar, hired John Malkovich. GoDaddy, another web domain registrar, is back again and going for animal humor in some ads, like one with a cat and another with a panda, and taking on pop culture moments, like the dress, in others. Two teasers are below. The others can be seen on GoDaddy's YouTube playlist. Website developer wix.com decided to turn its ad into an action scene in a restaurant featuring “Wonder Woman” actress Gil Gadot and “Expendables” star Jason Statham. Kia hired Melissa McCarthy. TurboTax reaches for Humpty Dumpty, and you can guess what happens to poor Humpty. Mr. Clean decided to get into real good shape. Peter Fonda returns, in a sense, to “Easy Rider” land for Mercedes-Benz. If you like avocados and miss Jon Lovitz on “Celebrity Apprentice,” this is for you. Steve Carell stars in a Honda ad. Here’s the teaser: Lexus has already released a dance-themed extended version of what will air on Sunday featuring Sia’s "Move Your Body." Febreze positions itself right after halftime and right before Lady Gaga for a reason, according to this teaser. Tide hired Jeffrey Tambor and Rob Gronkowski – for contrast purposes. This is the teaser: Wendy’s tries for humor in its first Super Bowl ad in a 50 years. KFC is using Rob Riggle and Billy Zane dressed as Colonel Sanders. One of the teasers is below: And here’s a cute King’s Hawaiian ad. This is the first time the roll company has opted for the Super Bowl. According to Ad Age’s Super Bowl ad tracker, Tiffany & Co. has hired Lady Gaga for an ad while other advertisers include Buick, Audi, Hyundai, WeatherTech, Wonderful Pistachios, Bai, Busch, Fiji Water, Top Games USA, GNC, It’s a Ten Haircare, Persil, 84 Lumber, Sprint and Wealthsimple. Some advertisers from last year that are skipping out this time: Butterfinger, Doritos, Heinz, Mini USA, Taco Bell, Toyota and Visa. © 2017 Cox Media Group.

Disney and three of its units are the last remaining defendants in a class-action lawsuit alleging the studios conspired to suppress wages through a “gentleman’s agreement” to not recruit each other’s workers. Attorneys for Disney and employees submitted a court filing Tuesday seeking approval of their settlement. Comcast Corp.’s DreamWorks Animation SKG previously agreed to a $50 million settlement, while two Sony Pictures units and Blue Sky Studios reached deals totaling $19 million. Apple Inc., Google, Intel Corp. and Adobe Systems Inc. paid $415 million in 2015 to resolve their part in a similar case that was brought against Silicon Valley technology companies that had been investigated for collusion by the U.S. Justice Department. Orly Lobel, a law professor at the University of San Diego, predicted Disney’s settlement will win approval because it satisfies requirements the agreement is fair, reasonable and adequate. Last Holdout “Given that this was the last holdout, there are already proxies of what should be the lump sum and it seems within the range," Lobel said. A $100 million settlement for one large company is proportional to the $415 million agreed to by several technology giants in the previous case, and the much smaller earlier settlements, she said. A Disney spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a call after regular business hours seeking comment on the agreement. The studios case is Nitsch v. DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc., 14-cv-04062, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose). Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

CreditPhotograph by Goh Seng Chong / Bloomberg / Getty Over the weekend, Jeffrey Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric, the venerable manufacturing conglomerate that dates back to 1892—and Thomas Edison—issued a statement to G.E.’s employees distancing the company from Donald Trump’s travel bans on people from predominantly Muslim nations. “We have many employees from the named countries and we do business all over the region,” Immelt pointed out. He said the firm would “stand with” its employees and customers in the countries affected by Trump’s discriminatory policy. That was a laudable statement, and Immelt, a longtime G.E. executive, deserves credit for issuing it. On the same day it was issued, however, the National Association of Manufacturers, which has representatives from G.E. and many other large U.S. companies on its board of directors, was striking a very different pose toward the Trump Administration. It ran ads on the Sunday talk shows urging congressional confirmation for Scott Pruitt, the attorney general of Oklahoma, whom Trump has chosen to run the Environmental Protection Agency. Pruitt has close ties to the oil-and-gas industry. He is an archenemy of federal regulations and laws that are designed to tackle global warming and other environmental threats, but which one of the trade association’s ads describe as “job-killing regulations slapped on manufacturers, energy producers, and farmers.” If Pruitt is confirmed, he will almost certainly roll back many federal directives, lowering the financial costs facing big companies like G.E. The juxtaposition of Immelt’s statement with the expression of support for Pruitt summed up corporate America’s Janus-faced attitude to the Trump Administration. On the one hand, many senior executives welcome the promises to cut corporate taxes and make a bonfire of federal regulations. They also fear incurring Trump’s wrath and appearing on his Twitter feed. At the annual Alfalfa Club dinner, in Washington, on Saturday, a long-established get-together for corporate bigwigs, one C.E.O. approached a rival and inquired how he could condemn Trump’s executive order “without poking the bear,” the Times columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin reports. The answer to the anonymous C.E.O.’s query was that it probably can’t be done. Trump is a vengeful figure who takes careful note of slights and sometimes brings them up months or years later. As President, he has the power to punish firms and individuals that cross him. For some Fortune 500 companies, such as defense contractors like G.E. and Boeing, and the big pharmaceutical companies, representatives of which met with Trump at the White House on Tuesday, the federal government is a big customer: huge contracts are at stake. Banks and other financial firms require good relationships with the federal agencies that regulate them. Corporate mergers, such as the pending one between A.T. & T. and Time Warner, require approval. In a normal Administration, it might be outlandish to suggest that the President would interfere with the workings of specialist federal agencies, such as the Justice Department’s antitrust bureau. But of course, there is little that is normal about Trump or his Presidency. Shortly before he took office, he met with Randall Stephenson, the chief executive of A.T. & T. Afterward, A.T. & T. officials insisted that the pending merger didn’t come up in the discussions, but public-interest groups pointed out that the meeting violated long-standing tradition that Presidents (and Presidents-elect) avoid direct contact with parties that have important regulatory decisions pending. In this environment, it is understandable that C.E.O.s, mindful of their shareholders and their own hefty stock-and-option packages, are reluctant to criticize the new Administration’s policies, let alone Trump himself. But it’s also becoming evident that, in many areas, the long-term interests of America’s biggest corporations, far from being aligned with the Trump Presidency, run directly counter to it. In terms of outlook, organization, and revenues, firms like G.E., General Motors, Caterpillar, Apple, Google, and Facebook are globalists. The Administration is isolationist—its slogan is “America First.” Multinational corporations prosper from free trade, open markets, and offshoring; the Administration is protectionist and intent on preserving U.S. manufacturing jobs. Trump’s chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, describes himself as “an economic nationalist.” To gain access to foreign markets and foreign talent, the multinationals rely on America’s “soft power”—the ability to get other countries to act in the interest of the United States and its citizens, including its corporate citizens, without using force. Trump is undermining U.S. soft power by the day. Demonstrations against him have been held all over the world, and many foreign governments increasingly view his America as a rogue nation. Pointing out that, in the past, big companies have coöperated with authoritarian regimes won’t make this conflict of interest go away. The U.S. economy isn’t an autarky like Germany in the nineteen-thirties, where Volkswagen, Bayer, Siemens, and other German corporations benefitted from protectionism, the outlawing of independent trade unions, and big government contracts. In today’s economy, firms like G.E., Intel, and Apple get most of their revenue from overseas, and their operations are spread all over the world. What matters to them most is the preservation of a global trading system that took decades to build. Trump, with his chauvinistic rhetoric, his opposition to multilateral trade deals, and his casual denigration of multilateral organizations like the European Union and NATO, represents a threat to that system. So far, no well-known C.E.O. has come out and said all this explicitly, although Immelt did hint at some of it. “There would be no GE without our smart dedicated colleagues from all over the world,” he wrote. “We are a global team, and we will stand together as the global political situation continues to evolve.” In another significant development, Netflix’s Reed Hastings expostulated the ethical argument against the ban as well as the economic one. “Trump’s actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world, and are so un-American it pains us all,” Hastings said on Facebook. “It is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity.” (My colleague Vauhini Vara wrote about Silicon Valley’s reaction to the travel bans.) In the weeks and months ahead, it will be interesting to see which, if any, corporate leaders summon the courage to follow Hastings’s lead. Tax cuts and regulatory relief are one thing. But for some of America’s biggest and most successful companies, the issues here are much bigger. With Trump and Bannon in the White House, their entire ecosystem is under threat.

Since its introduction as a premium gaming notebook vendor a few years ago, AORUS has become an established gaming notebook vendor.   AORUS is actually part of GIGABYTE Technology, a vendor who specializes in everything from notebooks to motherboard to gaming accessories. GIGABYTE has its own factories and assembly plants, as well as their own design teams. Their vision for AORUS was to put together their top resources to take on the crowded gaming notebook market where competition is fierce.     The AORUS X3 Plus v6 is a small 13-inch gaming notebook, but it packs one heck of a punch. Not only does it have an overclocked Skylake mobile processor, an IGZO QHD+ display, a GTX 1060, and two M.2 x4 PCI-E 3.0 ports, it also has a ton of the latest features such as USB 3.1 and HDMI 2.0 to ensure maximum connectivity.   Without further hesitation, let us begin the review and see what this notebook can do.     Specifications     Our configuration is the X3 Plus v6 came with two 512GB Samsung NVMe M.2 drives, but they weren't RAIDed. I am not sure if this is the intended design, or if this review sample had its RAID configuration screwed up and no one set it up before I got it, but in the UEFI you can setup RAID of the two NVMe drives.   AORUS is using the Intel i7-6820HK overclock-able Skylake mobile processor, a GTX 1060, as well as Killer wired LAN and Intel Wireless. The notebook weighs 1.8KG and has dimensions of 330x263.5x22.9mm (WxDxH).     Our configuration uses 16GB of G.Skill DDR4 overclocked to 2400MHz using XMP. The notebook also has a light sensor right near the HD camera.     Pricing   The X3 Plus v6 in our configuration costs a little over $2000, there is a configuration on Newegg which costs $1999, but only has a single M.2 drive.

The AtlanticFebruary 1, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Super Bowl ads, for all their running dachshunds and anthropomorphic foodstuffs and movie stars past their prime, often offer surprising insight into the state of the American psyche. 2016’s ads, with their Seth Rogen/Amy Schumer political campaigns and their opioid-induced constipation meds, took a fairly sharp look at the issues dominating the cultural landscape, while 2015’s largely offered a portrait of masculinity under siege by hunger and tiny cars and erectile dysfunction. So the question for 2017 is, how political will this year’s Super Bowl ads be? With the country still largely divided over the efficacy and legitimacy of President Donald Trump, will brands lean in to the conflict or try their utmost to avoid it? As some early reveals have indicated, it’s tricky territory to navigate, with even the blandest of cultural icons (Tom Brady, avocados) falling into the divide. Recommended: 'The Daily Show' Lives On (on 'The Late Show With Stephen Colbert') The earliest signal comes from Budweiser, whose minute-long ad, “Born the Hard Way,” debuted early. After a weekend of protests regarding President Trump’s ban on refugees and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries, the spot is undeniably timely, focusing on a German immigrant who makes it to America. Despite hazardous voyages and furious crowds who shout, “You’re not wanted here,” the young man arrives in St. Louis, where, it turns out, he ends up becoming one half of the duo that created Budweiser. The message is indisputable: Immigrants have long formed the fabric of American culture, even birthing the most iconically American beer that exists today. “Adolphus Busch made an incredible journey to this country, and that’s really what this is about. It’s about his vision, his dream, everything that he does to achieve that,” Ricardo Marques, the vice president for Budweiser in the U.S., told Adweek. “Even though it happened in the 1850s, it’s a story that is super relevant today.” But he denied that the ad was deliberately drawing parallels with topical events, stating, “There’s really no correlation with anything else that’s happening in the country.” Recommended: How to Build an Autocracy Predictably, though, the spot has been interpreted as offering a clear-cut message. “Budweiser Debuts Pro-Immigration Super Bowl Ad,” the right-wing news site Breitbart reported, while The AV Club announced, “Budweiser to ruin red-state Super Bowl parties with pro-immigration ad.” It seems, with this particular campaign, that Budweiser is working on multiple fronts: On the one hand, it can signal its virtue winkingly to liberal consumers, while assuring conservatives that it’s simply telling its own origin story, which happens to embody the archetypal American dream. By no means is this kind of complex maneuvering going to be anomalous over the next four years. As Nato Thompson, the author of Culture as Weapon told me last week, “I think that under Trump we’re going to be in for a lot more of brands for social justice, because, I suspect, a lot of people are going to be unhappy with him, even if they supported him ... a lot of companies will be able to position themselves as being against the current system, when really in fact they’re not against it at all.” There are, of course, brands that stay out of the fray altogether, like Skittles, whose new Super Bowl ad plays on the premise that everyone likes candy, regardless of generation. And there are those that are comfortable enough with their consumer base to take a firm posture, like Kia, whose new ad featuring Melissa McCarthy focuses on the perils of being a devoted eco-warrior. But there are also companies that get dragged into the debate whether they want to or not. Avocados From Mexico’s new ad, timed to coincide with the biggest night of the year for the fruit, has been inadvertently politicized by President Trump’s suggested tariff on Mexican imports to pay for a border wall. And Intel’s ad, featuring Tom Brady at home, attempts to sell the superstar athlete as an everyman (eating breakfast, brushing his teeth, going to the bathroom), but coincides with recent sportswriters stating that Brady no longer gets a pass on his longtime friendship with Trump. In the end, only time will tell if Budweiser’s pointed ad gets a pass from Trump fans. As recent months have shown, when it comes to the 45th president, not even the most established brands—Yuengling, New Balance—can avoid controversy.

BUSINESS COMPANY TOWN Disney agrees to $100-million settlement in anti-poaching lawsuit brought by animators A scene from Walt Disney Co.'s animated hit "Zootopia." Walt Disney Co. A scene from Walt Disney Co.'s animated hit "Zootopia." A scene from Walt Disney Co.'s animated hit "Zootopia." (Walt Disney Co.) Daniel MillerContact Reporter Walt Disney Co. has agreed to pay $100 million to settle a long-running lawsuit brought by animators and visual effects workers who alleged that several Hollywood companies had adhered to an anti-poaching pact that kept pay down. Burbank-based Disney, whose subsidiaries Pixar Animation Studios and Lucasfilm were also named in the class-action case, was the last entertainment company to agree to settle the dispute. Defendants including DreamWorks Animation, Sony Pictures Animation and 20th Century Fox’s Blue Sky Studios agreed to settlements last year. In all, the deals would total about $170 million for the plaintiffs. The class-action lawsuit was filed by former DreamWorks Animation artist Robert Nitsch Jr. in September 2014. The complaint, lodged in U.S. District Court in San Jose, alleged visual effects and animation companies “conspired to systematically suppress the wages and salaries of those who they claim to prize as their greatest assets — their own workers.”  The complaint alleged that the practice began in the 1980s when Pixar and Lucasfilm agreed to an anti-poaching pact (before they were owned by Disney), whereby the companies agreed to not “cold call” each other’s employees. The lawsuit sought an unspecified amount of money including compensatory damages and legal costs, plus a permanent injunction to prohibit anti-poaching agreements. Disney’s proposed settlement, filed on Tuesday, must be approved by U.S. District Judge Lucy H. Koh. The agreement, which includes Pixar, Lucasfilm and another Disney subsidiary, Two Pic MC, would be the largest of any of the defendants’ settlements.  The class was certified by Koh in May; it totaled more than 10,000 people, according to a court filing at the time. “We achieved a recovery for the class that we think is substantial and fair,” said attorney Steven G. Sklaver of Susman Godfrey, who represented the plaintiffs along with lawyers from Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll and Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro. “This is a conspiracy that involved suppressing compensation for employees all because it was viewed to be a cost that the companies didn’t want to incur.” Disney did not respond to requests for comment. The lawsuit was filed following a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into anti-poaching tactics used by companies including Pixar, Apple, Google and Intel. The companies settled with the Department of Justice in 2010, agreeing to a prohibition against engaging in anticompetitive no-solicitation agreements. After the Department of Justice’s probe ended, those companies and others — including Lucasfilm — faced a separate class-action lawsuit over poaching claims that was brought by software engineers in 2012. That case, also overseen by Koh, was settled in 2015. Caption 'Step' shows us its moves at Sundance The young women in "Step" demonstrate a routine at the L.A.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Feb 1, 2017 at 1:40PM Shares of Silicon Motion Technology (NASDAQ:SIMO) recently dipped after the SSD controller and specialty RF IC maker's robust fourth quarter growth was overshadowed by soft guidance for the first quarter. The company's fourth quarter revenue rose 47% annually to $144.2 million, beating estimates by $2.5 million. Earnings per ADS surged 73% to $0.95 per share, topping expectations by $0.06. Image source: Getty Images. But for the first quarter, Silicon Motion expects 7% to 14% annual sales growth, which missed the consensus estimate for 20% growth. CEO Wallace Kou attributes that slowdown to tightening supplies of NAND chips, which store data in the company's Shannon and Ferri SSDs. Kou noted that sales of its SSD controllers wouldn't be affected, but the company's broad 2017 sales forecast for flat to 10% growth indicates that its top line growth could be lumpy this year. However, Silicon Motion's soft first quarter guidance is great news for Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), one of the largest NAND suppliers in the world. Let's take a look at why Silicon Motion's pain could generate big gains for Micron this year. What does Micron Technology do? Micron is the fourth largest maker of NAND chips and the third largest maker of mobile DRAM chips in the world. Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) is the top player in both markets. Up until last quarter, Micron's revenues had declined annually for six straight quarters, due to sluggish PC shipments, the commoditization of the smartphone market, and a global glut of NAND and DRAM chips driving down prices. That waning cyclical demand caused Micron stock to plummet from the mid-$30s in late 2014 to less than $10 last May. But there are clear signs that supplies are tightening up and prices are rising. Last August, HP CEO Dion Weisler warned about shortages of memory chips across the industry. In December, Trendforce's DRAMeXchange noted that rising smartphone shipments, higher demand for SSDs, and the increase in the average memory density of eMMCs and eMCPs were all causing a global shortage of chips. The firm estimated that the NAND shortage would cause prices of SSDs and eMMCs to rise "by over 10%" sequentially in the first quarter of 2017 -- which is now reflected in Silicon Motion's first quarter guidance. Investors are already bullish on Micron Silicon Motion's weak guidance shouldn't have surprised investors who were watching the memory chip market. While the confirmation of tightening supplies is a positive development for Micron, investors are likely wondering if that optimism has already been baked in given the stock's 120% rally over the past 12 months. Analysts currently expect Micron's revenue to rise 42% this year, compared to a 23% decline last year. Its non-GAAP earnings are expected to soar from $0.06 last year to $2.42 on stronger sales and pricing power. Based on these estimates, Micron trades at just 9 times forward earnings. But mind the headwinds... However, there are also some major headwinds on the horizon. Samsung, Toshiba, and Western Digital's (NASDAQ:WDC) SanDisk could hurt Micron in the NAND market with their superior scale. Toshiba owns a NAND joint venture with WD, but it could soon sell its stake to WD to offset steep losses at its nuclear power division -- making WD a dangerous foe for Samsung and Micron. Samsung and SK Hynix could apply similar pressure on Micron in the mobile DRAM market. Lastly, Micron has warned that Chinese chipmakers could flood the market with cheap memory chips in the near future. To widen its moat against these rivals, Micron has developed next-gen memory technologies like 3D NAND and 3DXpoint with its longtime partner Intel. It's also acquired smaller memory chipmakers like Inotera Memories to grow its market share. The key takeaway The memory chip market is a notoriously fickle and cyclical one, so investors shouldn't simply assume that tightening demand and rising prices will lift Micron stock to fresh highs. But if Micron can stay ahead of the tech curve and keep growing inorganically, I believe that its shares could keep rising this year.   Leo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Feb 1, 2017 at 1:41PM Image source: AMD. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) ended 2016 on a high note. The company beat analyst estimates across the board when it reported its fourth-quarter results, driven mostly by its Polaris graphics cards. The PC CPU market also treated AMD a little better, with client processor sales improving compared to the third quarter. AMD enters 2017 on the cusp of launching what CEO Lisa Su calls "our strongest set of high-performance computing and graphics products in more than a decade." Ryzen, the company's new CPU, is now confirmed to be launching in early March, while Vega, its upcoming high-end GPU, is set to launch sometime during the second quarter. AMD is also in a far better financial position thanks to a joint venture deal and the sale of stock and convertible notes last year. The company had $1.26 billion in cash and $1.44 billion of debt at the end of 2016, compared to $785 million in cash and $2.24 billion in debt at the end of 2015. The diluted share count has jumped 17.7%, but that's a small price to pay for a sound balance sheet. Still losing money Despite beating estimates, AMD still posted a loss during the fourth quarter on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Revenue jumped 15% year over year, but seasonally low sales of semi-custom products knocked sales down 15% compared to the third quarter. AMD managed a non-GAAP operating profit, but non-GAAP EPS still came in at a loss of $0.01. GAAP EPS was a larger loss of $0.06. The computing and graphics segment, which includes GPUs and CPUs, produced $600 million of revenue, up 27.7% year over year and up 27.1% sequentially. AMD's Polaris graphics cards seem to be gaining some momentum, as they drove far less impressive growth during the third quarter. The segment posted an operating loss of $21 million, a major improvement over the $99 million loss reported during the fourth quarter of 2015. The semi-custom segment grew revenue by 3.7% year over year to $506 million. Revenue sank 39% year over year, but this was expected. The third quarter features the buildup of game console inventory for the holiday season, and with the segment still dominated by game console SoCs, there's no way to avoid this seasonality. Segment operating income was $47 million, down 20% year over year despite the higher revenue. Looking ahead AMD expects its first-quarter revenue to grow by 18% year over year, representing an 11% sequential decline. The company didn't provide earnings guidance for the quarter, but it did provide a more general outlook for 2017. AMD expects revenue to grow this year, with non-GAAP gross margin improving and non-GAAP net income turning positive. With both Ryzen and Vega launching soon, these goals aren't particularly optimistic. Whether AMD's bottom line surges enough to justify the buoyant stock price is another matter. AMD's stock soared in 2016, and the company now has a market capitalization of around $10 billion. AMD will likely need to get its operating margin into the double-digits for that price to make much sense, a tall order for a company that has lost money in each of the past five years. There's still plenty we don't know about Ryzen and Vega. Su talked about Ryzen during the conference call, but there wasn't much new information. The initial launch will be focused on the high end, competing with Intel's i7 and i5 chips, with the lineup eventually filled out with lower-end products. The breadth of the initial launch is still an unknown, as is pricing. Even less is known about Vega. 2017 looks like it will be the year that AMD returns to profitability, at least on a non-GAAP basis. The size of those profits depends on whether Ryzen and Vega live up to expectations. With Ryzen set to launch in a month or so, more details should be coming soon.

Tizen is mainly used in Samsung products. The release date of Tizen 4.0 is listed on the OS's developer website, which also states that the first beta of the OS will come out in June. The Tizen 4.0 release date is listed as part of the Tizen .NET roadmap. The page states that "the first official version of Tizen .NET will be released in September 2017 as a part of Tizen 4.0." The page went up recently, and an image detailing the roadmap seems to have  typographical errors. The chart is supposed to show a timeline for Tizen .NET releases extending into 2017, but the release date of Tizen 4.0 is listed for September 2016, in an apparent mistake. Tizen is a competitor of iOS and Android, but has struggled. The OS is in a handful of Samsung smartphones in India, but the handsets are stuck at version 2.4. Samsung's smart TVs and smartwatches like Gear S3 also use Tizen. The OS will be used in the company's home appliances, washing machines, and even vacuum cleaners. Most of Samsung's smartphones have Android today, but it is maintaining Tizen, as it doesn't want to put all its eggs in one basket. Samsung is developing technology so its Android mobile devices, Windows PCs and Tizen devices can easily communicate with one another. Tizen has also been ported to work on boards like Raspberry Pi and the Artik developer board. Tizen may be Samsung's ticket to success in the internet of things market, where competitive OSes include Google's Android Things and Microsoft Windows 10 IoT Core. Tizen 3.0 already supports Open Connectivity Foundation's emerging IoTivity protocol, designed for easy pairing of compatible devices. Shipments of IoT devices will outstrip smartphones in the coming years, touching 30.7 billion by 2020, and 75.4 billion by 2025, according to IHS. With Tizen 4.0 so close, Samsung is moving on quickly from Tizen 3.0, which hasn't made it to many devices yet. Tizen 3.0 was portrayed as a powerful 64-bit OS compatible with ARM and x86 processors, with support for 4K graphics and image and speech recognition. Samsung claimed Tizen 3.0 was 30 percent faster than Tizen 2.4. Tizen 4.0 will have richer features and be faster than its predecessor. It'll also be a beneficiary to Microsoft's embrace of open-source technologies. In November, Samsung announced a pact with Microsoft framed to allow .Net developers to easily write Tizen applications for mobile devices, smartwatches, smart TVs and IoT devices. Samsung is releasing previews of Tizen .NET to make that possible, and will bake a final version of related tools into Tizen 4.0. The origins of Tizen date back to 2007, when Intel started developing the Linux-based Moblin OS. In 2010, Moblin was merged with Nokia's Maemo into a new OS called Meego. That OS was then merged with LiMo to form Tizen. Tizen is considered Samsung's OS, but the development is managed by the Linux Foundation. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Credit: Samsung More like this With Viv, Samsung challenges Apple…and Google New software suggests Samsung set to launch Tizen-based smartphone Samsung hopes Raspberry Pi can spread Tizen OS adoption Video Review: Huawei's Mate 9 gives good value for the price A new version of Samsung's Tizen OS, version 4.0, is now under development for mobile devices, wearables and smart gadgets and is due for release in September. Tizen is mainly used in Samsung products. The release date of Tizen 4.0 is listed on the OS's developer website, which also states that the first beta of the OS will come out in June. The Tizen 4.0 release date is listed as part of the Tizen .NET roadmap. The page states that "the first official version of Tizen .NET will be released in September 2017 as a part of Tizen 4.0." The page went up recently, and an image detailing the roadmap seems to have typographical errors. The chart is supposed to show a timeline for Tizen .NET releases extending into 2017, but the release date of Tizen 4.0 is listed for September 2016, in an apparent mistake. Tizen is a competitor of iOS and Android, but has struggled. The OS is in a handful of Samsung smartphones in India, but the handsets are stuck at version 2.4. Samsung's smart TVs and smartwatches like Gear S3 also use Tizen. The OS will be used in the company's home appliances, washing machines, and even vacuum cleaners. Most of Samsung's smartphones have Android today, but it is maintaining Tizen, as it doesn't want to put all its eggs in one basket. Samsung is developing technology so its Android mobile devices, Windows PCs and Tizen devices can easily communicate with one another. Tizen has also been ported to work on boards like Raspberry Pi and the Artik developer board. Tizen may be Samsung's ticket to success in the internet of things market, where competitive OSes include Google's Android Things and Microsoft Windows 10 IoT Core. Tizen 3.0 already supports Open Connectivity Foundation's emerging IoTivity protocol, designed for easy pairing of compatible devices. Shipments of IoT devices will outstrip smartphones in the coming years, touching 30.7 billion by 2020, and 75.4 billion by 2025, according to IHS. With Tizen 4.0 so close, Samsung is moving on quickly from Tizen 3.0, which hasn't made it to many devices yet. Tizen 3.0 was portrayed as a powerful 64-bit OS compatible with ARM and x86 processors, with support for 4K graphics and image and speech recognition. Samsung claimed Tizen 3.0 was 30 percent faster than Tizen 2.4. Tizen 4.0 will have richer features and be faster than its predecessor. It'll also be a beneficiary to Microsoft's embrace of open-source technologies. In November, Samsung announced a pact with Microsoft framed to allow .Net developers to easily write Tizen applications for mobile devices, smartwatches, smart TVs and IoT devices. Samsung is releasing previews of Tizen .NET to make that possible, and will bake a final version of related tools into Tizen 4.0. The origins of Tizen date back to 2007, when Intel started developing the Linux-based Moblin OS. In 2010, Moblin was merged with Nokia's Maemo into a new OS called Meego. That OS was then merged with LiMo to form Tizen. Tizen is considered Samsung's OS, but the development is managed by the Linux Foundation.

The video card features a very high GPU frequency and will be among the fastest GeForce GTX 1080-based offerings from GIGABYTE and other hardware makers. The board will be the first graphics card to be sold under the Aorus brand, but soon other members of the same family will join it. Over the past several years, GIGABYTE has introduced multiple sub-brands to address the market, from gaming on a budget to the most demanding PC enthusiasts. For graphics cards, the company used the G1 Gaming and the Xtreme Gaming sub-brands for its highest-end products. In the meantime the motherboard arm of the company (which almost acts like a different company internally anyway) was using UltraDurable, SOC Force, G1 Gaming and some other names. The fact that there was a split suggested a lack of synergy, especially when GIGABYTE's main competitors were unifying their product lines under a single gaming brand. As a result, in order to make things simpler going forward, the company will consolidate its top-of-the-range offerings under just one brand, 'Aorus', which has been used for the company’s premiumhttp://forum.aorus.com/forum/main-forum/5170-what-does-aorus-logo-stands-for?p=5182#post5182 laptops so far and was introduced to 200-series motherboards with the launch of Kaby Lake in January. From now on, GIGABYTE’s most advanced products, including notebooks, motherboards, and graphics cards will carry the Aorus brand. To clarify 'why' Aorus: taken from an Aorus marketing rep forum post on 11/6/2016, 'the name AORUS stems from the Egyptian patron god Horus and was known for being a symbol of kingship in ancient Egypt. We picked Horus because we strive to be on top. We did replace the "H" with "A" to represent our philosophy of striving for grade A product and collectively as a company being the striving to better ourselves and be the "A-Team" The Aorus GeForce GTX 1080 xtreme edition 8G (GV-N1080AORUS X-8GD) in many resembles GIGABYTE’s previously announced GeForce GTX 1080 Xtreme Gaming 8G (GV-N1080XTREME-8GD). The new card has a nearly similar Windforce 3X cooling system with multiple heatpipes, two fans with special fins and RGB lighting, but a slightly altered backplate. This first Aorus video card also has exactly the same GPU frequencies as the previously announce card: 1784/1936 MHz base/boost in OC mode. The new GPU also has the same display output configuration (three DP, one HDMI, one DVI as well as one 'VR Link' - a HDMI on the back of the card). Based on the images, the PCBs of the cards are not exactly the same (at least based on the parts we can see on the images below the story), but they may be very similar. In any case, from an out-of-the-box performance point of view, the two cards would appear to perform almost exactly the same depending on firmware. The fact that the Aorus card resembles the Xtreme Gaming board is not something completely unexpected: development of brand new products takes a long time and the company already has a flagship graphics product with an advanced cooling system and feature-set that satisfies the buyer. Going forward we would expect to see exclusive Aorus offerings, but for now the new cards will resemble existing products. Meanwhile, when it comes to motherboards, all advanced Intel 270 PCH-based offerings from GIGABYTE already carry the Aorus trademark. As soon as GPU companies come up with new processors, the Aorus family will get unique graphics cards as well. Comparison of GIGABYTE's Aorus and Xtreme Gaming GTX 1080 Graphics Cards   Aorus GeForce GTX 1080 xtreme edition 8G GV-N1080AORUS X-8GD GIGABYTE GeForce GTX 1080 Xtreme Gaming 8G GV-N1080XTREME-8GD NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Founders Edition Stream Processors 2560 Texture Units 160 ROPs 64 Core Clock (MHz) 1759 - 1784 1607 Boost Clock (MHz) 1898 - 1936 1733 Memory Capacity 8 GB Type GDDR5X Clock 10 Gbps TDP 180 W Launch Date Q1 2017 Q3 2016 5/2016 Launch Price ? $680 - $744 $699 GIGABYTE did not officially announce the recommended price of the Aorus GeForce GTX 1080 xtreme edition 8G, but since the card has similarities with other products we expect the new unit to cost about the same amount of money. Right now, Newegg offers GIGABYTE’s GeForce GTX 1080 Xtreme Gaming graphics cards for $680-$744. Both the Aorus and Xtreme Gaming graphics cards come with a four-year warranty in North America (with online registration required).

POST A COMMENT 5 Comments View All Comments owan - Wednesday, February 01, 2017 - link The question for me on all of these high-end 1080's is whether or not the boost clocks cap out at 2100mhz. Sure, stock clocks will boost higher than a FE (used in the article for comparison) is supposed to, but back when I bought my card it looked like everyone was topping out around 2100mhz (+/-50 or so).... even the FE's. Whats the point of this overpriced and overbuilt card if it can't do more than that? Reply eldakka - Wednesday, February 01, 2017 - link "Whats the point of this overpriced and overbuilt card if it can't do more than that?" To overprofit from it. Reply BrokenCrayons - Thursday, February 02, 2017 - link We have a winner here! Reply Freakie - Wednesday, February 01, 2017 - link I got the Gigabyte Xtreme 1080 because it was the same price as the Founder's Edition, but had better cooling and the lighting options were a nice touch. I haven't tried rigorously overclocking it to see how far I can push it, though in general ~2035Mhz is stable in everything I throw at it. Rise of the Tomb Raider didn't much like overclocks past that but Witcher 3 handles it fine. Funny how cards are like that. Unrelated to your comment but for the article: " The new card has a nearly similar Windforce 3X cooling system with multiple heatpipes, two fans" the Windforce 3X is a 3 fan system, not a 2 fan system. Reply Achaios - Thursday, February 02, 2017 - link So, this is a rebranded Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1080 Xtreme Gaming Premium Pack 8192 MB GDDR5X. I have always thought that GIGABYTE is ASUS' younger and retarded cousin from the country where everybody is into incest. It took GIGABYTE 9 years to dig the ROG brand, to understand that it sells, and to develop a similar brand for themselves. Somebody should fire the marketing strategist they employed for the past 9 years.

Connie Warren, assistant manager of the computer centre in the Penticton London Drugs, said the staff decide to enter a contest sponsored by CPU manufacturer Intel. Warren said staff participated in a series of quizzes to test their knowledge, and racked up some high scores, enough to earn them a $10,000 prize. “We decided to give it to Columbia Elementary,” said Warren. “Seeing as it came from Intel, we’re looking at putting in some technology in the school,” said principal Lloyd Lindsay. “Some smart boards, projectors, things that, we’ve been in need of for a long time and couldn’t afford. “This came along at just the right time.”   We encourage an open exchange of ideas on this story's topic, but we ask you to follow our guidelines for respecting community standards.

By Charles McLellan | February 1, 2017 -- 16:42 GMT (08:42 PST) | Topic: Harnessing IoT in the Enterprise Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto For enterprises, the Internet of Things (IoT) currently represents something of a double-edged sword. On the one hand there are manifold opportunities to boost the efficiency of products and services, create new revenue streams and reduce operational costs by connecting all manner of devices ('things') to the internet and analysing the data they generate. On the other hand, this is still an immature market in which architectures, technologies, standards and vendors are all moving targets, making investment a risky business. In particular, security is a major worry when it comes to the IoT. FREE DOWNLOAD Special Report: Harnessing IoT in the Enterprise You can download all of the articles in this series in one PDF. It's free to registered ZDNet and TechRepublic members. Read More According to Gartner's Nick Jones, the IoT will be a 'long tail' domain, with 'things' ranging from automotive subsystems and security cameras to Bluetooth beacons, smart garments, agricultural crop sensors and many more. In the near term, 'consumerization' will play an important role, and all sorts of smart devices will find their way into businesses, causing headaches for IT managers (say hello to 'Bring Your Own Thing', or BYOT). Meanwhile, 'official' enterprise IoT deployments will concentrate on a relatively small number of use cases that can deliver demonstrable business value, says Jones. These include predictive maintenance (of HVAC systems, for example), energy saving in smart buildings, automatic replenishment (of anything from fuel tanks to beer kegs), vehicle fleet management and monitoring of assets and people. Looking further ahead, the IoT clearly has the potential to be a major driver of digital transformation, enabling new business models based on widespread internet-connected devices and the resulting data streams. CIOs will need to keep an eye on such long-term prizes while extracting business value from today's immature -- and therefore somewhat confusing -- IoT ecosystems. What does today's IoT market look like? In October last year, research/analyst firm Venture Scanner organised the 1,428 IoT startup companies it was tracking into 20 categories. These businesses were spread across 46 countries and had amassed a total of $25 billion in funding (as of January 2017, the numbers had risen to 1,544 IoT startups, 47 countries and $27bn). In terms of the number of IoT companies there's a clear consumer bias, with Home, Healthcare, Lifestyle and Fitness all making the top five: Image: ZDNet / Data: Venture Scanner However, when it comes to average funding levels, the clear leaders are Enterprise with around $78m per company and Utilities/Energy with around $69m per company: Image: Venture Scanner To get a handle on how enterprises are currently approaching the IoT, analyst firm Machina Research conducted a TIA-commissioned survey in March/April 2016 covering 200 business decision makers in US companies with annual revenues of at least $10 million (average annual revenue was $425m). The main industry sectors represented were manufacturing, banking/finance, technology and healthcare. The survey confirmed widespread interest in the IoT, with nearly half of companies (48%) already actively using IoT technologies, and a further 43 percent planning or expecting to deploy within two years (i.e. by March/April 2018): Image: Machine Research/TIA Naturally, at this stage in the game, companies will have to expend considerable effort to integrate IoT solutions with legacy business systems. According to the Machina/TIA survey, just over three-quarters of companies (76%) will be exclusively or primarily focused on this through 2017, with 60 percent expecting to be so occupied through 2020. Today's enterprise IoT landscape is a crowded and potentially confusing mix of specialist service providers, enterprise technology companies, cloud providers, telcos and systems integrators. All are in the business of helping companies to integrate IoT devices with traditional enterprise systems via communications channels (usually wireless), gateways and custom IoT software platforms, with analytics and security baked in at multiple levels. Image: Forrester Research According to the 2016 Machina/TIA survey, enterprises currently tend to choose systems integrators as trusted IoT partners, followed by 'IoT/M2M end-to-end providers using standardized cellular technologies', business software platform companies and 'IoT/M2M end-to-end providers that use low-cost proprietary networks and technology'. Together, these four categories of IoT solution provider account for three-quarters of the survey population: Image: Machina Research/TIA Whatever species of IoT solution provider you are, there's a multitude of technologies to master, some or all of which may be required in any given deployment. Gartner's Nick Jones, for example, highlights IoT device management, low-power short-range and wide-area networks, IoT processors, IoT operating systems, IoT gateways, event stream processing, IoT analytics and data science, IoT platforms and IoT security tools. No wonder many enterprises are currently content to partner with systems integrators and other third parties. However, as today's fluid and highly fragmented IoT ecosystem consolidates over the next few years, more businesses should gain the experience and confidence to carry out their own in-house IoT implementations. In 2016, only two percent of the Machina/TIA respondents were attempting this. Several IoT technology areas have multiple contenders to choose from. In low-power short-range wireless networks, for example, there is Zigbee (and other IEEE 802.15.4-based PANs), ZWave, Bluetooth (4 and 5), DASH7, WiFi, NFC and WiGig. Several options are available for low-power wide-area networking too, including proprietary technologies like Sigfox, incumbent 2G/3G cellular networks and NarrowBand IoT (NB-IoT) -- the latter being the likely long-term winner. Elsewhere, Forrester recently evaluated 11 leading vendors in the IoT platform space (and there are many more out there), namely: AWS IoT; Ayla Agile IoT Platform; Cisco Jasper Control Center; Murano IoT Platform by Exosite; GE Predix; IBM Watson IoT Platform; Xively by LogMeIn IoT Connected Product Management Platform; Microsoft Azure IoT Suite; PTC Thingworx; SAP Hana Cloud Platform IoT Services; and Zebra Technologies' Zatar IoT Cloud Service. The analyst firm identified four 'leaders' based on the strengths of their current offerings and strategic outlook: Image: Forrester Wave: IoT Software Platforms, Q4 2016 IBM's Watson IoT Platform was praised for its advanced functionality (including augmented reality, cognitive capabilities, blockchain, edge analytics, analytics tooling and natural-language processing), strong open-source focus and robust global partner ecosystem. Thingworx gots kudos for its broad wireless protocol support (short-range and WAN), strong digital twin functionality and wide range of prepackaged applications. PTC's 2015 Vuforia acquisition also gives it class-leading AR capabilities. GE's Predix focuses on industrial IoT deployments, majoring on remote monitoring, advanced predictive and edge analytics and class-leading digital twin capability. The fourth of Forrester's 'leaders', Microsoft's Azure IoT Suite, offers preconfigured solutions for predictive maintenance and remote monitoring, drawing on services such as IoT Hub, Notification Hubs, Machine Learning and Stream Analytics. Microsoft's IoT platform also garnered praise for its strong roadmap and global reach. As we've noted, there are many use cases and business models in the IoT space, and so it's no surprise, at this stage in its evolution, to find multiple standards bodies, consortia and tech industry heavyweights involved in the quest for interoperability. In February last year, for example, analyst firm IHS published an overview of 'the most influential associations and standards bodies' in the IoT space, and came up with profiles of no fewer than 55 entities, which it grouped into broad use-case categories. These were: Industrial Internet (6); Smart Home (18); Smart City (7); and Cellular/Telecommunications Connectivity (12), plus 12 further technical standards bodies. These entities include proponents of various protocols and connectors, standards bodies such as the service-layer-focused OneM2M, and industry groups like the AllSeen Alliance (which recently merged with the Open Connectivity Foundation) and the Industrial Internet Consortium. Then there are individual industry heavyweights promoting their own IoT ecosystems -- Apple, Google, Samsung and Amazon in the consumer market, and Cisco, Intel, IBM and others in the business/industrial market. As in many areas of the IoT, there are undoubtedly shakeouts and consolidations to come in the standards arena -- yet another thing for hard-pressed CIOs to keep an eye on. Outlook The IoT genie has escaped the bottle in the consumer space, particularly in the 'smart home' category, and the drawbacks of a rush to market are all too apparent in the security incidents that regularly hit the headlines. CIOs need to take note of these pitfalls, and deploy robust enterprise IoT solutions that not only deliver business value, but are also safe from the attentions of bad actors. That won't be easy in the short term, as they'll be dealing with technologies, standards and ecosystems that are undergoing rapid change. However, the long-term rewards for those who get it right should be well worth the trouble. Read more on IoT IoT's moment of truth -- who can secure the data flows?

The company has sent out invitations to a press conference on February 26 - the day before the show officially kicks off. Samsung has already said it won't be launching its next flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S8, at the event, so attention has turned to its tablet lineup. The Galaxy Tab is overdue an upgrade, after the Tab S2, which launched in late 2015, received only a minor refresh last year. Rumours suggest the Tab S3 will feature a 9.6-inch 2,048x1,536 touchscreen - the same as the 9.7-inch iPad Pro - and will be marginally thinner at 5.6mm (compared to 6.1mm) It will feature a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, and will come in two versions - one WiFi-only and the other adding 4G connectivity. Read More Samsung Galaxy TabPro S review - a flawed rival to the Surface Pro 4 It will have a 12-megapixel rear camera and a 5-megapixel selfie camera, and will run Android 7.0 Nougat. The Tab S3 is expected to launch in Korea in March with a price of around 700,000 won - which translates into roughly $600 or £480. Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 MWC kicks off on Monday, February 27, with technology companies from around the globe descend on Barcelona to showcase their latest smartphones, tablets and wearable gadgets. More than 2,200 companies will exhibit at this year's event, including major tech brands such as Google, HTC, Huawei, Intel, Lenovo, LG, Microsoft, Nokia, Samsung and Sony. Keynote speakers include John Hanke, founder and CEO of Niantic, which makes Pokemon Go , Reed Hastings, founder and CEO of Netflix , and Rajeev Suri, President and CEO of Nokia.
