Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Sep 14, 2016 at 2:32PM Image source: Apple. It's been about five years since Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) had any meaningful slot in Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone. Previously, Apple had sourced cellular baseband modems from its Infineon wireless segment, which Intel acquired way back in 2010. But then Apple dropped Infineon and began exclusively sourcing baseband from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) starting with the iPhone 4s in 2011, and has stuck with the mobile chip giant ever since. Intel has fought for years to get back in, and rumors to that effect have swirled ahead of every iPhone launch. Well, it looks like Chipzilla has finally succeeded. Tech teardown Investors won't know for sure until the new iPhones are shipped and subsequently torn down to see what components are inside. This usually occurs immediately within a day or two. But all signs point to Intel having won the GSM-equipped variants. Unlike in recent years where a single Qualcomm modem could handle just about any network you threw at it, you'll notice that this year half of the models do not support CDMA networks. Intel's 7630 modem fits the bill. From a global perspective, GSM is generally far more widely used for 3G connectivity. But CDMA is important in the two largest smartphone markets: U.S. and China. Half of the domestic carriers use CDMA, while TD-SCDMA is prevalent in China, so Intel's win will be limited. That also has some potential implications for global travelers that need broader support. Not only do the specs suggest that Apple is now dual-sourcing from Intel, but The Wall Street Journal's people ever familiar with the matter have also confirmed it. Intel has undoubtedly failed in the mobile market, but this win is a small consolation. I'd also be worried about the negative implications for Qualcomm. Apple is one of Qualcomm's two most important customers, and Apple has undoubtedly been using this dual-sourcing strategy as negotiating leverage. To the extent that Intel can continue catching up with its baseband products, Apple will continue putting the squeeze on Qualcomm for volume concessions. In less than a week, we'll know for sure whether or not there's Intel inside, but all signs point to yes. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

Chances are your computer isn’t running as fast as it could – and not because of all those browser extensions and background processes. Nope, your PC might not be performing at its peak because it may have been hamstrung by manufacturer set speed limits. How do you cast off those oppressive shackles keeping your CPU from its true potential? You overclock it. Overclocking your CPU is about more than just juicing up your processor. It’s about exploring the limits of your PC, pushing it to perform at its peak. Why is that? Well, when chips come off the line, they’re not uniformly capable. Due to variables in the manufacturing process, even CPUs produced in the same batch are going to perform differently. So manufacturers like Intel and AMD test the chips and slap a speed limit on them based on a lot of different factors. Performance, supply quotas, and marketing all play a role in determining how many chips of a certain speed each manufacturer ships to retailers. That’s where the fun comes in. By doing some tinkering, you might find that your humble CPU is hiding some serious horsepower. You could very well crank a 4GHz processor up to 4.5GHz or 4.6GHz for instance. With some serious cooling power, you might even push it to 5GHz. But your mileage will vary, because like we said, no two chips are alike. Exciting, right? Depending on your luck, you might have a processor that is capable of running much, much faster than it currently is, like a caged cheetah. Or a surprisingly quick tortoise. There’s only one way to find out. A word of caution When you overclock a processor a couple things happen. The chip runs hotter, and it uses more power. Both of those factors can be a problem if your PC has a barebones cooler. If you want to get serious power out of your processor, you might want to invest in some high quality cooling. You don’t have to spring for full-loop liquid cooling if you’re just looking to squeeze out a couple more clock cycles, but you might want to have a look at high performance fans or other cooling solutions. Secondly, if you’re looking for help overclocking your laptop, you’re probably out of luck. There are a couple laptops on the market which ship with unlocked Intel or AMD processors, but generally speaking most laptops – even gaming laptops – are shipped with locked processors. Finally, overclocking your CPU usually voids any warranty your computer is currently under. So if you’re worried about your warranty, or your extended care plan, stop reading and back away. Still want to give it a shot? Let’s get to the fun stuff. Identify your CPU First, it’s important to determine whether you can actually overclock your CPU in the first place. This is an area where AMD and Intel differ significantly. Most AMD chips can be overclocked, while only two series of Intel chips can be overclocked. Below are some current generation Intel processors which are unlocked and ready for overclocking. It’s not a definitive list, so if you’ve got an older PC your CPU, yours might not be down there. SKU Default Speed Cores Price Core i5-6600K 3.5GHz 4 $235 Core i7-6700K 4.0GHz 4 $340 Core i7-6800K 3.4GHz 6 $440 Core i7-6950X 3.0GHz 10 $1650 Core i7-6900K 3.2GHz 8 $1100 Core i7-6850K 3.6GHz 6 $610 Core i7-5960X 3.0GHz 8 $1016 Core i7-5930K 3.5GHz 6 $580 Core i7-5820K 3.3GHz 6 $340 Generally speaking, Intel chips can only be overclocked if they’re in the K or X-series. On rare occasions Intel produces an exception, like the affordable Pentium G3258. But that’s rare. In contrast to Intel, AMD produces a lot of unlocked processors, and currently they have three different lines of CPUs that offer unlocked variants. Rather than list individual processors here, below you’ll find the three current series of unlocked processors from AMD. Series Default Speed Cores Price Range AMD FX Series 3.2GHz – 4.7GHz 4-8 $78 – $202 Athlon X4 K-Series 3.8GHz – 4.2GHz 4 $60 – $84 AMD A10 & A8 K-Series 3.8GHz – 4.3GHz 2-4 $79 – $392 Now, don’t worry if your CPU isn’t on either list. It can be tough to identify whether or not your CPU is unlocked, particularly if it’s an older model. Fortunately, the utilities used in this guide will let you know whether or not your processor supports overclocking. Pop the hood Overclocking doesn’t require you to open up your PC, but you should. Get in there and clear out any dust with a can of compressed air, as you want to make sure your PC is running as cool as it possibly can before you squeeze any extra clock cycles out of your CPU. Open up your case, and be sure to blow out the main fan over your CPU, your GPU, and all the nooks and crannies. Your PC should be as clean as the day you bought it before you start juicing it for all its worth. Get your tools together It’s worth mentioning that there are two schools of thought when it comes to overclocking. Some prefer to overclock directly in your computer’s BIOS, while others prefer to use software you can run from your operating system. There are advantages and disadvantages for both. Overclocking in the BIOS allows more fine-grain detail as you configure various settings. But this guide is for beginners, so we’re going to focus on using software. You’ll want to to grab a utility that will allow you to make changes to your clock speed, and then test those changes. The app will help us determine what your PC’s stats currently are – how hot it’s running, how fast it’s running, and how much power it’s currently pulling down. The utility you need varies depending on if you have an AMD or Intel chip.

Technavio hardware and semiconductor analysts highlight the following four factors that are contributing to the growth of the global gesture recognition market: Processor manufacturers incorporating gesture recognition Growing consumer electronics market Emergence of gestures as a new way of communicating with machines Development of motion-control gaming Ask an analyst: http://www.technavio.com/content/ask-analyst?report=52163 Ask Technavio's lead analysts a question about this market and they will have your answer within 24 hours. Processor manufacturers incorporating gesture recognition Manufacturers such as Qualcomm, MediaTek, Intel, Microchip, and Texas Instruments have launched processors that support gesture recognition technology. In 2011, Texas Instruments launched OMAP 5 processors, which had the capability to recognize gestures utilizing the device's camera. Qualcomm acquired assets and technology from GestureTek in 2011 to add gesture recognition technology to its processors. In 2014, Intel introduced its RealSense technology for 3D gesture recognition with its 3D depth camera for notebooks, desktops, and other range of hybrid laptops. Intel has gone a step further with its RealSense technology, which was incorporated within a 3D depth camera that is small enough to be fitted in smartphones and easily incorporated into tablets. According to Navin Rajendra, an industry expert for human machine interface at Technavio, "Gesture recognition can be more accurate and provides better results than 2D cameras. Thus, processor manufacturers are investing in this technology, as a result of which gesture recognition is expected to become common in tablets, smartphones, and other devices during the forecast period." Growing consumer electronics market The demand for devices such as smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and TVs is growing due to numerous factors such as advances in technology, increased functionalities, and decreased prices. Smartphones are increasingly being used by every individual, and Technavio expects the market to grow at a CAGR of more than 10% during the forecast period. The markets in developed countries such as the US, Japan, Germany, and the UK are saturated but are still growing. At the same time, there is a huge potential for smartphone sales in countries such as India, China, Indonesia, Brazil, and other emerging economies. Most of the processors integrated into smartphones are capable of running gesture recognition software, which augurs well for the growth of the market. Emergence of gestures as a new way of communicating with machines PC users always look for new innovative technologies in their devices and gesture recognition is one of them. There are also consumers, though low in number, who demand gesture recognition in their smartphones, gaming consoles, and other gadgets. Graphic designers, engineers, artists, and others involved in design already find this technology useful when combined with AR. Gesture recognition helps them visualize the designs in 3D, and they can interact with the computer using hand movement. In addition, gaming using gesture recognition on a PC can create an experience similar to that provided by Xbox and PlayStation at a much more affordable cost. The educationindustry can use this technology to make learning more interactive and interesting. There are a number of other end-user applications that enable easy interaction with PCs. These applications can open up a number of other possibilities and reduce the need for existing hardware such as remote controls and keyboards. Development of motion-control gaming Motion-control gaming has gained traction in the global gaming console market. Major gaming console manufacturers such as Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo have motion controllers in their products. Microsoft developed Kinect, which works as a motion controller as well as a gesture recognition device. Sony's PlayStation Move can be used with its PlayStation Eye camera, and up to four such motion controllers can be connected at once to enable multiplayer gaming. Nintendo's Wii Remote is a motion controller that can be used with Wii U game consoles. The use of motion controllers in gaming will educate gamers about the use of natural hand gestures to control games. This will help increase awareness about gesture recognition-based gaming consoles. Motion controllers can be considered as the first-step toward gesture recognition for gaming. "Thus, it is safe to expect these motion controllers to be replaced with gesture recognition devices in the future not just to control gaming consoles but other devices as well," says Navin.

(Intel), Added September 12, 2016 Translating...TranslateChinese SimplifiedChinese TraditionalEnglishFrenchGermanItalianPortugueseRussianSpanishTurkish This is a computer translation of the original content. It is provided for general information only and should not be relied upon as complete or accurate. Share Tweet Share Executive Summary The PCOMMIT instruction has been deprecated.  Although it was documented earlier, Intel has dropped it from consideration for future products.  This blog post explains the details behind that decision.   Enabling Persistent Memory Programming                                In preparation for the emerging persistent memory technologies, like Intel DIMMs based on 3D XPoint™ technology, Intel has defined several new instructions to enable the persistent memory programming model.  First, there are two new optimized cache flushing instructions, CLWB and CLFLUSHOPT.  These instructions are described in the Intel Architecture Instruction Set Extensions Programming Reference and are slated to appear on various platforms, including those supporting the Intel DIMM.  They provide a high performance method to flush stores from the CPU cache to the persistence domain, a term used to describe that portion of a platform’s data path where stores are power-fail safe. Originally, the set of new instructions included one called PCOMMIT, intended for use on platforms where flushing from the CPU cache was not sufficient to reach the persistence domain.  On those platforms, an additional step using PCOMMIT was required to ensure that stores had passed from memory controller write pending queues to the DIMM, which is the persistence domain on those platforms. The picture below illustrates the data path taken by a store (MOV) to persistent memory. As shown above, when an application executes a MOV instruction, the store typically ends up in the CPU caches.  Instructions like CLWB can be used to flush the store from the CPU cache.  At that point, the store may spend some amount of time in the write pending queue (WPQ) in the memory controller.  As shown above, the larger dashed box represents the power-fail safe persistence domain on a platform that is designed to flush the WPQ automatically on power-fail or shutdown.  One such platform-level feature to perform this flushing is called Asynchronous DRAM Refresh, or ADR. When the persistent memory programming model was first designed, there was a concern that ADR was a rarely-available platform feature so the PCOMMIT instruction was added to ensure there was a way to achieve persistence on machines without ADR (platforms where the persistence domain is the smaller dashed box in the picture above).  However, it turns out that platforms planning to support the Intel DIMM are also planning to support ADR, so the need for PCOMMIT is now gone.  The result is a simpler, single programming model where the application need not contain logic for detecting whether PCOMMIT is required.  For this reason, PCOMMIT is being deprecated before ever shipping on an Intel CPU, removing any need to support the instruction in older software since no software could have contained it (the opcode has always produced an invalid opcode exception and will continue to do so). As shown in the picture above, a platform may still have a way to flush the WPQ (shown as WPQ Flush above).  Unlike the PCOMMIT instruction, this is a kernel-only facility used to flush commands written to DIMM command registers, or used by the kernel in the rare case where it wants to ensure something is immediately flushed to the DIMM.  The application is typically unaware the WPQ Flush mechanism exists.   The Simpler Programming Model The picture below shows a sample instruction sequence for storing values (10 and 20) to persistent memory locations. The sequence on the left was required on platforms that did not have the ADR feature to flush the WPQ on power-fail/shutdown.  Since ADR is now a requirement for persistent memory support, the simpler sequence on the right can be used for all platforms.   Operating System and Toolchain Changes    To prepare for persistent memory programming, some operating systems, compilers, assemblers, and libraries were modified to use the PCOMMIT instruction.  Since the instruction was not guaranteed to exist on a given platform, any software using PCOMMIT would only do so if the appropriate CPUID flag indicated PCOMMIT was supported (the exact flag is CPUID.(EAX=07H, ECX=0H):EBX, bit 22).  Since PCOMMIT is deprecated, that CPUID flag is now reserved to always be zero, rendering any code using PCOMMIT to be dead code that will never be executed. The harmless dead code can be removed over time, but as of this writing, all known operating systems supporting persistent memory and the Non-Volatile Memory Libraries (NVML) at http://pmem.io have already been updated to remove all uses of PCOMMIT.   Summary The programming model for persistent memory on Intel CPUs has been simplified by deprecating the PCOMMIT instruction before its first implementation.  Most software, including the Non-Volatile Memory Libraries at http://pmem.io are already updated to reflect this change.   Glossary of Terms Power-fail Protected Domain or Persistent Domain When storing to pmem, this is the point along the path taken by the store where the store is considered persistent ADR (Asynchronous DRAM Refresh) A platform-level feature where the power supply signals other system components that power-fail is imminent, causing the Write Pending Queues in the memory subsystem to be flushed PCOMMIT An instruction allowing an application to flush-on-demand the memory subsystem Write Pending Queues.  With ADR required, this instruction is no longer necessary and is being deprecated. WPQ (sometimes called TPQ) Write Pending Queues in the memory subsystem CLFLUSH CLWB CLFLUSHOPT Instructions that flush lines from the CPU caches.  CLWB and CLFLUSHOPT are recent additions for better pmem performance CPUID The mechanism allowing software to detect what features are supported by a CPU   For more complete information about compiler optimizations, see our Optimization Notice.

Password Operating Systems Is Windows 8.1 giving you a hard time ? Wanna try out Windows 10 ?   Thread Tools Display Modes Intel Performance Counter Monitor - A better way to measure CPU utilization   (#1) mbk1969 Ancient Guru   Videocard: GeForce GTX 970 Processor: I7-4930 Mainboard: Asus p9x79 Memory: G Skill RipjawZ, 16GB Soundcard: Onboard + FiiO E17 PSU: 1000 W Intel Performance Counter Monitor - A better way to measure CPU utilization - 09-14-2016, 01:47 | posts: 2,770 | Location: Moscow, Russia Quote: When the CPU utilization does not tell you the utilization of the CPU CPU utilization number obtained from operating system (OS) is a metric that has been used for many purposes like product sizing, compute capacity planning, job scheduling, and so on. The current implementation of this metric (the number that the UNIX* "top" utility and the Windows* task manager report) shows the portion of time slots that the CPU scheduler in the OS could assign to execution of running programs or the OS itself; the rest of the time is idle. For compute-bound workloads, the CPU utilization metric calculated this way predicted the remaining CPU capacity very well for architectures of 80ies that had much more uniform and predictable performance compared to modern systems. The advances in computer architecture made this algorithm an unreliable metric because of introduction of multi core and multi CPU systems, multi-level caches, non-uniform memory, simultaneous multithreading (SMT), pipelining, out-of-order execution, etc. A prominent example is the non-linear CPU utilization on processors with Intel® Hyper-Threading Technology (Intel® HT Technology). Intel® HT technology is a great performance feature that can boost performance by up to 30%. However, HT-unaware end users get easily confused by the reported CPU utilization: Consider an application that runs a single thread on each physical core. Then, the reported CPU utilization is 50% even though the application can use up to 70%-100% of the execution units. A different example is the CPU utilization for "memory throughput"-intensive workloads on multi-core systems. The bandwidth test "stream" already saturates the capacity of memory controller with fewer threads than there are cores available. Abstraction Level for Performance Monitoring Units The good news is that Intel processors already provide the capability to monitor performance events inside processors. In order to obtain a more precise picture of CPU resource utilization we rely on the dynamic data obtained from the so-called performance monitoring units (PMU) implemented in Intel's processors. We concentrate on the advanced feature set available in the current Intel® Xeon® 5500, 5600, 7500, E5, E7 and Core i7 processor series. We have implemented a basic set of routines with a high level interface that are callable from user C++ application and provide various CPU performance metrics in real-time. In contrast to other existing frameworks like PAPI* and Linux* "perf" we support not only core but also uncore PMUs of Intel processors (including the recent Intel® Xeon® E7 processor series). The uncore is the part of the processor that contains the integrated memory controller and the Intel® QuickPath Interconnect to the other processors and the I/O hub. In total, the following metrics are supported: Core: instructions retired, elapsed core clock ticks, core frequency including Intel® Turbo boost technology, L2 cache hits and misses, L3 cache misses and hits (including or excluding snoops).

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Analysis  ⋮  Exclusive  ⋮  Hardware Exclusive: Is Intel Really Starting To Lose Its Process Lead? 7nm Node Slated For Release in 2022 By Usman Pirzada Posted 2 months ago 96Shares Share Tweet Submit A comparison between 300mm² and 450mm² wafers - the shift to the latter will result in increased economies of scale. Changes in Intel’s hiring documentation have revealed what appears to be the first sign of the fact that the chip maker has delayed its 7 nm process to 2022. The 7nm node has been referred to, many times, as the end of conventional process technology and, quite repeatedly, the start of the road where physics will start to break down (we will go into detail on this below). Quite understandably, Intel has started to slow down its shrink schedule to milk the existing nodes for a bit longer and most of all – buy it precious time. It is with this somewhat stark backdrop in mind that we will look at this new development. Advert pops up stating that Intel’s 7nm node has been delayed to 2022 – Will TSMC & other Pure Play foundries beat it to the process? Motley Fool’s Ashraf Eassa was the first to spot that an Intel job advert looking for a processor designer had changed its time frame to 2022 from 2020 so the advert read: “ The India Lab specifically, in collaboration with MRL-US and Intel product architecture teams worldwide, will spearhead the research and advanced development of Microprocessor Cores in the 2022 and beyond timeframe. By conceiving of and prototyping radical approaches, the Lab will aim to deliver much greater CPU power and area efficiency while still delivering industry-leading performance. The microarchitecture and design of these advanced CPUs will be aggressively co-optimized with Intel’s sub-10nm technology nodes deep into the next decade.” Remember that pesky thing called Moore’s law? Well, all vestiges of that have been going out of the window with recent announcements. The Moore’s law cycle was initially stated to be a 1 year cycle, in the recent past it was a 2 year cycle. With the announcement of Kaby Lake however, the time span increased even more: tick tock became tick tock tock. With the 10nm process, Intel expects to bring out three iterations of 10nm, namely 10nm, 10nm+ and 10nm ++. If we are to believe this advert then Intel should enter volume production of 10nm in 2017 with the final micro architecture landing in 2020 (10nm for 2017-2018, 10nm+ for 2018-2019 and 10nm++ for 2019-2020). Why physics starts to break down at near atomic sizes; the short version Its very clear that the company is going to face a lot of problems as we move towards 7nm. People keep on saying that “physics is going to break down” at this scale – but what that does that mean really? Well, the building block of computer processors is the transistor. Which is nothing more than a gate which either allows electrons to pass – or doesn’t depending on the state. When we talk about the process node getting smaller – its actually these gates which are getting smaller. A gate below 7nm will be just a few silicon atoms thick (1nm has a about two silicon atoms but the process name does not correspond directly to the size of the gate). At this point, you are probably wondering so what is the big deal? Those who remember elementary physics will recall that an atom is quite a big larger than an electron and as long as its bigger than an electron its good right? not exactly. This is where quantum mechanics step in. You might have heard that it is physically impossible to know the precise location of any given electron at any given time. What you can have are locations where the electron is probably located (this probability is 95% within the orbital cloud but approaches zero as you move further away, but never actually touches zero!). To state the obvious, the Balrog represents the electron and Gandalf’s swords represent the gate. Copyright: Last Clover, DeviantArt When dealing with gates this small an interesting phenomenon begins to occur – the electron can simply chose to be on the other side of the gate; in other words they can effectively tunnel through the closed transistor and appear on the other side. And when you are talking about logic sensitive circuits you can’t have closed gates leaking electricity. There are of course ways to get around this ranging from the choice of the substrate to the design of the transistor. Interestingly however, TSMC has recently revealed that it is right on track to deliver the 7nm process in 2018 which raises some very interesting questions: is Intel, the chipzilla who has dominated process advances for more than a decade finally falling behind to competition? Well, its a little more complicated than that. Simon Wang, director of business development at TSMC stated that the company is aiming to go into volume production at 7 nanometers in the first quarter of 2018. It is only a year after the next generation, 10 nanometer, is expected to start generating revenue. Other pure play foundries like Samsung and Globalfoundries will also be following soon behind. It would look like someone forgot to tell them about physics because they don’t seem to be having a problem with it – so what’s wrong with Intel? Understanding how foundries name their process nodes: Intel’s 10nm versus TSMC 10nm and beyond The answer lies in the fact that Intel’s naming standards and TSMC’s naming standards are drastically different. Intel’s processes use the same backbone as the advertised node (a 14nm process will use a 14nm backbone) while as all pure play foundries use a mixture of process technologies. TSMC’s 16nm FinFET tech for example uses a 20nm backbone (BEOL). So it is almost a certainty that they will be using a 14nm BEOL for their ’10nm finfet’ node. Let me explain a bit further, the process names that foundries use have now become more or less marketing material and not accurate physical descriptions of the node (except maybe in the case of Intel). Simply marketing a node as 7nm FinFET or 10nm FinFET does not make it a true 7nm or 10nm node respectively. I think the most relevant benchmark in this case (in my attempt to explain the point) is that of the Transistor Gate Pitch. This is the measure which is usually a very good indicator of the “true” node that a foundry might be using. Advertisement Process Feature Size Comparison WCCFTech Intel 22nm Intel 14nm TSMC 16nm Samsung 14nm Transistor Fin Pitch 60nm 42nm 48nm 48nm Transistor Gate Pitch 90nm 70nm 90nm 84nm Interconnect Pitch 80nm 52nm 64nm 64nm SRAM Cell Area .1080um² .0588² .0700² .0645² To give a starting reference point, the Transistor Gate Pitch of a ‘true’ 22nm node is 90nm (or 45nm if you are measuring in half pitch). The Intel 22nm node, had a transistor gate half pitch of exactly 45 nm. In comparison, the transistor gate pitch of all 14nm/16nm FinFET nodes out there have a transistor gate pitch of ~90nm. This means that physically speaking, these processes are actually equal to Intel’s 22nm node. The correct physical description of the 14nm/16nm FinFET node from TSMC/GloFo and Samsung would be 20nm with FinFETs. But hey, since you are getting a performance advantage from going FinFET (over planar) at the same physical step, why not brand it as a lower node right? It’s not like most of the market can tell which is which. Now let’s talk about Intel’s 14nm with FinFETs node. A simple calculation shows us that if a 22nm node has a Transistor Gate Pitch of 90nm, a true 14nm node with proper physical scaling should have a transistor gate pitch scaling (shrinkage) of more than more than 63%. That said, Intel has introduced 14nm with FinFETs and unlike the pure play foundries out there, it is not the same physical node as 22nm. Intel was able to achieve a shrink of roughly 30-40% over the 63% ideal shrink (Intel Transistor Gate Half Pitch for 14nm FinFET is 35nm) which while not perfect, is much closer to a true 14nm node than any of its competitors out there which are clearly 20nm and higher nodes. So here is the thing, to truly make sense of Intel’s standing in the foundry market, and to ascertain whether or not it has lost any real industry advantage – we must put aside the cloak of invisibility marketing material and judge it on a basis of apples to apples. When TSMC says that it will be shifting to 10nm by next year – what it really means is that it will be shifting to the Transistor Gate Half Pitch measure of somewhere in the vicinity of 35nm – this is something Intel achieved last year. In other words, it will be using a 14nm back end of line (BEOL) but because the addition of FinFETs gives it a performance gain that a shift to 10nm planar would give – they call it 10nm FinFET process. Investigating the shift of foundries to EUV for 7nm and beyond Here is the catch though, TSMC claims that it will be shifting to Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography after the 10nm process and claims to be one of the first foundries to deploy EUV. Conventionally speaking the capabilities of the laser used can be calculated by the simple formulae of dividing the wavelength by 2. Since EUV has a wavelength of 13.5nm it can easily imprint wafers on the 7nm process (the theoretical limit is 6.75nm, easily extendable up to 5nm with tricks such as multi patterning). So how much of that is real? A slide showing the various possibilities for 5nm and beyond. Approximately two years ago, ASML and TSMC recently achieved a landmark goal by using an EUV scanner to produce more than 1000 wafers. The wafers were manufactured by using the NXE:3300B system by ASML holding and was done during the duration of exactly one day. TSMC already has two such systems in their foundry and plans to add as many as 2 more for the targeted output of 1000 wafers per day (sustained) at much higher than 90 Watts. Now here is the thing, the scanners originally used for testing were operating at 90W power, and should have been replaced with 3350B models running at 125W and ideally the factories should be capable of 250W production by, well, this year. Now let’s talk about Intel. The company has already stated that it does not need to use EUV for 10nm and plans to use them for nodes smaller than 10nm (although to be honest, they have been saying that ever since the 45nm node) – and you can be sure that if Intel switches to EUV, the process lead it has been enjoying for so long will hold (regardless of what the marketed names of the node might indicate). Although the customers of ASML are a secret, Intel is pretty much a no brainier considering their huge stake in the company.  But if this recent advert is to be believed, it does not look like that will be happening (or happening at a date later than the others). The demise of Intel’s process lead has always been greatly exaggerated Conclusion: Many analysts have been pointing to the fact that Intel had problems shifting to the 14nm node and 10nm and 7nm are going to be only harder, but as I have already explained in the article, that trouble was due to the process being much smaller than everyone else and not at all comparable to TSMC’s 16nm FinFET node – which is really 20nm with FinFETs physically speaking. This is why, at the very end of the article, I will give my opinion: It is entirely possible that 7nm wont land till 2021/2022 (considering the PAO cadence, 10nm will stay till 2020 at the very least) and it is also very much possible that you will see process nodes being marketed as 7nm by various foundries before Intel. But what is not possible (or rather highly improbable) is that Intel loses its process lead in terms of the actual physical node. Because for that to happen we have to assume that they wont be making the shift to EUV along with others and considering Intel has the largest stake (14.37%) in the company that produces the EUV scanners: ASML Holdings, it seems very very unlikely. The simple fact of the matter is that Intel has never cared about beating the foundries on the basis of marketing material – but it has consistently beaten every other foundry to process shrinks in terms of their physical size. Apart from this advert, I see no change in any of the fundamental variables that might indicate that this will not be true for the years to come. Intel’s greatest rival has always been, and remains, the laws of physics.

As Intel proceeds with plans to divest its majority stake in Intel Security, the chipmaker's security business unit, a lawsuit filed against Intel threatens to create challenges for the entity. Intel purchased the anti-virus company in 2011 for $US7.68 billion, then known as McAfee. Private equity firm TPG is backing the security business as a new entity under the McAfee name. The middle-market investment firm will pay Intel $US3.1 billion for a 51 percent stake in the new entity. The transaction is valued at $US4.2 billion, including debt. Intel first began exploring the sale of the security unit in June, according to a report in the Financial Times. The anti-virus company was founded by John McAfee in 1987. Intel renamed the company Intel Security in 2014, although some of the unit's products continue to use the McAfee name. John McAfee and his cyber-security investment firm, MGT Capital Investments, filed a request for a judgment that his investment company's “use of or reference to the personal name of John McAfee and/or McAfee in their business” would not infringe on Intel's trademark.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 13, 2016 at 3:33PM Image source: Intel.  In a previous column, I wrote about an interesting job listing that I found on Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) website. In particular, it seemed to suggest that products based on the company's upcoming 7-nanometer manufacturing technology might not arrive until either 2021 or 2022. I recently stumbled across something, hidden in plain view, that seems to corroborate this idea. Let's take a closer look. Check out this slide from Intel's developer forum At Intel's recent developer forum, two executives gave a presentation disclosing some key details about recently announced and future chip manufacturing technologies, as well as the company's strategy to provide contract chip manufacturing services to third parties. In one slide, Intel showed how it intended to offer three different iterations of its 10-nanometer technology known as 10-nanometer, 10-nanometer+, and 10-nanometer++. Each successive iteration is expected to deliver better performance "to support multiple leading-edge products." Looking more closely at the slide reveals something interesting: Image source: Intel. Notice that the circle denoting the third iteration of the company's 10-nanometer manufacturing technology, known as 10-nanometer++, actually sits solidly beyond the 2020 time-frame. This could mean one of two things If Intel really isn't planning to get its 10-nanometer++ technology out there until sometime past 2020, then this could mean one of two things. The first, and certainly the more pessimistic, implication is that the company's 7-nanometer technology won't arrive until well beyond 2020. Indeed, if 10-nanometer++ is expected to arrive in 2021 or even 2022, we could be looking at late 2022 or early 2023 before the chipmaker transitions to its 7-nanometer technology. Such a significant delay, particularly in light of the fact that contract chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) plans to put its 5-nanometer technology into production in 2020, would mean that Intel will fall behind its biggest competitor in terms of chip area scaling. (TSMC's 5-nanomater technology is likely to be similar in terms of transistor density to Intel's 7-nanometer technology.) An alternative explanation is that Intel actually intends 10-nanometer++ and 7-nanometer to co-exist. For applications that absolutely need to be on the latest, densest manufacturing technology, Intel could design products on the newer, and potentially more expensive, 7-nanometer technology. For products that don't need to adopt bleeding-edge manufacturing technologies -- for example, desktop processors -- 10-nanometer++ could be a better, more cost-effective choice. In fact, we are already going to see something similar to this next year. Intel's next-generation desktop processors, code-named Coffee Lake, are expected to be manufactured on the company's 14-nanometer technology, while the low-power notebook and 2-in-1 processors, code-named Cannon Lake, that are expected to arrive at the same time will be built on the company's newer 10-nanometer technology. Some additional clarity needed At Intel's investor meeting later this year, I expect the company to go into more depth on its chip manufacturing strategy and how it views the competitive landscape. It will be interesting to see if the company talks at all about the potential timing of its 7-nanometer and potentially even its future 5-nanometer technologies. I'm not going to hold my breath for such disclosures, although given how aggressively the competition is advertising its technology plans, they would be most welcome.

Food is the backbone of our island and it only takes one visit to understand why. From hot sugar-dusted malasadas to shave ice, poke (before it was trendy), and hearty bowls of saimin, the food in Hawaii is a melting pot of cultures. At the beach, in food courts, or even at the corner grocery, finding a high quality and affordable meal is easy. Below is a collection of iconic cheap eats, the local foods that are fresh and fast, accessible, and delicious. Most importantly, they are all unique to the island. Whether you're a first-time visitor or a local, consider this list a starter guide to the most essential street foods and easy-to-find bites Honolulu has to offer. Poke Bowls Poke bowls are all the rage now, but we've been eating chopped and marinated fish over rice for decades here in Hawaii. Most of the new places on the mainland make poke to order, or fancy it up. But "real" poke is pre-made (very important because you want the fish to soak in all the sauce/marinade) and usually sold by the pound. Where to get it: Ahi Assasins 2570 S Beretania St., Honolulu; website. Vital Intel: The owners catch the fish daily, and the poke is simple, good, and fresh. It's also super affordable (available by the pound or $7 for a bowl). What more can you ask for? If you're only having one poke bowl in Honolulu, do it here. Foodland Multiple locations; website. Vital Intel: Foodland is a supermarket with many locations throughout the state. They have a quality poke bar where you can purchase by the pound or order bowls to go. Don't be shy about asking for a taste before deciding on a flavor. Hawaiian Plate Not to be confused with plate lunch (more on that below), Hawaiian plate consists of many components — too many to break down where to find the best individually. Where to begin? First there must be rice, poi, mac salad, and chicken long rice. Add on from there. Lau lau and tripe stew. Lomi salmon and luau squid. And of course, haupia for dessert (haupia is a Hawaiian sweet that’s a cross between coconut milk pudding and jelly, see chocolate-haupia below). Head to one of these places below and order lots to share (or one of the set combos if dining solo). Where to get it: Helena's Hawaiian Food 1240 N School St., Honolulu; website. Vital intel: This is heaven for Hawaiian food. You'll want (and should get) everything. Chicken long rice, mac salad, luau squid... it's all dreamy. The pipikaula (short ribs) is also out of this world. Go early — unless you want to wait in line and/or go crazy trying to find a parking spot — and bring cash. Highway Inn Kaka'ako 680 Ala Moana Blvd. #105, Honolulu; website. Vital intel: A more approachable but still delicious and authentic spot for Hawaiian food cravings. On Thursdays, you can get fresh kulolo (a traditional grated taro and coconut milk dessert) flown in from Kauai. Shave Ice Super-fine ice shaved into a bowl and finished with syrup: While there are similar versions around the world (like snow cones, halo-halo, kakigori, etc), the ones in Hawaii are in a league of their own. Biased? Perhaps. But the ice here is fluffy, light, and literally melt-in-your-mouth perfect. Couple that with natural syrups (often made from local fruits) and toppings (like azuki beans, ice cream, and fresh mochi balls) and you'll see why. Where to get it: The Local 137 Hekili St. #108, Kailua; website. Vital Intel: All-natural flavors and a super delicate shave makes the Local worth the drive to Kailua. Keep an eye out for the seasonal syrups (like pickled mango and guava). You can put up to three flavors in an order. Your Kitchen 1423 10th Ave., Honolulu Vital Intel: The "tropical bowl" is the thing to order here. It's a giant portion of half-mango and half-haupia shave ice topped with housemade haupia ice cream (one of the best in town). Spam Musubi The thing about Spam musubi is that there is no right or wrong way about it as long as you have the three essentials: rice, Spam, and nori. There are a million variations. Some like Spam sliced straight from the can, others like it pan-fried in shoyu until extra crispy. Thick slice, thin slice. Spam on top, Spam in the middle. More rice, less rice. Some places even layer in an egg (or top it with a quail egg). You can get Spam musubi everywhere from 7-11 (a very popular spot for musubis) to fine-dining restaurants. Where to get it: Fort Ruger Market 3585 Alohea Ave., Honolulu, HI 96816; website. Vital Intel: Find classic Spam musubi plus a ton of other variations at this convenience store/plate lunch spot/musubi stop. Look out for musubis with mochiko chicken, Portuguese sausage, plus bacon-and-egg and shoyu hot dogs. Musubi Cafe Iyasume 2427 Kuhio Ave., Honolulu; website. Vital Intel: This tiny shop is devoted to  musubi. You can get Spam musubis plain or paired with anything from cheese to shiso or ume, and even topped with avocado, egg, and/or bacon. They do a nice job with the rice here. Mochi Mochi, a sweet rice cake with Japanese origins, is casual snack in Hawaii. You’ll find it at the office potluck gathering, at a friend’s house on any given afternoon, and if you’re lucky, in the car when your parents pick you up from the airport. Hawaii's mochi is less formal than traditional Japanese mochi. Texturally, it’s softer, and less delicate. It’s often sold by the pound or in box sets. Classic flavors like azuki bean are popular, but there are no hard rules; locals happily embrace mochi in flavors from peanut butter to blueberry cheesecake and chocolate-haupia. Where to get it: Nisshodo Candy Store 1095 Dillingham Blvd., Honolulu; website. Vital Intel: Order the chichi dango (plain, rectangular cuts of mochi made from mochiko flour). These are sold by the pound and not to be missed: Order half-plain and half-dusted in kinako (roasted soybean powder). Nisshodo also makes manju from wheat flour — it's like a soft cookie shell stuffed with a sweet bean filling, and some places steam it, Nisshodo offers a baked version. It's available in many traditional (like white bean and red bean) and modern flavors (like peanut butter). Saturday Grandma’s Mochi at Made in Hawaii Foods 2071 S Beretania St., Honolulu; website. Vital Intel: Saturday Grandma's Mochi sells out early at the Farmer's Market each weekend. The best way to avoid the crowd is to stop by their brick-and-mortar on South Beretania (which no one seems to know about) or pre-order by phone for pick-up. Don't miss the lilikoi (passionfruit) cheesecake mochi. Happy Hearts Mochi Order online for pickup at Natsunoya Tea House, 1935 Makanani Dr., Honolulu; website. Vital Intel: Bento #4, pictured above, is the way to go: one each of all the classic plus fresh strawberry mochi (a whole strawberry wrapped in azuki bean paste and mochi). The haupia-stuffed mochi (which comes in plain, chocolate, and hazelnut-coffee flavors) is heaven. Malasadas Imagine a hot yeast doughnut meets brioche, but a little eggier; fried to a deep, dark brown; and then rolled in sugar. That’s a malasada. The roots are Portuguese, but like many things that come here, it’s become Hawaiian-izied over the years. Malasadas are a very personal thing; for each person that prefers Leonard’s, there’s another that sticks by Champion’s. Where to get it: Punahou Carnival 1601 Punahou St., Honolulu; website. Vital Intel: The best malasadas on the island (they say the secret is a tiny bit of nutmeg and cinnamon mixed into the sugar) are only available the first weekend of every February, when the Punahou school hosts its annual carnival. It's worth planning a trip around. Leonard's Bakery 933 Kapahulu Ave., Honolulu; website. Vital Intel: A Honolulu institution loved by locals and tourists, Leonard's makes malasadas in a range of flavors. Get them dusted in cinnamon-sugar or li hing mui sugar (li hing mui is a salty dried plum powder that gets paired with everything from fresh fruit to cocktails in Hawaii), and stuffed with custard, dobash (chocolate pudding), or haupia. Only getting one? Make it the sugar-dusted classic. Champion Malasadas 1926 S Beretania St., Honolulu; website. Vital intel: Champion's is less crowded and chaotic than Leonard's. Because there's less foot traffic, every malasada is fried to order — and nothing beats a freshly fried malasada. (While you're here, pick up one of its signature mini chiffon cakes for snacking later.) Sashimi Sashimi on the mainland tends to be a special, sushi night treat. But in Hawaii, we eat a ton of fresh fish, and sashimi often shows up at a casual dinner or takeout lunch. Whether simply sliced and piled over rice so that you can take it to go, or sold by the large plate/pound, you can always count on finding high quality sashimi for fair prices. It's one of the best parts about eating in Hawaii. Where to get it: Kyung's Seafood 1269 S King St., Honolulu; website. Vital Intel: A centrally-located hole-in-the-wall frequented by chefs and locals in the know. Come with friends and get the large sashimi platter to share. Order up a few hot dishes, strawberry soju slush (for real), and call it a night. They also make great poke (especially the salmon-ahi mix). Maguro Brothers Hawaii 1039 Kekaulike St. #113, Honolulu; website. Vital Intel: Located inside a Chinatown seafood and vegetable market, this tiny spot is primarily takeout, but they have a few seats. Order big, beautiful sashimi platters to-go or, for lunch, you can get sashimi donburi bowls (served over rice). The daily offerings include maguro, chu-toro, and king salmon. Definitely add a side of ikura and/or uni. Plate Lunch Plate lunch is a broad term and there are many way to interpret it. To simplify, there’s rice, macaroni salad (though opting to sub in green salad is getting trendy), and meat (mochicko chicken, garlic shrimp, hamburger steak, etc.). It’s a complete meal served in a plastic or styrofoam container or paper plate. Not fancy, super delicious. You’ll hear it used in context like: "What’d you have for lunch?" followed by "Got a plate lunch from Rainbow’s today"; "Will you order me the mochiko chicken plate lunch from Diamond Head Grill?"; "Let’s get Korean plate lunch for dinner" (see photo). Like Spam musubi, there is no "correct" way to create a plate lunch. There is just a lot of variety, all boiling down to personal preference. Where to get it: Rainbow Drive-In 3308 Kanaina Ave., Honolulu; website. Vital Intel: Rainbow's is the classic. The "Mix Plate" gives you a taste of the most popular dishes, though the chili dog plate is also great. Don't forget the slush float for dessert. Romy's Kahuku Prawns & Shrimp 56-781 Kamehameha Highway, Kahuku; website. Vital Intel: The butter garlic shrimp plate and li hing mui pineapples (for pre-lunch snack or dessert) are musts. There's always a wait (usually 45 minutes) so phone in your order early or wait it out at Kahuku Farms across the street, where you can devour a grilled banana bread ice cream sundae. Gina's B-B-Q Market City Shopping Center, 2919 Kapiolani Blvd., Honolulu; website. Vital Intel: Everything about this place is wonderful. Go here for Korean plate lunch, order the Gina's Special, and share it with a friend — it's gigantic. Gina's also makes super japchae and potato salad, and her kalbi and barbecue chicken are outstanding. Coco Puffs These are a Hawaii classic and they come from one bakery: Liliha Bakery. A Coco Puff is composed of three parts: choux pastry, chocolate pudding, and chantilly. It's the size of a golf ball and served chilled. The pastry is stuffed with the pudding — super thick and not too chocolate-y — then crowned with chantilly. Chantilly usually refers to whipped cream, but in Hawaii chantilly is a frosting made from lots of egg yolks, sugar, and butter. FYI, you'll also spot green tea Coco Puffs at the bakery, but don't be tempted. They're not nearly as good as the original chocolate. Where to get it: Liliha Bakery 515 N Kuakini St, Honolulu; website. Vital intel: The original and the best. Liliha Bakery sells between 4,800 to 7,200 Coco Puffs daily. They make many other baked goods — and it's also a restaurant — so if you have room for more, get the pancake/waffle batter, dobash cake, and butter rolls (dine-in and they'll split, butter, and grill the rolls on a flat top). Manapua A manapua is essentially a giant char siu bao, a steamed bun filled with fatty roast pork. One is a snack, two is a meal. Some places offer steamed manapuas, and other do baked. Char siu is the classic filling, though nowadays you’ll find everything from curried manapua to sweet ones filled with black sesame and sweet potato. Where to get it: Chun Wah Kam Multiple locations; website. Vital Intel: Here manapua is offered in a variety of flavors including thai curry chicken, kalua pig, and honey garlic chicken. There's even mini manapuas. Char Hung Sut 64 N Pauahi St., Honolulu. Vital Intel: Come to this old-school Chinatown classic for the steamed char siu manapua. Chocolate-Haupia Chocolate-haupia is not a specific dessert but a flavor combination that is popular in Hawaii. There’s chocolate-haupia mochi (as mentioned in the mochi section), there’s chocolate-haupia pies, and chocolate-haupia layered on shortbread. These two flavors go together perfectly and you’ll see them in many dessert offerings across the island. Where to get it: Ted’s Bakery 59-024 Kamehameha Highway, Haleiwa; website. Vital Intel: Home of the famous Cchocolate-haupia pie. The original location of Ted’s is on the North Shore (a must visit for any island road trip), but you can also find their pies at supermarkets across the island. It’s super simple: pie crust filled with a bottom layer of chocolate pudding, a top layer of haupia, and topped with whipped cream. Ted’s also makes chocolate-haupia cake — try both and compare. Via Gelato 1142 12th Ave., Kaimuki; website. Vital Intel: Get a cone with half-chocolate and half-haupia. Yama's Fish Market 2332 Young St., Honolulu; website. Vital intel: This is also a great spot to pick up a Hawaiian plate lunch, but make sure to look for the refrigerated case to the right when you enter. That's where you'll find the chocolate-haupia brownie. Saimin In the same way that Hawaii is a literal melting pot of cultures, saimin is a melting pot of noodle soup. It’s a bit like Japanese ramen, a bit like Chinese wonton mein, and a bit like Filipino pancit noodles. This is comfort food: Clear, hot broth, saimin noodles, and toppings that most commonly include green onions, char siu and/or Spam, and kamaboko (fish cake). Where to get it: Palace Saimin 1256 N King St., Honolulu; website. Vital Intel: Pay particular attention to the broth — they use both pork and shrimp. Add an order of barbecue sticks (bite-size pieces of beef skewered onto a stick, marinated in a sauce akin to teriyaki, and broiled) to make a complete meal. Palace also offers saidon, which is saimin and udon mixed in the same bowl. Jane's Fountain 1719 Liliha St., Honolulu. Vital Intel: Come the nostalgic decor, stay for the saimin. Wonton mein (which is saimin with pork and/or shrimp dumplings) plus a barbecue stick is the go-to order here. Kathy YL Chan splits her time between her native Hawaii and NYC.

Credit: Intel More like this Raspberry Pi 3 gets the Windows 10 anniversary update Intel's new Atom chips bring 4K video to VR headsets, robots Raspberry Pi 3 creator hopes for Windows 10 desktop OS support Video How the Apple Watch copies Samsung and why you need to be scared Microsoft is challenging Linux's domination in Raspberry Pi-type computers by bringing support for Windows 10 OS to more developer boards. The newest computer to get a version of Windows 10 will be Intel's Joule, which has cutting-edge hardware compared to Raspberry Pi 3. To be specific, Joule will get support for Windows 10 IoT Core -- a slimmed-down version of Windows 10 -- by year-end, Microsoft said in a blog post last week. Joule currently supports only the Linux OS. With Windows 10 IoT Core, Joule can be used to develop gadgets, robots, drones, wearables, medical devices and smart industrial devices. The OS is supported by four other mini-computers -- Raspberry Pi 2 and 3, Qualcomm's DragonBoard 410c and Intel's MinnowMax. Microsoft is tapping into the community of enthusiasts developing new devices to push into the internet of things market. Expanding Windows 10 IoT Core support to more boards will give the company wider access to makers. Raspberry Pi may be the most the popular board computer, but Intel's Joule is perhaps the most complete, with superior hardware and wide OS support. It has a 64-bit Atom processor, 4K graphics, DDR4 memory and 802.11ac connectivity. But at $369.99, it is much more expensive than the $35 Raspberry Pi 3. Microsoft's Windows operating systems have worked well with Intel x86 processors, but most IoT devices are based on ARM processors, which power Raspberry Pi 3. The Windows OS is available for free for developer boards. Windows 10 IoT Core will give Joule users access to Azure cloud, which helps tack on services to gadgets. Microsoft recently delivered the Anniversary Update for Windows 10 IoT Core. It has a new feature called Windows IoT Remote Client so boards like Joule can be remotely accessed by smartphones and PCs. The update also has better communication tools. An adapter called IoTivity AllJoyn Device System Bridge allows devices based on two separate standards to communicate -- the Intel-backed Open Interconnect Consortium (OIC) and Microsoft-backed AllSeen Alliance. The discovery and security specifications from both organizations will be merged into new protocols of the Open Connectivity Foundation, which will have native Windows 10 support next year. The Joule board was introduced by Intel last month and will come in multiple versions. The Joule 570x has a 1.7GHz Atom T5700 processor, 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM and 16GB of storage. Intel will later release Joule 550x, which will have a 1.5GHz Atom T5500 CPU, 3GB of LPDDR4 memory and 8GB of storage. The Joule 570x has expansion ports regularly found on developer boards and interfaces to attach Intel's 3D RealSense camera.

Klint Finley Business Date of Publication: 09.13.16. 09.13.16 Time of Publication: 12:28 pm. 12:28 pm Hardware Giants Hope the Past Can Save Their Future Getty Images HP. Dell. EMC. Intel. The giants of computer hardware aren’t what they were ten years ago. Heck, they’re aren’t even what they were five years ago—or, for that matter, just a few months ago. These hardware giants realize that the technology landscape is shifting. With the rise of smartphones and tablets, PCs are far less important. With the rise of cloud computing services from Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and others, many businesses can build websites and other software without buying hardware for the data center. And when they do need hardware, they’re looking for something different, thanks again to the influence of the biggest Internet companies, including Facebook as well as the big cloud computing vendors. But although HP, Dell, EMC, and Intel see the shifts, they aren’t always sure how to deal with them. As the landscape around them continues to morph, they continue to reorganize, reshape, and remake themselves in an effort to keep pace. Sometimes, they acquire companies in entirely new markets. And sometimes, they jettison these acquisitions as they bet on entirely news ones. The only thing that’s constant in the hardware business is change. For a while there, these hardware giants thought the best thing to do was transform themselves into software companies. In 2010, Intel, the world’s largest computer chip maker, spent $7.68 billion acquiring security software company McAfee. A year later, PC and server giant HP spent $11.1 billion on “big data” company Autonomy. And over the next few years, another PC and server giant, Dell, spent billions on all kinds of software companies. But none of that really worked. Dell shed its software companies earlier this summer, and last week, HP Enterprise bid farewell to Autonomy, selling its software division to Micro Focus. Oh, and that same week, Intel spun off McAfee. Dell and HP also thought they could be cloud companies. But that didn’t work either. So now they’re reorganizing themselves again. HP split in two, and this week, one half bought the printer division of Samsung. Dell merged with EMC. Meanwhile, Intel is buying up various companies that make very different kinds of chips. After failing with software, these hardware companies ares going back to being, well, hardware companies. In short, the struggling to find where they fit into the future of technology—if they fit anywhere at all. Intel certainly does. But we’re not sure about the rest. The Shopping Spree Some companies can transform themselves as the market shifts. A decade and a half ago, IBM turned itself into something different. In 2002, it acquired the IT consulting company PricewaterhouseCoopers, and three years later, it sold off its personal computer business. In the years to come, it would focus on hardware, software, and consulting services for big businesses, and it worked. While PCs had become commodities—and it was clear the market was on the wane—enterprise IT was a lucrative, high-margin business. As the market continued to shift away from PCs and towards phones and tablets, other computer giants tried something similar. Dell went on a shopping spree that included database software maker Quest, network security company SonicWall, and cloud management company Enstratius. Intel snapped up McAfee. And the HP took the most radical approach—or at least it tried to. In 2011, then HP CEO Leo Apotheker announced the Autonomy acquisition, and word spread that the company would sell off its PC division. But Apotheker was fired a month later, and the company tabled plans to spin-off the PC division. Investors get spooked when you try to completely reinvent a major company overnight. But it needed reinvention. And the urgency only increased. By the beginning of this decade, cloud computing was changing enterprise IT, and all these companies needed to change again. Intel did so quite successfully, becoming the main supplier of chips to the Internet’s biggest players, including Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Facebook. It powered the cloud. But those big Internet players put these Intel chips into new kinds of servers and data storage devices, turning away from HP, Dell, and storage giant EMC. HP eventually split into two companies in order to focus its strengths—HP Enterprise (business hardware and software) and HP Inc. (PCs and printers)—but it had missed the boat. Amazon was dominating the cloud, and Google and Microsoft were well ahead of anyone else. Microsoft has ably reinvented itself for the modern age, and though both still face many obstacles, they’re better off than HP and Dell. HP didn’t just miss the boat. It paid a ridiculous amount for for the wrong boat, Autonomy. Finding a New Direction What Dell, EMC, HP and Intel have learned in recent years is that it isn’t easy for a hardware company to become a software company. But we can cut them a little slack here. After all, others have made similar mistakes. Google and Microsoft have learned that it isn’t easy for a software company to become a hardware company. In recent years, Google phone acquired maker Motorola Mobility before promptly selling it to Lenovo. Microsoft is writing down its purchase of phone maker Nokia. The bigger issue is that Dell, EMC, HP, and Intel didn’t see where the future was going. Instead of buying McAfee, Intel should be pushed harder into mobile phones. Instead of buying Autonomy, HP should have gotten far more serious about the cloud. Ah, but Intel certainly sees the next wave: artificial intelligence. The same week it spun-off McAfee, it bought Movidius, a company that specializes in making AI chips for drones, smartphones, and other gadgets. With this buy, Intel has a chance of finding a real foothold in the mobile business. Last month, it also bought a company called Nervena, which makes AI chips for servers. And last year, it dropped $16.7 billion on Altera, whose chips can also help with AI. These acquisitions also make sense because they’re closer to Intel’s core business. The chip maker is buying other chip makers. But that alone doesn’t breed success. After all, HP is doubling down on printers. But that is hardly the future. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Technavio defines an emerging trend as a factor that has the potential to significantly impact the market and contribute to its growth or decline. The global RAID controller card market mark the presence of many reputed vendors such as Avago Technologies (Broadcom), Intel, Fujitsu,Dell, and HP. Avago Technologies dominates the market due to its acquisition of LSI Technologies in 2014. With big names like Intel, Fujitsu, Dell, and HP, continuous innovation is required to become the leader in the market. In 2016, Broadcom introduced the first NVMe/SATA/SAS-based controllers. As there is a growing popularity of flash-based storage technologies, this introduction by the company will help it lead the global RAID controller card market. Request a sample report: http://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=52439 Technavio's sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. The top three emerging trends driving the global RAID controller card market according to Technavio hardware and semiconductor research analysts are: Increasing popularity of flash-based storage Increased adoption of IoT Emergence of containerized data centers Increasing popularity of flash-based storage Solid state drive (SSD) storage or flash storage offers greater efficiency than traditional HDD storage devices. In 2015, the cost of flash-based storage was greater than that of HDD-based storage arrays. Vendors are continuously decreasing their product prices due to the increased demand for storage infrastructure in the market. With the increased use of mission-critical applications, flash-based storage arrays offer 40 times better than hard disk input/output (I/O) performance and around 50% reduction in power consumption. Sunil Kumar Singh, a lead analyst at Technavio for research on embeddedsystems, says, "Due to the higher cost involved in procuring flash-based storage systems, it will experience a higher growth in large and mega data centers. However, the price of these systems will drop by 5%-10% YoY, resulting in an increased demand for flash storage during the period 2018-2020. The overall market will experience a steady growth in the adoption of flash and traditional storage systems, where flash will add more revenue in the coming years." Increased adoption of IoT Technavio researchers predict there will be around 30 billion internet-connected devices by 2019. This will give a major boost to the global data center market. The use of RFID sensors in logistics and warehouses in the late 1990s had put the focus on IoT. RFID is used to tag, track, connect, and read objects. The growing number of connected devices will lead to the generation of big chunks of data. Connected cars, homes, and smart cities are gaining popularity. As a result, many industries such as manufacturing, utilities, retail, automotive, and social media are using IoT for increased data transfer. By 2019, IoT-enabled devices will increase the data center traffic by 40 times. Cloud computing and data analytics play a major role in connected reality. Data centers are constantly upgraded to meet IoT data storage and processing requirements. "Many businesses are involved in establishing data centers worldwide to deal with the increasing need for the storage of IoT data. IoT will boost the establishment of distributed data centers, large data centers, and micro data centers worldwide," adds Sunil. Emergence of containerized data centers A containerized data center is a portable data center pre-installed inside a shipping container. These data centers are part of a modular data center in which each module is a container that can host power, IT, and cooling equipment. These data centers are available in the lengths of 40 feet and 20 feet and are delivered to end-users on demand. Enterprises are building modular data centers that comprise many data center container modules in a single facility. The cost of these facilities is around USD 7 million but may vary based on requirement. The installation to deployment time for these modules is less than six months. A wide range of computing equipment and racks are hosted within a containerized data center facility. The cost of deploying a containerized data center facility is less than the cost of building or renovating a traditional data center facility. Containerized data centers are easy to relocate from one location to another and can be managed centrally. Microsoft's Virginia data center is a modular data center comprising multiple data center containers.

Diehard fans of Windows 7 and 8 will be shut out.

Sign up for TechRepublic's Microsoft Weekly newsletter and get Windows and Office tutorials, plus our experts' analyses of Microsofts enterprise products. Read more Millions of personal computers running at both the enterprise and consumer level have taken the plunge and upgraded to Microsoft Windows 10. For the most part, enterprises and consumers have been pleased with the upgrade and Microsoft has earned the right to consider the new operating system a general success. But that doesn't mean the company has given up on its stated goal of billions of devices running Windows 10. For example, Microsoft has made it quite clear that it will support Intel's and AMD's next generation processors only with Windows 10. In other words, Microsoft will make no promises about the ability of those new CPUs to run Windows 7 or 8. Microsoft wants to put Windows 7 and 8 in its metaphorical rearview mirror and this is just another way to accomplish that mission. SEE: Microsoft jumps into the livestreaming business with its acquisition of Beam Here's your hat... On the one hand, you can understand why Microsoft is committing to the next generation processors. Intel's new processor architecture, code named Kaby Lake, will include new features and technologies that promise to increase the overall performance of devices by significant, and noticeable, percentages. AMD's new processor architecture, code named Zen, makes similar promises. Optimizing Windows 10 to take advantage of these new technologies will require a substantial bit of time and effort. The kind of time and effort Microsoft does not want to duplicate for what it considers old, on their way out, operating systems like Windows 7 and Windows 8. On the other hand, according to the latest information available from Netmarketshare, about 56% of all personal computers as of August 2016 are still running Windows 7, 8.0, or 8.1. Windows 10 has penetrated only about 23% of the available market so far. That means there is a long way to go before the majority of enterprises can be said to have fully deployed Windows 10. Image: Screenshot captured by Mark Kaelin c/o Netmarketshare Those statistics mean that Microsoft will not be able to completely abandon previously released operating systems, no matter how much it wishes it could. The company will have to at least help develop drivers and other behind-the-scenes protocols to account for new processor technologies, even if the older operating systems in question are not optimized. SEE: How Microsoft is creating a better Cortana with the purchase of Genee Bottom line The latest, greatest next generation processors from both Intel and AMD will be supported and optimized only for Windows 10. While this makes sense as a general business strategy for Microsoft, it is likely to cause problems for enterprises and consumers who stubbornly cling to older operating systems like Windows 7 and Windows 8. However, before you get too upset, keep in mind that the general overall architecture of these processors will not change. Kaby Lake and Zen processors will still be based on the x86 architecture, which means that the chips should still run Windows 7 and 8 devices. There may need to be some compensating software in the form of drivers or protocol layers to make it possible, but it can be, and likely will be, done. Of course, performance is likely to suffer because of it. That is why Microsoft wants to make it perfectly clear that the best experience with the soon-to-arrive next generation processors is going to require Windows 10. The writing is on the wall—as far as Microsoft is concerned, Windows 10 is the primary operating system. All earlier versions of Windows are second-class operating systems and will be treated that way going forward. Can your enterprise afford to continue running second-tier software? Are you sure?

The Indian Express Nation World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Home Compare News Mobile & Tabs Gadgets Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech Reviews RDP ThinBook Review: A budget laptop that is surprisingly good RDP ThinBook Review: A budget laptop that is surprisingly good RDP ThinBook is a budget laptop with great design but does it deliver as an overall Windows PC? We find out in our review Rating: 3.5 out of 5 Written by Karthekayan Iyer | Updated: September 13, 2016 6:42 pm RDP ThinBook is the latest in the growing list of budget Windows 10 notebook developed in collaboration with Microsoft Budget laptops – the ones costing less than Rs 20,000 – are the next big thing in the world of consumer PC segment. Microsoft and Intel both see the segment as the way forward for PC industry – where laptops are essentially replacing desktops as the first computer consumers buy. With Windows 10 becoming cheaper for OEMs and even free for certain screen size, this industry is in the threshold of a significant boom. Microsoft, which has set itself a target of 1 billion Windows 10 devices, has to tap into this very segment in order to achieve its goal. Microsoft has even identified the path to reach that goal – lure mobile OEMs to make Windows 10 PCs – that don’t cost a bomb. With Micromax and Lava already onboard, it was just a matter of time before Microsoft added more companies on its side. RDP ThinBook Just don’t worry if you haven’t heard that name before; I had no idea about this brand either. RDP is the latest to join Microsoft’s budget Windows PC initiative. RDP is, however, approaching the segment differently than Micromax, iBall and Lava. RDP’s first product is not a detachable but a traditional Windows PC and what more, one with really big screen. RDP ThinBook resembles Lenovo’s Ideapad series a lot. It won’t be an understatement to say that RDP ThinBook is completely inspired by the Ideapad series. The moment you unbox the device, that RDP logo placed like Lenovo on the exterior strikes you. RDP has also designed the interior similar to Apple’s flagship MacBook Pro lineup, which is pleasantly surprising from a newbie. A budget laptop that looks this good is always a good sight. But does this one perform considering the demanding needs of a Windows PC? We find out.

The laptop also offers very good battery life with its 10,000mAh battery What is good? The best part about RDP ThinBook is its big 14.1-inch display. The display is not the brightest or the colour saturated one I have come across, but it is certainly on par with several other budget notebooks out there. The advantage of the big screen here is that you can watch videos on a larger screen and it also helps in split-screen multitasking. I still remember my first laptop which felt like carrying bricks on my back. With RDP ThinBook, that issue is gone forever. RDP ThinBook is neither heavy nor too light. The laptop skips on non-essential options like DVD-drive to make room for a larger battery and keep the thickness and weight under control. The overall weight is evenly distributed so you won’t feel the pain while carrying it around the workplace by holding the screen bezel. Again, with these budget notebooks, the showstopper is Windows 10 and not the hardware or design. With RDP ThinBook too, Windows 10 outshines as a complete desktop operating system. Windows 10 pillars around use of Cortana, Microsoft Edge and mobile like notifications. On RDP ThinBook, these core features work absolutely fine. Thanks to the addition of two microphones up front, Cortana can hear you even from relatively far. So shouting, “Hey Cortana, get me driving directions to work” from far will always return a result. Since the laptop is a low-duty one, I faced issues browsing on Chrome, but Edge worked like a charm. RDP ThinBook offers dual microphones for better voice recognition and the laptop works comfortably with Cortana With Windows 10 Anniversary update bringing extensions to Edge, this is the only browser you need on this notebook. Overall, Windows 10 works far better on this low-cost notebook than it would do on your five-year-old PC. I have tested Micromax Canvas Lapbook, iBall Compbook Excelance, Lava Twinpad and now RDP ThinBook and I must say, these budget notebooks deliver on battery front. During my use, I was easily able to browse web, watch video and even write (though I won’t recommend), and yet have some juice left on this one. The laptop is good enough for five hours of constant streaming from the web, decent for that binge-watching session. As far as performance is concerned, RDP ThinBook does fare well with Windows and basic things like browsing the web, accessing media and even multitasking. The laptop is even great for playing games like Crossy Road, but just don’t load this one with Counter Strike. What is not good? The keyboard is not the strongest point of RDP ThinBook. The keys are shallow and I often ended up hitting the wrong key If there is something to dislike about RDP ThinBook, then it has to be its keyboard. Everytime I get a notebook for review, I try to start judging the keyboard right away and I even prefer to use that same keyboard to write the review. In the case of RDP ThinBook, it certainly didn’t hold up well. Firstly, the keyboard is designed similar to Apple’s MacBook Pro with wide space for palm rest around the keyboard. However, that design also means that the keys are more closely packed and there is extremely shallow travel between the keys. Another issue is with the feedback offered by the keys. You often don’t understand whether a key has been pressed or not. Well, I am being too judgemental here and probably you shouldn’t expect much from a budget laptop, but this one could have been better. RDP ThinBook also offers decent option in terms of ports with one USB 3.0, one USB 2.0 and mini HDMI port Another place RDP ThinBook struggles, is with the sound. The speakers on this notebook sound tinny, and the overall volume is very low too. It would be much advisable to invest in good quality speakers. Should you buy? If you are on a tight budget and want a laptop primarily for watching videos then trust me, this one is the only good option. The laptop has a decent keyboard for writing basic reports, but not the one for writing a long thesis. With RDP ThinBook, you can survive your summer holidays watching cat videos, posting on Facebook, chatting on Messenger and if that’s what you are looking for, then this makes a good buying option. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaBanks to work normal hours on Saturday, but only senior citizens can exchange old notes BusinessDemonetisation: Execution could not have been better, says Arun Jaitley IndiaDemonetisation: Misuse of bank account for black money deposit to invite govt action IndiaLong queues outside banks a ‘serious issue’, says SC on demonetisation IndiaPriyanka Gandhi to play 'major role' in UP Assembly polls: Congress EntertainmentForce 2 movie review: John Abraham, Sonakshi Sinha film is Bond-Bourne rehash EntertainmentChris Martin parties with Shah Rukh Khan, Sussanne Khan and Sridevi's daughters, see inside pics EntertainmentIt's November 18, Salman Khan's wedding day, see pics EntertainmentIulia Vantur reveals what she had to sacrifice to live in India.

Incoming McAfee CEO Chris Young on his company’s post-Intel future Posted Sep 9, 2016 by John Mannes (@JohnMannes) 0 SHARES Next Story User’s guide to Disrupt SF 2016 Advertisement With Intel set to spin off its security unit into a reincarnation of McAfee, attention is quickly turning to Chris Young, the guy tasked with steering the security ship through tumultuous waters and back toward relative independence. Young has been running Intel’s Security Group for quite some time now as senior vice president and general manager. While he will officially be given a CEO title in his new role, the position will be a rare point of continuity for a team that has changed hands twice in the last five years. We sat down with Young to get the scoop on what the transaction means for the future of McAfee and how the company will be challenged in the coming months to navigate a separation from Intel and find its stride in a rapidly changing cybersecurity ecosystem. The history McAfee was founded in 1987 by yoga aficionado and reported real-life Narcos character John McAfee. Some years later, in 2011, chip giant Intel purchased McAfee for $7.68 billion. The transaction was critical in that it tilted the company’s focus toward the hardware layer. This transaction was heavily criticized, but Intel remained bullish that McAfee would support the company’s growth into chip-level security solutions. DeepDefender, a tool for detecting and removing rootkits, became the key product of the acquisition. It leveraged a priority load position to do its work, but ultimately was discontinued by the company in early 2015. McAfee, renamed the Intel Security Group by this point, continued to report growth, but never really met expectations from investors who patiently waited five years for a revolutionary new Intel security product that never came. Latest Crunch Report Tesla Acquisition of SolarCity Approved | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Shifting toward consumer IoT and full-service enterprise security Wednesday’s announcement marks a significant turning point in McAfee’s history, away from chip-level innovation toward securing the Internet of Things for consumers and consolidating the number of cybersecurity companies enterprises have to work with. While Intel will still own 49 percent of McAfee, Young says the company shouldn’t be seen as half chip company. Young and his investors from TPG, which own 51 percent of the company, have a plan for the future that involves riding that trend of service consolidation by enterprise customers. It’s common for large Fortune 500 companies to have security teams that work with dozens of cybersecurity providers for a slew of niche needs. Young explains that this creates accountability issues and communication problems when a company needs to respond to a hack. McAfee wants to partner and buy its way to the top of the cybersecurity food chain to establish itself as a force within the industry that can connect the growing number of startups in the space via the central McAfee platform. The plan is incredibly ambitious for a company that is on Day Two of finding its identify separate from Intel. Young believes that capital from TPG will enable McAfee to acquire security companies more broadly that may not have fit in with the initial Intel vision. Crunchbase McAfee Founded 1987 Overview McAfee is now part of Intel Security. With its Security Connected strategy, innovative approach to hardware-enhanced security, and unique Global Threat Intelligence, Intel Security is intensely focused on developing proactive, proven security solutions and services that protect systems, networks, and mobile devices for business and personal use around the world. Intel Security combines the experience … Location Santa Clara, CA Categories Network Security, Security, Enterprise Software Website http://www.mcafee.com Full profile for McAfee Intel Founded 1968 Overview Intel designs, manufactures, and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide. The company operates through PC client, data center, Internet of Things, mobile and communications groups; software and services; and all other segments. Its platforms are used in various computing applications comprising notebooks, desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, wireless and wired connectivity products, … Location Santa Clara, CA Categories Semiconductor, Hardware, Software, Manufacturing Website http://www.intel.com/ Full profile for Intel McAfee still has offices co-located with Intel, but will be moving offsite in the future. Amidst all the change, employees have been anxious about what they are expected to do during the transition. Despite lofty goals, Young is instructing employees to “just keep doing what they have been doing.” A transaction of such large magnitude is more than enough to keep him busy ironing out financial details and establishing the organizational structure, leadership and vision for the company. When the dust settles, and Young has forged a company identity, McAfee will focus on securing enterprise data centers. He also wants the company to continue working with device manufacturers and service providers to bolster the security of things we use every day, like cloud storage, communication and file sharing. For consumers, focus will remain on offering a one-stop shop for simplifying security. McAfee’s enterprise division is larger than its consumer division, but not by much. Users should be able to purchase a single security solution that can evolve and remain device-agnostic. This is what sets McAfee apart from device manufacturers that secure their own devices, says Young. And while the Internet of Things has been mostly underwhelming to date, McAfee will be further developing partnerships to put an end to vulnerabilities on the accessories we use with our core devices.

[Photo: Cole Burston/Bloomberg via Getty Images] Jared Lindzon 09.13.16 5:02 AM The tech industry has historically struggled with diversity and inclusion, and while many founders acknowledge its importance, few have taken proactive steps to reduce bias and improve diversity in the workplace. According to their own diversity reports, 70% of Google's staff are male, as well as 84% of Facebook's tech team, while Twitter's leadership is 72% white and 28% Asian. In a new study conducted by Lawless Research on behalf of Techstars and Chase for Business, 72% of tech founders believe building a diverse workforce is very important, and 81% acknowledge that a diverse workforce enhances creativity and innovation. The same study, however, found that only 12% employ five or more employees from diverse or underrepresented backgrounds. The study also notes that while 92% of founders are at least familiar with the term "unconscious bias," only 45% have taken steps to combat it. The study gathered responses from 680 tech founders and executives from companies established within the past seven years. While some major companies like Intel, Google, and Pinterest are taking proactive steps to improve the diversity of their workforce, the study concludes that early stage companies, particularly those founded in the past two years, are most likely to have no women or minorities in tech positions. [Screenshot: Lawless Research] The Proven Advantages Of More Diverse Workforces Those who champion diverse workforce initiatives, however, have a proven advantage. A 2015 study by McKinsey and Company found that companies in the top quartile for gender diversity were 15% more likely to outperform their competitors, while those in the top quartile for ethnic diversity were 35% more likely to see financial performances above the national industry median. Other studies have found that companies run by women achieve 35% higher returns on investment, and a recent report by Intel found that a diverse workforce increases revenues, profits, and market value. "In this report, it said that improving ethnic and gender diversity in the U.S. technology workforce could create between $470 billion and $570 billion in new value to the industry, and could add as much as 1.2 to 1.6 percentage points to the national GDP," Danielle Brown, Intel’s ‎chief diversity and inclusion officer, told Fast Company. In spite of the mountain of evidence to the contrary, however, only 23% of respondents of this survey believe diversity improves financial performance. Improving Hiring Practices Is Only Step One While hiring practices are a significant area of improvement for many founders, it is only one part of the equation, the study explains. Training and development programs, employee benefits, and management practices must be considered in order to retain a more diverse workforce. In fact, the study’s authors specifically recommend a seven-point plan for improving diversity and inclusiveness, especially for early-stage companies. Those steps are: Companies with higher numbers of diverse technical employees are more likely to standardize their interview process, ensuring that all candidates are asked identical questions. Advertising and recruiting in nontraditional venues helps startups find qualified technical professionals who are women and minorities. Startups classified as diversity leaders are more likely to provide their employees with technical professional development, leadership training, and mentoring programs. Offering parental leave and leave of absence can help startups increase tech diversity. Startups can increase the diversity of their technical staff by examining bias in their management practices, such as auditing jobs for pay equity. Ensure that measurable steps for promotion are clearly articulated. Examine task assignment processes as well as performance evaluation tools and criteria for bias. These are similar strategies to the ones laid out by researchers from Harvard and Tel Aviv universities who have studied why traditional diversity and inclusion initiatives like training often fail. "Companies are basically doubling down on the same approaches they’ve used since the 1960s—which often make things worse, not better," they wrote. They additionally advise businesses to encourage contact between groups, social accountability, and appoint diversity managers. Startups have an advantage established companies don't. They can build diversity into their organizations from the beginning. Of course inclusion can be a challenge, even to those most committed to seeing it through, but it's proven itself worth the extra effort. At the startup recruiting platform Jopwell, the first four employees were former schoolmates or work associates. As cofounder Porter Braswell told Fast Company in a previous interview: "I think it is okay to hire people you trust and know, but you can’t build a product that is going to change the way people interact and change the world without diversity in your organization."

The 16nm FinFET GPUs use Nv's Pascal architecture and follow on from the P100 launched in June. The P4 fits on a half-height, half-length PCIe card for scale-out servers, while the beefier P40 has its eyes set on scale-up boxes. The new pair are aimed mainly at inference work, ie: you give the hardware a trained AI model, some suitable software, and input data like video from a camera or sound from a microphone, and it spits out decisions, speech-to-text translations, object classifications, and so on. We've reached the stage now where deep-learning models are so elaborate – having being constructed on powerful systems using mountains of training data – that the inference side has to catch up: you need a decent number-crunching processor to push information through a complex neural network to make decisions in real time. That's good news for Intel, Nvidia and others because it means they can sell high-end chips for training and inference, but bad news for us punters: it means more and more data must be shipped off to the cloud, processed there, and the results shipped back to our phones, tablets, gadgets and gizmos, increasing our reliance on stable internet connections and trust in far-away platforms. Roy Kim, a senior Nvidia product manager, told us the way forward is a "hybrid" approach, with a less-accurate model on the device so that decisions can be made immediately while a more powerful backend processes the situation and returns a more nuanced decision. State-of-the-art image-recognition systems have more than 150 layers of neurons, said Kim, hence the need for some more oomph on the inference side. What's new? To maximize inference throughput, so your IoT personal-assistant-in-the-cloud doesn't leave you hanging for too long when you ask it a question, Nvidia has added two instructions to its Pascal architecture: IDP2A and IDP4A. These perform two and four-element 8-bit vector dot product calculations with a 32-bit accumulation. If I was a moron hack I would right now wax lyrically about Nvidia embracing the good old days of the 6502 or Z80, but I'll spare you that crap. Basically, data scientists say 8-bit precision is fine for neural networks, and that allows GPUs to shuttle around more bytes than they would if they were crunching wider 16-bit or 32-bit values. You don't need that level of precision when rippling input data through deep levels of perceptrons. Google's TensorFlow-accelerating ASIC uses eight bits for inference, we understand. And Intel and AMD chips can also blast through 8-bit vectors. Dot what? Vector dot products are at the heart of artificial neural networks. At the core of all the AI hype at the moment are strings of math equations – dot products and other formula – that extract features from input data, or in plainer English, identify interesting things in information from sensors, cameras and so on, so that software can act on it. This is done by assembling, or training, a network that data flows into and trickles along various paths with different weightings on them, until an answer is formed. The weights are assigned during training to detect features in incoming data. You can find a gentle introduction to how this works over here, and more involved tutorials here and here [PDF]. The diagram of a single neuron below looks horrific but it's not as scary as you think. You've got values x1 to xn coming in on the left along n paths. Each xi input value is multiplied by its path's weight wi, and then the results of these multiplications are all added up. That's the dot product part. Then that sum is fed into a threshold or activation function, and that output is fed into the next perceptron in the network. When you link these together you get something looking like this basic network, which has two inputs, three neurons, and an output. Let's take just the top neuron. It takes the M input value, multiplies it by the weight θ1, and adds the result to J multiplied by θ2. It takes that sum, runs it through an activation function, and feeds the result into the furthest right neuron. So, ignoring the activation function, that top neuron's dot-product output is: (M x θ1) + (J x θ2). Now imagine those variables are each 8-bit integers ranging from -127 to 127, or 0 to 255. Now imagine doing up to 47 trillion of those dot-product operations a second, all combining inputs to feed into the next stages of a network. That's what Nvidia's P40 is claiming to do. That's what Nv means by accelerated 8-bit dot product calculations. Nvidia also claims its P4 can do, at its very best, 21.8 trillion operations a second using 8-bit integers, and that the P4 is "40 times more efficient" than an Intel Xeon E5 CPU in terms of the number of images classified per second per watt using an AlexaNet-trained model. That's after you've taken your AI model and squashed it down to 8-bit weights. This apparently works well for models trained to recognize speech, and is also good for classifying images and similar inference work.

The P40 is basically a slightly beefier Titan X. Meanwhile, Nvidia has released TensorRT, an inference engine to run on its hardware, and a software development kit called Deepstream, which can identify people and objects in high-resolution (HEVC, VP9) video. ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 24 Comments More from The Register Nvidia, Samsung pump brakes in car-crash GPU patent rip-off race After swerving through the courts with lawsuits, tech giants call last-minute truce 4 Comments Nvidia's financials have great numbers.

AMD Zen & Intel Kaby Lake - Neue Desktop-CPUs angeblich verspätet Die neuen Prozessoren von AMD und Intel werden laut neuen Berichten aus Asien wohl einige Wochen später erhältlich sein als bisher gedacht. Von Georg Wieselsberger | Datum: 13.09.2016 ; 10:04 Uhr Kommentare (24) AMDs Zen wird angeblich erst ab Februar 2017 erhältlich sein, doch auch Intels Kaby Lake S für den Desktop soll sich verspäten. Schon seit Wochen gibt es Gerüchte darüber, das AMD und Intel ihre neuen Desktop-Prozessoren Zen und Kaby Lake S auf der Consumer Electronic Show Anfang Januar 2017 in Las Vegas vorstellen werden. AMD-CEO Lisa Su hatte zuletzt davon gesprochen, dass die Zen-Prozessoren mit dem Codenamen »Summit Ridge« im 1. Quartal 2017 in größeren Mengen ausgeliefert wird, es aber vielleicht schon Ende 2016 eine kleinere Lieferung geben könnte. Nun meldet die Webseite Benchlife, dass die neuen Prozessoren wohl erst im Februar 2017 wirklich erhältlich sein werden. Gleichzeitig wird es neue Mainboards mit Sockel AM4 und dem High-End-Chipsatz X370 und den kleineren Versionen B350 und A320 geben. Die Mainboards sollen auch der Grund dafür sein, dass Zen wohl erst im Februar 2017 startet, da die Hersteller Zeit benötigen, um ausreichende Lagerbestände ihrer Produkte aufbauen zu können. Intel wird aber laut der gleichen Meldung von dieser eventuellen Verzögerung von Zen keinen Vorteil ziehen können, denn auch die Desktop-Prozessoren der Kaby-Lake-S-Serie sollen sich verspäten. Intel werde zwar wie erwartet die neuen Prozessoren samt dem Top-Modell Core i7 7700K auf der CES vorstellen, allerdings dann nicht wie üblich mit der Auslieferung größerer Mengen beginnen. Den Grund für die Verschiebung von Kaby Lake S nennt die Webseite in diesem Fall aber nicht. Die noch leistungsfähigeren Intel-Prozessoren der Skylake-X und Kaby-Lake-X-Serien, die einen neuen Sockel 2066 verwenden, werden laut einer Roadmap erst nach dem 2. Quartal 2017 erscheinen. Der Februar 2017 oder zumindest das 1. Quartal 2017 könnten im Bereich der Prozessoren der interessanteste Zeitraum seit vielen Jahren werden und wird zeigen, ob AMD wirklich wieder mit Intel konkurrieren kann.

Was nützt es denn wenn du Was auf dem Markt wirfst, wenn aber die anderen Komponenten, die zum Betrieb wichtig sind, fehlen? Die Tatsache das JEDER Herstellender Betrieb einen gewissen Stock aufbaut von einem Produkt hat den Hintergrund, das man den Markt bedienen kann und nicht in den Ruf des "nicht erhältlich" reinrutscht. Was macht den der Konsument, wenn von Produkt "X" nichts oder nur sehr vereinzelt erhältlich ist? Der Konsument geht schlimmstenfalls zur Konkurenz. Man Verkauft und Liefert einem Kunden ja auch kein Auto sollange die Räder nicht auch geliefert und Montiert wurden. Nach deinem Denken wäre ein Supermarkt super klein, weil du ja NUR ein Produkt benötigst und wenn du was haben möchtest wird erst dann, Die Kuh gemolken, das Tier geschlachtet, das Korn gesäht...  (3)  |   (0) Andre_75 #7 | 13. Sep 2016, 11:11 Was bringt es ein Produkt auf den Markt zu bringen wenn man nicht genug davon hat um es auch anbieten zu können? Ist doch bei allem so, stell dir vor Apple haut das neue iPhone heute auf den Markt, da es fertig entwickelt ist, aber hat kaum welche produziert und kann somit nur ein paar Kunden beliefern. Das bringt es nicht.  (1)  |   (0) TheSam #8 | 13. Sep 2016, 11:20 ---  (0)  |   (0) ethnix #9 | 13. Sep 2016, 11:27 Vielleicht schicke ich meinen Ivy Bridge in Rente.

News Room SOURCE: NVIDIA September 12, 2016 23:00 ET New NVIDIA Pascal GPUs Accelerate Deep Learning Inference Tesla P4, P40 Accelerators Deliver 45x Faster AI; TensorRT and DeepStream Software Boost AI for Video Inferencing BEIJING, CHINA--(Marketwired - Sep 12, 2016) - GPU Technology Conference China - NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today unveiled the latest additions to its Pascal™ architecture-based deep learning platform, with new NVIDIA® Tesla® P4 and P40 GPU accelerators and new software that deliver massive leaps in efficiency and speed to accelerate inferencing production workloads for artificial intelligence services. Modern AI services such as voice-activated assistance, email spam filters, and movie and product recommendation engines are rapidly growing in complexity, requiring up to 10x more compute compared to neural networks from a year ago. Current CPU-based technology isn't capable of delivering real-time responsiveness required for modern AI services, leading to a poor user experience. The Tesla P4 and P40 are specifically designed for inferencing, which uses trained deep neural networks to recognize speech, images or text in response to queries from users and devices. Based on the Pascal architecture, these GPUs feature specialized inference instructions based on 8-bit (INT8) operations, delivering 45x faster response than CPUs1 and a 4x improvement over GPU solutions launched less than a year ago.2 The Tesla P4 delivers the highest energy efficiency for data centers. It fits in any server with its small form-factor and low-power design, which starts at 50 watts, helping make it 40x more energy efficient than CPUs for inferencing in production workloads.3 A single server with a single Tesla P4 replaces 13 CPU-only servers for video inferencing workloads,4 delivering over 8x savings in total cost of ownership, including server and power costs. The Tesla P40 delivers maximum throughput for deep learning workloads. With 47 tera-operations per second (TOPS) of inference performance with INT8 instructions, a server with eight Tesla P40 accelerators can replace the performance of more than 140 CPU servers.5 At approximately $5,000 per CPU server, this results in savings of more than $650,000 in server acquisition cost. "With the Tesla P100 and now Tesla P4 and P40, NVIDIA offers the only end-to-end deep learning platform for the data center, unlocking the enormous power of AI for a broad range of industries," said Ian Buck, general manager of accelerated computing at NVIDIA. "They slash training time from days to hours. They enable insight to be extracted instantly. And they produce real-time responses for consumers from AI-powered services." Software Tools for Faster Inferencing Complementing the Tesla P4 and P40 are two software innovations to accelerate AI inferencing: NVIDIA TensorRT and the NVIDIA DeepStream SDK. TensorRT is a library created for optimizing deep learning models for production deployment that delivers instant responsiveness for the most complex networks. It maximizes throughput and efficiency of deep learning applications by taking trained neural nets -- defined with 32-bit or 16-bit operations -- and optimizing them for reduced precision INT8 operations. NVIDIA DeepStream SDK taps into the power of a Pascal server to simultaneously decode and analyze up to 93 HD video streams in real time compared with seven streams with dual CPUs.6 This addresses one of the grand challenges of AI: understanding video content at-scale for applications such as self-driving cars, interactive robots, filtering and ad placement. Integrating deep learning into video applications allows companies to offer smart, innovative video services that were previously impossible to deliver. Leap Forward for Customers NVIDIA customers are delivering increasingly more innovative AI services that require the highest compute performance. "Delivering simple and responsive experiences to each of our users is very important to us," said Greg Diamos, senior researcher at Baidu. "We have deployed NVIDIA GPUs in production to provide AI-powered services such as our Deep Speech 2 system and the use of GPUs enables a level of responsiveness that would not be possible on un-accelerated servers. Pascal with its INT8 capabilities will provide an even bigger leap forward and we look forward to delivering even better experiences to our users."

Alizera Shafaei, a UBC PhD student who wrote a paper showing how video games can be used to train a computer vision system, was quoted in the Mail article and in a similar story in Vice. Synthetic data like that used in video games can be just as useful for training, if not more so, said Shafaei. “With artificial environments we can effortlessly gather precisely annotated data at a larger scale with a considerable amount of variation in lighting and climate settings.” Next Big Thing 2014 View all Next Big Thing 2014 submissions.

Chandrasekaran , Benzinga Staff Writer   {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} September 13, 2016 1:27pm   Comments Share: Related SYMC LifeLock Could Be 'Too Good An Opportunity' For Symantec To Pass Up Wall Street's M&A Chatter From November 14 Growth-Needy Cisco Aiming To Be Top Dog In Security Vs. Palo Alto (Investor's Business Daily) Wunderlich Securities thinks Symantec Corporation (NASDAQ: SYMC) has spent more money in the last few years on transforming itself to next-generation security provider. Earlier, the company was restricted to backup and bulky legacy security. Analysts Bill Choi and Ryan MacDonald believe the transformation could enable Symantec to offer updated solutions to different segments like web/cloud with the addition of Blue Coat Systems to the consumer and enterprises. As a result, the company would become strong to boost its market share inside the IT segment by consolidating its presence in the enterprise segment. As a result, the brokerage upgraded the stock from Hold to a Buy rating and boosted target price from $23 to $30.

In our opinion, Symantec significantly improved its position with the Blue Coat acquisition, which has good mix of web and cloud security," according to the research note. The brokerage sees stabilization in Symantec's core businesses based on the expectation of reaccelerated endpoint security business due to the integration of BlueCoat business. The lead analyst sees the company gaining in DLP and cyber security services due to Blue Coat. Wunderlich sees Symantec progressing well toward achieving its cost savings goal of $400 million pointing out that it has already achieved $50 million runrate in the last quarter. Analyst expects more than $150 million cost savings from Blue Coat amalgamation. At time of writing, Symantec was down 0.52 percent at $24.72. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

The chipmaker, which dominates in video gaming, rolled out graphics chips for running software that makes split-second decisions needed when everything from phones to cars to internet search engines respond to inputs such as speech, images and moving objects. The company said its new Tesla P4 chip is for servers used in massive data centers. Based on its Pascal design, the P4 is more than three times as efficient at processing images than its predecessor and 40 times more efficient than Intel server chips, according to Nvidia. Another new chip, called the P40, is designed for more-powerful single computers, such as supercomputers. Read more about artificial intelligence here. Nvidia is taking aim at its Santa Clara, California-based neighbor Intel Corp., which last month announced its own AI chips and talked about its ambition to muscle in on this nascent but fast-growing market. Both companies also want to ensure data center operators such as Google not only use their technology but aren’t tempted to design their own custom solutions.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter Nvidia has argued its graphics chips, which perform multiple small manipulations of data simultaneously, are the right answer for AI systems, and it has invested in software to make them easier to use. Intel has said its chips, which have less ability to work in parallel but are more capable in general purpose computing, offer the right solutions. Data center owners, whose biggest cost is energy, are focused on components that can get the job done using less power. It’s still early days in the market for AI chips. In its latest quarter, Nvidia’s data center business more than doubled sales to $151 million and most of this came from AI tasks. Intel’s data center unit had sales of $4 billion, but very little of that revenue came from AI projects. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Press Release: Panasonic introduces Automotive Mobile Test Solution to enhance vehicle system initialisation and production testing 1 by Surur  @mspoweruser Sep 13, 2016 at 14:00 GMT2 months ago BRACKNELL, UK. 13th September 2016:  Designed by Panasonic Global Design Solutions following close consultation with leading industry manufacturers, Panasonic has launched its next generation in-line testing solution for the automotive industry at Automechanika in Frankfurt, Germany. The Panasonic Automotive Mobile Test Solution (AMTS) combines the technology requested by the automotive industry for efficient vehicle production and initialisation with enterprise features for seamless integration into a corporate IT environment. Designed with user and processes in mind The device has been developed with both ease of use and automotive production processes at the forefront of the design. The AMTS, based on the market-leading fully rugged Panasonic Toughpad FZ-M1 tablet, incorporates a 7 inch capacitive multi-touchscreen display, an NFC contactless card reader, integrated high power infrared, and a 2D barcode reader which are situated within the specially designed handle of the AMTS which aids mobility in the production environment. The solution is designed to be positioned on the steering wheel or the dashboard of the vehicle being tested due to its interchangeable, protective mounting insert. The AMTS also includes four programmable hot keys for one-touch access to important applications and functionality. Specialised connectivity The AMTS is built with the connectivity requirements of the automotive manufacturers in mind with dual rugged connectors that allow USB communication plus protected ODB in-vehicle charging from a VCI device. This means that the solution is ergonomic for both left and right hand drive vehicles. The power for testing applications To meet the processing and efficiency requirements for automotive testing, the Panasonic AMTS is powered by the Intel® Core™ m5-6Y57 vPro processor (1.1GHz up to 2.8 GHz with Intel® Turbo Boost Technology and a 4MB Intel cache) and Intel® HD graphics. It comes with the latest Windows 10 Pro operating system, which can be downgraded to Windows 7 Professional. For storage there is a 128GB Solid State Drive with 256GB optional. For communications, the AMTS is equipped with Bluetooth™ v4.1+EDR Class 1 and an Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 8260 WLAN capability with optional 4G mobile broadband (Gobi 5000, compatible to 3G) connectivity. A decade of design history “Panasonic has near a decade of experience collaborating with some of the world’s leading automotive manufacturers to create rugged mobile devices designed for the industry’s requirements,” said Robert Blowers, Head of R&D and General Manager at Panasonic Computer Products Europe. “As a result of our relationship and collaborative approach with these manufacturers, The Automotive Mobile Test Solution is the next generation of mobile device to help deliver ever more efficient and cost effective vehicle production for our customers.” The Panasonic AMTS will be available from October 2016 and is priced from £3,490.

The latest chunk'o’change brings its total funding to $25.6m, and founder and CEO Sid Sijbrandij said the cash would be used to “accelerate development and adoption” of its products: “We want to be the first company to integrate and git-ify all the tools developers need.” GitLab sees the software development process into a 10-step cycle, from initial idea, through development, testing, etc to production. A 12-step programme would be more catchy, but we suppose they don’t actually want to cure anyone of developing software. CEO Sid Sijbrandij said each step or two steps constituted a potential discrete product, and the firm wanted to span collaboration across the entire cycle. The ultimate aim was a single super product, he continued. The firm has already integrated continuous integration into its platform. In August it shipped Issue Board. Its September release will target Deployment with spiced up Review functionality, and cycle analytics and an improved Slackbot to cover production are slated for later this year. At the same time, there are certain bounds to GitLab’s ambitions - or at least how much of customers’ existing setup it can reasonably expect to displace. “We recognise there’s more out there, so we want to to play nice with what companies already have.” “What’s outside our scope is the PAAS,” he said. “We won’t go into your production environments, we won’t do configuration.” Something else outside its scope is blowing cash on a fancy corporate HQ. While it’s a cliché that once firms start spending more time building their HQ than their products, they’re in trouble, Gitlab has no corporate HQ at all, and its 100-plus staff are spread around the world. Which means Sijbrandij is now based in San Francisco; he only shares his digs with his wife and cat. “We don’t have any location where two people work.” He admitted that this left some investors “sceptical” about the model, but insists, “When they saw the amazing people we were able to hire, that changed their mind.” ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 10 Comments More from The Register Think GitHub and Git but for data – and you've got FlockerHub and fli ClusterHQ debuts information time machine for better production testing 9 Comments New Year, new Git: Version control system updated this week Careful of flakiness when perusing this box of delights 7 Comments Git thee behind me, Git crit security bug!

The company is engaged in the design and manufacture of digital technology platforms with segments that include Client Computing, Data Center, Internet of Things, Software and Services, etc. The stock is bouncing off of support, and the technology dividend-payer should be popular among buyers following the Fed speech. Investors have repriced a much lower probability for higher interest rates than they had last week, which is good for INTC’s dividend and fundamental performance. We recommend maintaining a short-term outlook, but, for now, a repeat of the post-Brexit rally doesn’t seem an unlikely possibility. Buy to open the INTC October 36 Calls (INTC161021C00036000).

The most common one is using the system CPU to process audio, under a technique called HSP (Host Signal Processing), with the south bridge chip from the chipset providing the necessary interfacing circuit with the external world. The second way  which nowadays is only seen on few very high-end motherboards  is using a dedicated controller to control and process the audio and thus not using the system CPU for these tasks.  http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/how-o...audio-works/2/ Thus, the feature in Win10 dedicates a CPU core to handle the data to/from the motherboards codec chip. This is the work that is handled by external interfaces. As for synthesis, my bet is that people arent using audio fonts and the like much any longer. All of these plugins and stand along soft synths use the CPU directly; they are usually not accelerated by any dedicated device (unless you get into stuff like UAudio plugins).

I was going to upgrade the Fatal1ty Champion I have now but I think I'll wait for cards built with Win10 official support in mind.Not this current generation that has to play catch up with handicapped drivers because the hardware is now inadequate to handle Windows Audio Processing.I can only imagine what the prices would be like, now that they have to match Window's 32bit sample rates, f#$%n hell. The f*^&n OS added 32bit sample rates to my f#%^n card, literally taking complete control over it, rendering it's ability to alleviate cpu time useless.Thankfully we have people like PAX and DK to try and sort out the mess for us.God Bless them, but they can only do so much, this time around.

Scientists from Darmstadt University in Germany and Intel Labs have developed a new clever method to source visual data from Grand Theft Auto that could then be fed to computers to teach vehicles how to drive autonomously. Although machine learning is enabling computers to quickly pick up new skills, the approach requires large quantities of information to work effectively –  and data could be hard to find sometimes. It takes thousands of hours of real-world visual data in various scenarios to teach cars how to navigate on their own, but the researchers say information from games is easy to collect and can be “almost as good, or sometimes even better” than real data. This is where Grand Theft Auto’s incredibly realistic environment comes in play. The scientists created a software that is capable of classifying different objects on roads within the game. The data generated can then be used to teach self-driving cars the difference between pedestrians and other objects when navigating through the real world. You can watch the video in the section above to see how the researchers are gathering data from Grand Theft Auto. And while scientists are still figuring out the best ways to teach computers how to drive, companies from the likes of Google, Uber, BMW and Nvidia are in a heated race to conquer the nascent market of self-driving cars.

Nvidia officials are looking to grab a larger share of the ever-expanding artificial intelligence space. At the company's GPU Technology Conference in Beijing this week, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang unveiled two new GPUs that are specifically designed for the part of the deep learning process called "inference," an area where the work is usually processed on CPUs from Intel. The new GPUs—the Tesla P4 and P40 (pictured)—are part of a widening push by Nvidia in the artificial intelligence (AI) arena and the latest point of competition between the GPU maker and Intel in the emerging market. AI refers to the creation of systems that can collect input (such as voice commands or images from the environments around them), process the data instantly and then react accordingly. It can be seen in such technologies as Siri on Apple iPhones and movie recommendation programs on Netflix, and will play an increasingly important role in other spaces, such as self-driving cars. "AI is everywhere," Marc Hamilton, vice president of solutions architecture and engineering at Nvidia, told eWEEK. "We believe it's the most important computing technology in the industry right now." Nvidia officials over the past couple of years have made AI and deep learning crucial parts of the vendor's strategy going forward, and Intel also is aggressively pursuing the emerging market. Central to the competition is the debate over whether GPUs or the x86 CPU architecture are best suited for the workloads that need to run in order for AI to fulfill its promise. The issue of deep learning is twofold. There essentially are two parts of machine learning: training (where neural networks are taught such things as object identification) and inference (where they use this training to recognize and process unknown inputs, such as Siri understanding a user's question and then responding correctly). Neural networks used for training are large, and most training is done on Nvidia GPUs. The inference networks are smaller, and most of that work is done on CPUs from Intel. However, Nvidia officials are arguing now that the Tesla P4 and P40 deliver greater performance and efficiency than Intel chips for inference applications. Both are based on the vendor's 16-nanometer Pascal architecture and offer specialized inference instructions based on 8-bit (INT8) operations. According to Nvidia officials, the new GPUs offer four times faster response than the previous GPU offerings launched less than a year ago and 45 times better response than CPUs. The P4, due out in November, is smaller than the P40 and is designed for data centers where energy efficiency is key. The GPU, which starts at 50 watts of power, can fit into any server and low-power system and, according to Nvidia, is 40 times more efficient than CPUs when running production inferencing workloads. A single server powered by a P4 GPU can replace 13 CPU-only systems for video inferencing workloads and deliver more than eight times the savings in total cost of ownership, which includes server and power costs. The larger and more powerful P40, which is scheduled for release in October, provides 47 tera-operations per second (TOPS) of inference performance, and a server with eight P40 GPU accelerators can replace more than 140 CPU-based servers, saving organizations more than $650,000 in server acquisition costs. The two graphics cards follow the massive P100 that Nvidia officials introduced in April, which packs 150 billion transistors and was built for data center and cloud environments. Intel is pushing ahead with its own AI initiatives. The chip maker in recent months bought Nervana Systems and its machine learning technologies, and officials have boasted of the company's commitment to such open machine learning frameworks as Caffe and Theano. In addition, at the Intel Developer Forum last month, Intel officials talked about the planned release of a multi-core Xeon Phi chip dubbed "Knights Mill" with enhanced variable precision and flexible high-capacity memory that is aimed at AI workloads. Knights Mill is due out next year. Nvidia also introduced new software tools for inferencing workloads. TensorRT is a software library designed to make it faster and more efficient to taking neural networks that have been trained and optimizing them for reduced precision INT8 operation. In addition, the DeepStream software developer kit (SDK) is aimed at video streams. The software enables servers powered by Pascal GPUs to simultaneously decode and analyze up to 93 high-definition video streams in real time, much faster than the seven streams that can be run with dual CPUs, officials said. This capability will be important for such applications as self-driving cars, interactive robots and ad placement, they said.             LATEST NETWORKING ARTICLES   Cisco Posts Modestly Good Quarter, but Outlook is Soft Nutanix Brings Networking Into Its Enterprise Cloud Platform Cypress Adds Connectivity Option to WICED IoT Platform BT, CA Make Deeper Pushes Into Growing SD-WAN Space Cisco Brings Flexible Payments, App Site to Spark Collaboration Tool                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

The SM951 AHCI PCIe Gen3 x4 M.2 SSD delivered the goods at the time like nothing previously seen. Even Intel's behemoth 750 Series NVMe SSDs had trouble outperforming this tiny M.2 SSD. The only issue with the SM951 AHCI was thermal throttling that in some cases greatly reduced performance.     Sonnet Technologies, a leading aftermarket company that mainly caters to the Mac crowd, has created a custom Add-In-Card (AIC) utilizing Samsung's SM951 AHCI M.2 SSD, a custom heat sink and an M.2 to PCIe Gen3 x 4 lane PCIe slot adapter, dubbed Tempo. The large custom heat sink wicks heat away from the drive's controller and flash packages, thus putting an end to the thermal throttling issues that have plagued the SM951 AHCI from day one.   Sonnet adds a hefty premium for this custom design, and that's to be expected from a company that caters mainly to Mac users. The price for the Tempo 512GB SSD is roughly $200 more than if you were to buy a 512GB SM951 AHCI in a standalone M.2 form factor. However, you get the benefit of a design that virtually eliminates thermal throttling as well as a more universal form factor that can be utilized on computers that do not have a built-in M.2 Gen3 x4 slot. Because the Tempo is an AHCI based drive, the Tempo has true plug and play capabilities for most Mac's as well as Windows PCs.   At the heart of the Tempo is a Samsung SM951 AHCI SSD, so we know it is going to be good; let's see how good.   Specifications     Sonnet's Tempo AIC SSD is available in two capacities: 256GB and 512GB. The 512GB model we have on the bench has the following factory specifications for Windows PC's with PCIe 3.0 slots:   Sequential Read: up to 1936 MB/s Sequential Write: up to 1529 MB/s Max 4K Random Read Speed: not listed Max 4K Random Write Speed: not listed   The Tempo retail package includes the drive, half-height mounting bracket, full height mounting bracket, and printed quick start guide.   Sonnet warranties the Tempo for one year, which is way too short of a period in our opinion. Because the SM951 AHCI is an OEM product, the warranty and endurance are specified by the reseller instead of Samsung.

News & Analysis Touch Standard Rides I3C Link MIPI aims to replace proprietary interfaces Rick Merritt 9/14/2016 11:30 AM EDT Post a comment NO RATINGS 2 saves Login to Rate Tweet MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. – The MIPI Alliance has started work on a standard interface for touch screens using its emerging I3C interconnect announced earlier this year. MIPI Touch, described at a developer’s conference here, aims to simplify work for engineers who currently support a handful of proprietary approaches. The interface includes a standard command set for relaying messages between the application processor and other touch components. It aims to replace a variety of approaches using I2C and SPI links the group claims are not well optimized for mobile systems The spec, now in a draft to contributors, is expected to be ratified sometime next year. It is being developed by companies including Intel, NXP, Qualcomm, Samsung and Synaptics. It’s not clear if potential users such as Apple and their vendors will support the effort. In the iPhone 6, Apple used a touchscreen controller from Broadcom and a line driver from Texas Instruments, according to a teardown by TechInsights. Apple is a contributing member of MIPI, but Broadcom is not a member. Today’s many touch-based smartphones, tablets and in-car gadgets send data “over a slow interface with customized register sets and functions so every OEM writes special drivers…MIPI Touch makes the process more transparent,” said Dale Stolitzka, a principal engineer in Samsung Display and chair of the MIPI Alliance’s display working group. MIPI Touch will support both standard and custom commands over an I3C interconnect. (Image: MIPI) MIPI Touch is not specific to today’s mainstream capacitive touch sensors. It will support single-, multi-touch and stylus inputs; and it allows vendors to create custom commands and functions outside a basic shared command set. The current version of the spec does not take into account force data, also known as haptics, but the spec could be updated in the future to include it. Earlier this month, Apple described a large custom haptics sensor it built into its iPhone 7. Engineers may be able to implement MIPI Touch in firmware if their devices have an embedded controller, Stolitzka said. The MIPI I3C interface the touch standard is based on is in a final review stage now. I3C supports data rates of more than 30 Mbits/second and has compatibility modes for working with I2C. “We’re trying to make it as easy as possible for vendors to implement this quickly,” said Stolitzka. Looking ahead, the rise of virtual and augmented reality goggles are expected to drive needs for new MIPI display interfaces with greater throughput. “The issue will be how much display area in pixels people need to look at and the commensurate bandwidth to support the resolution demands,” Stolitzka said. “We probably need to think about doubling bandwidth from where we are with the D-PHY interface at about 4 Gbits/s today,” an effort that could take about a year, he added. In addition, MIPI aims to extend its work beyond the smartphone to cars and TVs. That could require extending some interfaces to support distances measured in meters rather than inches, said Rick Wietfeldt, chair of MIPI's technical steering group in a keynote talk here. — Rick Merritt, Silicon Valley Bureau Chief, EE Times Related posts: Apple Debuts Three Custom Chips 4 Traps in Installing Capacitive Touchscreens for Auto Googles Daydream is Silicon Reality Where Is Top 10 IoT Processor List?

View Latest Posts >>> Russian Black Sea Fleet ‘Has Everything’ to Destroy Enemy Moving to Crimea By Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor on September 14, 2016 Russian Black Sea Fleet ‘Has Everything’ to Destroy Enemy Moving to Crimea … from  Sputnik, Moscow [ Editor’s Note: NATO’s ploy to think that a NEO-Nazi coup in Kiev was going to have the key Russian naval base in Crimea fall into its hands like a ripe apple was ill-founded, notwithstanding that Moscow had prepaid the Sevastopol base rental fees for a decade in advance to help out Kiev’s cash flow. Despite the Western puppet government installed in Kiev, the large majority of ethnic Russians in Crimea were not about to have the boot of Ukrainian nationalists on their necks. They did what any reasonable people would, telling Kiev with their secession vote where it could stick its boot. And so would the US, if it had been in a similar situation with Americans being threatened. The major boomerang from all of this is the huge focus now on Russia’s building up its defense capacities, despite the hardships of the sanctions. And with Obama’s ill thought out Asian Pivot, the Chinese are in the same mode now, particularly on making and deploying technical advances to counter US numerical naval advantage. Was triggering a new arms race to fill the coffers of the military industrial complex a major motivating factor in the strategy, when there was no realistic military threat from either Russia or China? Many geopolitical analysts think so, including those in the Intel field… Jim W. Dean ] ____________ – First published  …  September 14,  2016 – The Russian Black Sea Fleet is fully capable of defending the country’s borders thanks to reconnaissance and modern weapons, the General Staff’s head said. The Russian Black Sea Fleet is capable of engaging a potential enemy while advancing from its bases, the Russian Defense Ministry’s head of General Staff, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, said Wednesday. “The Black Sea Fleet now has everything needed to do so: intelligence tools that detect targets at ranges up to 500 kilometers [310 miles] and weapons. The Bastion coastal missile complex alone extends 350 kilometers [217 miles] up to and including the Bosphorous,” Gerasimov told reporters. He added that the fleet’s submarines armed with Kalibr cruise missiles, naval aviation, as well as strategic and tactical aircraft would prevent a potential enemy’s landing troops “from reaching the Black Sea coast of Crimea wherever it comes from.” “The Black Sea Fleet should be able to – and it has demonstrated its ability to – independently engage a landing force while advancing, starting from the loading ports,” Gerasimov stressed. __________ Russia Unleashes Lethal Next Gen Kalibr Cruise Missile During War Games (VIDEO) Russian Caspian Flotilla warships have successfully fired advanced Kalibr-NK cruise missiles as part of the country’s Caucasus-2016 military exercise. The Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement that the Kalibr-class cruise missiles launched from the Caspian Sea during Russia’s most recent display of strength all had accurately struck their designated land and sea practice targets. In the first stage of the drills, a missile fired from the Grad Sviyazhsk corvette with the use of Kalibr precision system flew about 100 nautical miles and successfully hit the onshore target — an artificial enemy command post. In the second stage of the exercises, a Kalibr missile launched from the Uglich small-size missile vessel struck a sea target located at a distance of over 70 nautical miles, the Defense ministry’s press service reported. Kalibr-class cruise missiles, the game-changing development by the Russian defense industry, can travel 50 to 150 meters above the ground and hit sea targets up to 350 kilometers away and ground targets more than 2,500 kilometers away. Their maximum deviation from the designated target is only three meters. Here is the chilling footage showing the missiles streak away into the air, leaving behind volumes of smoke. Russia’s Caucasus-2016 drills were aimed at testing the Caspian flotilla’s ability to resolve crisis situations threatening the country’s defense security. ____________ Related Posts: Why Russia Will NOT Be Dedicated to the “Virgin Mary” Russia tests stratospheric missile to destroy fleets Who Instigates Russian-Ukrainian War Over Crimea?

Someone that knows about PC hardware, is going to know that this is a very expensive piece of hardware. They are not going to pay that much for the machine, even though it is a small beefy PC! It is very expensive, and limited. They should have done what Alienware did with the Alpha, and target smaller hardware with lesser power, at a much lower cost. The Alpha is a quick selling product because of it's size, price, and power to be enough for mainstream gaming. The companies are also trying to call some of the small form factor PC's consoles, but you try to sell this to a console user that probably only paid maybe $400 on average for a console you aren't going to get anyone to buy it then. I am a huge fan of SFF PC's, but they have to have some value.     vbetts View Public Profile Find all posts by vbetts « Previous Thread | Next Thread » Thread Tools Show Printable Version Email this Page Display Modes Linear Mode Switch to Hybrid Mode Switch to Threaded Mode Posting Rules You may not post new threads You may not post replies You may not post attachments You may not edit your posts BB code is On Smilies are On [IMG] code is On HTML code is Off Forum Rules Forum Jump User Control Panel Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home General Chat     The Guru's Pub     Folding@Home - Join Team Guru3D !     Frontpage news     Digital Photography, Home and Portable Electronics     Tablets and Smart Phones     The HTPC, HDTV & Ultra High Definition section Videocards     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce Drivers Section     Videocards - AMD Radeon     Videocards - AMD Radeon Catalyst Drivers Section     Videocards - 3dfx     Videocards vs General Purpose - NVIDIA Ageia PhysX, GPGPU etc.     3D Stereo Gaming Section     Benchmark Mayhem Hardware     General Hardware     Die-hard Overclocking & Case Modifications      Computer Monitor Forum     Soundcards, Speakers HiFI & File formats     SSD and HDD storage     Processors and motherboards AMD     Processors and motherboards Intel     Network questions and troubleshooting     Laptops & Notebooks Affiliates     Rivatuner Generic Discussion forum         RivaTuner Advanced Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Overclock Application Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Private Beta access     ATI Tray Tools         ATI Tray Tools Generic Discussion             ATI Tray Tools Public Beta Section     Guru of 3D Clan General     Games, Gaming & Game-demos     Game Tweaks and Modifications     Consoles & console games     Operating Systems     General Software and Applications     Hardware Reviews and News     Programming/Html     Links Powered by vBulletin® Copyright ©2000 - 2016, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd. vBulletin Skin developed by: vBStyles.com Copyright (c) 1995-2014, All Rights Reserved.

Grand Theft Auto is being used to teach the artificial intelligence that controls self-driving cars. Researchers are using open worlds built by Rockstar and other developers to replicate real-world data. Using games like Grand Theft Auto is cheaper and less time-consuming than creating bespoke software for machine learning, according to a Technology Review report. Researchers at Intel Labs and Darmstadt University have created software that can help AI differentiate between vehicles, pedestrians and other scenery in games like GTA. Doing the same with real-world data would take “thousands of hours” to collect and label the imagery. “With artificial environments we can effortlessly gather precisely annotated data at a larger scale with a considerable amount of variation in lighting and climate settings,” said Alireza Shafaei, a student and the University of British Columbia. “We showed that this synthetic data is almost as good, or sometimes even better, than using real data for training.” Would you be happy in a car that learnt how to navigate the streets of Los Santos and the Cunning Stunts courses?

(Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images) In November 2014, Li Yuxiao, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Cyberspace, stated, according to the state-run China Daily: “Now is the time for China to realize its responsibilities. If the United States is willing to give up its running of the internet sphere, the question comes as to who will take the baton and how it would be run. “We have to first set our goal in cyberspace, and then think about the strategy to take, before moving on to refining our laws,” he said. Li is now the head of a department designed to enforce the Chinese regime’s laws on technology companies. His comments are tied to a process announced by the United States in 2014 to relinquish control of the internet by ending the contract between the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). This process is now nearing its completion, with a deadline of Oct. 1. The handover is technically of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), which is a department of ICANN. It regulates domain name registrations for websites, handles the Domain Name System (DNS) Root Zone to ensure internet users are directed to the websites they intend to visit, and also handles internet protocols. The integrity of DNS, in particular, is critical, since it can be used for cyberattacks that send people to fake, infected websites. It’s also one of the primary systems manipulated for state censorship that can block access to specific websites. Read More China Wants to Control What You Watch The United States plans for the internet to be run by a multistakeholder model without government oversight, and relinquishing control of ICANN will be the last step in this process. Yet the new model does not mean ICANN, or the broader internet, will remain free from government influence. Rather, the United States is simply stepping back from this role. According to Chris Mattmann, who helped develop how email systems work under IANA and who also helped develop several Apache systems that are at the heart of the internet, the handover of ICANN is a concerning move. With this shift, Mattmann said, the process of determining which website is shown to you when you enter a web address “will no longer be driven by the U.S. Department of Commerce,” and this could be manipulated by foreign powers for anything from censorship to cyberattacks. For instance, if the Chinese regime were to object to a website that publishes information about its human rights record, the ability to influence IANA would allow the regime to make that website virtually invisible on the web. Mattmann, who currently works at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said he believes processes under ICANN need to be heavily vetted, noting that “even when the internet is itself distributed and decentralized,” the open system begins to break down without an authority to ensure it stays open. Already, the Chinese regime is moving to fill the void left by the U.S. handover—and its new system for governing the internet goes far beyond the responsibilities held by ICANN. Over the last two years, Chinese leaders have drafted an authoritarian set of laws that governs every facet of the internet. The Chinese regime has formed domestic institutions or gained control over international bodies to press these new laws for the internet through the United Nations; through domestic enforcement including on foreign companies inside China; and through organizations formed to work directly with major technology companies abroad and more generally with internet stakeholders. A Tool for Foreign Engagement Lu Wei, minister of the Cyberspace Affairs Administration of China, at the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, eastern China’s Zhejiang Province, on Nov. 19, 2014. (AFP PHOTO/JOHANNES EISELE In the two years since Li gave his speech at the 2014 World Internet Conference, the Chinese regime has gained ground on Li’s goal to govern the global internet. The three-day conference in Wuzhen, themed “An Interconnected World Shared and Governed by All,” brought together more than 1,000 internet companies from over 100 countries and regions. Li is now the secretary-general of the Cyber Security Association of China, which is chaired by Fang Binxing, the creator of China’s Great Firewall, which censors and monitors the country’s internet. The association, formed on March 25, gives the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) a vehicle for spreading its systems and laws for governing the internet abroad, while giving its efforts a benign facade under the label of “cybersecurity.” Related Coverage Inside the Global Banking E-Heist The association can start discussions abroad at “more senior levels” with “international industry, academic, and research associations” that constitute the global system that controls the internet under the multistakeholder model, according to a report from the Center for Strategic & International Studies. The association is registered as a national nonprofit organization, but according to the report, it answers directly to the Leading Small Group for Network Security and Information—which is chaired by CCP leader Xi Jinping—and is “responsible for shaping and implementing information security and internet policies and laws.” According to the report, the Cyber Security Association of China, among other tasks, focuses on “public opinion supervision to help in information control and propaganda” and “protecting core Chinese interests under globalization, and promoting globally competitive Chinese IT companies.” According to Xia Yiyang, senior director of research and policy at the Human Rights Law Foundation, there is more to the statement, “protecting core Chinese interests under globalization,” than meets the eye. “In the CCP’s language, it’s a way to keep the CCP in power by any means,” he said, adding, “They have a very clear definition of ‘core interests.'” In an interview published on the World Internet Conference website, Li stated that since China has the largest number of netizens in the world, it should have the right to “make the international rules of cyberspace governance.” “The establishment of rules is just a start,” he said. Influence Over Foreign Companies The Chinese regime has begun bringing major U.S. tech firms—including Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp., Cisco Systems Inc., and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)—into its newly formed committee, the Technical Committee 260. The committee is already working with foreign companies to enforce the CCP’s laws. According to the Wall Street Journal, it is inviting companies to help Chinese authorities draft rules for issues including encryption, big data, and cybersecurity, and with determining which technologies should be “secure and controllable” by the CCP. A screen shows a rolling feed of new Generic Top-Level Domain Names (gTLDs) that have been applied for during a press conference hosted by ICANN in central London, on June 13, 2012. The U.S. intention to relinquish control of ICANN opens the door for China to gain greater control over the internet. (Andrew Cowie/AFP/GettyImages) The phrase “secure and controllable” was included in the Chinese regime’s sweeping National Security Law, passed on July 1, 2015. The Washington-based think tank Information Technology and Innovation Foundation described the law’s requirements as being “part of a strategic effort” intended to “ultimately supplant foreign technology companies both in China and in markets around the world.” According to the BBC, the law authorizes the CCP to take “all necessary” steps to protect itself. The BBC report also noted that many foreign technology firms operating in China “fear that under the new law they will be forced to hand over sensitive information to the authorities.” For instance, China has repeatedly tried to force foreign tech companies to hand over the source code for their software—in 2015, Apple said no, but IBM said yes—and has also demanded foreign tech companies’ encryption keys. The technology news website TechDirt speculated the CCP could use this law to renew its attempts to require foreign companies to install back doors in their technology products. If companies give in to these demands, they compromise their own and their users’ security in and outside of China. Failure to give in to these demands may bar companies from the Chinese market. Influence Through the United Nations The United Nations branch responsible for telecommunications issues, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) technically only governs radio communications, but at a meeting in 2012 many nations agreed to ITU assuming a role in governing the Internet. Meanwhile, China has been working hard to assume control of the ITU. The ITU gained international attention in 2012, when it held the closed-door World Conference on International Telecommunications in Dubai to rewrite rules that govern the global internet. Related Coverage CHINA SECURITY: Twitter’s First China Director Signals Censorship and State Control EXCLUSIVE: Global Banking System Infiltrated by Chinese State Hackers Despite the closed-door policy, many documents from the meetings were leaked online, and the contents of these documents drew heavy criticism from tech-focused groups and news outlets. One law the ITU passed “could give governments and companies the ability to sift through all of an internet user’s traffic—including emails, banking transactions, and voice calls—without adequate privacy safeguards,” according to the Center for Democracy and Technology, which exposed the ITU program known as Y.2770. The United States walked out of the 2012 meeting, and other countries—including the United Kingdom, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Australia, and others—refused to sign its controversial treaty. Yet the treaty was passed regardless, giving the ITU a level of governance over the internet it had not had before. Nations that refused to sign the treaty are not included in it. Instead, they retain agreements under the 1988 ITU treaty, which did not include any elements on ITU governing the internet. Nonetheless, the ITU declared the new treaty a success, as its remaining members did recognize its new role. It released a statement on Dec. 14, 2012, saying “delegates from around the world have agreed [to] a new global treaty that will help pave the way to a hyper-connected world.” In October 2014, the ITU elected China’s Houlin Zhao as its secretary-general. Zhao had stated previously that censorship is subjective. According to The New American in October 2014, when Zhao was asked about “the Communist Chinese dictatorship’s massive censorship regime targeting dissent, dissidents, and ideas it disagrees with,” he replied, “Some kind of censorship may not be strange to other countries.” A Contentious Move Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has spearheaded a push to prevent the handover of ICANN, and many U.S. government officials, organizations, and experts have sounded an alarm over concerns that a foreign authoritarian power may attempt to do precisely what the Chinese regime has already set into motion. During a Senate subcommittee hearing on Sept. 14 on the issue, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said, according to a prepared statement, that many important questions on the transition remain unanswered. These include whether it will “yield an unconstitutional transfer of United States government property, how the transfer will affect human rights and free speech issues, if U.S.-controlled top-level domains such as .gov and .mil could be compromised.” “If this internet giveaway goes forward, there’s no reason to believe that authoritarian states would stop trying to exert greater control and we don’t know how things will play out long term,” Grassley said. Related Coverage The Silent War Against America’s Image On June 8, Cruz and Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) introduced the Protecting Internet Freedom Act, which seeks to prevent the U.S. handover of ICANN, and to ensure the United States retains sole ownership of .gov and .mil top-level domains. Similar concerns were shared by Philip Zimmermann, creator of the PGP encryption standard and chief scientist and co-founder of Silent Circle, a company specializing in secure communications. Zimmerman said he believes the United States needs to maintain some authority over the internet, lest “we give in to control by an international body that can be easily influenced by member states that are oppressive societies.” “The internet is supposed to make the weak have a voice, you know. If China controls their own domains within their country, it’s going to be easy to suppress opposition,” he said. According to Barney Warf, a geography professor at the University of Kansas who has published research on global internet freedom and governance, China has a “brutal, fascist, oppressive regime that has gone out of its way to suppress human rights.” Warf said even the possibility that the CCP could enforce its laws over the global internet is a frightening thought. He said the United States’ informal governing of the internet did not place any firm control over it, and this allowed innovation to flourish. He said the lack of strict governance gave people room to “experiment and make mistakes,” and added, “I think the internet has thrived because there is no central power over it.” Laws for the Internet Steve Crocker, chair of ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), during an ICANN meeting in Singapore on Feb. 9, 2015. The U.S. plan to relinquish control of ICANN opens the door for China to have greater influence over the global Internet. (ROSLAN RAHMAN/AFP/Getty Images) After the U.S. relinquishes control of ICANN, it will technically retain some level of oversight, but this oversight will be bundled together with that of the 171 other members and 35 observers in the Governmental Advisory Committee. Among those members is ITU, along with “all the UN agencies with a direct interest in global Internet governance,” according to the committee’s website. The Committee advises ICANN on government concerns “related to laws and international agreements based on consensus,” according to Jonathan Zuck, president of ACT | The App Association, in a statement presented to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 14. In the event the 171 member committee does make a consensus-based recommendation to ICANN, Zuck testified that ICANN can reject it with a 60 percent majority vote of its governing board.  While the U.N.’s legal structure will for all practical purposes eliminate the U.S. ability to affect ICANN’s policy, Chinese officials have been very candid about their intentions to push CCP law onto the internet. The coming out party for this effort was the 2014 World Internet Conference, which followed upon the U.S. announcement that it would step back from internet governance. “Experts said China is using the platform to sell its own strategy and rules to the world, a mission that the world’s largest cyberpower with the most internet users has deemed significant and urgent,” the state-run China Daily reported at the time. “China has the capability now to set up international rules for cyberspace and use our strategy and our rules to influence the world,” said Shen Yi, an associate professor specializing in cybersecurity at Fudan University, according to China Daily. “China is considering setting up its own rules in cyberspace,” CCP Premier Li Keqiang said, in comments summarized by China Daily. He added the CCP wants to create a “common code of rules” for the internet. In July 2015, the CCP passed the National Security Law mentioned earlier, with its requirement that certain technologies should be “secure and controllable.” That same month, the CCP introduced the draft of its Cybersecurity Law. Reuters reported that the law requires network operators to “accept the supervision of the government and public,” and that it reiterates requirements that all personal data on Chinese citizens and “important business data” needs to be stored domestically—an element that further exposes the data to government surveillance. Reuters noted the law was controversial in the United States and Europe, since it affects foreign firms. It also noted it increased the CCP’s power to “access and block dissemination of private information records that Chinese law deems illegal,” and that this has caused concern among governments, multinational companies, and rights activists, since the CCP may be able to “interpret the law as it sees fit.” In December 2015, the CCP passed the Counterterrorism Law, which allows Chinese authorities to decrypt information to prevent “terrorism,” and to monitor systems with the excuse of preventing the spread of information that can be used for the CCP’s definitions of terrorism or “extremism.” There is a long list of similar laws and regulations. In February 2016, the CCP issued rules for online publishing. In March 2016, it drafted rules for domain name registration. It has issued state procurement lists that restrict foreign suppliers and has pending laws on encryption regulations. With its new institutions, laws, and regulations, the Chinese regime is ready through its Cyber Security Association to influence the operation of ICANN and other systems in the multistakeholder model; or it is ready to see the U.N. gain influence over ICANN through the ITU—with China at its helm. Tech companies operating in China are now required to turn over proprietary technology, endangering their businesses and destroying their customers’ expectation of confidentiality. Meanwhile, through the Technical Committee 260, major tech companies are lobbying for the world to adopt the Chinese regime’s internet law and regulations. And the China-led ITU wants to grant nations the right to search all internet traffic. Thus, China is seeking to make good on Liu Yuxiao’s promise that China will “realize its responsibilities” in the absence of U.S. control.

By Danny Palmer | September 14, 2016 -- 07:55 GMT (00:55 PDT) | Topic: Security Hospitals: an easy target for some hackers, a no-go for others. Image: iStock Ransomware attacks against hospitals represent a growing threat which is becoming increasingly lucrative for some cybercriminals -- even while other hackers are openly condemning extortion attempts against healthcare providers. A combination of hospitals' reliance on equipment powered by older operating systems and their often very urgent need to access medical data means that some hackers have looked at the institutions as a potentially rich target. One of the nastiest types of ransomware has just come back to life How Bitcoin helped fuel an explosion in ransomware attacks How Bitcoin helped fuel an explosion in ransomware attacks Ransomware-as-a-service allows wannabe hackers to cash-in on cyber extortion Now ransomware is taking aim at business networks That was demonstrated when a Los Angeles hospital paid a $17,000 Bitcoin ransom after a Locky infection took down its network. But that wasn't a one-off attack: there's been a surge in ransomware-based cyberattacks against hospital networks across the globe, but particularly in the US. Cybersecurity researchers from Intel Security analysed ransomware code from attacks against hospitals made during the first quarter of the year and discovered numerous Bitcoin wallets used to transfer ransom payments -- Bitcoin having become the preferred currency of the cybercriminal -- which showed that the hackers behind these hospitals attacks had amassed $100,000 from ransoms alone. Researchers have described the ransomware attack methods used by such attackers as "effective but not very sophisticated". While they don't specify which variants of ransomware are being used, the description could point to the culprits using something like Cerber, which has been seen being made available as a ransomware-as-a-service scheme for use by even the most technically-illiterate wannabe cybercriminal. Researchers also suggest the hospital attacks weren't carried out by the sort of "malicious actors we normally face in ransomware attacks or breaches". Indeed, they found evidence that suggests that cyberattacks against hospitals are being carried out by those viewed as renegades even within the cybercriminal fraternity, judged negatively for their decision to carry out attacks against those which provision healthcare. In the Russian underground in particular, there's an 'ethical' code of conduct which places hospitals off-limits -- even in countries usually targeted by Russian-speaking hackers. In one forum, criminals discussed the ethics of attacking hospitals at length: "Yes, this is pretty sad and a new low. These ransom attacks are bad enough, but if someone were to die or be injured because of this it is just plain wrong," one user said, while another labelled hospital attackers as "dumbest hackers ever". While hospitals currently only account for a small percentage of ransomware victims, it's feared that as ransomware becomes an increasingly appealing method of attack for hackers, more and more of them will attack the healthcare sector. "With cybersecurity threats including ransomware rising at such a rapid rate, organisations are having to come to terms with the fact that it's fast becoming a question of 'when', not 'if', they suffer a breach," says Raj Samani, CTO at EMEA Intel Security. "It's crucial that the likes of healthcare pick up the pace with cybersecurity. Vulnerabilities in these sectors provide hackers with access to extremely personal, valuable and often irreplaceable data and IP." Despite a few high profile cases, Intel Security researchers found that, in most instances, hospitals that became victims of ransomware didn't pay hackers a ransom. In these cases, it's likely that organisations found another way to decrypt the files -- or they simply deemed the encrypted files to not be important enough to pay to get back. Cybersecurity researchers and the authorities have both warned about the increasing threat of ransomware to corporate and public sector networks.

If that’s the case, then this latest Android-x86 release might just be the right fit for you. Now at version 6.0-r1, this is the first stable release of Android-x86 based on Android Marshmallow. And while it may not have yet the multi-tasking features of 7.0 Nougat, it does pave the way for that brighter future for Android on PCs. Although it may not be the only one, the Android-x86 project is perhaps the most successful and longest-running community port of Android for x86 and x86_64 computers, particularly those running on Intel’s chips. It is so popular that Jide, makers of the Android Remix devices and OS, grabbed Android-x86 founder Chih-Wei Huang for its own team, basing the new Remix OS for PCs on this body of code. Curiously, this Android x86 6.0 release comes almost two months after Jide released a new Marshmallow version of Remix OS for PCs. Still, not everyone might have been so enamored by Remix OS and some might opt for a leaner platform to build their own customizations on. For these people, Android-x86 is the perfect thing. Aside from upgrading to Marshmallow, Android-x86 6.0-r1 also brings in some new features and fixes. For the security-conscious, it includes all recent AOSP security fixes and patches. For the stability-conscious, it uses Linux kernel version 4.4.20 from the kernel’s “Long-Term Support” (LTS) tree. Android-x86 also now provides a normal looking mouse cursor, instead of a simple circle, taken from Android Nougat. Installing Android-x86, however, might not be for the faint of heart. Although it practically uses the same tools as Remix OS for PC, it doesn’t package them into a single downloadable bundle. For those who do wish to dive in, Android-x86 now supports both 32-bit and 64-bit processors and both legacy BIOS and UEFI firmwares.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Titan JUXT Pro Review Titan just outed their first all touchscreen smartwatch that follows up on the JUXT. The new smartwatch is called the JUXT Pro and aims to provide a premium experience to customers. Let’s take a look at what it offers. Unboxing The Titan JUXT Pro comes in a really neat wooden box that feels premium and reminds you of a premium analogue watch. You can watch the unboxing video below: Here are the contents of the box: Titan JUXT Pro smartwatch in Black Case with leather strap Charging cradle Micro USB cable User manual and warranty information Design, Materials and Build Quality The Titan JUXT Pro succeeds the JUXT but unlike its predecessor, it features a completely digital interface. However, you would be glad to note that Titan hasn’t compromised on the aesthetics or build quality like most other smartwatches seem to do these days. The JUXT Pro is made out of a stainless steel casing that is robust and features an IP67 rating that protects it from water and dust. The only plastic part on the entire casing is the bezel ring that surrounds the display but even that could pass as being metal to the untrained eye. The build quality is top notch thanks to the 316L stainless steel that has been used in construction and the watch feels like it can easily handle a drop or two but we don’t recommend that you try it though. The case features two buttons on the right side, one for the power button and another for the Titan Safety feature just below it. The casing is available in two different colour variants, one with a full black casing and the other in a combination of black and silver. Both of them come with a leather strap but the straps are interchangeable and just about any 22mm watch strap will fit into the casing. The watch is water resistant upto 3 ATM (30 metres) and it is quite a bit bigger (48mm casing) as well as heavier than most other smartwatches on the market. Although the size of the watch implicates that it would be something worn by men, Titan say that it could just as well be worn by women too. The primary need to have a larger design was to integrate more components inside the body including a larger battery without having to compromise. Hence the design could be said as something that was inspired by functionality as much as it was supposed to invoke a premium analogue watch design. Display The display on the JUXT Pro is a fully circular 1.3″ IPS display that comes with a resolution of 360×360 pixels (278 ppi) which offers good brightness as well as viewing angles. The brightness is good enough for both indoor and outdoor visibility. The display glass is Corning Gorilla Glass 3 which means its quite resistant to scratches and while it is no Sapphire Crystal, it still hasn’t gotten scratched on our unit even with regular use. Touch response is good as well. The display can be chosen to stay on all the time or a bring to see mode where you rotate your wrist in such a way that the screen is visible and the screen lights up. This also brings up an important feature of the JUXT pro called privilege reveal. Even if you get a notification, the screen of the smartphone won’t light up right away. You will get a vibration but you will be able to see the notification only when you use the bring to see function. You could also turn off the bring to see mode and only have the watch display light up when you press the home button but I personally quite like the bring to see function as it is quite practical and doesn’t really come at the expense of battery life. There are 20 pre-loaded watch faces to choose from and you can customize more online to your liking. Comfort I personally love big watches and the Titan JUXT Pro probably has the perfect size for my big hands too. At 48mm, the casing is larger than most smartwatches and even most analogue watches. But the whole point of the JUXT Pro was to be something that stands out and looks great. It certainly does achieve that. While the watch is quite a bit heavy when you hold it, it doesn’t actually feel all that big or heavy while wearing it. It doesn’t really give you any wrist fatigue too and despite having worn it through several hectic days during IFA 2016, it didn’t really irritate me. Coming to the strap, I am not really a big fan of leather straps and if I got the JUXT Pro personally, I would immediately change the strap for a silicon or rubber one. But with that said, the leather strap is of good quality and despite an initial rigidness, it becomes easy to wear after a few uses. A metal strap would also look good but I feel it would become too bulky and heavy if you do so. But that is your personal choice and the 22mm strap size means you can easily change the strap at a Titan store or anywhere else you want to. Storage and Performance The JUXT Pro comes with 4GB of internal storage but the OS itself takes around 2GB of space. Users can store their favourite music and play them from the smartwatch instead of having to rely on your smartphone itself. Additionally, you can use your JUXT Pro as a mass storage device to store and carry files that you want. In a way, its also a secure way to store important documents on travel for example your passport scans and more.  So in the unlikely event that you lose your phone or computer, you can still access the files from your smartwatch. However, the only downside is the fact that you need the dock to access the files. The 512MB of RAM along with the Dual Core Intel processor clocked in at 1 GHz made sure that performance was smooth at all times and we didn’t encounter any instances of the watch heating up even with step tracking and notifications turned on. Software The JUXT Pro does not run on Android Wear. Instead, it runs on Titan’s proprietary OS and is compatible with Android devices running version 4.4 and higher as well as iOS devices running version 8 or higher. It connects to your smartphone using Bluetooth 4.0 but it doesn’t have WiFi. There is a Titan JUXT Pro app that allows you to feed in your profile as well as customise and manage your watch settings. There is also a Titan Safety app that can be used to assign your emergency contacts. You can use Titan Safety to alert your loved ones of your location with the touch of the dedicated safety button. You could also set a panic alarm which will notify your selected contacts of your status and there is even a shadow me feature that will give regular updates about your location to your loved ones. Lastly, there is a priority call option where you can add chosen individuals to the list and you will be notified (even in silent or do not disturb mode) when any of them calls you but not disturbed when anyone else does. There is even a chat feature where you can talk to a particular group of contacts, be it your friend or family and send them photos and voice notes too. Apps and Notifications The JUXT Pro offers notifications for all apps and not just a few preset applications. This is quite good since the apps that each user uses varies a lot and it isn’t necessary that everyone uses the same messaging client for example. So if you have support for one but not the other, it is bound to agitate a few users at least. Luckily, all apps are supported and users can also choose which of them to exclude from the notification list and which should not be allowed to give a vibration feedback. I personally have disabled vibration and notification for apps like Whatsapp considering the vast majority of messages that come everyday. Have allowed important notifications such as calls, emails and messages though. You can also respond to notifications from a set of preset messages that can also be customised to your needs. Users can choose to mute calls and notifications on their phone when it is connected to the watch in order to have a more subtle way of getting notified. The watch also comes with a timer, a stopwatch, a weather app, a calendar app and a converter. Mind you, it is a unit converter and not a real time currency converter. There is a built-in phone finder tool that allows the user to make his/her phone vibrate or ring when the watch is connected to it. The good thing is that it allows you to even ring the phone when the phone is on silent. Note that on iOS devices, the ringing functionality won’t work if you have muted the phone with the physical switch. However, if you have muted it with the volume keys then it will work. Lastly, there is a camera app that allows you to remotely control the cameras on your smartphone be it at the front or back. You can choose the flash setting and take a shot by pressing the shutter button on the smartphone. The watch gives you a 3 second timer so that you have time to pose before the shot is captured. The only downside to this is that it launches its own camera app instead of the stock one and that limits the ability to adjust settings such as HDR, shutter speed etc before taking the shot. If Titan add that functionality too, it would become a really useful tool. Note that the phone needs to be unlocked when you want to use the camera app on the watch but you can launch the camera by hitting the camera app on the watch without needing to open the camera app separately on the phone. You can also use your JUXT Pro to control the music on your smartphone or play ones from the watch itself. To start playing music on your smartphone, you need to launch the app with the phone unlocked. After that, you can control the music even when the phone is locked. You have track play/pause, seek/transport as well as volume controls. Fitness Tracker The JUXT Pro has a built in Fitness Tracker that allows you to record the number of steps you take as well as the distance covered and calories burnt. It’s pretty neat and you get a statistical chart of how your day has stacked up compared to the previous day, week or month. You can set a profile where you specify your sex (this is another indication that Titan have also made room just in case women want to wear the watch), height, weight and also a step target. It can also notify you of your progress on a regular programmed basis. The sad part is that it isn’t really acccurate. We had the tracker count steps even as we were sitting in the car without too bumpy a road. So while it can be used as a rough scale of your physical activities, it isn’t probably your best bet for proper training. Battery Life The battery life is one of the aspects for concern in most smartwatches since manufacturers prefer to put in tiny batteries in order to go for a slimmer and sleeker design. Titan refused to do that and have bundled a massive 450mAh battery (Massive in smartwatch standards at least) into the watch body. Titan had promised a battery life of 36 hours when using the smartwatch with notification and the bring to see feature. In real life, we found this claim to be more or less true. While most smartwaches would’ve definitely died after a day of use if not before, the JUXT Pro kept pushing and I was able to muster around 38 hours of use with step tracking, notifications etc which is quite impressive. It also has an impressive standby time of around 7 days. The battery life does drop significantly when you leave the display on always but then again that is the case with every smartwatch and it would be sort of pointless and moreover distracting to leave it on always. Charging requires you to place the smartwatch into the dock since it is waterproof. There are 3 pins which need to be aligned with the ones on the dock. Once you do that, you can plug in just about any microUSB cable in order to charge the watch. Conclusion The Titan JUXT Pro is certainly one of the better smartwatches on the market. While it is smart and offers a lot of functionality, it emphasises more on being a watch rather than smart. It is one of the most premium smartwatches that we have tried in terms of design but functionality wise, I don’t think I can say the same. Sure, the Titan Safety feature is something unique but rest of the features don’t really stand out. If you are getting a smartwatch primarily for its fitness tracking abilities then you are better looking elsewhere since it isn’t very accurate. But if you want one to make a style statement while also being able to enjoy the occasional notification and perks of owning a smartwatch, then this is worth the buy at Rs 22,995.

Nearly every major tech company, car company and ride services company, it seems, is developing or partnering with developers of self-driving technology, from Google parent Alphabet to Tesla Motors, General Motors and Uber Technologies, creating an insatiable demand for the people teaching the machines to think. In about a year's time, a Lincoln sedan will be driving itself from Mountain View to San Francisco, using software developed by 250 or so students enrolled at education startup Udacity, if all goes according to plan. Udacity bought the Lincoln already equipped with the digital interface needed in autonomous vehicles; students will write the code. Udacity's course, which costs $2,400 for three, 12-week terms, starts next month and was designed by company co-founder Sebastian Thrun, who launched Google's driverless car program. World's first self-driving taxis debut in Singapore The world's first self-driving taxis will be picking up passengers in Singapore starting Thursday. Select members of the public will be able to hail a free ride through their smartphones in taxis operated by nuTonomy, an autonomous vehicle software startup. Self-driving truck startup Otto, recently acquired by Uber Technologies, automaker Mercedes-Benz and chip maker Nvidia contributed to Udacity's curriculum. "If you go through this curriculum you are on the bleeding edge of self-driving cars," said Thrun. Fast-track to jobs? The aim of the program is a faster path to employment, Thrun said, in a career that has an average salary of $138,000. Mercedes-Benz, Chinese ride-service Didi Chuxing and others agreed to consider Udacity graduates for job openings. The employer pool is growing quickly. Research firm and venture capital database CB Insights has identified 33 corporations working on autonomous cars, including auto makers GM and Volvo, internet giants Baidu and Google, and Silicon Valley companies tech firm Intel and startup ride-service Lyft. GM for one is hiring dozens of engineers in the area, and Uber is looking to fill more than 50 positions in Pittsburgh, where the company is building a fleet of self-driving cars, according to jobs website Glassdoor. "I love people with MIT and Stanford degrees," Thrun said. But "there are a lot of people who can't make it to those institutions. There are entire generations of people who are equally smart and equally capable." Yet the idea that a certificate from an online training program would secure a job in one of the most difficult emerging technologies strikes some recruiters as very unlikely. A master's degree in computer science from a leading university such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology or Stanford University is the usual, and still preferred, course. "You'd be hard-pressed to say the Udacity candidate is going to be more qualified because they have some specific knowledge about self-driving cars, versus someone who has a rock-hard degree in computer science or data science," said Dave Carvajal, chief executive of recruiting firm Dave Partners, which fills executive jobs at venture-backed tech companies. Hungry for talent With a scarcity of talent in the workforce, companies have been recruiting directly from universities with strong programs in data science, robotics and machine learning. Carnegie Mellon University suffered an exodus of staff last year after Uber hired away 40 faculty and researchers for its Advanced Technologies Center. Ford, Baidu invest $150 million in self-driving technology company Ford Motor and Baidu, the Chinese search engine giant, have jointly invested $150 million in Velodyne, which makes a key component in self-driving cars as Ford ramps up development in the autonomous field. Startups, too, are sparring to build autonomous vehicle staff. Varden Labs, a company of fewer than 15 people working on self-driving car technology, is "hiring aggressively" although the field is "very competitive," said co-founder Alex Rodrigues. Technology companies frequently bemoan their struggle to hire qualified engineers, but the challenge is more pronounced in autonomous vehicles, which combines complex technologies such as machine learning and computer vision, and applies them to cars. Startups in particular are struggling to hire against powerhouses such as Apple and Google, say recruiters. "The startups will have to get by with one, two, three or four people who can do it," said Dan Portillo, talent partner at venture firm Greylock Partners. But a small team may be enough for startup success. GM in March purchased Cruise Automation, a three-year-old autonomous vehicle startup with about 40 employees, for about $1 billion. Uber last month agreed to buy Otto, which is less than a year old, in a deal valued at $680 million. "Early hires are making unbelievable amounts of money in a few short years," Rodrigues said.

For example, in our case scientists from Darmstadt University in Germany and Intel Labs have decided that aimlessly stealing cars and running over people for no apparent reason in Grand Theft Auto needs to serve a higher purpose. This is because they came up with a neat way of getting data from GTA and using it to teach autonomous cars to better operate on real roads. The researchers argue that data from modern computer games can be “almost as good, or sometimes even better” than real data, while using it is also infinitely cheaper than gathering real-world visual data. The developers cooked a new software which classifies different objects on the roads in the game. So far 25,000 frames from the computer game have been extracted, with various weather conditions and at different moments of the day. Annotating them only took 49 hours in total – the process would have lasted days with real-world data. The data is then used to have the vehicles learn the difference between humans and other objects throughout the environment, which in turn makes autonomous cars smarter and safer.   Related Tweet Share Share 2017 Volkswagen e-Golf packs more power and better range November 18, 2016 The 2017 Rezvani Beast Alpha has arrived November 17, 2016 LA Auto Show: Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio November 16, 2016 LA Auto Show: Mercedes-Maybach S650 Cabriolet November 16, 2016 LA Auto Show: 2017 Lamborghini Huracan LP 580-2 Spyder November 16, 2016 Recent Posts Mercedes delivers the British Queen’s Christmas tree Toyota envisions heavy duty fuel cell use for commercial trucks Subaru Viziv-7 Concept paves way for large SUV in Los Angeles Toyota kickstarts battery electric development with new venture company We want to live like this – oldest Mustang GT driver is 97 Most Popular Now List of World record highways 10 Busiest Junctions in the world McLaren denies Dennis to challenge new FIA rule McLaren denies Dennis to challenge new FIA rule Jackie Stewart tells Mercedes to quit F1 Jackie Stewart tells Mercedes to quit F1 Hamilton-to-Ferrari rumours fire in Bahrain Ferrari re-opens door to working with Red Bull Bottas signs deal to replace Raikkonen – report 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show LIVE: 2016 Skoda Superb Combi… Latest Galeries Receive Our Newsletter Subscribe to RSS Follow us on Social Media News All the news ordered by time Industry Technology Tuners Videos Safety Car Crashes Concepts Spy Photos IN DEPTH Motor Shows Motor Sport Test Drive Editors Choice Automakers Acura Alfa Romeo Aston Martin Audi Bentley BMW Bugatti Buick Cadillac Caterharm Chevrolet Chrysler Citroen Dacia Dodge Ferrari Fiat Fisker Ford GMC Holden Honda Hummer Hyundai Infiniti Jaguar Jeep Kia Koenigsegg Lamborghini Lancia Land Rover Lexus Lotus Lincoln McLaren Maserati Mazda Mayback Mercede-Benz Mini Mitshubishi Nissan Pagani Peugeot Porsche Opel RAM Renault Rolls Royce Saab Saturn Scion Seat Skoda Spyker Subaru Suzuki Tata Tesla Vauxhall Volkswagen Toyota Volvo Others Copyright © 2016 — INAUTONEWS.

No More Ransom is an alliance of cops and anti-malware experts including McAfee and soon-to-be-former parent company Intel, Kaspersky Labs, Europol's EC3 cybercrime division, and Dutch police. The group has uploaded thousands of decryption keys and tools to help users avoid paying ransom to net scum who use malware to encrypt precious files demanding cash to revert the damage. The alliance formalises what had been a scattered and silo-ed, but furious effort by legendary malware researchers to lay waste to scores of ransomware variants, leaving a scant few including the latest Cryptxxx and Cryptowall unbroken. Security researcher Utku Sen went as far as to upload a deliberately-weakened ransomware blueprint to Github under the guise of a proof-of-concept in a successful bid to demoralise ransomware scum who built on his work. Jornt v.d. Wiel, a researcher with Kaspersky's elite GReAT threat team, announced the figures and revealed that as of yesterday 822 Coinvault and 941 Shade ransomware victims have been liberated. A further 700 ransomware victims have been assisted, bringing the total to 2463. The initiative is certain to have saved victims thousands of dollars, the pain of restoring data and formatting drives (or figuring out to get one's hands on a Bitcoin). Researchers recently scalped the Wildfire ransomware uploading more than 1600 decryption keys to the initative. Victims who cannot decrypt their ransomware infections should also try Trend Micro's continually updated decryption tool which recently added the advanced Ceber ransomware to the list of malware it can neuter. Criminals can net a conservative US$84,000 a month slinging ransomware for an investment of $6000, a whopping 1425 per cent profit margin, Trustwave found last year. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 2 Comments More from The Register NHS trusts ‘complacent’ on cloud app security risks Do we block unsanctioned ones?

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton Microsoft Corp unveiled on Tuesday its first laptop, a line of Lumia smartphones, a new Surface Pro tablet and an updated version of its wearable fitness tracker, Microsoft Band, all running on Windows 10, its latest operating system. Microsoft is counting on Windows 10, launched in July, to help it win a bigger share of the market for tablets and smartphones, now dominated by Apple Inc and South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. Microsoft said its laptop, the Surface Book, will start at $1,499 and is twice as fast as Apple’s MacBook Pro. It will be available from Oct. 26, with preorders starting on Wednesday. The laptop has a 13.5-inch display with 267 pixels per inch and features a track pad made of glass. Microsoft, whose shares were up 0.6 percent at $46.89 at midday, said 110 million devices were now running Windows 10. The company unveiled three phones at an event in New York. The Lumia 950 and 950XL will have starting prices of $549 and $649 respectively when they go on sale in November, while the Lumia 550 will cost $139 when it becomes available in December. The Lumia 950 includes a 5.2-inch display and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor with hexacore CPUs. The Lumia 950 XL has a 5.7-inch display and a Snapdragon 810 processor with octa-core CPUs. The 550 has a 4.7-inch HD display and runs on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 210 processor. The new Surface Pro 4 tablet – a larger but thinner and lighter version of the Surface Pro 3 – is priced at $899 and will be available from Oct. 26 with pre-orders starting on Wednesday. Launched nearly a year and a half after its predecessor, the Surface Pro 4 features a 12.3-inch screen with 267 pixels per inch. It runs on 6th-generation Intel Core processor and has 16GB of RAM and 1TB storage. Surface Pro 4 is 50 percent faster than Apple’s MacBook Air, Panos Panay, the corporate vice president for Surface Computing at Microsoft, said at the event. LOVING IT “We’re moving people from needing to choosing to loving Windows, and these devices promise to fuel even more enthusiasm and opportunity for the entire Windows ecosystem,” Chief Executive Satya Nadella said at the event. Microsoft suffered its biggest-ever quarterly net loss in the three months ended June 30 after taking a $7.6 billion writedown on its Nokia handset business. The company had said from the restructuring of the business would be pumped into its new flagship operating system, its fast-growing cloud business and its hardware division, which includes Xbox gaming consoles. Microsoft also said its new tablet and smartphones will come with Windows Hello, an automatic biometric sign-in option introduced earlier this year. The feature allows users to scan their face, iris or fingerprints to verify their identity and give them access to Windows phones, laptops and personal computers. Microsoft also introduced a Surface Pen, which has year-long battery life, 1,024 pressure points and comes in five colors with inter-changeable pen tips. The 950 and 950XL handsets feature a 20-megapixel rear camera, have up to 32GB of storage, 4K video and use liquid cooling technology. Microsoft said storage on the phones could be extended to up to 2 terabytes using a memory card. The Microsoft Band 2, which allows users to monitor their fitness and exercise regime, will be priced at $249 when it becomes available on Oct. 30. Unlike its predecessor, Microsoft’s entry product in the wearable technology market a year ago, the new Band has a curved display, which uses the Corning Gorilla glass 3, and has a barometer sensor to track elevation. “The event was solid and showed Microsoft has stepped up its game on the consumer device front. Now the question is will consumers buy the products,” said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, who attended the event. “…It is clear from presentations as well as speaking with the Microsoft team that Redmond feels that Windows 10 will help finally vault Microsoft into relevance on the smartphone landscape,” Ives said. “That said, this is going to be a long road for Nadella as Microsoft plays major catchup on this key market.” Microsoft said it was taking applications for a development kit for HoloLens, the holographic lens device that allows users to see 3D renderings of computer-generated images. The kit will be available in the first quarter of 2016 for $3,000. HoloLens, which looks like a wireless visor, gives Microsoft a stake in the emerging market for virtual and augmented reality, which is also being targeted by Facebook Inc’s Oculus. Microsoft’s shares have risen less than 1 percent since the start of the year. – Reuters Related Posts VimpelCom announces $40mln sale of Telecel stake to Zimbabwe govt HARARE,– Amsterdam-headquartered telecoms giant VimpelCom on Wednesday announced that it had agreed to sell its controlling stake in Telecel Zimbabwe to the government of Zimbabwe for $40 million.

Facebook Google Investing Analyst Upgrades Bankruptcy Buffett Corporate Governance Corporate Performance Dividends and Buybacks Earnings ETFs and Mutual Funds International Markets IPOs and Secondaries Mergers and Acquisitions Personal Finance Rumors Value Investing Economy Energy Government Regulation Healthcare Housing Jobs Special Report Brands and Products Cities Countries States Despite Volatility, Symantec Gets More Positive Analyst Views By Jon C. Ogg September 13, 2016 3:33 pm EST Print Email Tweet Is it possible that this is time that Symantec Corporation (NASDAQ: SYMC) is finally going to rocket higher? Symantec is now back to being security focused and the Blue Coat acquisition is going to make that even more of the case. The difference here is that it opens up more data security efforts for Symantec. After an analyst upgraded Symantec on Tuesday (9/13), we wanted to take a look at other analyst calls of late. It turns out that the bias has been leaning higher. Tuesday’s call was from Wunderlich, with the firm raising its rating to Buy from Hold. It also set a price target all the way up at $30.00 on Symantec — which is $1.00 higher than the prior street high target price. Before getting into individual analyst calls made of late, the Thomson Reuters consensus price target should say it all. The current consensus analyst target (mean) is $24.31. That consensus price target was $23.28 a month ago, $20.77 two months ago, and it was all the way down at $19.47 just three months ago. BTIG recently kept a Buy rating and $28.00 price target. The firm’s weekend software summary said: We continue to believe that $2.00 EPS by Fiscal Year 2019 is achievable, and think that Symantec’s stock should continue to re-rate as investors get more comfortable with the extent and impact of the combined $550 million in cost savings. BTIG expects linearity in Blue Coat integration costs, but they still expect more than 600 basis points of margin expansion from Fiscal Year 2016 to Fiscal Year 2018. That will come from targeting efficiencies in procurement, back office operations and real estate. BTIG even sees numerous scenarios boosting revenues for the new Symantec. Barclays, back on September 7, said that a McAfee sale with Intel and TPG combined might create a more focused competitor (MacAfee and Norton dominate PC markets). They had a mere Equal Weight rating with a $24.00 price target. Barclays said: We think spinning McAfee out as an independent company could create a more focused competitor to Symantec. Recall, Intel acquired McAfee in 2010 and part of the vision was to bring security down closer to the chip level. The market did not evolve towards that, and at the same time the broader endpoint market started to see more competition from freemium vendors. By spinning out, McAfee might be able to sharpen its focus in security, allowing it to attract more talent and potentially become a more focused security competitor to Symantec. It was also just on September 6 that 24/7 Wall St. pointed out the chart being so strong that chart watchers and investors might be ignoring the underlying fundamental valuations based upon hopes ahead. Even back in August, Citigroup raised Symantec’s rating to Buy from Neutral, and its price target was $26.50 (versus a prior close of $23.11 at that time).  Also in August, Symantec was started with a Buy rating and was given a $26 price target (versus a prior $22.54 close) at Goldman Sachs. One report that was not positive came from Standard & Poor’s on September 10. It kept a “Sell” rating and they have a mere price target of $20.00. Their ‘risk assessment’ said: Our risk assessment for Symantec reflects uncertain demand for the company’s products, the highly competitive market in which it operates and execution risks. This is balanced by the company’s solid market position and the growing number of cyber security threats. So far the analysts keep pointing higher on Symantec, at least for the most part. The shares have pulled back during the latest market sell-off, down almost 1% at $24.62 on Tuesday. Symantec’s 52-week trading range is $16.14 to $25.19. By Jon C.

LLVM Clang 3.9 Mostly Trails GCC In Compiler Performance Written by Michael Larabel in Software on 13 September 2016. Page 1 of 5. 26 Comments Following yesterday's GCC 5 vs. 6 vs. early 7 benchmarks, to no surprise LLVM's Clang compiler was brought up in the comments. I had already been running some fresh LLVM Clang benchmarks on this same Intel Xeon system and have those results to share now with Clang 3.8 and the newly-released Clang 3.9. This is the first time in a number of months I've carried out a large comparison of GCC vs. Clang using the latest compiler releases. For today's article are the GCC 5.4.0, GCC 6.2.0, and GCC 7.0.0 20160904 compiler benchmarks compared to LLVM Clang 3.8.0 and the new Clang 3.9.0 release. Interestingly, these benchmarks show a number of performance regressions in the generated binaries under Clang 3.9. With all of the compiler benchmarks, the CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS were maintained the same at "-O3 -march=native" and all other system settings were maintained the same throughout the benchmarking process. All tests for this article were carried out in a completely automated and standardized manner via the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software.

"Cyberspace and the relationship that Russia has with the rest of the world: These are areas where we have had equilibriums in the past, but that equilibrium eludes us right now," Lettre told a public meeting at the Atlantic Council. Lettre admitted that US policymakers were now unsure whether the traditional forms of deterrence that the United States and its NATO allies use would continue to deter Russia. "What are the norms of deterrence?… These are areas in flux… These are important strategic questions to get right for US strategic security," he said. Lettre also noted that the United States and its allies faced the challenge of "hybrid warfare," together with challenges to the credibility of the US government and allied accounts as well as official narratives on international affairs from other states, including Russia. He also said that US intelligence services are still suffering significant problems in recruiting enough experts with detailed knowledge of and language capabilities for key parts of the world. "[There is] a real deficit in the deep regional expertize and language skills on hand," letter told an open meeting at the Atlantic Council. "On linguistic capabilities… we always seem to be deficient." Lettre also warned that US technical advantages in war and intelligence were fragile and could be eroded in the coming years. "We have valued tremendously our geospatial and signals intelligence collection those have been very valuable… However we are at risk of those capabilities degrading over time," he stated. Lettre, however, added that cooperation between the 17 main US intelligence agencies and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had greatly improved in the 15 years since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. He noted the agencies were now working seamlessly together.   ...

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Notebooks Tim Cook Responds to Email Saying He Is Committed to the Mac – We Should Stay Tuned By Omar Sohail Posted 2 months ago 30Shares Share Tweet Submit The fact that Tim Cook didn’t announce any product related to the Mac lineup would give consumers second thoughts of the company’s commitment towards its desktop and notebook lineup. However, the CEO has ensured that he and the company has not given up on the lineup. Tim Cook States to Stay Tuned for the Arrival of the New Mac Series We understand that the iPhone is the bread and butter of the company’s revenue stream, but that still does not allow the tech giant to not give us a proper explanation as to why Tim Cook didn’t make any announcement related to new Mac products. According to a responded email, Cook states that we should stay tuned for new products, which means that the refreshed lineup could appear later this year. However, with less than 4 months remaining, Apple is definitely running out of time. Intel has already announced its Kaby Lake series of processors, and the latest report suggests that the upcoming iMac and MacBook is not going to be powered by the aforementioned processors. Instead, they will be running Skylake processors, which are not bad any means, but if the company is going to be charging a fortune for these products, then they should at least incorporate them with the latest hardware. It is said that the upcoming Mac family is going to feature AMD GPUs based on the company’s Polaris architecture, but it hasn’t been specified which chips are going to present inside the different categories of machines. What we do know is that Type-C USB ports are going to be an addition, and Apple’s upcoming MacBook is also said to feature OLED display strip to replace the function keys that you find on regular notebooks. Advertisement Unfortunately, there is no official release date of these notebooks, so we will have to continue waiting patiently till such an update is delivered to us.

Nearly every major tech company, car company and ride services company, it seems, is developing or partnering with developers of self-driving technology, from Google parent Alphabet Inc to Tesla Motors, General Motors Corp and Uber Technologies Inc, creating an insatiable demand for the people teaching the machines to think. In about a year's time, a Lincoln sedan will be driving itself from Mountain View to San Francisco, using software developed by 250 or so students enrolled at education start-up Udacity, if all goes according to plan. Udacity bought the Lincoln already equipped with the digital interface needed in autonomous vehicles; students will write the code. Udacity's course, which costs $2,400 for three, 12-week terms, starts next month and was designed by company co-founder Sebastian Thrun, who launched Google's driverless car program. Self-driving truck startup Otto, recently acquired by Uber Technologies Inc, automaker Mercedes-Benz and chip maker Nvidia Corp contributed to Udacity's curriculum. "If you go through this curriculum you are on the bleeding edge of self-driving cars," said Thrun. FAST-TRACK TO JOBS? The aim of the program is a faster path to employment, Thrun said, in a career that has an average salary of $138,000. Mercedes-Benz, Chinese ride-service Didi Chuxing and others agreed to consider Udacity graduates for job openings. The employer pool is growing quickly. Research firm and venture capital database CB Insights has identified 33 corporations working on autonomous cars, including auto makers GM and Volvo, internet giants Baidu and Google, and Silicon Valley companies tech firm Intel and startup ride-service Lyft. GM for one is hiring dozens of engineers in the area, and Uber is looking to fill more than 50 positions in Pittsburgh, where the company is building a fleet of self-driving cars, according to jobs website Glassdoor. "I love people with MIT and Stanford degrees," Thrun said. But "there are a lot of people who can't make it to those institutions. There are entire generations of people who are equally smart and equally capable." Yet the idea that a certificate from an online training program would secure a job in one of the most difficult emerging technologies strikes some recruiters as very unlikely. A master's degree in computer science from a leading university such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology or Stanford University is the usual, and still preferred, course. "You'd be hard-pressed to say the Udacity candidate is going to be more qualified because they have some specific knowledge about self-driving cars, versus someone who has a rock-hard degree in computer science or data science," said Dave Carvajal, chief executive of recruiting firm Dave Partners, which fills executive jobs at venture-backed tech companies. HUNGRY FOR TALENT With a scarcity of talent in the workforce, companies have been recruiting directly from universities with strong programs in data science, robotics and machine learning. Carnegie Mellon University suffered an exodus of staff last year after Uber hired away 40 faculty and researchers for its Advanced Technologies Center. Startups, too, are sparring to build autonomous vehicle staff. Varden Labs, a company of fewer than 15 people working on self-driving car technology, is "hiring aggressively" although the field is "very competitive," said co-founder Alex Rodrigues. Technology companies frequently bemoan their struggle to hire qualified engineers, but the challenge is more pronounced in autonomous vehicles, which combines complex technologies such as machine learning and computer vision, and applies them to cars. Startups in particular are struggling to hire against powerhouses such as Apple Inc and Google, say recruiters. "The startups will have to get by with one, two, three or four people who can do it," said Dan Portillo, talent partner at venture firm Greylock Partners. But a small team may be enough for startup success. GM in March purchased Cruise Automation, a three-year-old autonomous vehicle startup with about 40 employees, for about $1 billion. Uber last month agreed to buy Otto, which is less than a year old, in a deal valued at $680 million. "Early hires are making unbelievable amounts of money in a few short years," Rodrigues said.

MSI's X99A Gaming Pro Carbon isn't their top of the line X99-refresh motherboard, but it does carry many of MSI's latest features and aesthetic enhancements. Like MSI's king, the X99A GODLIKE GAMING CARBON, the X99A Gaming Pro Carbon features carbon fiber themed heat sinks and RGB LEDs to illuminate the motherboard exactly to your liking.     While everyone agrees that RGB LEDs are now everywhere, their implementation varies considerably depending on the make and model of the product. MSI's original X99A GODLIKE GAMING was ahead of its time in regards to RGB LEDs and independent zone control, something that the X99A Gaming Pro Carbon has inherited. Apart from the RGB LEDs on the motherboard, MSI has also added in x4 PCI-E 3.0 M.2 and U.2 ports to support the latest in storage devices. Without further ado, let's take a look at MSI's X99A Gaming Pro Carbon.     Specifications     Apart from all the expected features such as quad-channel memory and 4-way SLI/CrossFireX support, the X99A Gaming Pro Carbon also carries USB 3.1 type-A and type-C, and USB 3.0 type-C (called USB 3.1 gen 1). Also included is x4 PCI-E 3.0 M.2, x4 PCI-E 3.0 U.2, upgraded audio, overclocking features, and an Intel NIC.     Pricing   The X99A Gaming Pro Carbon is available from many large retailers for $329.99.

The popular hyper-realistic video game can aid computers in piecing together a perception of the real world, according to MIT Technology Review . Researchers from Intel Labs and Darmstadt University, Germany, have extracted training data from the game, teaching algorithms to identify cars, pedestrians and other objects. The team developed and built a layer of software which acted as a buffer between the game and a computer's hardware to label the various components. Google driverless car model (Photo: PA) The game is an efficient way to teach algorithms, as recording and labelling real-life imagery by humans would be extremely laborious and virtually impossible. Given the wide variety of scenarios possible in the game, using it removes the need to recreate high-speed car crashes and other dangerous situations. Read More How much driverless cars could save on your motor insurance revealed “Annotating real-world data is an expensive operation and the current approaches do not scale up easily,” said Alizera Shafaei. A PhD student at the University of British Columbia, Mr Shafaei recently co-wrote a research paper detailing how computer games can be used to train computer vision systems. GTA V clip shows a woman struggling to manoeuvre her car “With artificial environments we can effortlessly gather precisely annotated data at a larger scale with a considerable amount of variation in lighting and climate settings,” he added. “We showed that this synthetic data is almost as good, or sometimes even better, than using real data for training.” Earlier this year, programmer Brett Watanabe created an immortal deer to wander through the streets of GTA V causing chaos. The animal quickly garnered a five-star 'wanted' rating for bad behaviour, and survived encounters in the game's military base and with violent gangs.

"I think his appointment a very good, neutrally well-politically placed position, which allows Europe to feel in the post-Brexit wake that they are not losing a connect with our intelligence instruments or with our collaboration and assistance which is critical, because ultimately well all face the same threats. The more join-up and support that we can lend to our European cousins, the better," Will Geddes, a UK security expert with ICP Group told Sputnik. © AP Photo/ Christian Alminana Greater EU Intel Sharing in Face of Daesh Threat 'Complicated' - ExpertBritish intelligence — because of its long history of dealing with the IRA and other groups in Northern Ireland, plus its experience of the 7/7 London bombings in 2005 — is deemed to be the best in the world and recent terror attacks on mainland Europe have exposed intelligence failures within the EU.  The joined-up communication and intel-sharing in the UK is in sharp contrast to the federalized and silo nature of many EU countries, which security experts say led to terrorists going untracked ahead of recent terrorist attacks in Europe. "British intelligence networks — particularly the join-up between MI5 [domestic intelligence agency] and MI6 [foreign] in addition to the join-up between the various police agencies is a template admired by many across the world in terms of how they have set up their intelligence infrastructures. Are we the best in the world? Well, yes. Between us and the United States, we have the most admirable systems," Geddes told Sputnik. Security Experience King — who was most recently Britain's ambassador to France — has worked on European defense and NATO issues, spent time in Brussels, working on relations with Turkey, European defense and EU enlargement and was UK Permanent Representative to the EU Political and Security Committee in Brussels, covering Common Foreign and Security Policy. Thank you. Looking forward to further discussions on this vitally important area. https://t.co/O75tZdFALy — Julian King (@JulianKingFCO) 2 August 2016 ​King's appointment has yet to be ratified, but he appeared before MEPs for a three-hour grilling, during which he said: "I have direct experience — not least from my time in the Political and Security Committee and on the ground in Ireland and Northern Ireland, and more recently in France. Two months ago, I was in Nice on the morning of 15 July and saw for myself the devastating aftermath of the attack the night before — which killed so many people, injured many more and traumatized Europe. It brought home to me again the true human cost of terrorism." NEWS: Strong performance by Commissioner-designate @JulianKingFCO. View of @TimKirkhopeMEPhttps://t.co/Mxak6pF9OS pic.twitter.com/EUYvy2Spwl — ECR Group (@ecrgroup) 12 September 2016 ​After appearing before MEPs, September 12, Timothy Kirkhope, group leader of the Conservatives and Reformists said: "It's clear that being the UK Commissioner will not be a walk in the park, but Sir Julian was right to say that the UK has played, and will continue to play, a major role in European security and intelligence cooperation even after we leave the EU." ...

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Extreme Samsung may be in talks with AMD, Nvidia to license graphics IP Samsung may be in talks with AMD, Nvidia to license graphics IP By Joel Hruska on September 13, 2016 at 7:30 am Comment Samsung and Apple are the two titans of the smartphone industry, but they’ve taken very different routes to get there. Where Apple has invested a great deal of time and money into building its own custom SoCs and designing its own microarchitecture, Samsung has historically used cores from many other companies, including Texas Instruments and Qualcomm. Last year, the company announced it would bring its first custom CPU core to market in 2016. Now, it’s reportedly in talks with both AMD and Nvidia, looking for a graphics core to match its custom CPU. We’ve heard rumors of Samsung wanting a custom GPU core before, but nothing concrete has come of it thus far. It’s hard to find good data on recent smartphone GPU market share, but this graph by Jon Peddie Research shows the lay of the land from two years ago. Given that Intel and Vivante are both out of the game (Vivante seems to have pivoted to focus on embedded and IoT), the major players here are Imagination Technologies (Apple’s preferred partner) and Qualcomm. Both Nvidia and AMD have graphics IP that Samsung could license — the key question is, is Samsung just looking to cut a deal that gives them access to certain patents so they can legally roll their own solution, or do they want a part that’s designed by either AMD or Nvidia? It’s not actually clear which company would be the better fit. Nvidia manufacturers one of the best Android tablets you can buy, but recently canceled its plans to upgrade the Shield tablet. It’s been speculated that this might have been due to pressure from Nintendo and its upcoming NX. Nvidia is believed to have won that design and may have been prevented from bringing a competitor product to market. Over the last few years Nvidia has focused much more on automotive and deep learning than on launching mobile products. AMD famously sold its mobile IP to Qualcomm, who created Adreno. There’s no reason Team Red couldn’t build a new low-power GPU, and the company’s focus on embedded and semicustom design makes it a good fit for Samsung. CEO Lisa Su has also talked about wanting to lean more on AMD’s patent portfolio while building out additional semi-custom wins. The question is whether AMD has the manpower or current resources to design something in-house. GCN isn’t known for being a low-power GPU architecture, after all, and AMD already has plenty to keep it busy with Microsoft’s Scorpio, Vega, and Zen all dropping in 2017. Speaking of Samsung’s M1, Anandtech got a look at the architecture during Hot Chips 2016. The chip is an out-of-order design capable of decoding four instructions per cycle and with a perceptron-based branch predictor. This last isn’t a brand-new feature, but companies are often cagey about the exact details of how they implement branch prediction in silicon. Above, we see Samsung’s M1 performance as compared with a Cortex-A57, albeit one clocked 200MHz below the Samsung chip. Performance is fairly good, even if the chip really only distinguishes itself in a few tests. As a first effort, it’s a solid core. If Samsung wants to pair it with a GPU of their own design, AMD and Nvidia are the companies to talk to. It could take several years to bring a new solution to market. But if Samsung wants Apple-like control over its own product lines, creating new GPU and CPU IP is the way to do it.

Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube In the past, some have argued that games such as Rockstar’s Grand Theft Auto (GTA) franchise have promoted violence. However there have been instances where it has been found that it actually yielded some positive results, and it seems that over in Germany, researchers from Darmstadt University and Intel Labs have actually used the game to help teach self-driving cars how to navigate better in real life. According to the researchers, while machine learning might be a preferred way of teaching computers do certain things, the amount of data required is immense, and sometimes data can be hard to come by, which is why the researchers have turned to video games like GTA in which information such as roads and obstacles and objects can be used to substitute their real life versions. In some cases they claim that data from games is “almost as good, or sometimes even better”. What the researchers have done is create a software that can identify objects within GTA’s world, such as different objects and roads, and based on that they can use that information to teach self-driving cars the difference between pedestrians and other objects while driving. As to whether or not this method of teaching cars how to drive themselves will prove to be the most effective/efficient, it is a rather interesting approach. Filed in Transportation.

The MacBook Pro is now expected to be announced at a different event along with the iPad in October, according to many reports. The release date will follow the Apple event in a similar fashion to the iPhone 7 event, which also displayed the new iWatch series 2 and the controversial wireless ear pods. MacBook Pro needs a new update. The last version was released in 2012, and there have been no significant updates since then. The MacBook got updated with Intel’s Skylake processors and a new rose gold color option in 2016. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SN7gsMVB1yk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> The most prominent rumor surrounds the release of the MacBook Pro is a radical change in design. Similar to the 12-inch MacBook, it will be thinner and lighter. 6 MacBook Pro Rumors That Are Totally Teasing Us | POPSUGAR Tech https://t.co/zcju8Eob0G #MacBook #tech — byLenaDawn (@byLenaDawn) September 2, 2016 There are rumors of a gold edition, but this has not been confirmed. The new laptop is also expected to feature Touch ID and an OLED touchscreen bar on the keyboard to replace the top of the keyboard. The Touch ID means that you will probably be able to log in to the laptop with your fingerprint. An upgraded graphic card from either AMD and nVidia could make its way to the MacBook in 2016. The Skylake processor, a sixth-generation chip by Intel, is rumored to make its first appearance on the MacBook. This is expected to boost the speed of the MacBook and extend the machine’s battery life. @FinnInNY Hopefully next month. https://t.co/sbLTfOuFUI — MacRumors.com (@MacRumors) September 8, 2016 Since Apple is moving in the direction of wireless earphones, it is expected that the new MacBook pro will not feature a headphone jack. Earlier this year, the Daring Fireball alluded that the next MacBook may come with lighting ports: “Will MacBooks ship with a Lightning port in lieu of a headphone jack? If so, will they ship with headphones? (Probably not, I say. Cough up the extra $29 for a new pair of Apple EarPods),” Gruber explained. “Is this why we haven’t seen new MacBook Pros yet — because they’re waiting for the new iPhone so that both can go Lightning-for-audio at the same time? Perhaps.” Apple will want all their products to connect from the iPhone to iWatch to MacBook in their technological ecosystem. Therefore, it makes sense for iPhone 7 customers to be able to use their ear pods with their future MacBook pro. According to Mac Rumors, Apple may be working on a 5k display for the MacBook Pro. “Apple’s plans to work with LG on a standalone 5K display surface two months after it discontinued the five-year-old Thunderbolt Display. It remains unclear if the monitor will be based upon the Retina 5K iMac, and it is also unclear if the report’s broad late 2016 timeframe for ‘some of the new Mac products’ includes the display.” I guess the rumors about a new #MacBook Pro are real. the site won't let you purchase a new one. #AppleEvent pic.twitter.com/prFfUbnbI5 — ohthanksgee (@ohthanksgee) September 7, 2016 The MacBook Pro 2016 keyboard is expected to feature the butterfly mechanism rather than the traditional scissor mechanism. The current MacBook Pro range starts at $1,099 for the 13-inch non-Retina model, rising to $1,119 for the entry-level 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro and topping out at $2,099 for the 2.5GHz 15-inch Retina. The MacBook Pro 2016 prices are expected to be the same or at least similar, starting at $1,099. Some of the wild MacBook rumors include a touchscreen and a detachable keyboard. Touch sensitive keys rather than a physical keyboard has been thrown out there but is very unlikely at this point. Most laptops released this year has surpassed the MacBook Pro because its current version is dated. Apple will be looking to impress when the new MacBook Pro series is released. The October event should be filled with surprises and confirmation of many of the rumors surrounding the laptop. Are you looking forward to the new MacBook? Leave your comments below.

Reuters/Lucy Nicholson Fresh reports suggest that the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 launch will be delayed. The company may make the highly-anticipated device available in 2017. After the resounding success of Microsoft Surface Pro 4, the Surface Pro 5 is eagerly awaited by fans. The release date delay rumours may not upset fans as a 2017 launch opens up the possibility of Microsoft including the Intel Kaby Lake processor in the Surface Pro 5 device. Even though Microsoft is yet to release any information, there are multiple indications suggesting the Kaby Lake processor will run the show for Microsoft Surface Pro 5. The Kaby Lake processors won’t be ready until end of this year and hence cannot be shipped to the Surface team now. This could be the primary reason for the delay in the launch of Microsoft Surface Pro 5. Furthermore, the device will have the updated Windows 10. The Redstone 2 update is not arriving till spring of 2017, writes iTechPost. All this point towards a 2017 release for Microsoft Surface Pro 5. Microsoft is expected to hold a hardware launch event in late October. However, Microsoft may not be announcing anything on Surface Pro 5 in that event. Instead, Microsoft would be looking to “refresh” its Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book devices. There will be minor changes and a processor update, writes Neowin. Nonetheless, fans believe Microsoft will reveal something about Surface Pro 5 during that event. Meanwhile, the Microsoft Surface Phone 2016 is rumoured to have a Carl Zeiss lens in its 21MP rear camera and 8MP front camera, which will also sport a triple-LED flash. The USB Type-C port will also be made available for lightning speed data transfer and rapid charging.

News & Analysis Chip Process War Heats Up Samsung and China are the wild cards Rick Merritt 9/12/2016 09:00 PM EDT Post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SAN JOSE, Calif. — Although volumes are still small, fully depleted silicon-on-insulator could grow rapidly in the wake of Globalfoundries’ plans for a 12nm process. Whether Samsung or a new fab coming up in Shanghai will adopt FD-SOI will be a big factor, said veteran market watcher Handel Jones of International Business Strategies. Ironically in a semiconductor industry traditionally focused on the next big thing, the aging 28nm node is likely to be the biggest process off all through 2025, according to the current IBS forecast. The FinFET processes adopted by top chip makers Intel, Samsung and TSMC provide the highest performance and lowest power consumption. However in a 14nm equivalent, FD-SOI supports 16.8% lower cost per gate than FinFETs, Jones said. It also provides about 25% lower design cost and risk of needing a re-spin, he added. In addition, FD-SOI has a unique ability to dynamically manage power consumption through biasing. The process also delivers superior support for RF given a significantly higher cut-off frequency than FinFETs, said Jones who attended last week’s FD-SOI event in Shanghai. FD-SOI sports a 16.8% lower wafer cost at 14nm, according to estimates from IBS. (All charts: IBS) “We think smartphone applications processors and modems could adopt 12nm FD-SOI as an alternative to 10nm and potentially 7nm FinFETs,” said Jones. If the process is only available from Globalfoundries, Jones estimates it could grow to as much as a quarter of the advanced-node business. However, “if Samsung came in big time I could see market potential of 40-50% of the 14/16/10nm business covered by FD-SOI -- Samsung is the wild card,” he said. China is another wild card, particularly a new fab in the works in Shanghai. Hua Li will get as much as $5.8 billion from the China government to build a new fab. It has not picked a process yet, but “there’s a reasonable possibility they will do FD-SOI,” said Jones. Hua Li already runs about 30,000 wafers per month in an existing 300mm fab. It is part of the Hua Hong group that includes Grace Semiconductor which operates a 200mm fab. SMIC, arguably China’s most advanced locally owned fab, is not likely to adopt FD-SOI. It is focused on ramping 28nm processes in high-k metal gate and polysilicon flavors. “They are making the right choice to be mainstream,” Jones said. China could sustain “big losses” trying to compete with TSMC in the complex FinFET processes. Jones noted TSMC already as many as 500 engineers dedicated to FinFET design enablement. Overall, “It’s a bit too early” to determine what share FinFET, FD-SOI and planar processes will take, said Jones who has estimated the total available market but not market share for FD-SOI Next page: Apple drives FinFETs, 28nm wins FD-SOI has a $17B available market in 2017, but it's unclear how much it will get.

Video The Windows 8.1 user's guide to navigating Windows 10 Do you still have problems with the Windows 7 check for updates taking hours and hours? It's the same problem I've been talking about since April, but this month, we have a different solution. I can hear the sigh of relief from here. The "magic" patch this month is KB 3185911, otherwise known as MS16-106. It's yet another security patch for the Windows Graphics component. If you install KB 3185911 first, then scan for updates, the scan will miraculously decrease from many hours to a few short minutes. [ InfoWorld has you covered through all stages of Windows 10. Download the Windows 10 installation superguide and the ultimate Windows 10 survivor kit, both available as PDFs. | Stay up on key Microsoft technologies with the Windows Report newsletter. ] In the past, a blogger known as Dalai has updated the information on his website, wu.krelay.de/en, to fill us all in on the latest magic patch. Unfortunately, at the moment, I can't get that site to appear. It's quite likely that the site's become so popular that it's inaccessible, or Dalai has pulled it offline. If you want to install that patch alone, see the two-step method I posted last month (you only have to do Step 2 this month), and substitute KB 3185911 in Step 2. Make sure you follow the instructions and turn off the Windows Update service at the right time. Poster Canadian Tech, both on AskWoody.com and on the Microsoft Answers forum, has presented a simple, permanent solution to the problem (at least until Microsoft changes everything in October). He suggests that you install KB 3020369, then KB 3172605. (Canadian Tech gives credit to TrashZone, ElderN, and VolumeZ for their contributions.) I had a problem with that approach several months ago. KB 3020369 was triggering "Stage 3 of 3" reboot hangs and KB 3172605 had many bugs. Now it looks like Microsoft has fixed those problems -- in particular the Intel Wi-Fi bug has been fixed. So you can pick your poison and either install the one key patch that makes it work, or go ahead with the more-recent changes demonstrated by Canadian Tech. Poster ch100 on AskWoody recommends: For new machines, use Canadian Tech's approach as it is enough to get WU started. For established machines missing patches, use Dalai's approach as it has extra updates which are useful for the slow WU issue. A lot of the issues are related to Windows Update Agent 7.6.7600.320 which is pushed automatically if there is no superseding (later) Windows Update Agent installed. Currently the best Windows Update agents come with KB3138612 or KB3172605 and one of them needs to be installed first thing. Eventually both will be installed as part of WU, as while they overlap in some parts, they do not supersede each other. Either way you'll save many hours in your pursuit of Windows 7 patches.

Pomona lineman Jake Moretti, state’s top recruit, flips commitment from Ohio State to Colorado Broncos’ blocked kick game-winner was a rare perfect storm in the NFL Salida OK’s community of 200 tiny homes to help ease housing crunch By Lindsay Whitehurst and Susan Montoya Bryan, The Associated Press ALBUQUERQUE — Facebook has chosen a village on the edge of New Mexico’s largest metropolitan area as the location for its new data center, an announcement that spread quickly Wednesday as elected officials celebrated a hard-fought win that could have ripple effects for the state’s struggling economy. News of the social media giant’s decision to build in Los Lunas, just south of Albuquerque, comes after a roller-coaster contest between New Mexico and Utah to attract the facility. The courting of Facebook began more than a year ago with a meeting between Republican Gov. Susana Martinez and Facebook executives. During a visit to California, Martinez and her economic development team pitched the sparsely populated state as a good place to do business. New Mexico wasn’t on the radar before that August 2015 meeting. “With the improvements we’ve made over the past several years, New Mexico is finally competing again, and in this case, it’s a big win for the people of our state and our economic future,” the governor said.

Utah supporters said the project would bring a high-tech cachet that could draw other companies to West Jordan, but critics said the cost was too high for land that could attract other development. The village of Los Lunas, meanwhile, agreed to give up all property taxes for 30 years in exchange for annual payments from Facebook that start at $50,000 and top out at less than $500,000. The complex economic development agreement also involves tax breaks on billions of dollars in computer equipment over time. In Utah, an initial $240 million tax-break plan publicly fell apart after several leaders said the lure was too rich. Despite talks being revived, Utah Gov. Gary Herbert later said the deal looked dormant, if not dead. West Jordan Mayor Kim Rolfe said he’s disappointed his city wasn’t chosen and the tax-break package was unfairly maligned. The billion-dollar project would have been an economic boon, he said. A critic of the Utah plan, Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams, said the cost to taxpayers was too steep. “We will walk away from a bad deal. We’re not so desperate that we’re willing to give everything away,” he said. The cost-benefit analysis is different for New Mexico, he said. New Mexico officials have appeared eager to please Facebook after the state was hit hard by a downturn in the oil and natural gas sectors. Computer chip maker Intel, meanwhile, has been steadily unwinding a major manufacturing plant that was an early beneficiary of similar property tax breaks using industrial revenue bonds. Los Lunas economic development director Ralph Mims dismissed criticisms of the package state and local officials created to woo Facebook to New Mexico. “If you want to bring business in, you have to offer incentives,” Mims said. “This is the biggest thing since Intel and you have to look at the economic development spillover. It’s not just about the data center.” Data centers are key to the booming cloud-computing economy, but they typically bring few local jobs. Officials hope Facebook construction will spill over into other parts of the economy, including three industrial-scale solar power plants that would be built to offset electricity consumed by the data center. Los Lunas officials have said the center would be a $1.8 billion construction project creating 300 direct temporary jobs and just 50 permanent jobs. Construction is expected to start next month, with the center coming online in late 2018.

By Julio Ojeda-Zapata | jojeda@pioneerpress.com PUBLISHED: September 14, 2016 at 6:02 pm | UPDATED: September 14, 2016 at 11:21 pm Sign up for newsletters and alerts Most Popular Winter storm: Driving rain in metro, roads icy elsewhere; what to expect today 19-year-old killed in Inver Grove Heights crash Cop shoots suspect after he ‘blew doors off’ squad car in 130 mph chase Oops: Man’s car sails out of second-floor garage, takes a nosedive N.D. Jefferson expert tells University of Virginia students to ‘man up’ 7-year-old found gun in uncle’s room and classmate fired it in school, police say Windows apps everywhere: This has been the longtime mission of St. Paul-based CodeWeavers, a software company that marked its 20th anniversary in May. Most have never heard of CodeWeavers. But for those who rely on its CrossOver products, it’s nothing short of magical. CrossOver, in a nutshell, lets computer users run Windows applications without also having to install the Windows operating system. This means they can run Windows apps on their Macintosh computers, which use the macOS operating system instead of the Windows OS, and even on certain kinds of Android devices and Chromebooks. PCs using various versions of the Linux OS are fair game, too. The Android and Chromebook version of CrossOver is brand new, compared to the Mac and Linux versions that have been around for a long time. The implications are huge: Users of certain Android smartphones and tablets, along with users of Google-based Chromebook notebooks, are now able to run Microsoft Office and other Windows apps right along with Windows-PC users. There are still catches, of course. CodeWeavers is dubbing the Android version of CrossOver an incomplete “technical preview,” and it is providing the software at no cost for testing purposes. What’s more, CrossOver Android only runs on Android devices with Intel processors. There are not many of those. Intel-based Chromebooks, the lower-cost laptops running Google’s Web-centric Chrome OS, are more common. CrossOver Android will run on the laptops courtesy of a Chrome OS feature that enables the use of Android apps. However, only a handful of Chromebooks support this feature so far. The upshot: CodeWeavers’ Android-compatibility technology is promising, but it’s still early days. The companys’ Mac and Linux software is much farther along. CodeWeavers founder Jeremy White said these CrossOver products run thousands of Windows apps with reasonably decent reliability. Though newer Windows apps like Microsoft Office 2016 aren’t compatible yet, older versions like Office 2010 are. “There are enormous and complex apps, and we still struggle with those,” White said. “But most of our demand is for that obscure genealogy app or knitting app, and with those were broadly compatible. We’re running the bulk of those applications pretty successfully.” Tags:  Technology Julio Ojeda-Zapata Julio Ojeda-Zapata covers technology for the Pioneer Press’ business and features desks.

Facebook has several other data centers around the world, such as this one in Prineville, Ore. Photo: Andy Tullis, Associated Press Facebook chooses New Mexico for new data center over Utah 1 / 1 Back to Gallery ALBUQUERQUE — Facebook has chosen a village on the edge of New Mexico’s largest metropolitan area as the location for its new data center, an announcement that spread quickly Wednesday as elected officials celebrated a hard-sought win that could have ripple effects for the state’s struggling economy. News of the social media company’s decision to build in Los Lunas, just south of Albuquerque, comes after a roller-coaster contest between New Mexico and Utah to attract the facility. U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich broke the news on social media, and the rest of the congressional delegation followed minutes later. Gov. Susana Martinez in a statement welcomed what she described as a stellar, cutting-edge company. In Los Lunas, village officials were rejoicing. “This is huge for the state of New Mexico, for the region, for the whole Southwest. This is a big win,” said Ralph Mims, the village’s economic development director. The courting of the Menlo Park company began more than a year ago with a meeting between the Republican governor and Facebook executives. During a visit to California, Martinez and her economic development team pitched the sparsely populated state as a good place to do business. New Mexico wasn’t on the radar before that August 2015 meeting. “With the improvements we’ve made over the past several years, New Mexico is finally competing again, and in this case, it’s a big win for the people of our state and our economic future,” the governor said. While the project has enjoyed broad political support in New Mexico, local leaders in Utah pushed back against a tax-incentive plan they saw as too generous. Utah supporters said the project would bring a high-tech cachet that could draw other companies to West Jordan, but critics said the cost was too high for land that could attract other development. The village of Los Lunas, meanwhile, agreed to give up all property taxes for 30 years in exchange for annual payments from Facebook that start at $50,000 and top out at less than $500,000. The complex economic development agreement also involves tax breaks on billions of dollars in computer equipment over time. In Utah, an initial $240 million tax-break plan publicly fell apart one night in August after several leaders said the lure was too rich. Talks were revived the next morning, but two weeks later, Utah Gov. Gary Herbert said the deal looked dormant, if not dead. Data centers are key to the booming cloud-computing economy, but they typically bring few local jobs. Los Lunas officials have said the center would be a $1.8 billion construction project creating 300 direct temporary jobs and just 50 permanent jobs. That’s far fewer than the steady employment at the local Walmart distribution center. New Mexico officials have appeared eager to please Facebook after the state was hit hard by a downturn in the oil and natural gas sectors. Santa Clara chipmaker Intel, meanwhile, has been cutting jobs at a major manufacturing plant that was an early beneficiary of similar property tax breaks using industrial revenue bonds. Officials hope Facebook construction will spill over into other parts of the economy, including three industrial-scale solar power plants that would be built to offset electricity consumed by the data center. Mims dismissed criticism of the package created to woo Facebook. “If you want to bring business in, you have to offer incentives,” he said. “This is the biggest thing since Intel, and you have to look at the economic development spillover. It’s not just about the data center.” State officials say Facebook has committed to buying local materials and hiring local employees to the greatest extent possible. Construction is expected to start next month, with the center opening in late 2018. Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

Article Tweet Change text size for the story Print this story Report an error In the ever-growing world of digital connectivity and “Internet of Things,” how much sharing is too much? Apparently everything is connected to the Internet these days, even sex toys. In fact, a lawsuit has been filed in an Illinois court against the Ottawa maker of the popular We-Vibe adult sexual aid, over the way newer versions of the device share "highly intimate" data over the web. A version of the vibrating sex toy, called the We-Vibe Rave, which was released two years ago, is Bluetooth and Wi-Fi compatible and can be controlled using a cellphone app called We-Connect, allowing users to control the toy’s intensity and vibration patterns. It also allows for partners to control the toy remotely, while other features built into the app allow for private text messages and video calls. The lawsuit filed on Sept. 2 claims that Standard Innovation Corp. did not do enough to explain how the “sensitive information” being generated by We-Connect users was being used. “Unbeknownst to its customers … (Standard Innovation) designed We-Connect to collect and record highly intimate and sensitive data regarding consumers’ personal We-Vibe use, including the date and time of each use and the selected vibration settings, and transmit such usage data – along with the users’ personal email address – to its servers in Canada,” reads the court filing. The filing on behalf of a female We-Vibe user, identified as “N.P.” seeks certification as a class action complaint and asks the courts for a trial by jury. It alleges the company’s actions demonstrate “a wholesale disregard” for various privacy rights and violated a number of U.S. laws. In a statement, Standard Innovation said it has not yet been notified of the lawsuit. “We cannot comment on rumour or speculation. Should we receive additional information, we will review it thoroughly and comment at the appropriate time,” the company said in the statement. “There’s been no allegation that any of our customers’ data has been compromised. However, given the intimate nature of our products, the privacy and security of our customers’ data is of utmost importance to our company. Accordingly, we take concerns about customer privacy and our data practices seriously.” Eve-Lynn J. Rapp, a lawyer with Edelson PC in San Francisco who is handling the case, said Standard Innovation would be served with papers by Friday. Standard Innovation said it has been working to improve its data security and privacy practices, including consultations with security and privacy experts with a view of further strengthening data protection and privacy for our customers. It said it will also strive to better communicate its data practices to its customers. “We are updating the We-Connect app later this month, and the update will include new in-app communication regarding our privacy and data practices and a new feature for consumers to control how their data may be used,” it said in the statement. The lawsuit serves as a warning for companies that are increasingly pushing more web connectivity and share usage data online. Known in technical circles as the “Internet of Things”, the ever-expanding list of connected devices is staggering. According to information technology researcher Gartner, there are more than 6.4 billion devices connected to the Internet and sharing information online today. That number is expected to hit 20.8 billion devices by 2020, excluding tablets, cellphones and computers, as everything from solar panel to coffeemakers and adult sex aids are hooked up. Scott Montgomery, chief technical strategist with Intel Security, said the We-Vibe controversy is a fascinating look at the issues affecting the world as everything becomes more connected. “People are looking to have the convenience and the perceived benefit without thinking about their own privacy,” said Montgomery. “There was an event last year where hackers attacked a Wi-Fi-enabled Barbie and were able to record what the microphone in the doll was picking up from kids. It begs the question, are we too connected? Did Barbie really need to have an online presence?” In February, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada released a 34-page report outlining concerns for privacy and data as the Internet of Things continues to take shape. “The Internet of Things has been compared to electricity, or a nervous system for the planet, to illustrate phenomena that are at once pervasive, unseen and will become crucially integrated within the fabric of our society,” states the report. “Several international experts, thinkers and technology builders are forecasting profound political, social and economic transformations; concerns about privacy and surveillance are chief among them.” Ottawa-based sex-toy maker facing U.S. lawsuit over privacy concerns Vito Pilieci First posted: Wednesday, September 14, 2016 05:35 PM EDT | Updated: Wednesday, September 14, 2016 05:40 PM EDT In the ever-growing world of digital connectivity and “Internet of Things,” how much sharing is too much?

As the Main Event Partner, Microsoft looks to build partnerships that bring about solutions in the education sector with technology and the power produced by the cloud. The Innovation Africa platform has over 200 government officials comprising of ministers, secretaries of state, deputy ministers, permanent secretaries, and director generals from over 30 countries. Microsoft works with governments, communities, schools and educators to use the power of information technology to deliver services and programs that provide learning for all. Microsoft believes an educated population is the one natural resource that increases in value as it increases in size. “We’re seeing a shift in the way we think about our education systems, based on intuitive nature with which the youth interacts with technology and the dramatic evolution we’re seeing in the 21st century workplace. In addition, the burgeoning youth population across Africa means we need to find a way to more effectively reach a greater number of students. Simultaneously, we need to allow them to learn in their own unique way, anytime, anyplace and at their own pace. Cloud computing, provision of devices to allow for immersive, mobile learning environments and teacher training are all contributing to this evolution and Innovation Africa is the perfect platform to discuss these solutions.” Commented Mark Chaban – Education Director, Microsoft Middle East and Africa In addition to Microsoft, Innovation Africa 2016 has the privilege of hosting an even more striking array of industry titans than it has in past years. Notable partners of the 2015 Summit included HP, Intel and IBM who spoke of the solutions, connectivity and networking opportunities the Summit provides. It is a great platform where all the industry players in Africa can evaluate the education system as a region and design solutions that will benefit the many unique students for 21st century learning. “This is a unique opportunity to discuss with the decision-makers at the highest level. In two days we held 17 pre-scheduled meetings back-to-back.” Andrea Emiliani – Business Development, IBM. As proof of the Summit’s method of raising a company’s profile and maximizing its exposure, partners and sponsors backing the 2016 summit include Huawei, Bi-Bright, Inspur, JP-IK, Positivo BGH and Teachers Media International with repeat support from Intel, Oracle, Samsung and many others. These and more leaders in cloud computing, technological and learning solutions as well as consumer electronic goods will interact in the unique meetings-based format the Summit is known for. “Innovation Africa provides HP with a unique experience to engage with true leaders and decision makers on the continent.” Commented Dave Hill – Senior Director Education, HP on the Innovation Africa Summit 2015. Following an earlier announcement on the dignitaries confirmed to take part in this year’s summit, this striking show of support demonstrates that Innovation Africa Summit is no holds barred for 2016.

You cannot reply to this topic 6 replies to this topic #1 LHLaurini   Members   -  Reputation: 665 Like 0Likes Like Posted 14 September 2016 - 01:50 PM Hello everyone!   I've been recently porting my Direct3D engine to OpenGL so it could run on platforms other than Windows, but it didn't work as intended. After a lot of debugging (using ApiTrace) I'd decided to try to run it on Ubuntu and guess what? It worked exactly like I wanted it to. Earlier this afternoon I tried to use llvmpipe (a software rasterizer) on Windows and it ran just like it did on Ubuntu.   Most objects seem to be rendered at the same place (maybe it's (0,0,0)?) and all of them have the same color so I'm thinking it may be a problem with the uniform buffers, but ApiTrace doesn't give any related error and the values seem OK.   This is how it looks like with llvmpipe:   This is how it looks like without it:   I don't know if ApiTrace .trace files are machine independent, but I'm including one in case someone has time to take a look at it:  Test.zip   8.99MB   41 downloads   Now, there's something very important that I should say. My laptop has Intel integrated graphics which is known to have very crappy OpenGL drivers on Windows (supports 3.1), but the MESA driver on Ubuntu is much better (supports 3.3 core). Also, when on Windows it runs on a OpenGL 3.1 context, but on Ubuntu and when using llvmpipe it runs on a OpenGL 3.3 core context. I don't know if that could make a difference.   Does someone have any idea of what it could be? Could it be a driver bug? Could MESA drivers be allowing something that shouldn't be?   Thank you for reading. Best regards.

At least check the error code of GetLastError() Winapi. Remember that glGetError may be resetted when running any gl function after that one that fails so you need to double check this too. Back to top #4 gabereiser   Members   -  Reputation: 246 Like 0Likes Like Posted 15 September 2016 - 11:39 AM This is classic driver incompatibility.  Your using things on the Ubuntu side that your intel driver can't do.  Do yourself a favor and test it on a proper windows gaming pc (nvidia or amd card) to verify.   The biggest hurtle I had when porting my XNA engine to OpenGL was to remember to check glGetError after each call in DEBUG mode so I knew exactly which lines were failing.  There's a lot more error checking done in OpenGL that I was used to.  I found that even the same code that rendered fine on OSX and Linux, showed up wonky on windows.  My issue was driver defaults.  On windows, my driver defaulted some state (blend state and cull states) that weren't done on OSX and Linux.  I had to write a state manager for my engine to maintain it's own state and not rely on OpenGL's.   One would think that it would be easy to take a standard api and make something cross platform.  Except there are small nuances with the platforms that you have to kinda navigate with your code.     EDIT: Also, test with something basic and small, set to an identity matrix, test across all platforms and see if it's the same.  A simple cube at 0,0,0 should suffice.  This will allow you to start to pinpoint where the differences are. Edited by gabereiser, 15 September 2016 - 11:42 AM. Back to top History(1) #5 LHLaurini   Members   -  Reputation: 665 Like 1Likes Like Posted 15 September 2016 - 05:12 PM Hi again. Sorry for the late reply. Thank you to everyone who's trying to help me.   Do you have any immediate mode code at all? I had to google a bit to remember what that meant. No, I don't have any immediate mode code.     Are you checking for errors in Ubuntu, even though it looks correct? I'm not checking for errors through glGetError yet (because of lazyness) but I'm using GL_KHR_debug which reports even performance warnings.     Can you compile and/or run it as OpenGL 3.1 under Ubuntu to see if you get similar results as Windows? That's tricky. The Ubuntu driver only supports 3.2 and 3.3 when using the core context. The greatest non-core version available is 3.0, so the best I could do would be having a 3.0 context and loading 3.1 extensions. I'll try that if nothing else works.     It sounds that your Intel Chip has some unsupported extensions you are using that the Ubuntu driver support so you may need to check the extension string That's true. The Windows driver doesn't support geometry shaders, for example. But my engine checks if all needed extensions are present, so unless I'm missing an extension (which I don't think I am) that's also not it. I'm going to take a look at it anyway.     and shader compiler output eve if it dosent fail there may be warnings in it. My engine always does that.     At least check the error code of GetLastError() Winapi. I don't know what GetLastError has to do with anything, but I'll take a look at that.     Remember that glGetError may be resetted when running any gl function after that one that fails so you need to double check this too. I don't think so. According to the reference "No other errors are recorded until glGetError is called, the error code is returned, and the flag is reset to GL_NO_ERROR.". Also, ApiTrace always lists all errors and warnings.     Do yourself a favor and test it on a proper windows gaming pc (nvidia or amd card) to verify. If I had a "proper Windows gaming PC" I wouldn't be using a laptop. Decent computers are pretty expensive where I live, so it's not that simple. Remember: just because you can afford a good computer it doesn't mean everybody can.      The biggest hurtle I had when porting my XNA engine to OpenGL was to remember to check glGetError after each call in DEBUG mode so I knew exactly which lines were failing. Yeah, that's something I should do now. Even though ApiTrace verifies errors after each call, it's better to do it on my own.     My issue was driver defaults.  On windows, my driver defaulted some state (blend state and cull states) that weren't done on OSX and Linux.  I had to write a state manager for my engine to maintain it's own state and not rely on OpenGL's. My engine is designed not to assume any kind of default value.     Also, test with something basic and small, set to an identity matrix, test across all platforms and see if it's the same.  A simple cube at 0,0,0 should suffice.  This will allow you to start to pinpoint where the differences are. THIS. For some reason, I haven't even thought about using a simpler scene. Doing this will probably make finding the problem much easier.   Again, thank you to everyone who replied. Have a nice day.

 The code above is executed once per object. The results seem to change if I use glBufferSubData instead of glMapBuffer, so here's a "table": 
UBO update method | 1 object | 2 objects¹ | 3 objects¹
------------------+----------+-------------------------
glMapBuffer       |    OK    |     OK     | WRONG (1)
glBufferSubData   |    OK    |  WRONG (2) | WRONG (3)

¹ It didn't matter if the objects used the same VBO or not.
 What I mean by "wrong" depends on the combination.   For (1), it rendered the first object ok, the second one disappeared and the third one was rendered with the wrong VBO, but with the right world matrix and material.   For (2) and (3), it rendered only the last object, with the right world matrix and material, but with the wrong VBO.   Okay, we're getting closer. The UBO update method really matters. Let's try something. 
UBO update method | Run until the UBO update for the 2nd object | Run until the UBO update for the 3rd object
------------------+---------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------
glMapBuffer       |                      OK                     |             Same as (1) above
glBufferSubData   |               Same as (2) above             |             Same as (3) above Hmm, interesting. So glMapBuffer is erasing the second object after it's been already drawn and glBufferSubData is erasing everything.   Now, as you may know, I have no f***ing idea what the f*** is happening. I feel like even if I manage to solve this issue, another issue even worse is going to appear, so that's why I'm officially giving up support for Intel Windows OpenGL drivers. It's just not worth it. I've spent two weeks trying to solve it. But that's not a big deal since Intel GPU users on Windows can still use Direct3D 10.1.   So thanks to everyone who tried to help me and sorry that I wasted your time by not being able to solve this issue.

If you have no issues with maintaining a D3D pipeline, thats prolly your best option. Otherwise just target core 3.3 on both platforms and scrap older Intel GPUs on Windows.   AMD supported GL3 cards up to GL 4.2, so you get a couple of nice GL4 extensions supported in GL3 hardware (arb_shading_language_420pack, arb_texture_storage, etc). nVidia went a bit further (you can find 4.4 extensions in GL3 cards). Intel just implements what it wants on Windows (sometimes GL 3.1, sometimes GL 4.1, sometimes GL 4.2, its a lottery). Although on Linux they do support some GL4 extensions on GL3 hardware.   Thus why GL 3.3 core is a nice "middle ground" context to target on most places.

News of the social media giant's decision to build in Los Lunas, just south of Albuquerque, comes after a roller-coaster contest between New Mexico and Utah to attract the facility. The courting of Facebook began more than a year ago with a meeting between Republican Gov. Susana Martinez and Facebook executives. During a visit to California, Martinez and her economic development team pitched the sparsely populated state as a good place to do business. New Mexico wasn't on the radar before that August 2015 meeting. "With the improvements we've made over the past several years, New Mexico is finally competing again, and in this case, it's a big win for the people of our state and our economic future," the governor said. While the project has enjoyed broad political support in New Mexico, local leaders in Utah pushed back against a tax-incentive plan they saw as too generous. Utah supporters said the project would bring a high-tech cachet that could draw other companies to West Jordan, but critics said the cost was too high for land that could attract other development. The village of Los Lunas, meanwhile, agreed to give up all property taxes for 30 years in exchange for annual payments from Facebook that start at $50,000 and top out at less than $500,000. The complex economic development agreement also involves tax breaks on billions of dollars in computer equipment over time. In Utah, an initial $240 million tax-break plan publicly fell apart after several leaders said the lure was too rich. Despite talks being revived, Utah Gov. Gary Herbert later said the deal looked dormant, if not dead. West Jordan Mayor Kim Rolfe said he's disappointed his city wasn't chosen and the tax-break package was unfairly maligned. The billion-dollar project would have been an economic boon, he said. A critic of the Utah plan, Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams, said the cost to taxpayers was too steep. "We will walk away from a bad deal. We're not so desperate that we're willing to give everything away," he said. The cost-benefit analysis is different for New Mexico, he said. New Mexico officials have appeared eager to please Facebook after the state was hit hard by a downturn in the oil and natural gas sectors. Computer chip maker Intel, meanwhile, has been steadily unwinding a major manufacturing plant that was an early beneficiary of similar property tax breaks using industrial revenue bonds. Los Lunas economic development director Ralph Mims dismissed criticisms of the package state and local officials created to woo Facebook to New Mexico. "If you want to bring business in, you have to offer incentives," Mims said. "This is the biggest thing since Intel and you have to look at the economic development spillover. It's not just about the data center." Data centers are key to the booming cloud-computing economy, but they typically bring few local jobs. Officials hope Facebook construction will spill over into other parts of the economy, including three industrial-scale solar power plants that would be built to offset electricity consumed by the data center. Los Lunas officials have said the center would be a $1.8 billion construction project creating 300 direct temporary jobs and just 50 permanent jobs. Construction is expected to start next month, with the center coming online in late 2018. ___ Whitehurst reported from Salt Lake City, Utah. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

News of the social media giant’s decision to build in Los Lunas, just south of Albuquerque, comes after a roller-coaster contest between New Mexico and Utah to attract the facility. U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich broke the news on social media, and the rest of the congressional delegation followed minutes later. Gov. Susana Martinez in a statement welcomed what she described as a stellar, cutting-edge company. In Los Lunas, village officials were rejoicing. “This is huge for the state of New Mexico, for the region, for the whole Southwest. This is a big win,” said Ralph Mims, the village’s economic development director. The courting of Facebook began more than a year ago with a meeting between the Republican governor and Facebook executives.

Data centers are key to the booming cloud-computing economy, but they typically bring few local jobs. Los Lunas officials have said the center would be a $1.8 billion construction project creating 300 direct temporary jobs and just 50 permanent jobs.

(XLNX) Fundamentals Look Strong The future is looking bright for XLNX stock, with or without M&A Sep 14, 2016, 10:30 am EST  |  By Rick Rouse, Editor, Momentum Options     Although earnings season is right around the corner, I wanted to do some early research on Xilinx, Inc. (NASDAQ:XLNX) while shares are near 52-week peaks. The company has matched or topped earnings estimates during three of the past four quarters by 5 cents, 2 cents and 1 cent, with a match in the mix. Revenues have topped estimates during the past three quarters but missed by $1.58 million in the year-ago period. Gross margins have pushed 70% over the past year, which is a number that analysts will want to see sustained. A number below this level or a lowered outlook on an earnings miss could send shares sharply lower. XLNX stock’s next earnings report is scheduled to be released on Oct. 19, and current estimates are pegged at 55 cents a share on revenue just south of $575 million. 10 Growth Stocks That Will Outrun Google I love the technical and fundamental picture for Xilinx, and analysts have been mostly bullish on the stock throughout the year. In mid-August, one of the suits-and-ties raised their price target on XLNX stock from $55 to $65 while keeping an “outperform” rating on the stock. In June, with shares at $46, another brokerage firm reiterated its “outperform” rating and $52 price target. On the other hand, at the start of the month, an analyst out of Goldman Sachs lowered their rating to “neutral” from “buy” and set a $51 price target. The reason cited was “limited upside,” with shares closing above $47 the prior session. In May, the company’s board approved a $1 billion share-buyback program. This was a bullish sign, and it came a few weeks after Xilinx lowered its earnings forecast and outlook in late April. Shares fell from $47.35 to close at $43.23 following the quarterly results. Bottom Line for XLNX Stock Xilinx develops integrated circuits and software design tools used to in programmable logic devices. The company has been subject to takeover rumors throughout the year, with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) and China’s Tsinghua Holdings floated as possible suitors. Earlier this year, the company filed a change in control provision, with the SEC saying that it would provide additional benefits to its top executives if XLNX stock is acquired. Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 8 Will Be a 10th Anniversary Masterpiece The chances of the company being acquired are real. However, I don’t believe that management appears anxious to sell given the terrific business it has developed and the long-term growth opportunities in autonomous driving. With a market cap of just over $13 billion, a 50% premium would value the company at $20 billion for roughly a $75-per-share buyout offer. While I don’t like buying stocks on rumors, I do like the technical and fundamental setup for Xilinx going forward.

The increasing IP video growth and swiftly growing number of receiving devices level up the requirements for multifunctional transcoding solution. Unfortunately, as common practice shows – its cost rises ratably. Luckily, CodecWorks 990 is out of the picture offering the customers a very attractive price. “We were inspired and motivated by the challenge to create a high-quality transcoding solution which provides revolutionary performance and easy setup at the affordable price. CodecWorks 990 was specifically designed to meet the requirements of OTT, Video-over-CDN, Point-to-point video delivery and Hospitality solutions. and it definitely fits for such projects”- comments on Fedor Bushlanov, CodecWorks 990 product manager. Elecard CodecWorks 990 supports AVC/HEVC video up to 4K video, HLS adaptive streaming format and a selection of reliable tested hardware options. Powered by Intel 6th generation “Skylake” processor, CodecWorks 990 provides ambitious 6 HEVC HD1080 or 10 AVC HD1080 single streams per CPU. In case of adaptive bitrate transcoding – most demanded AVC HD720 video works smoothly at speed of 6 streams with 3 bitrates/resolutions per stream on a single CPU. Additional pre-processing capabilities include video de-interlacing, picture resize and aspect ratio change. CodecWorks 990 setup and installation process has become intuitively understandable and clear. One may use pre-defined transcoding settings fitting most in-demand and popular tasks. For large-scale projects with hundreds of streams engaged in the process, CodecWorks 990 ensures centralized control over all the encoding servers with GUI app which simplifies it down to a few clicks. In case a failure occurs the transcoding process at the channel will be automatically restarted. CodecWorks 990 software reliably works on a wide range of hardware equipment. However, we prepared four winning combinations of CodecWorks 990 running on Intel NUC Mini PC model, HPE Moonshot, Kontron Symkloud and Supermicro SuperServer 1019S-M2 which proved to show advanced performance at the projects of different scale and complexity. See the performance results here. The product’s name unlocks the secret about its price – CodecWorks 990 license for a single Windows OS instance comes at $990 USD. The number of input/output streams is unrestricted and gives you the chance to effectively use all your CPU power!

Israel's exports continue powering ahead: in June-August 2016, the export of goods (excluding ships, planes and diamonds) rose an annualized 11.5%, compared with a decline of an annualized 6.8% in March-May 2016. RELATED ARTICLES Israeli exports continued to fall in May Israel's exports down 13% in Q2 Treasury: Brexit has negligible impact on exports, TASE The Central Bureau of Statistics reports that in August, the import of goods totaled NIS 21.8 billion, goods exports were NIS 14.6 billion and the trade deficit was NIS 7.2 billion. The rise in exports has been partially explained by one-time events, such as the reactivation of production lines in at the Intel plant in Kiryat Gat. Production lines had been shut down earlier this year, causing exports to decline. In June-August 2016, high-tech exports (about 47% of all industrial exports, excluding diamonds), rose an annualized 12.3%. In comparison, in March-May 2016, they dropped an annualized 14.1%. Export data indicates an annualized 94.6% rise in drug exports (average rise of 5.7% per month). In contrast, the export of electronic components and boards dropped an annualized 11.8%. As for imports, a 34.2% drop in car imports was noted, affecting overall data for consumer durables which dropped an annualized 13.8% in August.

(Photo: AFP Relaxnews) Silicon Valley is creating a crash course in self-driving car technology to address a shortage of engineers with help from a startup in a different field: online education. Nearly every major tech company, car company and ride services company, it seems, is developing or partnering with developers of self-driving technology, from Google parent Alphabet Inc to Tesla Motors, General Motors Corp and Uber Technologies Inc, creating an insatiable demand for the people teaching the machines to think. In about a year's time, a Lincoln sedan will be driving itself from Mountain View to San Francisco, using software developed by 250 or so students enrolled at education start-up Udacity, if all goes according to plan. Udacity bought the Lincoln already equipped with the digital interface needed in autonomous vehicles; students will write the code. Udacity's course, which costs $2,400 for three, 12-week terms, starts next month and was designed by company co-founder Sebastian Thrun, who launched Google's driverless car program. Self-driving truck startup Otto, recently acquired by Uber Technologies Inc, automaker Mercedes-Benz and chip maker Nvidia Corp contributed to Udacity's curriculum. "If you go through this curriculum you are on the bleeding edge of self-driving cars," said Thrun. The aim of the program is a faster path to employment, Thrun said, in a career that has an average salary of $138,000. Mercedes-Benz, Chinese ride-service Didi Chuxing and others agreed to consider Udacity graduates for job openings. The employer pool is growing quickly. Research firm and venture capital database CB Insights has identified 33 corporations working on autonomous cars, including automakers GM and Volvo, internet giants Baidu and Google, and Silicon Valley companies tech firm Intel and startup ride-service Lyft. GM for one is hiring dozens of engineers in the area, and Uber is looking to fill more than 50 positions in Pittsburgh, where the company is building a fleet of self-driving cars, according to jobs website Glassdoor. "I love people with MIT and Stanford degrees," Thrun said. But "there are a lot of people who can't make it to those institutions. There are entire generations of people who are equally smart and equally capable." Yet the idea that a certificate from an online training program would secure a job in one of the most difficult emerging technologies strikes some recruiters as very unlikely. A master's degree in computer science from a leading university such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology or Stanford University is the usual and still preferred course. "You'd be hard-pressed to say the Udacity candidate is going to be more qualified because they have some specific knowledge about self-driving cars, versus someone who has a rock-hard degree in computer science or data science," said Dave Carvajal, chief executive of recruiting firm Dave Partners, which fills executive jobs at venture-backed tech companies. course engineering Self-driving cars smart cars Trending Articles New Zealand vs Pakistan Live Score: 1st Test Day 3 at Christchurch Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them Review: A Charming Film Fantastic Beasts Movie Review: Magic Is Back on the Big Screen!

RELATEDNCIS Boss Talks DiNozzo’s ‘Enormously Significant’ Reason for Leaving, Ziva’s (Alive?) Fate and More Burning Qs The actor, who just wrapped a five-episode arc on Grey’s Anatomy, will play a “once grounded NCIS field agent who accepted a deep cover assignment years ago and never resurfaced. Many agents don’t know he’s still on the job or that he’s even alive. Now, he’s back and his dedication to job and country has left him an unpredictable, charismatic loose cannon.” In a statement, exec producer Gary Glasberg said the role will allow Valderrama to “flex his dramatic, physical and comedic talents,” adding, “Fans are going to see him like they’ve never seen him before. This is going to be fun. We’re thrilled he’s coming aboard.” RELATEDFall TV’s First Scoops: A Grey’s Baby, Vampire Diaries‘ New Big Bad and More Early Intel From 18 Returning Series Valderrama’s hiring comes as NCIS heads into its first season without Michael Weatherly, whose 13-year run on the CBS juggernaut ended with last month’s Season 13 finale. It also follows last spring’s casting of British actor Duane Henry and 24 alum Sarah Clarke in recurring roles. Thoughts on this unlikely piece of casting?

Reply Tybois says: June 16, 2016 at 3:38 PM It’s gonna take alot to replace Michael Weatherly. “DiNozzo” was a character that was kind of an all-in-one. Dramatic, comedic, etc. Replacing him won’t just be one person, it’s gonna have to be more. Reply crimibird says: June 16, 2016 at 3:58 PM The problem though is oversaturation. There is a reason the majority of TV shows have 7/8 core regular characters and an extended recurring cast. Reply David4 says: June 16, 2016 at 6:20 PM Maybe they are planning for the future when more and more people leave the show. However I’d love if they got rid of the ‘new’ blond. I still think she is pointless. Reply william says: June 16, 2016 at 6:47 PM I love her. she’s great. Jim says: June 16, 2016 at 7:13 PM I have thought that since the first episode she appeared. Jim says: June 16, 2016 at 7:14 PM All she brings to the show is ‘fluff’ Amanda Lee says: June 17, 2016 at 12:34 AM Oh, give it a rest–she’s doing a damn fine job, the only “pointless” thing is the small little group of haters who won’t let it go. Slow clap for you, we all get it, you can’t have what you want so you continue to pile it on. Emily is doing a great job and her character has as well–go spew your hate and bile elsewhere…SMDH Murica! says: June 17, 2016 at 4:29 AM I agree. She’s absolutely useless. That ‘Dear mr president’ crap was completely psychotic. It was one of the worst NCIS episodes I’ve ever seen. lizzie says: June 17, 2016 at 4:41 AM Murica, you do know that she didn’t write the episode, don’t you? Kathy says: June 17, 2016 at 5:00 AM I think she fits right in and does a great job. darkangel200 says: June 17, 2016 at 6:51 AM I adore Emily Wickersham and adding Ellie B has been the only smart thing the show has done in years. Mary Wright Pippert says: June 17, 2016 at 7:31 AM I am still truing to get used to her. they needed another weapon. dlraetz says: June 17, 2016 at 8:07 AM I don’t have anything against Ellie Bishop, but I felt like NCIS lost its bite, the hint of danger when Ziva left. An unpredictable agent who spent years under cover might bring some if that back. Then Ellie can be a more stable influence against him Jon says: June 17, 2016 at 11:08 AM Lizzie, if I hit that right, is correct. Emily Wickersham doesn’t write her own part. She is playing the part written for her and is doing it well. You might not like it. She may not like it, but there it is. You’re problem is the writers, not EW. Sounds like you just want more skin or violence. Try AMC or HBO. KJ says: June 17, 2016 at 2:25 PM I’d love to see Ziva come back! She rocked that part so much better than the current female does. Hated to see Weatherly leave for sure. He was a highlight on the show almost every week. :) tomus225 says: June 17, 2016 at 5:38 PM Zzzzzzzzzzzz! That is not for the actress either. BJG77 says: June 16, 2016 at 3:45 PM I’m wondering where they’re all going to sit…LOL Reply eldon says: June 16, 2016 at 7:08 PM Huh? Weatherly leaves a chair. They hire one more person. Seems simple to me. Reply BJG1977 says: June 17, 2016 at 5:46 AM NCIS said they were also adding Tess (the FBI agent) and Clayton (the MI6 guy). That’s 3 people for one chair. Reply darkangel200 says: June 17, 2016 at 6:48 AM Maybe they’re hoping all the new shiny toys will divert fan’s attention away from how mediocre the writing has become? That’s the problem, not the cast. GrannyRose says: June 17, 2016 at 7:21 AM Does it take three people to replace Tony?? dlraetz says: June 17, 2016 at 8:08 AM This article says reoccurring. So maybe they’re not in the bull pen Laurie Merrigan says: June 17, 2016 at 3:11 AM agreed here. Reply Tom says: June 17, 2016 at 5:02 AM Duane Henry and 24 alum Sarah Clarke in recurring roles, recurring being the operative word. So it looks like Wilmer is going to be the series regular.

Kris says: June 17, 2016 at 6:22 AM The other two new characters from the end of S13 are recurring, not regular, characters. So they’re not permanent additions to the cast. Reply Hege says: June 17, 2016 at 6:48 AM Weatherly leaves, Valderrama joines. The number of castmembers are still the same.

Reply meredithbrody says: June 17, 2016 at 7:37 AM Thanks for adding that Matt, I didn’t think I was losing it when I thought that nobody had confirmed they weren’t picked up. I have a theory that I’m not going to post publicly (because I don’t feel like being lynched by the NOLA fans today and they’ll get me for it) but I think I have an idea… Reply MMD says: June 17, 2016 at 8:43 AM I thought it was inferred in the article that they would still be recurring or is my reading comprehension dwindling?

Nobody can’t replace Michael Weatherly and it won’t be the same without him. Reply Mary Wright Pippert says: June 17, 2016 at 7:35 AM I love this show. Although Tony will be missed I will soldier on.

Reply Gemini says: June 25, 2016 at 10:53 PM When Gibbs was shot by the boy, his personality was supposed to change–wearing button-down shirts instead of polo shirts, letting his hair grow, becoming softer to his group, etc. That story line never took off. I’d like to see the old Gibbs back. Reply auntiemm says: June 16, 2016 at 3:34 PM Wow! Where did this come from? So neither of the newbies made a great enough impression to become regulars? This might be interesting. Reply Dmac says: June 16, 2016 at 3:42 PM No, I think they are still part of it. Reply KLS says: June 16, 2016 at 4:52 PM They are recurring with the chance to be regulars. Seems like their trial period is lasting longer then originally planned. Reply shermom says: June 17, 2016 at 4:00 AM Good point auntiemm – I think Michael’s part was so strong that another actor with his charisma should replace him…Wilmer’s got the stuff to keep everyone (cast and audience) on their toes. I can;t wait. Reply Lore says: June 16, 2016 at 3:43 PM I love it… and because the other two agents are recurring roles, dont care… i think its a good idea to bring some latino flavor Reply eldon says: June 16, 2016 at 7:10 PM Yep. Reply ndixit says: June 16, 2016 at 3:43 PM I know that MW is a big loss for NCIS, but three new regulars to replace one is overdoing it. Reply ndixit says: June 16, 2016 at 3:45 PM I see now that Duane Henry and Sarah Clarke were mentioned as recurring in the article. I though they were both going to be series regulars. Reply Andrew Hass says: June 16, 2016 at 3:49 PM No Duane Henry and Sarah Chalke were recurring in last season’s final 2 episodes and depending how things went one or even both could have been promoted to series regulars next season. Reply Andrew Hass says: June 16, 2016 at 3:46 PM I’m going to keep an open mind and not judge this new character until i see him.Plus i hope the fans don’t compare Wilmer Valderrama to Michael Weatherly because i don’t think that’ll be fair.However i also NCIS will hire one another actor/actress and it could be either Duane Henry and/or Sarah Chalke.So this hiring might be a separate thing from that.As for how this character appears maybe he’s connected to a case Gibbs and his team will investigate in the season premiere Reply Terry says: June 16, 2016 at 6:48 PM I was thinking the same thing…keeping an open mind. I’m giving the show and new characters a chance just because I’ve been a long time fan. Loved the DiNozzo character, but who knows? They might be able to pull it off. After all, lots of characters have come and gone and the series survived. Tim McGee grew on me, loved Ziva, and the Jimmy Palmer character is holding his own. Still have Abby, Gibbs, and Ducky so I’m still tuned in. Reply eldon says: June 16, 2016 at 7:13 PM Well said, Andrew & Terry. Reply mazel tov says: June 16, 2016 at 9:38 PM McKee is solid. Can easily live without Jimmy. Abby I can live without. She has not grown or matured in 13 seasons. It is still “Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs” and Caf-Pow. Never warmed up to Rocky Carrol as the Director. Easily put a new face there. I thought John Cryer did a great job as Gibb’s surgeon. Maybe they can work him in as Ducky’s potential replacement. Bishop is fine.I still miss Kate. Reply Terry says: June 16, 2016 at 3:49 PM More like a spit take. After what passed for Michael Weatherly’s sendoff, but was really more about insulting both his character and his fans with bad fan fiction, I don’t really care who they cast in any role. I won’t be watching the further destruction of a once great show, but good luck to them. Reply Melody says: June 16, 2016 at 3:56 PM I hope other shows learn NEVER to give in to fan service. The show lost its integrity by cater to lowest common denominator of the fandom and down the road they will acknowledge this mistake. Reply crimibird says: June 16, 2016 at 4:00 PM I agree with you here. Fanservice never ends well really. Reply Daniel says: June 16, 2016 at 5:07 PM Sweet cheeks… they didn’t. They came up with Tonys exit a LONG time ago And never deviated from course. Just because you didn’t like… it doesn’t make it a mistake … or “fan service”. Weatherly had fun with Cote, with Ziva… it made him a better actor when she was there, so obviously they chose to mine that time for one last story. Get past it… Weatherly has. Reply pAloma says: June 16, 2016 at 8:34 PM I would have preferred to see the finale storyline moved earlier in the season so we could have had some time enjoying Tony as a father to a little girl. What a change of circumstances for him. So I feel a little cheated there. And, really, the final two episodes were just blah. Reply Pete says: June 17, 2016 at 5:06 AM Cutie Pie, If they came up with Tony’s exit a long time ago and never deviated from it then they should stick to writing fan fiction. That episode, his departure episode, was pure fluff and nothing to do with NCIS or crime drama. . As for Weatherly’s acting, “Ziva” did the opposite of making him a better actor, most of his scenes with her threw away his acting ability. Actually, no, perhaps it did make him a better actor in that he was able to pull off such rubbish with a straight face, compared to the drama and action he was given in the early seasons, before all the writers could do was link his – once so rich and nuanced – character, to her and soppy, soapy stuff. . Romances for characters in a show like this should be sidebars to greater illuminate a character, not taking over the story with one character eclipsing another. Reply Vanessa says: June 17, 2016 at 5:35 AM Pete, I couldn’t agree with you more. I hated the Tony/Ziva storyline. She always treated him like crap and they made him fawn over her. The finale was awful. Melody says: June 17, 2016 at 11:39 AM Amen! There was no true love. They had a freaking one night stand that produced a child and she didn’t even tell him. As a woman that offends me. Its funny how some women want strong female characters then always overly romanticize them with a male character. Keith says: June 17, 2016 at 5:53 PM Blame the writers-these are fictional characters Melody says: June 17, 2016 at 11:35 AM I smell BS! And you are definitely not a guy. You are one of those rabid Tiva Minions. You dont cater to a small minority of fans. ITS BAD WRITING. To me it proves the creators were scared of the Tiva fans. You dont give in to militant rabid groups like that. Reply BJG77 says: June 16, 2016 at 4:02 PM I’ll be watching & hoping the new characters will help me forget Tony DiNozzo (MW). I’m saying this only because I don’t want to remember what they did to Tony in the SF13. It was a disgrace. Reply teresa says: June 16, 2016 at 4:10 PM with you there, Terry! Looks to me like GG is really just going nuts trying to undo what’s already been done — irreparable! Reply Cat says: June 16, 2016 at 3:53 PM “This is one way to get those young female demos up: NCIS has recruited That ’70s Show‘s Wilmer Valderrama to join the Season 14 cast as a full-fledged series regular, TVLine has learned.” So….the rest of us fans who have watched faithfully over 13 yrs mean nothing??? We had two good characters introduced at the end of last season…don’t need someone else coming in and kicking them out (making them recurring rather than regulars). When are the idiots going to realize that 18-34 year old females are NOT the main TV audience. Reply Duke says: June 16, 2016 at 5:18 PM I’m sure the 36 year old Valderrama can bring in the middle aged audience as well. Reply Murica! says: June 16, 2016 at 3:59 PM Weird casting. I can’t picture him as a part of the team. I thought one of the other two was going to become a series regular. I would rather have Sarah Clarke as the new team member than Valderrama. Reply Will Cariño (@wcarino03) says: June 16, 2016 at 8:55 PM Is it because he’s not black or white? Reply Murica! says: June 17, 2016 at 4:25 AM What kind of idiotic question is that?

Reply Gramercy says: June 16, 2016 at 4:05 PM And I’m going to start watching NCIS regularly again! I love this He was amazing Grey’s Anatomy I totally can see him doing drama with that comedy. I did not like the girl character (Sarah Clarke) they tried to add but the British guy wasn’t bad. He didn’t stand out but there was a lot going on. Reply grazelled says: June 16, 2016 at 4:21 PM I was impressed with his time on Grey’s otherwise I would never think he could play a dramatic role so well. Having a comedy background will also help. Nobody will replace Tony but I after seeing him on Grey’s I think he’ll fit in better with the team than the other two from last season. Maybe it’s because they used up Tony’s time or something else but I wasn’t that impressed with either one to be a permanent part of the team. Of the two, I liked the British guy the best so hope he’s on the most. Reply Gemini says: June 25, 2016 at 11:04 PM I didn’t really like the two new characters they added for the last two episodes. The British guy wasn’t bad, but there were times when I couldn’t hear or understand what he was saying. Sarah Clarke tried to hard to be tough and it just didn’t work for me. I’d like to give Valderrama a chance so I’ll tune in initially. Reply Jennifer says: June 16, 2016 at 4:40 PM And with that, RIP NCIS. It’s a good thing that you were renewed for 2 years, otherwise it his would be the last season. Again, RIP to a once great show. Reply Matt Webb Mitovich says: June 16, 2016 at 4:54 PM LOL . Reply TraciWallters says: June 16, 2016 at 4:59 PM Ncis has sucked since Ziva left. That new girl should have been killed off by now. She adds nothing. No dimension.

Kathy says: June 17, 2016 at 5:08 AM We’ve been trying to tell them that for years. I agree it did get better after z left, they should have killed her off then. And just in case someone has a question, I’m talking about the fictional character z, NOT the actress that played her, when I say they should have killed her off as soon as she left. Reply Pete says: June 17, 2016 at 5:10 AM The show improved briefly, after Ziva left, and then it became clear that the writers have very little idea about the legacy Bellisario left them of rich and nuanced characters – instead they have all been written as one-dimensional caricatures for too long. Sad really. Reply Amanda Lee says: June 17, 2016 at 12:42 AM That’s your opinion. I love Emily’s character and it’s only in your mind that it has “sucked” since “Ziva” left. Want to toss blame around? Go write Cote, she’s the one who walked away. Towards the end it was more like a soap opera instead of NCIS. If you don’t want to watch it, learn how your remote works and change the damn channel….want some cheese to go along with your whine?? Reply PamC says: June 23, 2016 at 9:11 AM And that, Amanda, is your opinion. Can you blame Ziva for leaving after what Glasburg did to her character. Reply tomus225 says: June 23, 2016 at 9:28 AM …Did to HER character? Really! If someone paid me outlandish amounts of money for “playing” a part I believe I could show up happy every morning, do my job and skip out every evening with a big ole smile on my face!! Matthew says: June 16, 2016 at 4:48 PM Pretty stupid idea. One cast member leaves and you cast three to take his place. Amazing show but stupid move on their part. Reply KLS says: June 16, 2016 at 4:50 PM This is a good addition, a surprise though. I didn’t like either of the two new agents that they tried out last year. Sarah Clarke’s character was too abrasive and Duane Henry was trying too hard to fit in (or the rest of the cast was trying too hard for us to like him with too many smirks and slide ways glances). We’ll see how this one works out. . And as to a comment above, NCIS’s prime audience are 25-49 female. Reply Kim R says: June 16, 2016 at 4:58 PM I think this is a great fit.

NEW PRESS RELEASE CATEGORIES ﻿ Computer & Technology MP4 to Blu-ray Converter -- What to look for? PR-Inside.com: 2016-09-14 14:33:04 Being a mainstream container format, MP4 provides a way to store both videos and audios in one file, so that people can watch a video on a compatible device, such a smart phone, or tablet computer, especially to those always on the move. However, as the popularity of Blu-rays continues to accelerate, there are many people interested in turning their high resolution MP4 videos into Blu-ray format, so that they can also watch their personal MP4 videos on a home Blu-ray player occasionally. Speaking of this, the need for a MP4 to Blu-ray converter comes to reality. But, there are so many so called Blu-ray maker applications on the internet, and you have no enough time to test them one after another just to see whether a certain one works for you or not. So, a recommendation from others will save you much time. This is why this article is here for. I will take Sothink Blu-ray Creator as an example, to show you while finding a quality Blu-ray creator software, what influencing factors should you keep in mind, and what should you look for. The First Thing to Consider: Features and Performance The first thing to consider is the features and performance of the possible candidate. Apart from the MP4 videos, Sothink Blu-ray Creator also supports to convert many other videos into high resolution Blu-ray video, such as MKV, AVI, MOV, M2TS, VOB, MTS, etc, and it allows users to save the finished Blu-ray video onto computer hard disc drives as Blu-ray ISO file, or Blu-ray folder which can be watched with a video player software or burnt to blank Blu-ray media at a later time with other 3rd party burning tools, or you can also choose to burn the finished Blu-ray video directly to blank BD-50/-25 disc, as this Blu-ray creator software has its own built-in burning engine; it also a several sets of menu templates with different themes, like a birthday party, a wedding ceremony, etc, which can be freely customized. Still there are some other features that should be very much helpful, like the capabilities to add external subtitles, multi-threading, Intel Quick Sync, CUDA hardware acceleration, all of which can speed the conversion a whole lot faster. The Next Element to Consider: Input and Output Settings As about the input settings, it is something much similar to one of its capabilities, which is to be able to convert all kinds of videos out there, no matter what format they are in, into Blu-ray video. And regarding to the output settings, there actually are several to mention, like the options it gives to users to choose the BD 50 or BD 25 size, even the DVD-9 and DVD-5 size, to shrink the oversized source so that it can fit into the selected output size, to choose the playback order, and also to choose the video aspect ratio. The 3rd Thing to Think of: the Pricing and Technical Assistance As far as the price is concerned, Sothink Blu-ray Creator costs $56.99 for one year’s subscription, and $86.99 for a lifetime subscription. It’s nothing inexpensive, but they have a lot of online tips, guides and also timely email technical assistance if you run into any problem. It will be the money well spent.

Based on net income of 186 million Euros, the company achieved diluted earnings per share of 0,16 Euros, in line with the prior quarter and 60% up on the same quarter last year. • Sierra Wireless reported results for its second quarter ending 30 June 2016: revenue was $156,2 million, a decrease of 1,1% compared to the second quarter of 2015. Net earnings were $0,7 million, or $0,02 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2016, compared to net earnings of $4,1 million, or $0,12 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2015. During the quarter, the company also completed its acquisition of GenX Mobile, a provider of in-vehicle cellular devices for the fleet management, asset tracking and transportation markets, for $7,8 million. • Qorvo’s June quarterly revenue increased 4% year-over-year and 15% sequentially to $698,5 million. It made a net loss of $5,7 million, or $0,04 per share. During the period, the company released its next-generation BAW filter process and reported that it secured what it described as “key 5G and massive MIMO design wins.” • Texas Instruments reported second-quarter revenue of $3,27 billion, net income of $779 million and earnings per share (EPS) of 76 cents. That represents a 1% increase in revenue year-on-year, and a 17% increase in EPS. Compared with a year ago, demand for TI’s products continued to be strong in the automotive market, and grew in the industrial and communications equipment markets. Embedded processing revenue grew 9% and analog revenue was about even with the same quarter a year ago. • For its second quarter of 2016, NXP Semiconductors brought in $2,37 billion in revenues, an increase of 57% year-on-year but down 8% on a comparable basis considering product line divestures and the acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor earlier in the year. Diluted net loss per share was $0,04, which was primarily affected by accounting related to the Freescale acquisition. Companies • TDK announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, EPCOS, will launch a public tender offer for all publicly held shares of Tronics for 48,7 million Euros. The move is part of TDK’s strategy to grow its sensor business, as Tronics’ services range from MEMS design to high-volume MEMS manufacturing, with a portfolio of technologies covering inertial sensors, gas sensors, infrared sensors, micro-mirrors, micro-optics and micro-actuators, as well as forward-looking BioMEMS and microfluidic devices for in-vitro diagnostic and DNA analysis. • Osram is expanding its specialty lighting business through the acquisition of Novità Technologies, a US manufacturer of automotive LED modules which are used particularly in tail lights, fog lights and daytime running lights. Although financial details are being kept confidential, Novità has annual sales of over 40 million Euros, with around 100 employees and ships mainly to headlight and tail light manufacturers in the United States. • Following Datwyler’s recent bid for Premier Farnell, Avnet has thrown its hat in the ring with a better offer. Avnet reached agreement with Premier Farnell’s board of directors on the terms of a recommended all-cash offer of £1,85 per share for an equity value of approximately £691 million, compared with Datwyler’s offer of £1,65. Headquartered in the UK, Premier Farnell is one of the world’s leading global distributors of electronic components and related products, with revenues of £982,7 million in its most recent fiscal year. • Renesas Electronics is rumoured to be in the advanced stages of negotiations to acquire Intersil. According to a report in Japanese newspaper Nikkei, Renesas is poised to spend up to $3 billion to buy the power management, analog and mixed-signal semiconductor firm. Neither company has thus far confirmed the rumour. • With an eye towards expanding its range in growth areas such as the Internet of Things, Industry 4.0 and smart metering, Würth Elektronik eiSos has acquired fellow German company Amber Wireless, a manufacturer of industrial wireless connectivity solutions. Financial details of the transaction were not disclosed. • STMicroelectronics has acquired assets related to ams’ NFC and RFID reader business. The deal includes intellectual property, technologies, products and business complementary to ST’s secure microcontroller solutions serving mobile devices, wearables, banking, identification, industrial, automotive and IoT markets. Approximately 50 technical experts from ams have been transferred to ST. The purchase includes a cash payment of $77,8 million as well as deferred earn-out contingent on future results, which ST estimates will be about $13 million but which will not exceed $37 million. Industry • IC Insights’ top-20 worldwide semiconductor sales ranking for the first half of 2016 (shown in accompanying table) includes eight suppliers headquartered in the US, three in Japan, three in Taiwan, three in Europe, two in South Korea, and one in Singapore, a relatively broad representation of geographic regions. In total, the top-20 semiconductor companies’ sales increased by 7% in 2Q16/1Q16. Although, in total, the top-20 2Q16 semiconductor companies registered a 7% increase, there were seven companies that displayed a double-digit 2Q16/1Q16 jump in sales and only two that registered a decline (Intel and Renesas). Given the possible acquisitions and mergers that are likely to occur over the next few years, the top-20 ranking is likely to undergo a significant amount of upheaval as the semiconductor industry continues along its path to maturity. (see table below). • Global revenue for lighting equipment grew by 4,6% in 2015, a slightly lower rate of growth than the previous year, when revenue grew 4,8%. According to IHS Markit, lamp market revenue grew 4% percent in 2015 (lower than the 7,3% growth in 2014), and luminaire revenue grew 4,8% (compared to 3,9% growth in 2014). While the switch to LED technologies, which have much longer lifespans than traditional technologies, means that fewer replacement lamps are required, luminaire revenue growth is forecast to continue, driven by LED integrated and LED replacement luminaires. • The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) announced worldwide sales of semiconductors reached $79,1 billion during the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 1,0% over the previous quarter and a decrease of 5,8% compared to the second quarter of 2015. Global sales for the month of June 2016 reached $26,4 billion, an uptick of 1,1% over May’s total of $26,1 billion, but down 5,8% from the June 2015 total of $28,0 billion. Cumulatively, year-to-date sales during the first half of 2016 were 5,8% lower than they were at the same point in 2015. • Though beacon retail technology is grabbing headlines, the future of Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacon shipments is not in retail. ABI Research forecasts the amount of BLE beacon shipments made in the personal tracking, IoT and real-time location system (RTLS)/asset tracking markets will easily surpass those in retail. The overall BLE beacon market continues to grow rapidly with shipments set to break 500 million units by 2021. In the IoT space, ABI Research expects to see BLE combined with LPWAN technologies to support large scale deployments in smart cities. Another emerging trend is the shift to software-based beacons, in which vendors leverage integrated BLE ICs as beacons and virtual beacons; these will be major drivers across a range of markets. Technology • A research group at Japan’s National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS) has developed new display sheets that can be cut into any shape with scissors. The technology employs a polymer with electrochromic properties that can be sprayed onto a flexible substrate to form a coating layer stable against moisture and oxygen. In addition, it requires only a few seconds of electrical input to switch visual information, and the display will last even after power supply is discontinued. Since it can be cut into any shape desired, and attached to the surfaces of complex objects such as clothing or buildings, the display could meet diverse needs beyond what can be achieved by conventional display technologies. • Researchers from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) have developed a novel type of photodetector that needs far less space than conventional ones. The component has a base area of less than one millionth of a square millimetre without the data transmission rate being affected adversely, allowing it to be integrated with electronic components on the same CMOS chip. In experiments, the researchers reached a data rate of up to 40 gigabits per second. A plasmonic detector that is directly coupled to a silicon optical waveguide and smaller than one micrometre was developed by KIT.           << Previous article   Next article >> Mobile | Classic
