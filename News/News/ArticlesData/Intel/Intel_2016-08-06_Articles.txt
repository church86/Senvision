Novel Intel Edison smart helmet with portable air conditioner that can notify the relatives when a rider meets an accident, can automatically trigger the indicators based on head movement. Download Helmet Intel XDK Nodejs Code.zip - 9.4 KB   A Intel Edison based smart helmet that Changes In-Helmet temperature using Peltier based cooling system The cooling is based on temperature sensing Triggers indicator automatically when user moves his head in left or right direction Detects accident and notifies about the accident using Gmail and over Mqtt Cmpletely battery driven and working prototype  Motivation In many places, in INDIA like Kalaburagi, people tend to avoid the helmets due to excessive heat and severe irritation and discomfort, resulting from the heat. The country also suffers from rash driving & negligence. Many a time, such negligence by the riders for not using dippers and indicators results in road mishaps. Further we do not have a great accident support system. Hence many a times a rider loses his life because he remains unattended for a long time even after the accident. The major motivation for the work is to address a solution that can keep riders head cool, trigger the indicators automatically when he turns and notifies any authority or relatives when rider meets an accident. Our main goal is to save millions of lives that have been lost every year, not using the helmet, not using the indicators. Introduction Street car/bike accidents take the lives of about 1.3 million consistently and harm 20-50 million more on the planet. Refusal to utilize legitimate cruiser protective caps is among the fundamental variable adding to pass from street crashes - WHO said this in its report on 'Decade of Action for Road Safety '2010-2011'. All the more exasperatingly, an extensive number of passing from street mischances are borne by helpless Street clients, for example, people on foot, cyclists and motorcyclists. Around 13% of the casualties from street related passing are people on foot in India when contrasted with 15% of mischances from traveller cars, autos and taxis and 27% from riders of mechanized two-or-three wheelers. So in the event that it can be made required to make the general people wear the protective cap when they ride the bike then the rates of these mishaps can be relied upon to fall. Overall most governments have officially made stringent laws with respect to wear the protective cap. In any case, regardless of the laws such cases are still on an ascent due to the absence of legitimate execution. As of recently just the laws have been shaped however no mechanical work has been done in such manner. This is a circumstance we see in our everyday life, a considered discovering some answer for determination this issue we concocted this thought of giving the data about the mishap at the earliest opportunity and in TIME….!! Because after record-breaking matters a great deal, if everything is done in time, at any rate we can spare a large portion of the lives that are lost because of bike mischances. Considering three main considerations for keeping away from the mishap causes, for example, Make wearing the protective cap mandatory. Avoid drink and drive. If an individual is met with a mischance and if nobody is there to help him. Rather than basically leaving or overlooking the individual he may bite the dust (Die). In such circumstance, advising to an emergency vehicle or relatives through smart phone to safeguard him to a degree. In this work, we exhibit the configuration of the model we redesigned the head protector cap with Peltier module and GPS. With stock incorporated into head protector, agreeable temperature can be kept up in the cap by utilizing the Peltier module which deals with the premise of thermoelectric impact. In the event of street mishaps the exact area of the rider can be followed out utilizing GPS framework and gives the message to crisis vehicle. Also if any draining of blood happen can be coagulated by the thermoelectric module with the goal that individual can be safeguarded from basic conditions.     Problem  Few of the past works have proposed various embedded based solutions for helmets. Most of the past solutions adapt GPRS for generating the notification. One of the major problems with SMS (GSM) and web (GPRS) based notification is that the messaging is costly and secondly the web protocol is multitudes of time slower in comparison to M2M protocols being offered by IoT. Also, most of the past works are based on microcontroller architecture which has a serious limitation as far as parallel programming is concerned. Therefore parallel monitoring and controlling of the temperature, accident and indicators becomes very slow in the context of real time scenario. This problem can be addressed by replacing GPRS with IoT gateway, microcontroller with powerful microprocessors and using low latency sensors over conventional sensors. The challenge of fast communication, scalable messaging, channelling of the messages and alarm and better event trigger is solved by the proposed solution. We use Intel Edison with Arduino compatible extension board to increase the speed of prototyping. We used Wi-fi connectivity to connect the IoT board with internet. We have used I2C based Accelerometer sensor, which has got significant performance improvement over serial communication based on conventional Accelerometers. The notification system puts the data into Google cloud through which it can be channelled to other platforms like Facebook, Twitter through IFTTT’s cloud based event and message routing. We have also used MQTT protocol which betters the response time of both web services and http. As MQTT from core offers QOAS support, the delivery of every packet with optimal latency is guaranteed. The detailed architecture of the proposed system is explained in detail in the methodology section.    Highlights The objective of the work is to offer cutting edge near real time solution for road safety, head comfort, riding assistance to a rider through a smart helmet powered by new generation IoT processors and protocol structures. The overall objective can be summarized into below specifics. Maintaining a comfortable temperature for the rider and in case of head injury due to an accident, to accelerate the blood clotting process by rapidly reducing the temperature of the Peltier module. Besides this locating the precise location(civic address) of the rider in case of an accident and at the same time intimating it to a preset mobile number and also since the data is collected through the cloud via MQTT ,the real time civic address will be broadcasted to social media applications like Facebook, Twitter, Gmail etc via an IFTTT application to address it to the family members. Based on the movement of the head of a rider for certain duration, this device actuates indicators placed on helmet sensed by the Groove accelerometer sensor.       Specifications Hardware Specifications Intel Edison Arduino  Compatible Breakout board for Intel Edison Sensors(Vibration, Accelerometer Peltier module with Heat Sink 12v External power supply/ Mobile Power Bank Internet Connectivity(Wi-Fi), 3G Android Mobile (Android version 4.0 and above) SeedStudio Groove Kit   Software Specifications Linux Yocto Operating System for Edison Node.js IDE: Intel XDK IoT edition Language: JavaScript ( Node.js) PuTTY IP Gateway:  IFTTT  protocols: MQTT.SMTP Client IDE: Android Studio     Components In this section we will elaborate about the sensors and other components being used in this project   Grove Peizo Vibration Sensor  - For Accident detection You can learn more about the sensor in this wiki link     Grove temperature Sensor - For temperature detection and triggering cooling unit Grove temperature sensor is an electronic grove device that is basically used to sense the temperature changes in the surrounding. The Grove-Temperature Sensor utilizes a thermistor to identify the encompassing temperature. The resistance of a thermistor will be increment when the encompassing temperature diminishes. It's this trademark we use to compute the surrounding temperature. The recognizable scope of this sensor is -40 - 125ºc, and the precision is ±1.5ºc Following are the specifications of the sensor: Voltage: 3.3 ~ 5v Max power rating at 25 ºc:300mW Zero power resistance: 10KΩ Operating temperature range:-40 to 125 ºc 3-Axis Accelerometer -  For Head movement detection and automatic indication The 3-axis Accelerometer grove device basically uses a MMA7660FC and Digital Output I2C. This Grove device is basically applied for sensing the changes in the data, production direction and motion recognition via an interrupt pin (INT). This module uses less power and has a lower profile capacitive MEMS sensing element. Following are the features of the 3-axis accelerometer sensor: Grove compatible interface Axis motion/orientation sensing Digital Output (I2C) 10,000g shock survival RoHS/WEEE lead-free compliant 5V DC input Grove Relay -  For switching the Peltier module                                                                                            The Grove-Relay module is a computerized typically open switch. Through it, we can control circuit of high voltage with low voltage, say 5V on the controller. There is a pointer LED on the board, which will illuminate when the controlled terminals get shut. In my work the use of Grove relay is to switch on the Peltier module or the fan when the value of the temperature rises above some threshold value set. It will be triggered by the MCU. Specifications Operating voltage: 3.3V~5V Operating current:100mA Relay Life:100,000 Cycle Max switching voltage:250VAC/30VDC Max switching current:5A Grove RGB LCD Backlight -  For display (Ok, IoT device doesn't look good without a display :) ) This Grove empowers you to set the shading to whatever you like by means of the basic and compact Grove interface. It takes I2C as specialized strategy for the microcontroller. So the number of pins required for information trade and backdrop illumination control contracts from ~10 to 2, diminishing IOs for other testing errands. Moreover, Grove - LCD RGB Backlight underpins user characterized characters. In my work, it is basically used to display the live temperature information with the green colour and once when the temperature rises above the threshold value it changes it colour to red and starts blinking. Similarly it displays the state of the rider. In case if the rider meets with an accident it changes it colour to red and starts blinking. Specifications Vcc Voltage: 5V I/O Voltage: 3.3/5V Operating Current<60mA CGROM: 10880 bit CGRAM: 64*8 bit Colorful RGB Backlight Built-in English and Japanese fonts I2C communication, uses only two IOs Automatic power-on reset   Peltier Module Peltier is a  thermoelectric effect (TEE) device where thermal properties can be controlled using electrical signal. Basically there are two effects they are : Peltier effect Seebeck effect TE coolers, TE heaters and heat pumpers are all the devices that work on TEE and all these devices are referred to as the Peltier Effect. Peltier device is not a heat absorber. Rather it’s a heat driver. The heat that is driven out from the cooler side is accumulated on the hotter side of the device and it has to be debauched in one or the other way. Otherwise the device the device may tend to stop working and it may tend to increase the temperature at the cooler side which is practically not feasible.[Wiki] Heat Sink The heat dropper has to be taken as an essential part of the pettier device for cooling purpose. All its performance distinctiveness of the Peltier module change as the utility of the heat dropper temperature. Hence the ultimate heat droppers should have a capability of sponging in unlimited quantity of heat exclusive of increasing the device temperature. In general, we need to consider a heat dropper that can soak up the entire residual heat of the device and help in not increasing the temperature above the acceptable point. Hence in practice we can use a heat dropper that can increase the temperature of the device in the series of 5 to 15 ºC higher than the bearable temperature that is sensible. Operating Voltage: Utmost 13.5V. Voltage can be in both the directions. The only change is that the face that will rise in temperature or cool in temperature. Rating: Utmost 4.4 amps Power: Utmost 36 watts Temperature change: Utmost 59ºC at the normal temperature of 30ºC and with no stack. Number of p-n junctions: 127 Footprint: 4 cm x 4 cm Thickness: 4mm Weight: 28 grams Module Factory Number: TEC1-12704 The ground of the Peltier module is connected to one contact of the relay. When the temperature sensor reaches the threshold value set say 30ºC then the sensor will trigger the MCU to supply power to the grove relay switch and hence completing the circuit and allowing the base current to flow and hence switching the Peltier module to start cooling inside the helmet and hence providing the comfortable temperature for the rider. Design Block Diagram     Intel Edison will be connected with a pelting module through transistor as a switch. Peter is a temperature cooling solution that is driven by a 12v power supply. The supply will be given by a 12v battery pack. The ground of the poultice will be connected to one of the input of the grove relay. When the MCU provides supply to the relay and triggers it. This will activate pettier and trigger cooling. MCU will keep monitoring temperature through Grove temperature measurement sensor. When the inside temperature is high, the poultice will be activated using the method mentioned in step2. MCU will be integrated with Cloud through MQTT IoT gateway. Rider’s mobility will be integrated with the cloud using MQTT gateway. The mobile will keep on tracking the GPS data which will be sent back to Google cloud to obtain Civic Address for the latitude, longitude GPS data. MCU will keep tracking of the impact through Grove vibration sensor. In case of an accident, the sensor will generate a signal which will trigger a notification.GPS civic address with this notification will be pushed to the cloud. This can then mitigate the notification to Facebook/Twitter or any other channel through IFTTT gateway. Accelerometer will monitor the movement of the head. When the rider is looking at right/left for a long time, in helmet indicator can be triggered.     Circuit Schematic   Sequence Diagram Algorithm     Actor Edison

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Aug 6, 2016 at 3:21PM The past decade wasn't kind to AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), which ceded the x86 CPU market to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and lost the GPU market to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). AMD's CPUs and GPUs were cheaper, but they always seemed to lag behind Intel and Nvidia in terms of architecture and power efficiency. Image source: AMD investor presentation. Between 2005 and 2015, AMD's annual revenue dropped from $5.85 billion to $3.99 billion. During that same period, Intel's annual revenue rose 43% and Nvidia's revenue more than doubled. AMD lost nearly 70% of its market value over the past decade and went through three CEOs before Lisa Su took over in late 2014. But under Su, AMD recently scored a major victory during its second quarter by achieving its first period of annual sales growth since the second quarter of 2014. Sales rose 9% to $1.03 billion during the quarter, beating estimates by about $75 million. AMD expects that growth to continue with about 18% sales growth for the third quarter. That news lifted AMD stock to four-year highs. AMD survives by expanding into niche markets Over the past few years, AMD realized that attacking Intel and Nvidia head-on was futile, since both companies had superior cash flows and higher R&D and marketing budgets. Instead, AMD pivoted toward certain niche markets which its rivals had overlooked. In 2013, it scored design wins with Sony and Microsoft to respectively power the PS4 and Xbox One with its semi-custom APUs -- which combine the functions of a CPU and GPU on a single SoC (system on chip). It also supplied the GPU for Nintendo's Wii U, which effectively locked Nvidia out of the eighth generation of gaming consoles. All powered by AMD. Image source: Company websites. Sales of semi-custom SoCs for consoles became a pillar of growth for AMD's EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) business, which generated 58% of its sales last quarter. Revenue at the unit rose 5% annually and operating income more than tripled to $84 million. That growth offset an $81 million operating loss at its computing and graphics business. Looking ahead, the EESC business will likely get a boost from new updated consoles like Sony's PS4 Neo and Microsoft's Xbox One S and Scorpio. AMD also sees niche growth potential in data centers, a market which Intel dominates with its Xeon processors. Instead of competing against Intel with x86 CPUs for high-end servers, AMD has started shipping ARM licensed chips for lower-end servers. To complement that move, AMD formed a joint venture with Chinese firm THATIC earlier this year to develop SoCs for the Chinese server market. It also formed another joint venture with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics to expand its ATMP (assembly, test, mark, and pack) capabilities in China. AMD could benefit from the growth of virtual reality Tech M&A advisory firm Digi-Capital estimates that the fledgling virtual reality market could grow from practically nothing today to $30 billion by 2020. That growth could benefit AMD in two major ways. When the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive were launched earlier this year, consumers had to buy a $1,000 PC to use the headsets. Since the Rift costs $600 and the Vive costs $800, VR remained a hobby for rich tech enthusiasts instead of mainstream consumers. However, AMD recently lowered the price of VR-ready PCs considerably with its $200 RX 480, the cheapest VR-capable card on the market. Current PC builds using the RX 480 have reduced the price of a VR-ready PC to just $600. The Rift and Vive currently depend on the PC's GPU power, but companies will likely launch stand-alone headsets which aren't tethered to desktops in the near future. Like gaming consoles, these devices will run better on efficient semi-custom APUs instead of stand-alone CPUs and GPUs. AMD's market-dominating position in semi-custom APUs for consoles gives it a major advantage in this market. Don't call it a "turnaround" just yet... Posting 9% sales growth might not seem like a huge victory, but it's certainly AMD's biggest win of the year so far. However, investors shouldn't ignore three upcoming challenges that could derail AMD's turnaround. First, Nvidia's new GTX cards offer a lot of power for just a little more cash. The new GTX 1060, for example, offers better performance than the RX 480 for just $50 more. Second, AMD must prove that its Zen x86 chips, which will arrive at the end of the year, can effectively compete against Intel's upcoming Kaby Lake and stop the bleeding at its CPU business. Lastly, Nintendo has reportedly selected Nvidia's Tegra to power its upcoming NX console, which will likely arrive next March. If the NX is a surprise hit like the original Wii, it could hurt sales of the PS4 and Xbox One and AMD's EESC sales. I think AMD's outlook is improving, but I'd be hesitant to call it a "turnaround" until it can overcome those challenges. But if AMD's revenues can continue growing year-over-year for the next few quarters, it could be the start of a major comeback for the beaten-down chipmaker.   Leo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.

DragonFlyBSD 4.6 vs. Linux Benchmarks Written by Michael Larabel in Operating Systems on 6 August 2016. Page 1 of 4. 13 Comments With DragonFlyBSD 4.6 having been released this week, here are benchmarks comparing its performance to that of the previous DragonFlyBSD 4.4 release as well as seeing how it compares to some Linux distributions. The DragonFlyBSD 4.6 release premiered with NVMe PCI-E solid state drive support, significantly improved SMP performance, improved i915 DRM Intel graphics support, initial EFI booting support, new packages, and other changes. On an Intel Xeon E5 v3 Haswell system I did a clean stock install of DragonFlyBSD 4.6.0 and compared its out-of-the-box performance to DragonFlyBSD 4.4.3. In addition, on the same system its performance was compared to Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS, Ubuntu 16.10 in its current development form, and Intel's Clear Linux 9710 distribution. All of the tests were done on the same system (on the system table the CPU frequency differences just come down to boost vs. base clock frequency reporting and other reporting differences). DragonFlyBSD 4.6 ships with the GCC 5.3.1 compiler. All of the BSD/Linux distribution benchmarks carried out for this article were fully-automated using the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software. The tests for this article are mainly focused on CPU performance and all tests are built from source for the respective platform using the out-of-the-box compiler and OS settings.

By India Ashok August 6, 2016 05:10 BST Close Embed Feed Cyber Warfare: The Black Hole of Online Crime IBTimes UK <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/videos/embed/4103" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> Hackers have allegedly managed to get their hands on employee accounts of Google, Apple, Samsung and more tech firms, by hacking into a developer forum that is commonly used by developers for a variety of options, including computer design and game development. The data comes from the Khronos website. Employee accounts of other tech giants, including IBM, Panasonic, VMWare, EA, Toshiba, Intel, Sony Ericsson and more have also been reportedly stolen by the hackers. It is likely that the stolen data has been kept private among a group of hackers. According to a report by Motherboard, who was provided an SQL file of nearly 3,000 accounts for the breached Khronos site, the data exposed included email addresses, usernames, plaintext passwords, sign up IP addresses and dates, and in certain cases physical addresses. It is still unclear as to how many users have been affected by the breach. Although Khronos has been notified of the breach by Motherboard, the firm is yet to make an official statement either confirming or denying the breach. "Khronos Membership puts your company at the forefront of the development of these APIs, and lets you collaborate with over 100 industry-leading member companies across the globe," reads the company membership website. The email addresses and usernames of 18 accounts have been reportedly tested and found to be corresponding with the accounts on the breached site. The data dump included the exposed account of an unnamed renowned security researcher, who confirmed that details including sign-up date, password and IP address appeared to be accurate. It is still unclear as to how many users have been affected by the breachiStock Fortunately, unlike the layperson, most developers do not fall into the trap of password reuse. One victim of the breach told Motherboard that he generates unique passwords of every site with the help of a password manager. This means the hackers will not be able to use the passwords from the victim's stolen account to access his other accounts. However, most of the other passwords examined were reportedly found to be fairly weak and predictable. The breach is yet another reminder of the dangers posed by the practice of password reuse. Previous high-profile data breaches sustained by tech giants like LinkedIn, MySpace and others also saw how hackers can exploit users' habit of reusing passwords to hack into other accounts. Users have since been advised to abandon the practice and generate unique and strong passwords for each of their accounts and also activate two-factor authentication as an added security measure. IBTimes UK has reached out to Khronos Group for further comment on the breach and is awaiting a response.

Credit: Thinkstock More like this Upgrading to Windows 10 and questioning <i>The New York Times</i> 20 fixes for a Windows 10 update meltdown The shame of Windows Update Video Mingis on Tech: The MacBook Pro show-and-tell Installing bug fixes is a big part of Defensive Computing. When I recently updated devices running five different operating systems, I took the opportunity to compare how they installed their latest patches. The tests were run on July 27th. Hardware-wise, all the devices were old, but their software was reasonably up to date, lacking only the latest round of updates. All in all, it seemed like a fair fight. I cold booted each device and waited for it to settle down before updating the operating system. Typically a computer does some housekeeping when it first boots and/or when it first goes online. So, I let each device sit for a while. Then, on Windows and OS X, I updated Firefox to insure that the internet connection was working well. On iOS, I waited for the app store to phone home. It initially said that 5 apps needed to be updated, but after a short delay, upped that number to 31. On Chrome OS, I just waited a few minutes. In each case, the operating system update was the only thing the device was doing. Four devices used the same 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network with a very strong signal (they were in the same room as the router). The fifth device, a Windows 7 desktop, used Ethernet as that's all it had. Timings are reasonably accurate but I wasn't using a stopwatch. I tried to limit the updates to just the operating system, something that comes quite naturally in iOS and Chrome OS. Windows 7 and 8.1 offer this as an option, but I am not aware of any way to limit OS X. In my test, it also updated Safari, iTunes and a couple other applications.  THE PLAYERS The five tested devices were: 1. A 64 bit Windows 7 desktop PC running an Intel Core i5-3470 (3.2GHz) with 8GB of RAM and a mechanical hard drive connected via SATA III. It had last been updated on June 17, 2016. 2. A 32 bit Windows 8.1 tablet running an Intel Atom CPU model Z3745 (1.3GHz) with 2GB of RAM and a 32GB SanDisk SDW32G connected with an interface that Speccy calls "SD." It was last updated on June 25, 2016. 3. A first generation iPad Mini model MD531LL/A running iOS version 9.3.2. 4. A MacBook Air laptop dating back to November 2010 (model A1370). It's running an Intel Core 2 Duo (1.4GHz) with 2GB of RAM and OS X Yosemite version 10.10.5. 5. An Acer C710 Chromebook with 2GB of RAM, manufactured in May 2013. It was on the stable channel, running the 64 bit edition of Chrome OS version 51.0.2704.106, which has a build date of July 6, 2016. THE BAKE OFF Windows 7 has been plagued, for months, with OS updates that take forever to install. Sadly, this remains true, it took Windows 7 longer than any other system to install its bug fixes. Windows updates itself in two phases; first it figures out the missing bug fixes, then, in phase 2, it downloads and installs them. The first phase took 1 hour and 38 minutes to complete, by far, the slowest of the tested systems. The first phase found seven missing patches but defaulted to only installing six of them. For whatever reason, it opted not to install KB971033. The six patches totaled 74 megabytes, and it took 5 minutes to download and install them. The shutdown and reboot took 2 minutes. TOTAL TIME: 1 hour 45 minutes Windows 8.1 Windows 8.1 updated itself faster than Windows 7, even though the tablet hardware was far less powerful than the desktop system. Still, it was the second slowest device. The first update phase, determining the missing bug fixes took an hour and 6 minutes. The system needed 11 patches, totaling 199 megabytes. Phase 2, downloading and installing the patches, took 7 minutes. At one point in the reboot process, the screen was totally blank. Maybe it always does that, I don't use Windows 8 much and never paid particularly close attention.The shutdown and reboot took 3 minutes. TOTAL TIME: 1 hour 19 minutes iOS 9 Updating iOS 9 was a drastically different experience. As soon as the process started, the system already knew that it had to install version 9.3.3, and, how big the download would be. The process however, was the most confusing of the five systems. The early stages are confusing because it reports the status of the update in three different locations. The later stages are confusing because there is so little status information. It also tried to calculate a time estimate, but never did. The initial statuses were "Update requested" and "Downloading". Then, while it was still downloading, it was also in "Preparing update" status. Then a small white window was displayed but it disappeared before I could read what it said. After the download completed, one location reported that it was "installing" while another location reported that it was "verifying the update." Apple likes progress bars, but, for whatever reason, makes them very thin. So thin, it is hard to see the progress. It's not for lack of space, even with the screen mostly empty, the progress bar height is measured in molecules. And none of the progress bars were accompanied by a percentage, which just adds insult to the injury of barely being able to see them. At one point the screen went totally black, then a white apple appeared, then all black again. Then a white apple with a progress bar. Then the progress bar disappeared, then another progress bar appeared, but there was no progress for a while, it appeared to be hung. To paraphrase an old movie: Words? We don't need no stinking words.  Eventually there was movement on the latest progress bar, then it disappeared, leaving a black screen with white apple on it. Finally, the normal logon screen appeared for a few seconds, then the screen went black again.  From start to finish the process took 29 minutes. As I was finishing up this blog, Apple issued another iOS update, 9.3.4, which took me 23 minutes to install. AVERAGE TIME:  26 minutes OS X Yosemite Like iOS, Yosemite knew very quickly that it needed to install security update 2016-004. As noted earlier, I was unable to install just this update so it also downloaded and installed Safari, iTunes, Remote Desktop Client and something called SU_TITLE - 768 megabytes of software. I was able to ignore the updates to Pages, Keynote, Numbers, GarageBand and iPhoto. The download started quickly, but after about 600MB, it slowed down. The initial time estimate was 2 minutes but with 108MB to go, there were an estimated 6 minutes remaining. After downloading 734MB, it estimated that the remaining 34MB would take 2 minutes.  I don't think that the slowdown was on my end. When the download started, the MacBook had the Wi-Fi network all to its own. During the download, the Windows 8 tablet downloaded its 199MB payload very quickly. Even after the Windows 8 tablet was done, the MacBook download continued to crawl. In the end, it took 18 minutes to download the 768 megabytes. After rebooting, the system estimated that it would take 7 minutes to install the new software. There was a progress bar and a time estimate that continued to adjust. Nice. Then, another reboot and yet another progress bar. The initial estimate was pretty good, installing the software and rebooting took 8 minutes. After all this, the system was still running version 10.10.5, which I found puzzling. I'm not a Mac user, this may be normal, but I wondered if something had gone wrong. A little poking around (Apple icon -> About This Mac -> System Report.. button) turned up a System Information report that includes a log of software installations. The log confirmed that Security Update 2016-004 had just been installed, so OS X loses brownie points for not fully indicating the operating system version. Both iOS and Chrome OS display an operating system version number that increases when the OS is updated, which, to me, seems like a better approach. The log also showed that the MacBook was at a dis-advantage in this contest. The previously installed Security Update was 2016-002 so this was the only device missing two rounds of bug fixes. And, it showed that along with the Security Update, it also installed Safari 9.1.2, iTunes 12.4.2, Remote Desktop Client Update 3.8.5.1 and the mysterious SU_TITLE which has no version number (more points deducted).  TOTAL TIME:  26 minutes Chrome OS The transparency of software updates is, to me, one of the best things about Chrome OS. End users are not asked or told anything about updating any software. It just works. That said, Chromebook users can opt into the bug fix game if they want.  To kick off a software update, run the browser and do: Help -> About Chrome OS and then click on the "Check for and apply updates" button. In my test, the check for updates took seconds, then it transitioned to "Updating your device..." During this phase it displays a completion percentage, but offers neither a time estimate (hat tip to OS X) nor an indication of how how much data is being downloaded. When the completion percentage hit 100% it sat there for a bit before telling me to "Restart your device to finish updating." At this point the black upward pointing arrow (the standard indication that a reboot is needed) also appeared in its usual spot on the bottom right of the screen. Unlike the other OSs, when Chrome OS reboots to install new software, it is a standard, ordinary restart. There is no warning not to turn off the computer as in Windows. There is no non-standard user interface as in OS X and iOS. There is no progress bar. It tells the end user nothing. It just reboots. As noted earlier, the system started out at version 51.0.2704.106 (Help -> About Chrome OS from the browser). After the update, it was running version 52.0.2743.85. A nice thing about Chrome OS is that it also assigns a date to the operating system. The "About" page has a "more info..." link that when clicked shows the Build Date of the system. I started with a system that was built on July 6, 2016 and ended with one built on July 21, 2016. The date is a bit more hidden than I would like, but still, Chrome OS is the only system that provides dates. TOTAL TIME:  4 minutes BAKE-OFF OBSERVATIONS The Windows devices had a hardware advantage, not that it mattered. To recap the timings: Chrome OS took 4 minutes, OS X Yosemite took 26, iOS 9 needed 29 minutes the first time and 23 minutes the second, Windows 8.1 took an hour and 19 minutes, and Windows 7 needed an hour and 45 minutes. I think it's fair to say that Chrome OS does the best job of self-updating. Not only is it fast, but it's also automated far beyond any other system. It is so automated, that it doesn't have to tell the end user anything. Chromebook users are not even aware that software is being updated - a small black arrow is the only user interface for software updates, and it can be ignored without penalty. I like that the version number of the operating system increases as updates are installed and it's the only OS that assigns itself a date in human readable format. Finally, Chrome OS auto-updates everything, the operating system, extensions, plug-ins and, yes, Flash too. It is the gold standard for software updating.  FLASH The Adobe Flash Player, while not part of any operating system, is a thorn in the side of many. It may well be the most dangerous software in the world, considering both how buggy and how widespread it is.  Flash is not an issue on iOS, which offers no support, or Chrome OS, which auto-updates it, but on Windows and OS X, it's a mess. Windows 8 and 10 will at least update Flash along with the operating system, but just for Microsoft's browsers. OS X however, is totally hands off. In my test, even the just-updated Safari browser was still using an old version of Flash.  On both Windows and OS X, the Defensive Computing approach is to limit Flash to the Chrome browser, which both auto-updates it and tries to disable its use in advertisements.  Related: Apple Mac Apple iOS Chrome OS Windows PCs Apple Google Microsoft 1 2 Page 1 Next 12 steps to lower your espionage risk Shop Tech Products at Amazon You Might Like Notice to our Readers We're now using social media to take your comments and feedback.

View Latest Posts >>> NEO – Don’t Cry For Me in Aleppo By Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor on August 6, 2016 by Jim W. Dean, VT Editor  … with New Eastern Outlook, Moscow “Just societies cannot be run by big money or armed forces with their too narrow agendas.” ~ Plato The Western-supported rebels have rained their “barrel bombs” down on the Aleppo civilians [ Note: The media fraud on the Syrian War is reaching hysterical levels as the Aleppo and Manjbi battles are turning against the rebels. When there is nothing good to report, we see the terrorist supporters dragging out the age-old Damascus “barrel bomb” stories and the predictable “gas attack”. The Russians held their media response fire until they could review all of their Intel on the gas attack, and then confirmed it had come from a US-rebel supported area. That is why I used the gas canister images. If you google that phrase with Aleppo, you will come up with a mass of photos, as the jihadis love showing themselves using this indiscriminate weapon on government-held areas. The rebel “barrel bombs” have literally been raining down on government-held areas with almost zero coverage in the Western press because it did not fit the narrative they were trying to imprint upon us. Corporate media pushing the rebels and jihadis as the good guys is one of the biggest media frauds in history, including no real denunciation from any of the media trade groups. Rebel “mobile artillery” We see this over and over, where from the big veteran to religious denominations, our big civic organizations have stood down, while watching this ongoing fraud like it was none of their business. As for the news unions, they have just been pitiful. All they had to do was have monthly, one-day work stoppages, with demands for “content investigations” to spotlight compromising of major media at the highest levels, and the public would have rallied around them. It is safe to conclude that no one had the stomach for it, including the retired senior people who could have more safely taken the leadership roles. Even at VT, despite the quiet “keep up the good work” atta-boys we get from many individuals inside the matrix, the institutional support has been zero. They are too scared to even talk to us, afraid they would end up on a list. This is how low American leadership has sunk. When the public sees so many others “faking it”, with no career blowback consequences, then resistance is viewed as a sucker’s game. But we would never swap places with them, despite all the good-life, side benefits on the table for the sellouts… JD ] ____________ US coalition approved terror shelling – First published  …  August 06,  2016 – The battle for Aleppo does not look it will end well for the rebels and jihadis who have held the city for four years, living off the looting of the houses and businesses of Damascus supporters who long ago fled the city with just a car and a few suitcases.  What will remain of Aleppo when it is over? I met one of these émigrés during the Damascus Counter Terrorism Conference in December of 2015. She was one of the Veterans Today team’s guides and interpreters. Her manufacturing family had fourteen diversified, medium-sized businesses in Aleppo before the war, but lost them all, with the equipment and inventory loaded onto trucks and taken to Turkey to enrich the army of parasites that have fed off the Syrian War. I don’t call the Syrian struggle a civil war, as that would give cover for the international geopolitical hoodlums who used Syria as an example of what could happen to those would not submit to their domination. As with most all the “color revolutions”, they used local assets as the cannon fodder, but the upheaval was foreign-inspired, while trained and supported by various countries and business interests seeking to profit from a future Balkanized Syria. The Syrian Army and its allies have finally surrounded the rebel and jihadi forces in their Eastern Aleppo stronghold and brought that battle to what may be its final resolution. An extra bonus in following the news coverage has been seeing how the international anti-Syrian media has launched its own final battle to smear Damascus and the Syrian Army for doing what an elected government and loyal army is supposed to do… defend the country. The VT team (middle four) at the Damascus Counter-Terrorism Conference on Dec. 6, 2014 In Syria’s case the fight has not only been with traditional opposition rebels, but also Western and NATO countries teamed up with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey to carve Syria into spheres of influence, in a classic throwback to the old colonial days. When that did not work, the Western and Gulf State Intel agencies unleashed a large-scale terror war against the Syrian people to help tip the scales in their favor − and it almost worked. But the above-mentioned scoundrels had another institutional helper in their dirty deed. Western media became the Syria-busters’ PR weapon to keep the Assad regime and its supporters under constant assault. Running a multi-year proxy terrorist regime change operation required a steady smokescreen operation, and I have had a front row seat watching it reach its peak during the current Aleppo battle. Over the past ten days, I was able to do a number of TV interviews, including two Debate Show features with Press TV, with opponents who were anti-Assad regime boosters. The first was a professor from John Hopkins University in Washington, Daniel Serwer, where the topic was Battle for Aleppo. The second Debate Show a few days later was on Assad’s amnesty offer for the Aleppo rebels. Jim Dean and Prof. Serwer go head to head Both of these guys were walking propaganda delivery boys using the same talking points that most of the anti-Assad faction had had emailed to them by their minders. Prof. Serwer seemed to have been assigned to caste Assad as being responsible for the 400,000 deaths from the Syrian War, barrel bombing, and of course all the hospitals he claims were blown up on purpose. He even claimed that the Russia air wing was also responsible for some of these, a black lie because Russian Air Command caught the French Doctors without Borders putting out a bogus story of like eight or nine of them bombed over a few days, but where research later showed that most of the towns mentioned did not even have hospitals. Briefing and Q&A by the governor of Homs province, Talal al-Barazi with election monitors, June 03, 2014 (Photo credit: Jim W. Dean Archives) Prof. Serwer would not acknowledge that Aleppo was being liberated, but was “a conquest by an autocracy”. This outrageous statement ignored two elections, where Assad was reelected by a huge majority. One election I attended as an election monitor in 2014 in the city of Homs, where I visited five polling stations where we had free rein to interview whomever we wanted, which included the governor, Tala Barazi. The event was as much a celebration for Assad and the Army keeping the country from being taken over by the Western and Gulf State-backed jihadi terrorists as it was a political event. My second Debate show opponent was a Michael Lane, who was supposed to be the founder of a think tank-sounding entity called the American Institute for Foreign Policy, founded in 2004. A quick Google of both came up with absolutely nothing on the Institute, and nothing on Lane, other than his Press TV shows. He had the profile of a planted talking head, where his public background had been cleaned off the internet. And talk he did, about how Assad’s amnesty offer could not be trusted, describing it as an “unverified offer”. I countered with the long record we already have on numerous Assad amnesties which have worked just fine, where many of the takers were incorporated into the civil defense units. Lane was also selling how humanitarian effort could easily have succeeded if the Syrian Army had stepped back and allowed the UN to handle it all. I again countered that the UN could not do that in the middle of a big battle without the Syrian Army having to be tied up providing it with security from car, truck and suicide bombers to block the rebels’ human shields from getting out of the city. The mysterious Michael Lane (R) and his think tank that does not show up on Google We also have the track record that during the initial ceasefire, the West, Turkey and Saudi Arabia poured in more reinforcements, ammo and new weapons, like the TOWS and MANPADS, which were then used to support counter attacks all over Syria. Corporate media has also shown its true colors on Aleppo coverage. The Guardian actually had an editorial whose purpose seemed to be an effort to save the surrounded rebels and jihadis by pressuring Syria to stop the battle. The UN could pump in all the food and supplies for the civilians, while the rebels could get resupplied by their various sponsors to later launch more counter attacks. The strategy is to continue undermining Assad via endless war, regardless of how many lives are destroyed. The Guardian pulled out all the stops to paint the worst picture possible: “It would not just be a defeat for the rebels, perhaps an irreversible defeat for the uprising – it would be the beginning of a new, humanitarian catastrophe of unprecedented proportions in Syria…International pressure must be put on Russia to force Syrian troops to retreat, so that lives can be saved…Its machine of repression makes no distinction whatsoever between armed combatants and civilians.” British media has been “in the bag” for a long time The Guardian editors appear to have gotten an assignment from British Intelligence to try to put lipstick on a pig. I had predicted during one of my Debate Shows that the Aleppo jihadis would attack the humanitarian corridors to scare their human shield civilians from taking that path, and within a day they were doing car bomb attacks and shelling the corridors. The rebels have been counter attacking Syrian lines in an effort to open up their own supply corridors. It is they who have refused to join the peace process via a political solution, as they bet that their backers would continue to keep them in the fight during the phone ceasefire. Turkey’s coup may have been the tipping point for a change in Erdogan wanting to concentrate all of his resources on the home front and ease out of the Syrian conflict. His main war aim now seems to be in taking on the international Gulen organization and its main sponsor, the U.S. But Erdogan seems unpredictable now, with his attempt to blackmail the EU with his demand for a visa regime by October or he would reopen the refuge floodgates. This is hardly a predictable situation by any means, especially when we see Russia-Turkey relations being normalized, something that began before the coup; and some say this may have had an effect on its timing, as Erdogan has now openly charged the CIA and FBI with supporting the coup. The rebels shooting down a Russian relief helicopter returning to base might have put a wooden stake through their hearts. They will now be met with cold resolve. Assad and the Russians know that the rebels and Jihadis have nothing to fight for when they have lost Aleppo, and their backers will abandon them. Gone will be the Saudis’ dream of an energy pipeline to the Mediterranean and onward to Europe. Gone will be the dream of an autonomous rebel region that might want to someday host US military bases or even NATO in Damascus’ rear and block Iranian-Russian flights through Iraq. The Russian cruise missile strikes from the Caspian Sea launches have not been forgotten, neither the importance of having friendly and safe ground to fly over when projecting military power. That is why the US coalition wants to keep its rebel forces in control of Aleppo. Jim W.

FaceBook Comments 22 Responses to "NEO – Don’t Cry For Me in Aleppo" Worker Bee  August 6, 2016 at 6:29 pm Some big picture questions. If Syria had nuclear armed cruise missiles that could hit Ankara, Riyadh, and Tel Aviv, would this war have happened? If the answer is no, that seems to be a way to start of a nuclear arms race with only losers in the long run. A related question is, what price beyond money already spent will the US/NATO, Saudi, Turkey, and Israel pay for doing this to Syria? If the answer is nothing, no war crimes trials for leaders, and not even paying for rebuilding Syria, there is no incentive for them to not repeat this action in other countries again and again. Log in to Reply Cold Wind  August 6, 2016 at 2:20 pm I make no bones about it. I’m rooting for Assad and the Syrian Army and I hope they crush the “rebels” in Aleppo real soon. It’ll be a good day for me when it happens. My mood will only have been tempered by all the destruction, pain and suffering the “rebels” inflicted on Syrians and for (truth be told) Israel’s sake. Isn’t Israel the reason why the US is in Syria at all? Yep, it’ll be a great day to see the “rebels” wiped out. I say give them no quater! Wipe them out! Log in to Reply Edward Longshanks  August 6, 2016 at 2:26 pm No, greater Israel is a virtuell enterprise. The war in Syria is based on a pipeline from Qatar to the Mediterrean and to destroy the secularized regimes in the Orient and North-Africa, to support the US$ and to get an argument for permanent war. Edward Longshanks  August 6, 2016 at 11:07 am I have to confirm that the Spiegel yesterday’s and today’s reports about Aleppo are miserable as never before. By failure today’s report mentioned the first time in an accessory sentence the support of ISIS via Turkish routes. Such a mistake in German Bolshewik controlled media shows the effect of losing ground by the US in the Levante. German Massmedia still states that the gas is used by Assad, in spite of the fact that US officials already corrected this blame. Log in to Reply Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor  August 6, 2016 at 11:17 am Our German readers tell us that German media is more in the bag than in the US…that like Britain the Intel people have a lock on anything they want a lock on, or it is “publish at your own risk time”, and everyone knows what that means there. Edward Longshanks  August 6, 2016 at 12:16 pm No doubts on that. Two small points to add. The system Germans tend to a typical German kind of character, the preemptive obedience. At second, different from the US, in Europe a regime change means the same, as in Turkey and Poland now. The politicians fear to lose their well paid jobs, so they panic and fail in political polarization. Ramirez  August 6, 2016 at 10:09 am Jim I had the misfortune of catching a C4 news report where they sent a camera crew into Aleppo with two Syrian(?) doctors. They were in a car with them and at one point they stopped driving as they were supposedly in a place where the SAA were dropping barrel bombs. You heard a noise that did not sound explosive and the reporter said ” Oh that was just a small barrel bomb” Then they basically arrived at work. Log in to Reply joetv  August 6, 2016 at 9:47 am Why does it bother me when ISIS, Al queda, and others are identified as the rebels? The term “rebel” lends legitimacy to them. Is this an actual revolt of Syrian citizens? A more accurate description of Syrian opposition is Criminals, or International Theives. Either term would be more accurate. Can I define a burglar as a “moderate trespasser”? What can we call a murderer? How about “interrupter”. “Mr. Smith’s life was interrupted last night when…” Not so bad right? Much more relaxing.

It is reaching epic propotions. I fear this fight is so important to the West that they will do anything, including WW3 to win. Like Israel with their Sampson option platform of, if we go down everyone does. For the West this is truly too big to fail. The truth has been obfuscated to the point where the average Joe doesn’t trust any media. Our senses are battered. We are almost senseless. How else to explain mass apathy. I have chosen firms like VT to get the facts. I think I’m right. Mr. Dean don’t ever waiver. “Who Let The Dogs Out”? Log in to Reply NotAVeteran2  August 6, 2016 at 8:55 am Is ‘war’ really picking up some kind of (semi) automatic machine gun, Step around the corner, fire your gun aimlessly in the street, to be taken out by a headshot? Is ‘war’ really taking cover behind your squad member with the RPG, Just in time to get your head blown off by the blow back? (or whatever you call it) Is ‘war’ really loading up a little van with thin metal plating, then drive straight up to a small convoy to be outnumbered 3:1, just to be dead, with a mout full of sand 20 minutes later? Log in to Reply NotAVeteran2  August 6, 2016 at 8:57 am I know nothing of war. But I do know that if I would find myself in one, this would not be the way I would fight it. I kind of like living. So after seeing footage such as I mentioned, I can only conclude… I’m not sure what is going on there, but a war it is not. NotAVeteran2  August 6, 2016 at 10:49 am Yes as in, “It happens”. No as in “F-ing stupid thing to do” Right? Other things that bother me after watching videos of private contractors and things like: v=WYJ_O1rCRU8 So, you are stuck on a roof or in a ditch in a sand colored world. There’s a lot of shots being fired, in a “general direction” sort of way. You can not see where you are shooting or who is shooting you. Then you decide to take a peak using: A black gun, black binoculars, a black cap, a black vest. I guess those things can not be made in sand color? Or maybe surviving the thing is not a top prio? NotAVeteran2  August 6, 2016 at 8:54 am First, I know nothing of war. I, nor my father, have ever been in a war, yet: Whenever I see footage on the fighting in Syria, I think by myself: “Is that really how you fight a war?” Is ‘war’ really a lot of standing around in groups, waiting to load up a barrel and then shoot it off in some indiscriminate direction? Log in to Reply NotAVeteran2  August 6, 2016 at 9:31 am I am hoping for the same, though I am not sure that living in the cradle of the ‘Builderburg Meetings’ is any sort of help. When WW3 hits, I might survive the initial onslaught, but any blowback might turn this 270*150 KM piece of land (and me included) into dust. Well, no more worries then at least. Edward Longshanks  August 6, 2016 at 11:35 am I know nothing of war, too. But i asked. One of my grandfathers was with 17 years in Belgium hanging on a ballon to steer the German artillery, he was often attacked by Bristish double-decker warplanes. He had to see all those casualities in modern warfare, he never could get over it. In WW2, above 40 years, he served as a guard on different places. My other Grandfather served as a ambulanceman in Russia for a company, which chased partisans behind the front till 1942, with his 5th child born, he served at home as a police officer, it happend on a Führerbefehl. The Russian people, in occupied Russian territory by the Germans, feared more the Bolshewik commissars, most of them jews, than the SS. The Germans, concerned to symetric warfare, were not really successful against the partisans. Later on they used russian entities like the Vlassov army against the partisans. These guys simply annihilated villages and towns, whith those measures they stopped partisan warfare. But today nobody is going for symetric warfare anymore, because the enemy is always the US army in joystick combat. What VT and southfront publish are pictures of asymetric warfare. I owwn an private interview with a German panzerman, bearer of the Knight’s Cross of the Iron Cross, in German, i could provide it for you via VT, if you want it. He describes his involvement in the battles in France, Africa, Yugoslavia, Russia and Berlin. Codoh  August 6, 2016 at 8:50 am Sadly the situation doesnt look good on the ground. After Castello fell to the Syrian army, the terror zombies took over south Aleppo and are close to opening up a supply line there. Basically they traded supply routes…And apparently they lost hundreds of in that offensive. Either way….the fight for Aleppo is far from over…lets hope for the best here…Russians should fire their toys now when the situation demands it, not on some remote Zombie warehouse thats not exactly important… Log in to Reply Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor  August 6, 2016 at 11:12 am “the fight for Aleppo is far from over”.. Amen on that. Let us hope that the Syrian and Russian command has anticipate this strategy of the rebel counter attacks and is geared up to concentrate firepower to destroy them when they concentrate for their attacks. This is also combat taking place outside of the city so they can use air power and artillery, which with drones as spotters they should be able to deal with “fluid” situations, the toughest fight to use artillery in.

The Speed Of Ubuntu 16.10 Currently Versus Ubuntu 16.04, Clear Linux Written by Michael Larabel in Ubuntu on 6 August 2016 at 08:41 AM EDT. Add A Comment Being mid-way through Ubuntu 16.10's development cycle, here are some fresh benchmarks showing how its performance has changed (if at all) compared to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS as well as compared to Intel's high-performance Clear Linux distribution as a reference point. Over Ubuntu 16.04, the current Ubuntu 16.10 images have GCC 6.1.1 as a big difference for the tests being built from source. Right now Ubuntu 16.10 is still relying upon a Linux 4.4 based kernel while Linux 4.8 will end up being used by the Yakkety Yak in October. Ubuntu 16.10 also has Mesa 12.0.1, but no graphics tests were done for this article since the card running in this system was the GTX 770 with less than ideal Nouveau driver performance. Intel's CLear Linux meanwhile has the Linux 4.7 kernel, GCC 6.1, and LLVM Clang 3.8.1. A larger Linux/BSD comparison on this same system is currently being worked on. Clear Linux continues leading over Ubuntu in many benchmarks. Part of the reason is Clear Linux ships with many optimized compiler flags by default compared to Ubuntu and many other distributions. GCC 6 seems to help some tests over GCC 5 on Ubuntu 16.04. There are a few upsets. In some tests there isn't much of a performance difference. See more of these benchmark results via this OpenBenchmarking.org result file while staying tuned for a larger Linux/BSD comparison on this system.

The photos show a variety of weapons, ammunition, communications gear and accessories. Perhaps the most chilling image is a closeup of someone holding two ID cards belonging to a U.S. soldier, Spc. Ryan Jay Larson.   #ISIS 'Amaq posted photos of documents and gear of #American soldiers allegedly taken by ISIS fighters in #Nangarhar pic.twitter.com/UDat7qOFvX— SITE Intel Group (@siteintelgroup) August 6, 2016 It's unclear when the photographs were taken and what precisely transpired, although there are no reports of any American military personnel having been captured, said Henrietta Levin, a Defense Department spokeswoman. "We are aware of erroneous reports that U.S. Army Specialist Ryan Jay Larson was captured by ISIL in Afghanistan," Levin said, referring to one the Islamic State group's other monikers. "These reports are false. He has been accounted for and remains in a duty status within his unit. We are looking into how he lost possession of his ID but can confirm he has been accounted for with his unit.‎" Levin provided no additional details about the photographs and declined to address several questions submitted by Military Times. A White House official referred questions to the Defense Department. The images were shared on social media Saturday by the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors ISIS and other terrorist organizations. SITE indicated that the photos were originally published by the Islamic State group's Amaq news agency after ISIS fighters confiscated the equipment and documents in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province. American special operations troops are operating in Nangarhar province, which borders Pakistan. The region has become a stronghold for the estimated 1,000 to 1,500 ISIS militants in Afghanistan. Most are believed to be disaffected Taliban who were forced out of Pakistan.   In late July, five American troops were wounded there during separate engagements with ISIS fighters, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Army Gen. John Nicholson, said recently. The Americans were accompanying a group of Afghan troops on what Nicholson described as a clearing mission intended to help the Afghans reclaim territory lost to ISIS. None of the injuries was life threatening, Nicholson said. It's not immediately clear how ISIS came into possession of equipment that was photographed. But it's fairly substantial, said Fred Galvin, a retired Marine Corps officer who led a special operations unit in Nangarhar province in 2007.  Among the items is a M72 single-shot rocket launcher and a spare barrel for an M240 machine gun. There are 40mm grenades, a hand grenade and smoke grenades, and numerous 5.56mm rifle rounds and bigger 7.62mm rounds, which are fired from M240s and sniper rifles. There's a ruck sack, some body armor, knee pads, eye goggles, gauze, tourniquets and other medical supplies, a multiband radio and flex cuffs used to detain bad guys. Some of the gear appears to be standard issue, Galvin said, while other items are used only by "more advanced" military units. An American flag appears in one of the images. "From the looks of all of this," Galvin said, "it appears [the perpetrators] may have hit a fixed position. Maybe they ran across an observation post, or a site where guys were sleeping, bedding down. You can't tell 100 percent. But it does look like someone was caught in a hasty attack. If they knew they were going to be attacked like that, they would have been wearing their body armor." The volume and variety of items could suggest the Americans were forced to leave it behind — quite possibly in a hurry.  The radio is most concerning, said Shawn Snow, a Marine Corps veteran who served as a signals intelligence analyst during multiple tours to Afghanistan and Iraq. It's a PRC-148, also known as the Multiband Inter/Intra Team Radio, or MBITR. "It's one of the most commonly used portable radio systems employed by coalition and NATO forces. If ISIS has captured several of these radios, it would provide them with deadly capabilities," Snow said, noting the device was developed by U.S. Special Operations Command during the 1990s. "Usually, the Taliban communicates on a simple push-to-talk walkie talkie. These radios are very easy for coalition forces to intercept, providing timely indications and warnings of pending attacks. If ISIS has several of these MBITR radios, it could provide them with the ability to escape detection and interception through its programmable cryptologic function and frequency hopping abilities. "Even a small command and control node could do considerable damage being able to operate undetected with little to no warning. It would also provide them with extended range over their small hand held Chinese made radios."  ISIS is hoping to capitalize on this propaganda, Galvin surmised. He cautioned, however, that until there's confirmation from the Pentagon, it's impossible to know for sure whether this is a legit score for the enemy.  "Americans have been in Nangarhar for years," he added. "All of that equipment could have been bought in a local bazar. It's possible this is just a deception operation. 'Hey look. We attacked them. We destroyed them.' It could be a complete ruse."

Colm Willis, who won the Republican candidate nomination for Oregon in the May US Primary elections recently took a break with his family to visit his ancestral home in Knockacullion, Aghacashel. Colm's parents Tom and Mary, along with his cousin Bridie Reynolds (nee Boyle) and her husband Dennis, own the homestead in Knockacullion and the area remains an important part of his family's heritage. “I have lived in Oregon all my life but my great-grandfather, Jimmy Skinnon, came from Leitrim. He left school at just 10 and came to work on the docks of New York,” said Colm. Jimmy's daughter was brought up in New York, married and, with her husband, started a Ford dealership following WWII. Her son, Colm's father, Tom, went to Harvard Business school and eventually worked for Intel. “So for my family it has been a story of coming to another country, coming as my great-grandfather did, with just a 5th grade education and then, through the generations, taking advantage of opportunities and seeing success. For Jimmy coming to America it was a chance to come to America and live the dream and we, his descendents, have built on that,” he said. Acknowledging that his family had no previous involvement in politics, Colm explains that his interest stemmed from his first job after college where he worked for the Joint Economic Committee in May 2008. “I got hired just as the economy crashed and I saw leaders of both parties (Republican and Democrat) giving money to big lobby groups . I became very disillusioned and I left after about a year,” he explained. However, after he married, his wife Joan and became the father of two little girls, Ainne and Roisin, Colm says that his interest in politics was rekindled. He describes America as the “most free place in the world” and says that their political system reflects this freedom with anyone able to put themselves forward and very little, to Irish eyes, restrictions on what can be spent or said during election campaigns. “People say to me, “why don't they (those in charge) stop people from saying and doing things in the election, that they find outrageous, but the reality is that there is no 'they' running things. People have the freedom to say and do what they want and that is something we, as Americans, believe is important, freedom.” Colm's home town in Oregon is part of a large farming district and crops such as blueberries, hazelnuts, hops and pinot noir wine grapes are all grown in this area. Another big issue is the timer industry and, in particular, the impact of conservation on the industry and the job losses resulting from reduced harvesting. “Harvesting was a major source of funding for our police force and our education system. When harvesting declined so did our funds. The Federal Government said they would give us direct payments to make up the loss but in the last five years they are cutting payments and a lot of counties are struggling to fund their police and education systems,” he said. He acknowledges that immigration remains a key issue in America. “For our voters the question is not about the immigrants themselves, it is about our leaders in Congress and how they have failed to deal with the issues surrounding immigration,” he explains. “People are very disillusioned with how immigration has been dealt with. The fact is that most Americans are descended from immigrants and when they look back at the way their families came through Ellis Island, the health checks and suitability checks they went through to come into America, and now, we have a situation where people are being let into the country without any of this checks. “People want a proper structure in place so we know who is coming into our country and why.” Colm will be seeking election to Congress in November and, if successful, will take up a two year term in Congress. In Oregon, voters won't take to the polls like they do here in Ireland, instead, voting is done by postal vote. While voting in the US, as in Ireland, isn't compulsory, Americans typically have a much higher turnout for elections (70-80%), something Colm attributes to a tradition of much stronger involvement in the political system for the average American. And if he is elected? “My hope is to fight for the people in West Oregon. To fight for the values, for jobs and to be a true advocate for the people,” he said. However he says that Ireland, and in particular Co Leitrim, will always hold a special place for his family and himself. “I was brought up with a strong love for Ireland. I play the flute, I went to the Gaeltacht twice growing up, I learned set dancing and I have visited here often throughout my life “This is the place we can always come back to , a place to remember the love and sacrifice so many made through the generations for us. People like my great-grandfather Jimmy, who left with the hope that his children could have a better life, could be free,” he said. “The people of Ireland are the guardians of that legacy, that history and love of Ireland and every time I come home I feel a part of that.” Leave your comment Share your opinions on Text Characters left: 1500   Digital newsstand Our latest editions exactly as they are printed Buy edition Browse edition The late Ryan Doyle.

He isn't as well known as the other computer creators of his generation but now the Computer History Museum has made available for download part of the draft he had intended as the basis of a book.   Gary Kildall (1942-1994) Gary Kildall, the creator of the CP/M operating system, died unexpectedly in 1994, at the young age of 52. having never published an autobiography. He had, however, distributed copies of a Christmas, 1993 Edition of a memoir titled “Computer Connections: People, Places, and Events in the Evolution of the Personal Computer Industry” to family and friends, noting that it would "go to print  in final form early next year, apparently under the auspices of Osborne-McGraw Hill".  Ownership of that manuscript passed to Gary’s children, Scott and Kristin who have now given permission for the Computer History Museum to make the first portion publicly available along with previously unpublished family photos.  In their introduction Scott and Kristin Kildall write: “Our father, Gary Kildall, was one of the founders of the personal computer industry, but you probably don’t know his name. Those who have heard of him may recall the myth that he “missed” the opportunity to become Bill Gates by going flying instead of meeting with IBM. Unfortunately, this tall tale paints Gary as a “could-have-been”, ignores his deep contributions, and overshadows his role as an inventor of key technologies that define how computer platforms run today. Gary viewed computers as learning tools rather than profit engines. His career choices reflect a different definition of success, where innovation means sharing ideas, letting passion drive your work and making source code available for others to build upon. His work ethic during the 1970s resembles that of the open-source community today. With this perspective, we offer a portion of our father’s unpublished memoirs so that you can read about his experiences and reflections on the early days of the computer industry, directly in his own voice. The excerpt consists of the first seven chapters of the memoir, 78 pages in all documenting his early experience with computers while at the University of Washington, through his time as a professor at the Naval Postgraduate School and as a consultant for Intel and creating PL/M - Programming Language for Microcomputers, a breahthrough which used compiler technology up to the early days of Digital Research (DR), the start up he established with his wife, Dorothy.     A chapter is devoted to CP/M and in the next one we learn how lasting contribution to computer technology came about due to Glenn Ewing, one of Kildall's graduate student's needing to produce a disk operating system in a hurry: Glenn came to my tool shed computer room in 1975, so we could "adapt" CP/M to the IMSAI hardware. What this means is that I would rewrite the parts of CP/M that manage things like diskette controllers and CRTs. Well. come on, I'd already done this so many times that the tips of my fingers were wearing thin, so I designed a general interface, which I called the BIOS (BASIC I/0 System) that a good programmer could change on the spot for their hardware. This little BIOS arrangement was the secret to the success of CP/M. With the BIOS in place, a programmer could make CP/M work with their specialized hardware. With all those hobbyists out there, believe me, there was no shortage of specialized hardware. Glenn and I built a BIOS that afternoon and stuck CP/M on an IMSAI. In a section on The Early Days of Microsoft we are given an insight into the relationship between Kildall and Bill Gates: Bill came to me in Pacific Grove one day in 1977 to discuss his current quandary about relocation of his Microsoft company. We invited him to stay that night at our home. Dorothy fixed a nice roast chicken dinner, and we had light conversation. Bill told us about the tickets he had received driving at high speed in his Porsche 911 through the main street of Albuquerque. We found a common topic since I. to my misfortune, also enjoy speed of the automotive type that sometimes, but not often, results in an encounter with The Law. At this time, I was quite friendly with Bill, and we always talked of the "synergism" of our two businesses. But, quite frankly, I was always apprehensive of his business moves, as I found his manner too abrasive and deterministic, although he mostly carried a smile through a discussion of any sort. In a later passage he wrote: Monetarily, Bill had the proper approach to get a stack of bucks, and lose a bunch of friends in the meantime. I guess that's ok. Other people discussed in the course of the excerpt include Grace Hopper, described as a "lovely lady" who: was self-proclaimed to be the first programmer, and I believe her. She was quite elderly when I met her, but wore the crisp dress uniform of the Navy each time I saw her. She helped invent COBOL, that business language used throughout the world today. She was a brightly clever, petite gray-haired lady with a wit and brain sharper at her age than most who were half her's. She was like having a charming grandmother who could talk your socks off about computers. Quite a combo, indeed. All her stories were true, captivating, and always drew a crowd.  He also liked Robert Noyce, founder of Intel: Bob Noyce was a clever, somewhat silent, gray-haired guy who mostly wore a white lab coat to cover his casual demeanor. At first, I must admit that I liked him because he was a pilot.... Bob was a friend. He, like all of us, made some decisions that are right, and some that could have made the future unfold in a different manner. But, most of all, Bob treated his people with dignity. He had the foresight to build an industry in microprocessors. I was very sad when he died recently. This portion of the memoir takes us to the end of the 70s and it doesn't give details of what caused the deal for IBM to contract DR's CP/M as one of the operating systems for the IBM PC to fall through. The apocryphal story that he was enjoying a day off flying his plane, is now seen to be an over simplified, or even falsified account, of the events. Whatever happened it had a lasting impact on the future of the software industry. Gary Kildall died after a blow to the head during a biker brawl at a bar in Monterey in 1994 so there is more of his story to tell. However it doesn't seem as though more of his memoir will be revealed. Scott and Kristen Kildall write: We have chosen to release only the first portion of his memoir. Unfortunately Gary’s passion for life also manifested in a struggle with alcoholism, and we feel that the unpublished preface and later chapters do not reflect his true self. If you want to read more about events in his later life and the further development of CP/M, They Made America by Harold Evans, Gail Buckland, and David Lefer has an excellent chapter on this topic.     You can read more about Kildall's life and contributions in Gary Kildall - CP/M, Digital Research and GEM. This 1995 video is a special edition of Computer Chronicles, a series which Kildall had co-hosted since its inception, was devoted to Gary Kildall's story. Introduced by Stewart Cheifet. it includes comments by Tom Rolander who was the first employee of Digital Research; Alan Cooper, a CP/M applications developers; as well as Gordon Eubanks and others.       More Information In His Own Words: Gary Kildall Related Articles Gary Kildall - CP/M, Digital Research and GEM IEEE Honors Gary Kildall 30 years ago - Microsoft signs contract with IBM to create MS-DOS     To be informed about new articles on I Programmer, sign up for our weekly newsletter, subscribe to the RSS feed and follow us on Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or Linkedin.   SQLite 3.15 Adds Row Value Support 24/10/2016 SQLite 3.15 is now available with support for row values, support for deterministic SQL functions in the WHERE clause of a partial index and the ability to VACUUM an attached database. + Full Story Neural Networks Have A Universal Flaw 04/11/2016 It was recently discovered that neural networks have a flaw that leads them into errors that look stupid to a human.

SuperOp! uniquely allows companies to test that their products work seamlessly with equipment from other companies by offering a test platform of software, hardware, UC and multimedia solutions both for enterprises and service providers, running over a combined IP and 4G LTE network and using a broad range of protocols and technologies including WebRTC, Microsoft Skype4Business, SIP, TIP, H.323, H.264, SVC and HEVC/H.265. This diversity of equipment, protocols and vendors is not duplicated by any other industry event and cannot be economically undertaken by individual companies. At each SuperOp!, a SuperConnect is held to test and demonstrate interoperability across all the multimedia and UC products. This year's SuperConnect was completed in 14 minutes across 35 SIP, WebRTC and Telepresence endpoints and 14 MCUs, Gateways, Session Border Controllers and SIP servers. The IMTC WebRTC group works closely with the IMTC SIP Interconnect group focusing on interoperability between SIP and WebRTC Video conferencing applications. For the second successive year the IMTC WebRTC Activity Group was at the SuperOp! event to promote interoperability of WebRTC based applications with Video Conferencing solutions, SBCs and Audio/Video Endpoints. The companies participating in the WebRTC related testing included leading vendors from the Unified Communications industry. The IMTC WebRTC AG is also actively supporting the development of a WebRTC interoperability testing framework capable of testing both applications and browsers, which is intended to provide the basis for future WebRTC testing at SuperOp!. The SIP Interconnect Activity Group testing included 16 product teams from Blue Jeans Networks, Cisco Systems, Huawei, Intel, Pexip, Polycom, Sonus Networks, Sorenson Communications, Spirent Communications, Vidyo, and Wipro. Testing focused on key aspects of videoconferencing/telepresence interoperability, using the IMTC SIP Interconnect best practices documents and associated test cases as the framework within which to test and report results. Interworking across implementations was quite broad, extending beyond that covered within the IMTC's best practice documents, including SIP/WebRTC interworking via gateways provided by several participants. The level of interworking and the sophistication of the test scenarios was more advanced than in previous years. New interoperability issues were identified, some of which were resolved during the week with corresponding changes being fed back into the best practices and test cases documents. "This year's SuperOp! results prove that the IMTC is successfully bringing together industry leading companies from around the world, improving product performance by breaking down the technical barriers which hinder interoperability," said Anatoli Levine, IMTC President and Director of Product Management at Spirent Communications. "Our ultimate goal is to ensure that video, audio and UC clients, systems and Cloud services all work flawlessly together to provide a seamless user experience." SuperOp! 2016 also featured a half-day IoT workshop focused on using IoT in the context of Unified Communications (UC). Topics covered included use-cases and adaptation architectures, a Software Define Networking (SDN) model to interface to IoT, Sensors and APIs with UC as hubs, UC hubs interfacing to IoT infrastructure, and UC components as IoT elements. IMTC was honored to have Cisco, Polycom, Vidyo and Wipro sponsor the event. About the International Multimedia Telecommunications Consortium (IMTC) The IMTC is an industry-leading, non-profit organization whose mission is to promote and facilitate the development and use of interoperable, real-time, multimedia telecommunication products and services based on open international standards.

For the second successive year the IMTC WebRTC Activity Group was at the SuperOp! event to promote interoperability of WebRTC based applications with Video Conferencing solutions, SBCs and Audio/Video Endpoints. The companies participating in the WebRTC related testing included leading vendors from the Unified Communications industry. The IMTC WebRTC AG is also actively supporting the development of a WebRTC interoperability testing framework capable of testing both applications and browsers, which is intended to provide the basis for future WebRTC testing at SuperOp!.\n The SIP Interconnect Activity Group testing included 16 product teams from Blue Jeans Networks, Cisco Systems, Huawei, Intel, Pexip, Polycom, Sonus Networks, Sorenson Communications, Spirent Communications, Vidyo, and Wipro. Testing focused on key aspects of videoconferencing/telepresence interoperability, using the IMTC SIP Interconnect best practices documents and associated test cases as the framework within which to test and report results. Interworking across implementations was quite broad, extending beyond that covered within the IMTC's best practice documents, including SIP/WebRTC interworking via gateways provided by several participants. The level of interworking and the sophistication of the test scenarios was more advanced than in previous years. New interoperability issues were identified, some of which were resolved during the week with corresponding changes being fed back into the best practices and test cases documents.\n \"This year's SuperOp! results prove that the IMTC is successfully bringing together industry leading companies from around the world, improving product performance by breaking down the technical barriers which hinder interoperability,\" said Anatoli Levine, IMTC President and Director of Product Management at Spirent Communications. \"Our ultimate goal is to ensure that video, audio and UC clients, systems and Cloud services all work flawlessly together to provide a seamless user experience.\"\n SuperOp! 2016 also featured a half-day IoT workshop focused on using IoT in the context of Unified Communications (UC). Topics covered included use-cases and adaptation architectures, a Software Define Networking (SDN) model to interface to IoT, Sensors and APIs with UC as hubs, UC hubs interfacing to IoT infrastructure, and UC components as IoT elements.\n IMTC was honored to have Cisco, Polycom, Vidyo and Wipro sponsor the event.\n About the International Multimedia Telecommunications Consortium (IMTC)\n The IMTC is an industry-leading, non-profit organization whose mission is to promote and facilitate the development and use of interoperable, real-time, multimedia telecommunication products and services based on open international standards. The IMTC hosts interoperability testing events and demonstrations throughout the world. IMTC has hosted numerous events to test IMS, VoLTE, SIP, H.323, 3G-324M, TIP, 3G PS Streaming, and other Voice over IP products and services with each other. The IMTC Board of Directors includes representatives from Avaya, Cisco Systems, Ericsson, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, LifeSize Communications, Microsoft, Polycom, Qualcomm, Spirent Communications, Unify and Vidyo. Membership is open to any interested party, including vendors of audio, document, and video conferencing hardware and software; academic institutions; government agencies; and non-profit organizations.

The 14-inch convertible laptop is equipped with a revamped Wi-Fi antenna, a touchscreen display and a wireless mouse that can be used as a remote. Its 8-hour battery life is designed to make long hours of work manageable without power sockets. The Yoga 710 is host to a Wi-Fi antenna that is spread over a larger area than usual, enabling 20 percent stronger signal strength. Its combination of the 6th gen Intel Core processor and 8GB RAM should offer decent performance value along with the Windows 10 OS that’s aboard. In case you’re worried about portability, the laptop tips the scales at just 1.5kg. The Yoga 710 features the next generation Nvidia GeForce 940 MX (N16S-GTR) graphics card which should be capable of smoothly rendering games and videos. Its 1920 x 1080 FHD display spanning 14 inches would have sounded more appealing had it been a 4K one. Above the screen sits 720p HD webcam for video conferencing and what not. To add to the home theater experience is Dolby Audio Premium which adjusts audio while providing a virtual surround sound experience. All these specs come with a 256GB SSD to store movies and photos. The company claims 8-hour battery life including video playback. Lenovo provides two USB 3.0 ports on the device along with an HDMI port and an SD card reader. It also has a microphone and headphone jack. The wireless Yoga mouse doubles up as a remote control with an adaptive touch display. It is fitted with rechargeable batteries to eliminate the need for buying new ones now and again. It can be hooked up to the laptop over Bluetooth 4.0 or 2.4GHz wireless connection. Lenovo bundles in extra accessories like Bluetooth speakers and the Lenovo 500 in-ear headphones too. Let’s take a quick look at the specifications of the Lenovo Yoga 710: – OS: Windows 10 – Display: 1920 x 1080 full HD 14-inch screen – GPU: Nvidia graphics card – CPU: 6th gen Intel Core processor – Camera: 720p HD cam – Memory: 256GB SSD – RAM: 8GB – Battery: 8 hours including video playback – Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, USB 3.0, HDMI, SD card reader, headphone/microphone jack The Lenovo Yoga 710 is being sold in a silver color variant.

New Delhi: Car rental firm Carzonrent is looking to invest up to Rs.400 crore over the next five years to beef up business verticals, including self drive car service ‘Myles’, besides technology upgradation as it eyes Rs.5,000-crore revenue by 2021. The New Delhi-based company offers chauffeured vehicles on rental basis to corporates, institutions and SMEs, besides self drive vehicles. “It seems to be quite an aggressive target but with the kind of work we have done in the past 15 years to consolidate our operations, technology and network, we are quite confident of achieving a revenue target of Rs.5,000 crore,” Carzonrent MD and CEO Rajiv Vij told PTI. The industry as a whole has reached an interesting and inflection point, ready to expand rapidly, he added. The company’s current turnover is around Rs.350 crore. “We are adding new clients everyday. We have built a reputation over a period of time, enhanced technology, added new partners and all these things give us confidence to achieve our set targets,” Vij said. When asked about investments, he said that in order to expand fleet and enter new cities, the company will invest in the range of Rs.300-400 crore over the next five years. “Some of it will come from internal accruals. Besides, we may also look at some stage to raise capital by either public listing or raising from the equity partners,” Vij said. Carzonrent has already invested around $9 million in the last two-and-a-half years. The company offers its car rental services to various corporates, including Emirates, Accenture, Intel, TCS and Amazon, across 21 cities. Carzonrent currently enjoys a market share of around 22% in the organised car rental market and is growing at 30% year-on-year, Vij said. Its self drive service Myles, which started operations with just 14 vehicles two years back, now has a fleet of 1,200 vehicles. “It (Myles) is going to be very huge business for us. By the end of the year, we aim to have a fleet of around 5,000 cars,” the CEO said. He added that the company has established Research and Technology Development Lab in Delhi and Bangalore, besides a National Command Centre (NCC). The company is adding manpower in these centres in order to support future growth, he said. “The current strength of NCC will go up from 200 to 600 while employee strength in Bangalore will go up to 200 from the current 50,” he added.

Conflicts Terrorism Disasters Global Economy Environment Religion Scandals Regions isis ISIS claims to have captured trove of U.S. military gear By Lucas Tomlinson Published August 07, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook0 Twitter0 livefyre Email Print   ISIS fighters in Afghanistan claimed to have recently seized a trove of sensitive U.S. military equipment – including communications gear, a rocket launcher and the ID card of a U.S. soldier –but it remains unclear how the items came into the terror group’s possession. There was no immediate information on when the pictures, posted to social media on Saturday, were taken, though the U.S. soldier’s ID expires in 2017, a possible sign the photos are relatively fresh. There was also no information on how the extremists captured the gear. The American soldier whose identification was pictured, U.S. Army Specialist Ryan Jay Larson, was not captured by ISIS, Brigadier General Charlie Cleveland told Fox News on Sunday. “Obviously, SPC Larson is not captured – he is accounted for and with his unit despite having lost his ID card and possibly some of his equipment during recent operations,” Cleveland said in an email. “Beyond that, there is a lot of equipment in those pictures. “At this point, we don't know if all of the equipment in the pictures was lost during recent operations or at some other time in the past.” #ISIS 'Amaq posted photos of documents and gear of #American soldiers allegedly taken by ISIS fighters in #Nangarhar pic.twitter.com/UDat7qOFvX— SITE Intel Group (@siteintelgroup) August 6, 2016 It’s possible some of the equipment was left behind during a recent operation, but it was not lost due to any kind of hasty withdrawal, Cleveland said. “We do know that U.S. troops were not forced to retreat during any operations,” he said. SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors jihadi web activity, published the pictures and said they originated in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province. That’s the location where a company of nearly 150 U.S. Army Rangers recently took part in a multi-day assault against up to 1,500 ISIS-affiliated fighters. Mostly composed of former Taliban members, the fighters have a heavy presence in two districts near Pakistan. Fox News reported the Army Rangers killed “hundreds" of the ISIS fighters, although at some cost – five Rangers were shot and at least two remain hospitalized with non-life threatening injuries. None of the Rangers were killed. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter told Bret Baier on Thursday that the Army Rangers' actions in the operation were “heroic” and confirmed they were involved in heavy combat.

Some people are facing random system freezes that occur shortly after startup and leave their PC unusable. First noticed by Neowin, the scale of the serious issue is revealed by a Reddit thread that now has over 600 replies. No single cause for the freezing has been established. The users are all experiencing the same consequences: a total system lock-up at seemingly random intervals. The freezes usually trigger very soon after turning the PC on. The original poster in the Reddit thread said his computer is usable for little more than 20 seconds. After that, hovering the mouse over the Start menu or taskbar leaves the entire system unresponsive. The only way to recover from the bug is to reboot the PC. This allows for another 20 seconds of usage before it freezes up again. The period of time before the computer will freeze varies for each individual. The bug has been observed to occur across a wide range of hardware configurations and form factors. It persists after disabling third-party startup programs, indicating the problem is caused by system code introduced with the Anniversary Update. A variety of fixes have been suggested by various users. So far, there doesn't seem to be a general solution though. Some procedures work for some people but produce no results for others. One popular idea is to move the locations of the app installation and user files directories back to the system drive. This is only applicable to people that have previously moved the location of these folders. Other suggestions include updating Intel Rapid Storage technology and installing the Anniversary Update from an ISO file rather than a download. After staying quiet for a while, Microsoft has now responded to the rapidly increasing number of reports. The @MicrosoftHelps Twitter account acknowledged the company is aware of the problems and directed affected users to seek assistance on its support forums. In a post on its support site, Microsoft suggested users run the System Maintenance Troubleshooter in a first attempt to fix the bugs. If that fails, it advises the computer is started in safe mode and then clean booted to disable third party software. Replies in the Reddit thread already indicate this approach doesn't always work however. With Microsoft now admitting to the issues, its engineering teams should begin diagnosing the cause of the problems. It can then be patched in an upcoming update, although with some PCs unusable for more than a few seconds Safe Mode may again be required. This isn't the first major issue to appear since the launch of the Windows 10 Anniversary Update. Other problems include severe bugs when using Xbox One controllers in games and the inability of some laptops to update at all. They end up stuck in a reboot loop and displaying a black screen. While the update has been extensively tested internally and with Windows Insiders, it looks like Microsoft could have done better on quality control.

Sixty-eight percent of Apple's worldwide workforce is male and 56 percent of them are white, although Cupertino is slowly becoming more diverse, according to the company's latest report. Women and people who Apple considers to be underrepresented minorities in the US made up 37 percent and 27 percent of new hires, according the the report. Both categories are 5 percent higher than Apple's overall employee makeup, and are also 6 percent higher than they were in 2014. Apple says 54 percent of new hires in the US are now minorities. Asians make up the largest group at 24 percent, followed by blacks and Hispanics at 13 percent each. Whites, meanwhile, make up 46 percent of new hires. Apple releases its diversity report each summer. It celebrated the diversity advances it reported this year as a key step in helping to "break down historical barriers in tech." Those barriers, which include not only underrepresentation of minorities but also unequal pay that favors men, are well-known to Apple and its competitors. Intel last year announced it would spend $300 million to attract more women and minorities for engineering and computer science positions. //Related Articles How to Tackle Tech's Diversity Problem Facebook also wants to close the tech diversity gap, and one of its many initiatives is TechPrep, a website in English and Spanish that offers underrepresented groups information about computer science and resources to help them get started in the industry. Apple CEO Tim Cook has admitted in the past that he is not satisfied with the diversity of the company's employees. In a note accompanying 2014's diversity report, Cook said that the stats showing a majority white, male workforce are "not new to us, and we've been working hard for quite some time to improve them." It appears that those efforts are gaining ever-so-slight momentum; the percentage of employees who are male has been decreasing 1 percent per year for the past three years.

These days, however, things are different. The arrival of Chromebooks has driven PC makers to change their approach and release laptops that are much more appealing to consumers shopping in this segment. With a thin profile, solid specs and a nice design, the Jumper Ezbook 2 seems to be the perfect example of a new-age entry-level Windows laptop. It is priced well below the magical $200 mark, which, at least on paper, makes it a very attractive option. But just how good is it really? Design and Build Quality Straight after taking the Ezbook 2 out of box you will remark just how similar it looks compared to an Apple MacBook Air. It's all silver, with the exception of the keyboard, which is done in black with silver characters. Power it up, and you will notice that the Jumper logo on the back is backlit, just like on a MacBook. It looks much more expensive than it actually is. Of course, the Ezbook 2 is not made out of aluminum, but rather plastic. And it feels like it. The use of plastic is to be expected at this price point, after all, so I do not perceive it as a negative. What I did not expect is the amount of flex in the keyboard, which is pronounced, and the creaks that can be heard while handling the device. It may be down to the strength of the chassis or the quality of the plastic but, either way, this is something worth mentioning. You can see further evidence of build quality issues when looking at the port cutouts, which do not have straight edges. The USB ports, of which there are two, are not without problems either, as the only way I can connect my mouse is by forcing the connector in. Also, the ports are not labeled. This can be an issue when you want to charge the Ezbook 2 and you plug the round power connector in the 3.5 mm headphone jacket instead of the dedicated port. They look identical, so it is easy to get it wrong the first time. Just like the MacBook Air, the Ezbook 2 has a black panel at the rear. But, unlike the MacBook Air, there is a gap on the left side of it where it meets the silver plastic. It is not bothersome, however. But it all adds up to make me question just how much effort has been put into developing this laptop. Another problem, this time more serious, is that one of the screws holding the plastic cover at the bottom popped off recently. It landed on the floor next to my bed, but had it fallen off somewhere else I may not have found it. This is the first time that I have ever noticed this on a laptop. Display One of the main things that appeal about the Ezbook 2 is its display. Jumper has opted for a 14-inch panel with a resolution of 1,920 by 1,080, which makes it stand out in a sea of entry-level laptops. It does not disappoint. The high resolution works fine for a screen of this size. Using a scaling setting of 125 percent in Windows 10 everything is easy to read and sharp. Viewing angles leave something to be desired, and colors are not as vibrant as I would like them to be, but for casual use it is more than adequate. Keyboard and Touchpad The keyboard is another area where Jumper has tried to imitate the MacBook Air, but while adding its own touch. It looks similar, though it is designed to integrate nicely with Windows 10. So, there are dedicated buttons at the top for things like search, disabling the touchpad, and sending emails, but also for adjusting the volume and brightness. These functions are activated in conjunction with pressing the Fn key, which is positioned right where it should be, exactly to the right of the control key. So, if you are coming from a different keyboard, chances are you will feel right at home in a matter of minutes. The layout works nicely for typing, and key travel is good. I like the fact that there are home, page up, page down, end, delete, print screen and pause keys on the right side. Jumper has put some thought into the keyboard layout. But, and this is a huge but, the quality of the keyboard itself disappoints. A lot. I mentioned the travel in the keyboard, but that is not the real issue. No. In fact, it is relatively common on entry-level laptops based on my experience. What is frustrating is that some presses do not always register, so you end up going back and forth while typing to fix that. And, afterwards, you might see the cursor suddenly jumping to a different row. While I have noticed the first problems on other keyboards it was less pronounced. But I have never ever seen the cursor moving randomly on the screen. The cursor issue manifests itself when hitting certain keys on the right side of the keyboard. It is likely that the problem is caused by the considerable travel, which may lead the circuitry to believe that certain keys have been pressed when they haven't. Regardless of what causes it, these issues make the keyboard unusable for me, which is a shame because the laptop has some potential. The touchpad is another major disappointment. The problems that I have are that the cursor sometimes hangs or moves slowly while running my finger over the touchpad, and when I use two fingers to scroll up or down it typically sees that as a zoom gesture. This is clearly a software issue. The touchpad seems to work with the default Windows drivers, so there are no useful customization options available to tweak how it works. And it is a shame, because I believe that it could be optimized to work much better. However, out of the box, you need to use a mouse to browse the web, otherwise it is a frustrating experience. Performance The Ezbook 2 is equipped with a 1.34 GHz quad core Intel Cherry Trail X5-Z8300 processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB eMMC storage. On paper, that means it should handle tasks like web browsing and watching YouTube videos just fine, but ask more than that from it and it will struggle. The processor and storage are really meant for low-power applications, so performance is not a priority. Knowing this, I did not have high expectations, but I did expect the Ezbook 2 to handle web browsing just fine. And, generally, it gets the job done. But if you throw more than a few tabs at it that takes a toll on performance. It heats up on the right side (left side in the photo below), but not to the point that it becomes unbearable, and it struggles to play YouTube videos smoothly. Even going down to 720p levels of quality did not help much. I know that Windows 10 is not a resource hog, so the performance issues likely stem from the hardware side of things. With a cooler the Ezbook 2 could perform much better, but these chips are designed with passive cooling in mind so the temperature goes down only by throttling the chip. The only holes that you can see are in the black panel at the rear, and they are quite small. Charging the battery while using the Ezbook 2 leads to overheating though, and that is when I am tempted to put it down and do something else until it is ready to go again. A full charge is estimated to take in excess of five hours, during which it can be used comfortably only on a table. Battery Life Battery life is good on the Ezbook 2. I can typically use it for more than a couple of hours while browsing before having to pull out the charger, and it seems to hold up fine too while sleeping. The specs sheet points to a 10,000 mAh battery operating at 3.7V, which means that it is a 37 Wh unit. That is slightly larger than the battery on an 11-inch MacBook Air, to put things into perspective. Portability The Ezbook 2 is a fairly small and light laptop. It measures 34.65 x 22.95 x 1.76 cm (13.64 x 9.04 x 0.69 in) and weighs a claimed 1.18 kg (2.6 lbs). The small footprint makes it easy to carry in a bag, and the weight does not get in the way at all. If you want to use it on the go, you should know that it comes with a mini HDMI port, microSD card slot, and 3.5 mm headphone jack, so you will be able to connect it to an external monitor, expand the storage, and plug in a pair of headphones if you need to. Software Another positive of the Ezbook 2 is the fact that it comes without any bloatware that I can find. There are no strange programs installed on it, only a copy of Windows 10 Home. There are some tweaks, like the availability of a single power profile instead of the usual three, but other than that it is pretty close to a vanilla experience. The fact that it ships with a x86 processor means you can install most Windows software and run it without issues. It is meant for light applications though, so you should stick to programs that do not require a great deal of resources. There is enough storage out of the box for Windows 10 and lots of apps, and if you need more you can always get a good microSD card to offload some of the content from the internal storage. Windows 10 is nicely optimized for such scenarios, so it should make for a pleasant experience. Verdict As you can see, the Ezbook 2 is a mixed bag in the worst possible sense. It has some quality bits, which will appeal to consumers shopping for an affordable laptop, but it also has some terrible bits, which make it impossible for me to recommend it. The trouble with the Ezbook 2 is that Jumper has thrown a lot of good components at it but did not go the extra mile to make sure they all work together nicely. It feels like a collection of parts not as a whole, and, sadly, it cannot be improved as it stands. GearBest currently has the Jumper Ezbook 2 available for preorder for $167.89.

While Apple, the Magellan Global Fund’s top holding, lost 13 percent in the past 12 months and has been one of the biggest drags on its performance, the others have both gained more than 20 percent over the same period. Magellan wants to own businesses where artificial intelligence “will get monetized” and companies such as these provide avenues to do so, Magellan Chief Executive Officer Hamish Douglass said in an interview Monday. Artificial intelligence is approaching a “tipping point of exponential technological advancement,” he said in the company’s annual report to investors. The A$7.9 billion ($6 billion) Magellan Global Fund has beaten all but 2 percent of its peers in the five years to July 27, delivering an average annual return of more than 20 percent, although its 0.9 percent loss over the past 12 months has been less stellar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of July 28. Douglass said the fund has more than doubled its exposure to technology stocks in the past two years as it bets innovations in artificial intelligence will reshape how companies conduct business. Massive Advances “I describe it as a nuclear arms race that’s occurring,” he said by phone. “Many of these big technology platform companies appear to be making massive advances in machine-learning, voice recognition.” Other technology firms that feature in Douglass’s portfolio include Larry Ellison’s Oracle Corp., chipmaker Intel Corp. and online marketplace eBay Inc., according to the annual report. He is also backing credit card company Visa Inc. and fast-food franchiser Yum! Brands Inc., while home improvement chain Lowe’s Cos. and CVS Health Corp. round out his 10 biggest investments. The biggest contributors to the fund’s returns in the year through June 30 were Microsoft, Lowe’s and Visa, while the biggest detractors were U.K. lender Lloyds Banking Group Plc, supermarket owner Tesco Plc and Apple.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Sunday, 7 August 2016 | MYT 9:00 AM Google, Facebook and Apple draw hordes of tech tourists by ethan baron On the itinerary: A tourist posing for photos at the Android Garden on the Google campus in Mountain View, California. Iconic high tech firms in Silicon Valley have become tourist destinations. — Bay Area News Group/TNS SAN FRANCISCO: Move over, Alcatraz; clear some way, cable cars; and back off, Mickey: Silicon Valley is giving San Francisco and other Golden State attractions a run for their money when it comes to drawing hordes of tourists.  Because for some tourists, taking a selfie in front of Facebook is all part of the vacation plan.  "We are all the way from India," said Pavi Rajkumar, with family members at Facebook's "thumbs-up" sign outside its Menlo Park headquarters on a recent morning. Alongside Rajkumar was her nephew Shriman Sendhil, who spends two to three hours a day on the social network and claims 1,000 Facebook friends.  "This is the only thing that woke him up," Rajkumar said of the visit to the company. "Disneyland didn't work."  Quietly but indubitably, tech tourism has become a thing. Hundreds of people a day visit the Facebook sign and Google's Android sculpture garden in Mountain View, with many stopping at other tech giants as well, snapping photos and shooting video. And they don't even get to go inside.  "What you're seeing are people on a pilgrimage," said Stanford communications professor Fred Turner, who regularly drives past Facebook and ponders the selfie-seeking travellers. Most technology tourism is of the do-it-yourself variety, but several companies offer customised tours.  Turner compared the new breed of tourists to pilgrims who travelled to the Holy Land in the Middle Ages to visit churches engaged in large-scale colonialism.  "We now see pilgrimages to firms that in ways both good and bad are colonising our everyday lives," Turner said. "Folks are looking for a physical place behind the kind of dematerialised experience that they have online."  A visit to Google's Android garden in Mountain View presents a physical place, and more: Here, tourists walk among super-sized representations of the operating system's mascots, including a hulking doughnut, immense cupcake and giant ice-cream sandwich, representing the 11 Android iterations.  "We use Google every day, every hour, so we wanted to visit it," said Daniel Rezende, 34, an electrical engineer from Brazil on vacation with his wife, Monica, a 37-year-old dentist. "It's an important place."  Turner's pilgrimage theory also seems to explain why Canadians Vicky Hsu and Philip Huang were at the Facebook sign with their baby and a selfie stick, about 1,000 miles from their Vancouver home.  "We use (Facebook) every day," said Hsu, 30, a banker. Huang, a 37-year-old airport shop manager, gestured toward Facebook's sprawling campus and said, as might be predicted, "It's pretty cool, eh?" They planned to drop in at Google next.  Mostly, tech tourists are not focused on a single company. They hopscotch from firm to firm.  "We just came from Oracle, then we go to HP, Google; we're going to do Tesla, Intel, eBay and Yahoo. And Apple, I forgot Apple," said Ray Santiago, of San Francisco, escorting his friend Eiji Matsumoto, from Tokyo, on a do-it-yourself tour that brought them to the Facebook sign. Matsumoto owns a Japanese company that designs websites.  "That's why I like to see the high-tech companies," said Matsumoto, 46. "Everything is huge, just huge. One company is like one city in Japan."  For the Rezendes, of Brazil, watching Googlers pedal the company's famous multi-coloured employee bikes around the campus highlighted a difference between job requirements at Google and those in Brazil. "Usually we work on just one duty and don't move from building to building," Daniel Rezende said, before he and Monica headed off to visit Apple's headquarters in Cupertino.  It's a short walk from the sculptures to Google's merchandise shop, where a branded sweatshirt costs around US$20 (RM80), a Google lollipop will set you back less than US$3 (RM12), and the most popular purchases among the 300 to 500 people who visit daily are, according to a staffer, Android figurines for US$8 (RM32) to US$15 (RM60) and Google T-shirts for US$15 (RM60).  The notoriously secretive Silicon Valley tech giants offer no public tours of their facilities but generally allow limited public access. Naturally, some visitors push the envelope.  "You need to know a staff member to get a tour," an Australian visitor to Google noted on TripAdvisor in March. As a consolation, the Australian suggested an unauthorised escapade frowned upon by company security. "Can ride a Google bike around the outside of the campus if wanted though," the visitor wrote.  Like Google, Facebook and Apple, Tesla has a branded-merchandise shop at its Palo Alto headquarters. Visitors are prohibited from exploring beyond the lobby, where the shop is located. "They come and try to take pictures of the cars," said a security guard posted in a rear parking lot. "We kick 'em out. That's why we're here."  Some tourists' expectations go unmet. "It was nice to walk between the buildings, take some pictures and see the employees enjoy their lunch break," a visitor to Google's campus posted on a Google Plus thread about Silicon Valley tourism, before griping that Google provided no bathroom access. "We were redirected to a nearby public park," the traveller sniffed.  A TripAdvisor user from London recalled a disappointing incident from a visit to Google. "We got told not to use the Google bikes as they are for employees only, which was a bit of a shame," the traveller complained.  At one of the handful of companies offering Silicon Valley tours, the trip to see the tech icons has been the most popular of its 14 Bay Area tour options for the past year.  "The selfies are the main thing," said Tours By Locals guide Caesar Cypriano, 55. "They do all their postings, and then people on the other side of the globe go, 'Wow, I wish I were there!'" — The Mercury News/Tribune News Service You May Be Interested Reese Witherspoon, AT&T venture, form media company aimed at women Yew Sin-Ee Yi continue fine run in Hong Kong Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Fraud in Felda Global Ventures Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Others Also Read A match by match look at the English Premier League M’sia, Thailand to begin talks on Bangkok-KL HSR project - Thai Minister Japan enlists Sailor Moon to promote safe sex advertisement Latest News Philippines money laundering body charges bankers for ignoring cyberheist Google nears tax settlement with Indonesian government: sources The new Vivo V5 takes the selfie crown Self-driving car group urges US regulators to clear road Singapore unveils self-driving scooter, ideal for phone-obsessed walkers Most Viewed in Tech Apple issues recall on September, October 2015 iPhone 6S Viral video will crash your iPhone The new Vivo V5 takes the selfie crown Pokémon Go: Dittos are hiding in plain sight Google nears tax settlement with Indonesian government: sources Self-driving car group urges US regulators to clear road Israeli firm can steal phone data in seconds Singapore unveils self-driving scooter, ideal for phone-obsessed walkers Pokémon Go says thanks and reshuffles CP Watch your self-ie!

My support is with Mike Gallagher. Voters look past primary and congressional elections. That’s a mistake. Our Republic is built on a representative premise. The 435 congressional representatives make up the backbone of our government — the leaders elected to represent the people. “Leaders.” There aren’t many leaders in Congress. Mike joined the Marines after college; served multiple deployments, earned the rank of captain, and led intelligence teams in Iraq. Mike’s a proven leader, and proven his selfless service and patriotism. A Princeton graduate and receiving a Ph.D. from Georgetown; at 32, Mike could move on privately and be successful. But his motivation lies to serve his country. Members of Congress are supposed to be public servants; serving out of patriotic duty for betterment of neighbors, community, state and nation. Not power or prestige. Mike’s already served his community and country honorably. He’s looking to do it again — just in a different capacity. I served multiple Iraq deployments, conducting convoy security operations in the same area Mike Gallagher led Intel teams. Human/counter intelligence is gritty — requiring embedding. An intellectual, he can also roll up his sleeves, engage, and get the job done. We need fewer lawyers in Congress, and more leaders. The Marine Corps creates leaders. Mike is one of them. A Green Bay native, Mike is a unique candidate Wisconsin is fortunate to have. On August 9th, to me the choice is clear: I’m voting for Mike Gallagher.

While Redmond fans get to look forward to new tech every year (at least in the PC division), what about those dedicated to Cupertino? It seems as though Apple has been lacking when it comes to innovation, let one Microsoft exec tell it. Brian Hall, general manager of Microsoft’s Surface line, had this to say about his long time competitor: I compete with Apple and respect them. but they ARE doing their customers a disservice at times with old tech… https://t.co/PR2pC6TsJh — Brian Hall (@IsForAt) August 5, 2016 Now Apple does have a slightly diverse product line, with PCs, Macbooks, iPads, and iPhones, but lest we forget, the MacBook Air was last redesigned six years ago, and the MacBook Pro’s design hasn’t changed since 2012. In addition, many of the Macs have not been updated with the latest processors, which may be why Apple’s computer shipments declined 11.5% annually last quarter. However, there are rumors which suggest a new MacBook Pro with a new touchscreen keyboard and the latest and greatest Intel chips will be coming this fall, but i wouldn’t get my hopes up. While Apple has yet to respond, it has just released an ad for the iPad Pro, touting it as more than a tablet, more like a computer. While I can’t say I agree with this, the ad is very impressive, and would probably make due for another piece of hardware. Some links in the article may not be viewable as you are using an AdBlocker.

Steve Dent , @stevetdent 08.02.16 in Politics Comments 1144 Shares Share Tweet Share Save The US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) has been very cautious about drone testing in the US so far, but that's about to change. The FAA has granted Google's sister X division (under Alphabet) permission to test Project Wing delivery services below 400 feet at six sanctioned test sites, according to the White House. The flights will be part of a new push by the US National Science Foundation, which is spending over $35 million on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) research and testing over the next five years Alphabet's Project Wing UAVs, first revealed in 2014, aren't like Amazon's drones -- they take off vertically then fly like a fixed-wing plane. While not as maneuverable as standard UAVs, they can fly much farther and carry more weight (see the video, below). Though the FAA released its final rules for drone operations in June, deliveries still aren't allowed. However, Alphabet has reportedly been testing them in the US anyway, skirting the regulations via a NASA waiver. It plans to launch the service commercially in 2017. Alphabet will be able to test drones with cargo beyond line-of-site, which is another current no-no by FAA rules. It will also "develop and deploy an open-interface, airspace management solution for safe low-altitude operations," according to the Feds. The initiatives were unveiled during a big event today that included keynotes from US Chief Technology Office Megan Smith, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta and Intel CEO Bryan Krzanich. The White House emphasized that government must be more flexible about allowing companies to test drones and other tech over US soil. Amazon, for one, was forced it to test its delivery drones in the UK due to restrictive US rules.Drones helped Fort McMurray firefighters, but they can hinder manned aircraft. (Chris Wattie/Reuters) The White House also unveiled a flurry of other initiatives. It wants the FAA to develop new regulations to "safely integrate [UAVs] in the airspace" and have them ready for comment by winter 2016. Further to that, it will create a UAV "safety team" that can analyze safety data and investigate accidents. It also enlisted NASA to help develop "detect and avoid" tech, with completion planned by 2020. FAA chief Huerta cited rescue operations and crop dusting as two big areas where drones could assist or replace manned aircraft. "Just last week, two people were killed in two different accidents involving crop dusters -– exactly the type of job a small unmanned aircraft could do with much less risk to people and property on the ground," he said. There are other studies planned around wildfire safety, drone racing, medical deliveries in hard-to-reach areas, public information about drones and more. For a complete list of the many, many initiatives, check the fact sheet.

Toggle Navigation A-   A+ Sign in News   Stock Home «Back HP Spectre 13: A delightful week with world's sleekest, thinnest laptop (Tech Review) IANS | New Delhi Aug 06, 2016 10:30 AM IST Thin is clearly in -- not just in life but in the world of technology too. With the jaw-dropping Spectre 13, touted as the world's thinnest laptop ever, global computer and laptop giant HP Inc has surged ahead in the race to go thin in the premium segment. It is not a question of just being thin. The laptop has some top-of-the-line specifications for a powerful experience and gives its nearest rivals -- Apple MacBook Pro and Microsoft Surface Pro4 -- a run for their money. After using it for over a week, we can confidently say that it has been a never-before experience. Be it design, performance or portability, the machine leaves every other laptop in the premium segment miles behind. Let's decode it further. Spectre 13 has a hand-polished, jewellery-like finish and a copper-coloured "piston hinge" that creates the illusion of a hinge-less design to offer an unmatched premium look-and-feel. HP Inc claims that its innovative hybrid battery -- split into two thinner pieces -- delivers the same wattage as a single battery for up to 9 hours 45 minutes of charge. Well, for us, continuous use -- movie watching, video gaming and internet browsing -- gave a cool 4-5 hours of battery life. Thin as an AAA- battery at just 10.4 mm with 13.3-inch edge-to-edge display, the Spectre 13 is equipped with sixth generation Intel Core i5 and i7 processors, 8GB RAM and a unique hyperbaric cooling technology. (Our review unit had the i7 processor.) The technology helps the device to draw cool air and direct it over the processor rather than just venting heat out, thus keeping the device cool even with peak performance. And we did not hear the sound of the fan much during use. The device has a carbon fibre bottom that is both durable and lightweight, keeping the total weight of the notebook at just 1.1 kg. Packed with Windows 10 Pro, Spectre 13 uses Intel's integrated HD 520 GPU for graphics and packs in a lightning fast PCIe solid-state drive (SSD) with storage of 512GB with up to 8GB of memory. The device has full HD IPS Corning Gorilla Glass 4 display, a full-sized backlit keyboard, a superb touchpad, a wireless Bluetooth mouse and Bang & Olufsen audio with Quad speakers for superb-quality sound. You do not need an extra set of speakers at all! Another disruptive feature: three full-function USB Type-C connectors with two of these supporting Thunderbolt 3 connectivity to provide a fast and versatile video/data connection including 4K display (via an optional dock). You can charge the laptop with any of the three USB Type-C connectors and all three ports can charge external devices like your smartphone too. When you hold the Spectre 13 in its specially-designed leather case, it appears as if you are carrying a folder with a thin sheaf of papers. For people on the go, it is a clear choice. What doesn't work. Well, try finding for yourself! In the premium segment, this is truly a technology marvel. Conclusion: If we were to describe Spectre 13 in one sentence, it will be, "Style and luxury with powerful performance". The revised price in India for Spectre 13 with the i5 processor is Rs 99,990; and with the i7 it is Rs 139,990 (taxes extra). Both units are now available for purchase.

With the jaw-dropping Spectre 13, touted as the world's thinnest laptop ever, global computer and laptop giant HP Inc has surged ahead in the race to go thin in the premium segment. It is not a question of just being thin. The laptop has some top-of-the-line specifications for a powerful experience and gives its nearest rivals -- Apple MacBook Pro and Microsoft Surface Pro4 -- a run for their money. After using it for over a week, we can confidently say that it has been a never-before experience. Be it design, performance or portability, the machine leaves every other laptop in the premium segment miles behind. Let's decode it further. Spectre 13 has a hand-polished, jewellery-like finish and a copper-coloured "piston hinge" that creates the illusion of a hinge-less design to offer an unmatched premium look-and-feel. HP Inc claims that its innovative hybrid battery -- split into two thinner pieces -- delivers the same wattage as a single battery for up to 9 hours 45 minutes of charge. Well, for us, continuous use -- movie watching, video gaming and internet browsing -- gave a cool 4-5 hours of battery life. Thin as an AAA- battery at just 10.4 mm with 13.3-inch edge-to-edge display, the Spectre 13 is equipped with sixth generation Intel Core i5 and i7 processors, 8GB RAM and a unique hyperbaric cooling technology. (Our review unit had the i7 processor.) The technology helps the device to draw cool air and direct it over the processor rather than just venting heat out, thus keeping the device cool even with peak performance. And we did not hear the sound of the fan much during use. The device has a carbon fibre bottom that is both durable and lightweight, keeping the total weight of the notebook at just 1.1 kg. Packed with Windows 10 Pro, Spectre 13 uses Intel's integrated HD 520 GPU for graphics and packs in a lightning fast PCIe solid-state drive (SSD) with storage of 512GB with up to 8GB of memory. The device has full HD IPS Corning Gorilla Glass 4 display, a full-sized backlit keyboard, a superb touchpad, a wireless Bluetooth mouse and Bang & Olufsen audio with Quad speakers for superb-quality sound. You do not need an extra set of speakers at all! Another disruptive feature: three full-function USB Type-C connectors with two of these supporting Thunderbolt 3 connectivity to provide a fast and versatile video/data connection including 4K display (via an optional dock). You can charge the laptop with any of the three USB Type-C connectors and all three ports can charge external devices like your smartphone too. When you hold the Spectre 13 in its specially-designed leather case, it appears as if you are carrying a folder with a thin sheaf of papers. For people on the go, it is a clear choice. What doesn't work. Well, try finding for yourself! In the premium segment, this is truly a technology marvel. Conclusion: If we were to describe Spectre 13 in one sentence, it will be, "Style and luxury with powerful performance". The revised price in India for Spectre 13 with the i5 processor is Rs 99,990; and with the i7 it is Rs 139,990 (taxes extra). Both units are now available for purchase.

We now know that they’ll come in sizes up to a terabyte and will offer some rather impressive performance, especially considering this is Plextor’s first attempt at the flourishing SSD standard. The new drives represent Plextor’s big return to the enthusiast market, after a delay with Marvell controllers led to an absence of high-end Plextor consumer hardware for about two years. When these ones arrive, they will come in 12 distinct flavors, varying in storage sizes and physical dimensions, and with slight changes in performance. All of them make use of the Marvel 88SS1093 Eldora controller, according to Tom’s. There are three configurations, offering a drive with a large, branded heatsink, a full-size PCB with no shroud whatsoever, or a similarly nude drive at half height. Regardless of the form factor you opt for, there are sizing options ranging from 128GB, through 256GB and 512GB, right up the largest 1TB variant. Related: Intel confirms 2016 arrival of 3D XPoint-based Optane SSD All drives make use of Toshiba-branded 15 nanometer MLC flash memory and feature three-year warranties. Performance ranges widely, with the 128GB model offering sequential read/write rates of 1,600MBps/500MBps, respectively, while the 1TB variant can reach much higher sustained read/write rates of 2,500MBps and 1,400MBps. The same can be said for the random read and write commands, with the midrange 256GB option offering 210,000 and 230,000 IOPS, respectively, while the 1TB version can handle 280,000/240,000. With the added capacity and performance, you do have to pay a premium. While the 128GB drive will set you back just $90, the 1TB costs a much heftier $600. Adding the heatsink does tack an extra $10 ($50 for the 1TB version) on to the design, but considering it should help improve the life span of the memory chips used in the drive’s design, it’s probably worth it. It could in theory also prevent any throttling that may occur during particularly lengthy, heated transfers. Although the drives won’t be available for a few more days, you can pre-order them now at various retailers, with the likes of Newegg claiming that they will ship out on the August 17.

It is a measure written behind closed doors by, and for, public employees and their unions, unencumbered by the democratic process and without any meaningful public input. It is an enormous new tax on business, not on profits but on sales. And no, it does not just apply to out-of-state businesses. It applies to any large corporation. Think Nike, Intel, Precision Cast Parts and even locally owned grocery chains and breweries. The measure contains no exceptions for high-revenue, low-margin businesses such as grocery chains. Why should Market of Choice continue expanding if virtually all of its profits are taken by this tax? This measure is shocking in its scope — a $3 billion tax increase just at a time when Oregon is finally experiencing a robust recovery from the recession. This measure will hurt the Oregon economy in ways that cannot yet be predicted. Nothing like this should ever receive the light of day via the initiative process, which long ago was hijacked by special interests. I’m voting no.

Today, who complains about things that bugged us a decade ago, such as heavy laptops, slow cellular Internet, the inability to send e-mails in planes It was only a matter of time before those geniuses started tackling one of the longest-running pain points in history: passwords. We’re supposed to create a long, complex, unguessable password — capital and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols, with a few Arabic letters thrown in if possible. For each site. Don’t reuse a password. Oh, and change them all every month. Sorry, security experts. Not possible. Not for an average person, not even for you. Nobody has that kind of memory. To make matters worse, passwords aren’t even especially secure. See any recent headline about stolen passwords or about some company’s servers being hacked. Time to kill the password Surely, in the 50 years since we started typing passwords, somebody must have invented a better security system. The answer: Yes and no. Apps such as 1Password and Dashlane memorise and enter long, complicated passwords for you. But most of them cost money, they don’t work on every Web account and the nontechie public don’t know they exist. There’s also two-factor authentication, which makes you type a password and a code texted to your phone to log in. It’s an unbelievable hassle. The masses will never go for it. Finally, biometric approaches can be both secure and easy because they recognise us, not memorised strings of text. Here there’s hope. Fingerprint readers on smartphones, tablets and laptops are becoming common, cheap, convenient and essentially impossible to hack on a large scale. So far, they’re primarily useful for logging us into our machines. Shouldn’t the next step be letting us log into our Web accounts Iris scanning is another biometric technology, fast enough to work well at automated border-crossing systems and secure enough for national ID programs such as India’s (it’s enrolling 1.2 billion people). At the moment, iris scanners are far too new and expensive to build into every phone and laptop — but almost every technology gets cheaper over time. Some scanners can be fooled by a photograph of your eye, but this problem, too, can be overcome (by tracking your pupil as you read something, for example). Bottom line: there’s no insurmountable problem in iris reading’s future. Same with voice authentication, using the unique pitch, accent and frequencies of your speaking voice as your key. It’s cheap enough for wide adoption — our phones and gadgets already have microphones. Worried about bad guys faking out the system with a recording of your voice That can’t happen if the phrase you’re asked to speak changes every time you log in. The only roadblocks here are background noise and laryngitis. And as with any biometric security solution, this approach only requires a backup system, like a password, just in case. Then there’s Windows Hello, a new feature of Windows 10 that lets you log in with fingerprint, iris or facial recognition, whatever your laptop is equipped to handle. The face option is especially exciting. You just sit down at the computer, and it unlocks instantly. You can’t fool it with a photograph or even a 3D model of your head, because the Intel RealSense camera it requires includes infrared and 3D sensors. Of course, very few gadgets come with that camera preinstalled. But the RealSense concept is truly the Holy Grail: secure and convenient. If the hardware ever became as ubiquitous and cheap as, say, our phones’ fingerprint readers, we could have a winner. Clearly, the password concept is broken. Equally clearly, these new technologies can provide both the security and the convenience the world demands. Nothing’s quite there yet, and we need to keep our eye on privacy concerns (who owns the databases of biometric scans, for example ). But one thing is for sure: this is one pain point that’s got everyone’s attention.
