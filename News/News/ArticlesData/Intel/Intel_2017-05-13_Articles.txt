Many say income gaps. I'd say not quite. I'd say income anxiety and the stress over what it now takes to secure and hold a good job. I believe the accelerations set loose by Silicon Valley in technology and digital globalization have created a world where every decent job demands more skill and, now, lifelong learning. More people can't keep up, and clearly some have reached for leaders who promise to stop the wind. Let me elaborate through a few conversations, starting with Brian Krzanich, the CEO of Intel, who recently remarked to me: "I believe my grandchildren will not drive." Since he has teenage daughters, that means self-driving vehicles should be fully deployed in 25 years, at which time you won't "steer" your car but will program it on a smartphone or watch or glasses. Sounds like fun — unless you're one of the millions who drive a truck or cab for a living. But don't think you're safe as an accountant, either. Mark Bohr, Intel's senior fellow for technology, explained to me that Intel's main workhorse microprocessor today is the 14-nanometer chip it introduced in 2014. It packs 37.5 million transistors per square millimeter. By the end of 2017, thanks to Moore's Law, Intel will begin producing a 10-nanometer chip that will pack "100 million transistors per square millimeter — more than double the previous density with less heat and power usage," said Bohr. If you think machines are smart today wait a year. It's this move from 14-nm to 10-nm chips that will help enable automakers to shrink the brain of a self-driving car — a brain that has to take in sensor data from 360 degrees and instantly process whether it's a dog, a human, a biker or another car — from something that fills a whole trunk to a small box under the front seat, so these cars can scale. When you get that much processing power, putting out that much data exhaust with ever-improving software, you create a world where we can analyze, prophesize and optimize with a precision unknown in human history. We can see trends we never saw, predict when engine parts will break and replace them before they do, with great savings, and we can optimize everything — from the most energy-saving flight path for an airplane to the ideal drilling path for a natural gas well. I recently visited the control room at Devon Energy, a large oil and gas producer, in Oklahoma City. It's half a floor of computer screens displaying data coming out of every well Devon is drilling around the world. At the bottom of each screen are two boxes that blew my mind. One box displays how much money was budgeted to drill that particular well per foot, and the other box displays — in real time — how much the drilling of that well is actually costing, as it bores through different rocks, and it's updated every foot! A typical well might involve sending pipe 2 miles down and then turning horizontally for 2 miles east or west — with such precision it can hit a seam of gas as small as 20 feet wide! If you're working on a Devon oil rig today, you're holding a computer, not just an oily wrench. And if you're getting a degree in auto mechanics at a community college today, it's not to be a "grease monkey." It's to be a repairman for a computer with wheels. The notion that we can go to college for four years and then spend that knowledge for the next 30 is over. If you want to be a lifelong employee anywhere today, you have to be a lifelong learner. And that means: More is now on you. And that means self-motivation to learn and keep learning becomes the most important life skill. That's why education-to-work expert Heather E. McGowan likes to say: "Stop asking a young person what you want to be when you grow up. It freezes their identity into a job that may not be there. Ask them how you want to be when you grow up. Having an agile learning mindset will be the new skill set of the 21st century." Some are up for that, some not; and many want to but don't know how, which is why the College Board has reshaped the PSAT and SAT exams to encourage lifelong learning. "We analyzed 250,000 students from the high school graduating Class of 2017 who took the new PSAT and then the new SAT," College Board President David Coleman told me. "Students who took advantage of their PSAT results to launch their own free personalized improvement practice through Khan Academy advanced dramatically: 20 hours of practice was associated with an average 115-point increase from the PSAT to the SAT — double the average gain among students who did not. "Practice advances all students without respect to high school GPA, gender, race and ethnicity or parental education. And it's free. Our aim is to transform the SAT into an invitation for students to own their future." So the tough news is that more will be on you. The good news is that systems — like Khan-College Board — are emerging everywhere to enable anyone to accelerate learning for the age of acceleration. Step back from all of this and it's clear that thriving countries today won't elect a strongman. They'll elect leaders who inspire and equip their citizens to be strong people who can own their own futures.

Walsh / May 13th, 2017 Once the rockets are up, who cares where they come down? That’s not my department. — Wernher von Braun1 From MAD to Madness: Inside Pentagon Nuclear War Planning is the enlightening memoir by Paul Johnstone, a man who worked in the “department” that decided where “they” would come down. Johnstone labored there during WWII and then from 1949 to 1969, the initial period of the Cold War and the period covered by this book. On August 29, 1949, the USSR caught the world flat-footed when it set off its first nuclear bomb. Thus began the years when frightened children scrambled under their desks by day and were tormented with mushroom cloud nightmares by night. The U.S. and the USSR stood on The Brink over the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Berlin Crisis when The Wall went up. Those years were the initial period of nuclear standoff called MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction). What Johnstone saw as he went about his duties horrified him – and it should also horrify us. For it is the thesis of the Afterword, by the author’s daughter, the prominent political commentator Diana Johnstone, that after the demise of the Soviet Union, the U.S. moved quickly from “MAD to Madness.” Madness refers to plans for a knockout nuclear first strike on Russia, aided and abetted by the latest missile defense boondoggle. That was a favorite fantasy of the generals in the post-WWII era. Whether we now live in another era of Madness, when a disabling first strike again dances in the heads of the Elite, or once again in an era of MAD is an open question in my mind. But Paul Johnstone’s memoir is a work of great importance in either case. Paul Johnstone started out in Henry Wallace’s Dept. of Agriculture during the New Deal, but was moved to the Department of War after Pearl Harbor. His job was to pick targets for conventional bombs in Japan, although not the targets for the first atom bombs. When the Cold War commenced, he studied how targets for nuclear weapons should be selected and how much damage The Bomb would do when dropped on various corners of the USSR. He also assessed the damage of Russian nukes landing in various corners of the U.S. He worked at the most august levels of US intelligence: Air Force Intelligence, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Office of Secretary of Defense. Some of Johnstone’s studies became part of the Pentagon Papers, and Daniel Ellsberg. Johnstone gave the manuscript for this memoir to his daughter, Diana Johnstone, when he was on his deathbed in 1981. A central message of the book is the inevitable failure of intelligence. This aspect of the memoir is hard to apprehend in all its facets without actually reading it. Why can “intelligence” not be trusted? First the intelligence agencies lie – and do so quite consciously when it suits those who command them or the desires of those who command their commanders. Anyone who does not recognize this by now has not been paying attention. Intel did this most notoriously in recent years in the case of the non-existent WMD that led the US to a multitrillion dollar war on the innocent people of Iraq – which we fight to this day even though Barack Obama declared the war “officially” over. But even when the Intel agencies are trying to make honest estimates, they face other obstacles. This is the major lesson that Paul Johnstone delivers. Let us take a few examples. On the topic of trying to assess the damage done by nuclear weapons either on the USSR or on the US, he writes: “They (the effects of nuking a target, jw) would be researched, and in time – much time – a lot would be learned about them, although not enough ever to provide the basis for predictive measurements. So men do what men always do. They calculated what was calculable as best they could, and generally ignored, or dismissed with mere mention by name, the factors that, however relevant and crucial, were incalculable. Or they would just make a wild guess. One problem was that whatever the uncertainties, those utilizing the information were rarely in a position to understand its degree of reliability. “(p. 39 of From Mad to Madness, hereafter FMTM) So the “decision makers” for nuclear war could well be acting on intel that is “a wild guess,” and they would not know it! And here is Johnstone writing on the way that the “wild guesses” and other intelligence estimates come to be made, most notably about enemy capabilities – an essential if one plans to start a nuclear war: “I believe that, to anyone who has been deeply immersed in it and then has had the privilege of viewing it with some measure of detachment, military intelligence must seem a world of flickering light, dark shadows, mood music and whispered rumors, half heard against trumpeted accompaniment proclaiming dire threats that imperil us from outer darkness. Shapes are partly perceived at best, most commonly merely implied, often not seen at all, and often what you think you see is really not there at all. There are always some things you know you know, but you never know how many things there are that you have no evidence even to suspect. You do not know how much of what you see is deliberately staged to mislead you. What is seldom realized is that there is always a dominant mood that determines, more than the sharpest senses or the most acute reasoning, what you decide is out there and what is going on. Like all the world and all experience, it is kaleidoscopic; and the bits and pieces that flit before your eyes are what you thought you’d see before you looked. Always of course there are the true believers. The images immediately before their eyes are God’s own truth. It’s a matter of right or wrong, bright sunlight or utter darkness. Then there are those not fully convinced nor deeply caring, who find it least troublesome to see what others say they see. Like herded sheep they may once in a while say “baa,” but though they may distrust the direction they are driven in, they feel reassured following the path forced on them by the pressure of the bodies next to them.” (FMTM, p. 63) In other words, in the end the data and analysis do little more than to confirm pre-existing sentiments and prejudices. Then there were the “experts” who had their own agenda. A striking example is the “Special Studies Group” set up in the early 1950s in the Air Force Directorate of Intelligence. Johnstone writes: “It was headed by Steve Possony, a Hungarian émigré who professed to be an expert on Communism in general and the Soviet Union in particular. Steve was the first of several Central European émigrés I met in the next few years who passed as experts on Communist Europe….Others were Stausz-Hupé, Kissinger, Brzezinski and many lesser lights such as Leon Gouré and Helmut Sonnenfeldt. In every case I felt that they were thinking, consciously or otherwise, as representatives of a lost cause in their native land, and I always believed that they were used by the military because their ‘obsessions’ were so useful.” (FTFM, p.80) Of course it is not clear who was using whom here. But we can think of a latter day equivalent in Bush 2 time when neoconservatives like Paul Wolfowitz dominated the Pentagon. As they ginned up the War on Iraq, it was all too clear that their loyalty to Israel came into play. For while the wars in the Middle East and North Africa did little to advance the interests of the US, costing it blood, treasure and new enemies like ISIS, those wars left in ruins potential adversaries of Israel in its neighborhood. There can be little doubt that the interests of Israel were served by these American “strategic thinkers.” Johnstone goes on: “The one product of Possony’s group that I most distinctly remember was an annual appraisal of the strategic situation. And the reason I remember it, perhaps, is that every year that appraisal forecast a massive Russian land attack on Western Europe the following year. Several of us began to laugh about it after a while, but the forecast was always intoned awesomely and with superficial plausibility. I do not know whether many people who heard the briefings really believed the forecasts. I suspect many doubted it would really be next year, and thought it more likely the year after or even later. But even doubters approved the forecast because, they reasoned, it was better to err in this direction than to minimize the danger. Above all, it was good to say things that emphasized the need for strong defenses.” (And I might add big military budgets, jw) (FTFM, p. 80) The issues that Johnstone raises are relevant not only for scholars, but for each and every one of us since our very existence hangs by a thread increasingly frayed by the incessant anti-Russia drumbeat in our media. That drumbeat has reached a neo-McCarthyite crescendo in these days of Kremlin Gate where politicians crazed by hatred of Putin like John McCain or hatred of Trump like nearly every last Democrat hold sway. The relevance of the memoir is inescapable, and this is laid out with considerable insight in a preface and a postscript by Johnstone’s daughter, Diana. Diana Johnstone, a journalist residing in Paris and a frequent commenter on French and U.S. Politics is also the author of The Politics of Euromissiles (1984), Greens in the European Parliament – A New Sense of Purpose for Europe (1994), Fool’s Crusade: Yugoslavia, NATO and Western Delusions (2003), and Queen of Chaos: The Misadventures of Hillary Clinton (2015). She is careful of the conclusions she draws. In addition, Paul Craig Roberts’s Foreword adds a further dimension to the book since he worked with some of Paul Johnstone’s colleagues and also inside the Reagan cabinet when the first Cold War finally came to an end. (Regrettably here we are again – in Cold War 2.0.) I remain unconvinced only by one conclusion of the book and that lies in Diana Johnstone’s Afterword. One thesis of the Afterword is that we went from the era of MAD back to the era of Madness, that is an attempt at a nuclear first strike, after the demise of the USSR. That may well have been true in the first decade of the Century when Russia was still on its back and China was relatively weak. (Diana Johnstone cites literature from this period to make her case. See also “The End of Mad”.) Bush was in power then, and the neocons were in the driver’s seat. Bush withdrew from the ABM treaty in June, 2002, which opened the door to developing the ever elusive anti-missile system that would make possible a first-strike on Russia and/or China. (At times first strike capability is called “nuclear primacy”.) Those ABM plans persisted and have been implemented right up to the present with their deployment in Eastern Europe nominally against Iran and in South Korea nominally against the DPRK. They are in fact aimed at Russia and China, and no one is fooled by other claims, least of all Russia and China. But we are now 15 years out from 2002 and Russia’s economy and military are much stronger under Putin. Moreover, China’s GDP was only about 18% of the US GDP in Purchasing Power Parity terms in 2002; it is now in 2017 about 120% that of the US., and the gap grows daily. And of course military power grows out of economic power. Things have changed. Certainly, the US maintains a vast edge in its military capability, but is it enough for the neocons and neoliberalcons to realistically dream any longer of a nuclear first strike? I doubt it, but the grave danger is that they are living in the past and that their “intel” is telling them that nuclear primacy is still theirs. Why? Because the intel agencies might feel that is what their bosses want to hear. After all, who wants to abandon past glory. Empires do not have a great track record when it comes to accepting decline. Living in the past is one of the things that might concern us after reading Paul Johnstone’s work. So it is a book of considerable importance for the moment. It warns us of the perilous age in which we live, and it tells us that the need to create a structure of peace in a multipolar world is urgent. From Tom Lehrer’s ballad of Wernher von Braun.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Cheap gaming chips from AMD Home Hardware Hands on with AMD’s cheaper Ryzen 5 CPUs By Jeremy Laird on May 11th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Serving up eight pukka CPU cores at a price mere mortals can afford was easily the most compelling part of the initial AMD Ryzen proposition. But there’s been some filling out of the Ryzen range since last we alighted the subject. Specifically, a load of quad-core and six-core models have hit retail. They’re significantly cheaper than the beefy eight-core beasts. Might they actually make more sense for gaming than those slightly flawed eight-core chips? It’s little more than journalistic OCD and of absolutely no consequence to the end-user experience. But it very slightly winds me up that AMD, like Intel, spurns logic with its CPU nomenclature. AMD has announced that Ryzen will come in three flavours for the foreseeable. Ryzen 7 is the performance king, Ryzen 5 balances price and performance and Ryzen majors on value. There are also – again for the foreseeable – three different basic configurations for Ryzen. Eight-core, six-core and quad-core. You might think they map neatly and logically to Ryzen 7, 5 and 3. But no, that would make too much sense. Ryzen 5 includes both six and quad-core models. Ryzen 3 has yet to be detailed. Anyway, the first thing to note about the latest quad and six-cores models is that some make a lot more sense in value terms than others. There’s about a £60 gap between the priciest six-core Ryzen, the £260 Ryzen 5 1600X, and the cheapest eight-core chip, the Ryzen 7 1700, for instance. Add about 5% to those numbers (and all the prices that follow, for that matter) for US $ prices. Given that you’re certainly going to also need a new motherboard and very likely some sticks of memory, too, the 1700 is the no brainer in that comparison. After all, you’re looking at perhaps £150 minimum for a decent X370 motherboard plus maybe £75 for 8GB of memory and perhaps a few more quid for sundry items like a new cooler. Factor in the motherboard, RAM and more and the cost of upgrading to Ryzen certainly adds up The plain old Ryzen 5 1600 non-X surely makes more sense at £219 given that it’s also six cores and likewise unlocked for easy overclocking, if you care about that sort of thing. It’s fully a £100 jump to the cheapest eight-core model from the Ryzen 5 1600. A similar logic applies to the quad-core models. The Ryzen 5 1500X clocks in at £179, which looks likes poor value when you can have 50% more cores for just £40 extra. To be honest, even the £159 Ryzen 5 1400 quad-core chip looks like marginal value when you factor in the overall costs of upgrading to Ryzen. Predictably, I’ve had a go with the two most difficult to justify models in the Ryzen 5 range, the 1600X and the 1500X. The former is clocked at 3.7GHz base and 4GHz Turbo, the latter at 3.5Ghz base and 3.7GHz Turbo. Both are a little quicker than their core-count-parity but cheaper siblings, the 1600 and 1400. But the point is that they’re broadly representative of the gaming experience you can expect from the six and quad-core breeds. Gaming joy in a small box? As it happens, when Ryzen was originally announced it seemed like the six core models could be the bang-for-buck sweet spot. Relatively affordable, reasonably high clocks for single threaded performance, plenty of cores and threads for multi-threading. Remember, every Ryzen can process two software threads in parallel per core. That’s pretty much how it pans out in practice. The 1600X makes similarly priced Intel processors look very, very silly in any software that’s multi-threaded, like video encoding. The catch, as it has been from the get go with Ryzen, is that the gaming performance is ever so slightly patchy. All Ryzen CPUs use the full eight-core processor die and disable cores in the two quad-core modules within the chip in symmetrical pairs. So, the configurations are therefore 4:4, 3:3, and 2:2 The benchmark numbers mostly look solid. But there’s no getting away from the fact that some games run tangibly less smooth on Ryzen than Intel CPUs. I had a good hard look, for instance, at Total War: Attila and every Ryzen chip I’ve dabbled with exhibits some stutter from which Intel processors simply don’t suffer. I even sense checked what I was seeing with passing colleagues. It’s unmistakable. And you simply wouldn’t spot it in the relatively small gap in average frame rate. It’s not a total deal breaker and most games run without such hitches. But for me, it slightly undermines Ryzen’s appeal for a dedicated gaming rig. As it happens, the quad-core Ryzen chip is no worse and indeed knocks out similar frame rates to the six-core model in most games. So, of all the existing Ryzen processors, it’s perhaps the quad-core 1400 that’s most compelling. It’s cheapest and you lose little in games. For the same price from Intel you’re looking at the quad-core, quad-thread Core i5-7400, which rocks in at 3GHz base and 3.5GHz Turbo but no scope for significant overclocking. Overall, the choice between the Core i5-7400 and Ryzen 5 1400 is awfully tough. But if the decision is being driven primarily by gaming concerns, then with a somewhat heavy heart I still lean Intel. As things stand, I think you’re probably guaranteed a great gaming experience even with that relatively lowly Intel Core i5 processor. To be sure, the Ryzen chip will mostly be just as good. But just occasionally it will frustrate. The problem, therefore, is this. I reckon the mere knowledge that the Ryzen option might occasionally underperform can be quite damaging to one’s subjective enjoyment. I’m pretty sure every time a game felt a bit juddery I’d be wondering if the Ryzen CPU was to blame, even when the bottleneck was likely elsewhere. It’s a similar psychology that has always put me off multi-card graphics – that constant, niggling doubt whether it’s working properly. There’s not a lot in it, let’s be clear about that. But Intel retains its status as the go-to CPU option for gamers for now.

Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 00:19 GurtTractor says: From my experience of using my 1700x so far I can say that Total War Atilla is a bit of an outlier in terms of performance on these new CPUs. Empire Total War for example runs superbly, load is spread well across all threads, allowing me to run maximum size battles with no discernable slowdown. Total Warhammer has pretty consistent performance generally, though still can lag a bit in very large battles (maybe just because it is a bit more modern, though I get the impression that optimisation could be better). Atilla by comparison seems to run terribly, clearly lacking optimisation for high core count CPUs and/or the Ryzen architecture. Every other game that I have tried has seemed pretty solid on this CPU (Actually ARMA 3 is somewhat poorly optimised too). IMO the only two Intel chips that are worth buying at the moment are the low end Pentium G4560 which nearly matches the i3 chips at a much lower price, no competition from AMD for this one yet (Ryzen 3 should be soon), and the other chip that might be worthwhile is the i7 7700k which seems like the best chip if you really need that single core performance for high refresh gaming or productivity tasks that eat up clockspeed (I think some Photoshop stuff is mainly single core). Every other Intel CPU just seem seems like terrible value compared with the kind of general performance/price of the Ryzen chips. Like the 7600k vs the 1600 for example, 4 threads vs 12!! No 5Ghz overclock can really make up for that. Regarding the i5 7400 vs the 1400; you’re probably not going to be wanting to push the highest framerates with either CPU, but the eight threads of the 1400 vs the 4 of the 7400 should mean more consistent performance with most modern titles. Even if it is just for gaming I would definitely still go for the 1400 if that was my budget, here’s video comparing the two (not the most extensive of tests but I think it’s pretty fair) – link to youtube.com Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 06:45 SquarePeg says: Thanks for the link at the bottom of your post. That was a very solid comparison between the Ryzen 1400 and the i5 7400. Seeing how so many games only make use of four threads I’m very interested to see how the Ryzen 3’s perform. A quick check on pcpartpicker shows the R5 1400 as low as $159.99 here in the US. So I’m wondering how low AMD will go with say the R3 1100. $99 to $119 at launch seems to be a reasonable expectation. If the Ryzen 1100 can easily overclock to 3800mhz+ it would be an fantastic value. Also, given that a socket AM4 system will be upgradeable for several more generations of Ryzen CPU’s it makes the Intel i5 7400 a hard sell.

I have an issue with this article, and its one I share with damn near every review out there – with the notable exception of Anandtech’s Ryzen 5 review. Which is unbelievably detailed in the permutations of CPUs/GPUs/resolutions it tests. The issue I have is that its too simple to say Ryzen is worse than Intel at gaming. Yes it is true if you match it with an Nvidia 1080 and a high refresh rate 1080 resolution monitor. But it’s less true with an Nvidia 1070 or 1440p monitor(GPU constraint kicking in). Go 4k monitor and its irrelevant entirely. Have a bog standard 1080p monitor and a Nvidia 1080? What the hell are doing matching that with an Nvidia 1080 GPU? The monitor is pretty much maxed out. Drop the graphics drop down to an Nvidia 1060/Radeon 480 and below – the GPU is pretty much your entire constraint. And so – is Ryzen “worse” at gaming? Sure – if you have one helluva graphics card, and monitor to match. But if you’re like me on something like a mid-range RX470 and budget 1080p monitor? (which I would say is a lot of people) Well, you just picked up a CPU that smashes the comparable Intel i5 chip in a lot of ways, for effectively identical gaming performance.

Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 23:56 sweenish says: There is a reason that CPU benches are run like that. While you’re correct that no one runs a setup like that, the point is to benchmark the CPU, not the GPU. They did what they said they would, and benchmarked the CPU. It’s up to you to determine how the CPU performance stacks up against what you want to do, and you can do that, because you have accurate CPU performance numbers. Log in to Reply 13/05/2017 at 20:42 Kasjer says: Yeah, this article completely misses the point that those budget Ryzen processors won’t be the ones that PC enthusiast will drop money for – taking in to consideration that new mobo and in most cases, DDR4 RAM (still on DDR3 like many of us? Tough luck) will be required. It’s not very realistic that Ryzen 5 (and even less likely with 3) CPU will be paired with GTX 1080 (or better) card. Considering the value, I think Ryzen 5 range will be very popular choice in pre-built PCs aimed at people who are looking for inexpensive PC or mid-tier one at best. This means land of 1080p/1440p 60hz monitors, anything from GTX 1050Ti, RX460 up to GTX1060 and RX480. And in such PCs, these CPUs will do quite well in terms of gaming. Plus, as it was said, Ryzen is based on new socket, which will be supported in years to come, this opens room for future upgrades of such PCs… can’t say that about buying older/second hand Intel i5/i7 CPUs. I’m currently on old i5 4460, 8GB DDR3 and 1050Ti (recent upgrade from 750Ti). In about two-three years (three is a stretch), as games will move more in to multi-threaded territory, I would have to buy new PC. Most likely I still will be stuck in 1080p 60hz land as I game on 1080p60 48 inch Samsung TV I’m not willing to retire any time soon (it’s not that old model and works great, so there is no point…). I suspect this PC will be based on second gen Ryzen processor unless Intel comes with something that can offer similar value. No going back to red team cards though, I’m too fond of low-powered silent ones from nVidia! Silent card can make huge difference when you are gaming in living room. Log in to Reply 14/05/2017 at 00:20 Jeremy Laird says: The first problem you have is that I didn’t say Ryzen 5 was “worse” for gaming. I’m afraid you made that bit up. In fact, I said, “to be sure, the Ryzen chip will mostly be just as good.” I also said that just occasionally it will frustrate. I said that based on the objective fact that it underperforms in some games. How many? Probably only a small number overall. So my broad take is that for a primarily gaming rig, I’d still lean Intel. It’s my view that you’re tangibly less likely to find a given game runs surprisingly poorly on the Intel chip. I think the Intel chip will give a good experience in pretty much every game. The AMD chip will be mostly just as good, occasionally sometimes better, but critically it will occasionally be poor. The occasionally better bit isn’t of significant value it’s better than something that’s already good – ie it’s better objectively in terms of the benchmarks, but you likely won’t be able to subjectively sense that advantage. When Ryzen occasionally runs poorly, you very much can sense it and as I said in the article, it’s not something that’s obvious from looking at the benchmark numbers. I don’t want to overstate the problem. But I tried to explain my viewpoint in the main piece. It’s not that Ryzen is a disaster. It’s that the knowledge that it occasionally underperforms in games can undermine your confidence and enjoyment. And that’s why I would be reluctant to build a gaming system around it today. You needn’t agree with that – it’s a viewpoint, not a statement of fact. But dismissing it as though I had simply said Ryzen is “worse” is to misrepresent what I wrote. And you’re wrong about the 4K thing. When Ryzen doesn’t get on nicely with a game, you can feel it at 4K as well. I’ve tried it! Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 08:52 Replikant says: I beg to disagree. The Ryzen processors are really good value for the money compared to Intels offerings and, in addition, they are probably a lot more future-proof, considering that newer games tend to have improved multi-core support and Intel is ramping up the core-count as well. Secondly, it’s a new platform, performance is bound to improve (wait for Zen+, maybe). Third, total cost of ownership of a Ryzen system should be lower than an Intel system, as far as I know, the AM4 socket is going to be around for a while. But, most importantly: We are just coming out of a ten year stretch when Intel ruled the (PC) world and followed the Way of the Dinosaurs: Become greedy, fat and lazy and hurt the (PC) environment as whole in consequence. AMD does not beat Intel in raw performance (that would be the i7 7700k) but has an advantage in terms of performance / price. So, having seen what a monopolized market looks like, we should all seriously consider buying AMD chips once in a while. Most of us probably won’t, though, because in Jeremy’s words: “The problem, therefore, is this. I reckon the mere knowledge that the Ryzen option might occasionally underperform can be quite damaging to one’s subjective enjoyment.” Funnily enough, gaming theory favors Intel.

Log in to Reply 14/05/2017 at 00:34 Jeremy Laird says: The thing is, if Ryzen didn’t occasionally underperform, then we would all buy Ryzens. It’s not some irrational fear drummed up by Intel marketeers. The problem is that Ryzen is mostly fantastic, but where its performance is a little anomalous just so happens to take a form that slightly undermines it as a gaming CPU proposition. It’s by no means a terrible gaming CPU. It’s mostly a good gaming CPU. But if my life depended on a gaming CPU delivering a smooth subjective experience, I would choose Intel. In practice, if I was building a rig for myself today I would go Ryzen because I don’t have any PCs that are exclusively or really even primarily gaming PCs. They’re all multipurpose. I’d probably go with the 1700 and not need an upgrade for years. As an overall package, Ryzen is a really easy win. But for a system primarily for gaming, I still lean Intel for now. The margin isn’t huge. The trade offs are somewhat nuanced. But if I am providing advice about choosing a CPU for a primarily gaming rig, then that advice is that I think Intel remains the best choice today. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 09:15 Tyrmot says: I think as well while you *might* give intel the nod today, a very important consideration is that having 2 extra cores in your system right now is going to give a hell of a lot more future-proofing than going with 4. While it’s always wise to be a bit careful about future predictions, the scaling of software (including games) across more cores is, it’s reasonable to assume, pretty inevitable. Log in to Reply 14/05/2017 at 00:39 Jeremy Laird says: I would agree with that except games having been supposedly going multi-threaded for years. And yet even today so few scale well to those extras cores. I thought when the consoles went to eight weedy AMD mobile cores, that would change. But here we are years later and it still hasn’t happened. It will probably, maybe even certainly, happen one day. But will it happen within the typical lifecycle of a CPU bought today? Hard to say. And thus I lean towards buying what works best right now. it’s also worth noting that’s its’ probably going to be an awfully long time before a major game dev puts out a game that runs poorly on a quad-core Intel Kaby Lake CPU. I really can’t see that happening for many years. So, I’m largely unconvinced by the future proofing argument. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 09:27 Addie says: At the moment, having to buy a new motherboard and RAM (and probably a new graphics card to make use of the CPU) makes this look a not-too-compelling upgrade over my FX9370. But probably by the time they’re a significant improvement the prices will have come down a bit and any bugs will be squashed. I’d certainly be looking to buy an Ryzen system if I was building from new, though. Looks like the main difference between the x370 chipsets and the b350 chipsets is that the former supports SLI / CFx? I thought that dual graphics cards were basically dead in the water now anyway, being supported by very few new games, and that one graphics card at twice the price was a much more sensible investment? In which case, you can cut the price of the motherboard in half and buy more RAM instead. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 10:30 Arathorn says: The B350 motherboards might not be great for overclocking, at least that is how I understood it when I was researching for my build. Apart from that, it seems to be a great platform. It kind of depends on what you intend to do with it. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 13:09 GurtTractor says: I think most B350 boards should be fine for overclocking actually, you are more likely to hit the wall in the silicon lottery on your specific CPU than exceed the potential of the board chipset. Always a good idea to check reviews and forums for people’s overclocking results though. The main benefits to X370 are the greater number of ports and things like fan headers, many of the board’s VRMs and other components are in theory a little better but the difference is not huge. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 10:28 Arathorn says: An extra thing to keep in mind is that the 1600 comes with a bundled cooler, and the 1600X does not, so the plain 1600 is an even better price proposition than the X. RAM support for Ryzen is still somewhat crappy, making it hard to get fast RAM to work at full speed at the moment. And Ryzen benefits from fast RAM because its clock speed is linked to the communication speed between Ryzen’s two core complexes. I finally bought and built a PC with the 1600 and an RX 580 video card last week, and so far I’m very happy with it. I haven’t been able to test it with something heavy yet for lack of games, but Doom 2016 is on offer on Steam this weekend, so that sounds like a fine opportunity. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 16:05 Megadeth dude says: It’s a fallacy to assume you need “a decent X370 motherboard”. Why would you need at least that? You probably don’t know what the features are on an X370 and yet you’re assuming you need to spend the money for that. I personally got myself a cheap Gigabyte B350 Gaming (non-X even cheaper model) because I didn’t need crossfire or additional LED strip control. And this, for my Ryzen 7 1800X. And I am getting the most necessary feature, which is BIOS updates with new AGESA for memory compatibility updates. Disappointed in the article. Everyone, please watch AdoredTV’s vids on YouTube instead of taking advice from RPS.

Should be great for a portable PC or living room console replacement. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 20:20 wodin says: I’m considering an update to the 1600 chip. Currently have a AMD 6300.

Add A Comment If you happen to have an ASRock G41C-GS still in use or tucked away in your closet, this older motherboard for Intel Core 2 CPUs now has support for Coreboot to free the proprietary BIOS of the motherboard. Or if you don't but still have other parts available, this motherboard is still available from a few online shops. The ASRock G41C-GS may be an old motherboard with G41+ICH7 chipset for old Intel Core 2 processors, but surprisingly, you can still buy this motherboard new on Amazon for $83 USD if wanting to assemble a system that can be run using free software down to the firmware/BIOS. This motherboard has one PCI Express x16 slot, Serial ATA 2.0 ports, Gigabit LAN, and four USB 2.0 ports. There's also onboard VGA via the Intel GMA X4500 IGP. This is also one of the rare boards sporting both DDR2-800MHz and DDR3-1333MHz slots, albeit the DDR2/DDR3 memory cannot both be used simultaneously. With this Coreboot commit the initial support for this ASRock G41 motherboard is now in place. An initial limitation though is it doesn't appear to initialize when using DDR3 memory but only DDR2. The motherboard BIOS flashing does work with the Flashrom utility to make things easier. So if you have an older LGA-775 Intel CPU sitting around and looking to experiment with Coreboot, this ASRock motherboard is interesting given it can still be found new for less than $90 USD, compared to many other Coreboot desktop motherboard ports that tend to be for hardware still not readily available aside from used markets. If there's enough interest from premium subscribers / tippers I may be tempted to pick up this board myself for some Coreboot/Flashrom article on Phoronix as I should have some LGA-775 and DDR2 hardware still in the storage room.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Cheap gaming chips from AMD Home Hardware Hands on with AMD’s cheaper Ryzen 5 CPUs By Jeremy Laird on May 11th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Serving up eight pukka CPU cores at a price mere mortals can afford was easily the most compelling part of the initial AMD Ryzen proposition. But there’s been some filling out of the Ryzen range since last we alighted the subject. Specifically, a load of quad-core and six-core models have hit retail. They’re significantly cheaper than the beefy eight-core beasts. Might they actually make more sense for gaming than those slightly flawed eight-core chips? It’s little more than journalistic OCD and of absolutely no consequence to the end-user experience. But it very slightly winds me up that AMD, like Intel, spurns logic with its CPU nomenclature. AMD has announced that Ryzen will come in three flavours for the foreseeable. Ryzen 7 is the performance king, Ryzen 5 balances price and performance and Ryzen majors on value. There are also – again for the foreseeable – three different basic configurations for Ryzen. Eight-core, six-core and quad-core. You might think they map neatly and logically to Ryzen 7, 5 and 3. But no, that would make too much sense. Ryzen 5 includes both six and quad-core models. Ryzen 3 has yet to be detailed. Anyway, the first thing to note about the latest quad and six-cores models is that some make a lot more sense in value terms than others. There’s about a £60 gap between the priciest six-core Ryzen, the £260 Ryzen 5 1600X, and the cheapest eight-core chip, the Ryzen 7 1700, for instance. Add about 5% to those numbers (and all the prices that follow, for that matter) for US $ prices. Given that you’re certainly going to also need a new motherboard and very likely some sticks of memory, too, the 1700 is the no brainer in that comparison. After all, you’re looking at perhaps £150 minimum for a decent X370 motherboard plus maybe £75 for 8GB of memory and perhaps a few more quid for sundry items like a new cooler. Factor in the motherboard, RAM and more and the cost of upgrading to Ryzen certainly adds up The plain old Ryzen 5 1600 non-X surely makes more sense at £219 given that it’s also six cores and likewise unlocked for easy overclocking, if you care about that sort of thing. It’s fully a £100 jump to the cheapest eight-core model from the Ryzen 5 1600. A similar logic applies to the quad-core models. The Ryzen 5 1500X clocks in at £179, which looks likes poor value when you can have 50% more cores for just £40 extra. To be honest, even the £159 Ryzen 5 1400 quad-core chip looks like marginal value when you factor in the overall costs of upgrading to Ryzen. Predictably, I’ve had a go with the two most difficult to justify models in the Ryzen 5 range, the 1600X and the 1500X. The former is clocked at 3.7GHz base and 4GHz Turbo, the latter at 3.5Ghz base and 3.7GHz Turbo. Both are a little quicker than their core-count-parity but cheaper siblings, the 1600 and 1400. But the point is that they’re broadly representative of the gaming experience you can expect from the six and quad-core breeds. Gaming joy in a small box? As it happens, when Ryzen was originally announced it seemed like the six core models could be the bang-for-buck sweet spot. Relatively affordable, reasonably high clocks for single threaded performance, plenty of cores and threads for multi-threading. Remember, every Ryzen can process two software threads in parallel per core. That’s pretty much how it pans out in practice. The 1600X makes similarly priced Intel processors look very, very silly in any software that’s multi-threaded, like video encoding. The catch, as it has been from the get go with Ryzen, is that the gaming performance is ever so slightly patchy. All Ryzen CPUs use the full eight-core processor die and disable cores in the two quad-core modules within the chip in symmetrical pairs. So, the configurations are therefore 4:4, 3:3, and 2:2 The benchmark numbers mostly look solid. But there’s no getting away from the fact that some games run tangibly less smooth on Ryzen than Intel CPUs. I had a good hard look, for instance, at Total War: Attila and every Ryzen chip I’ve dabbled with exhibits some stutter from which Intel processors simply don’t suffer. I even sense checked what I was seeing with passing colleagues. It’s unmistakable. And you simply wouldn’t spot it in the relatively small gap in average frame rate. It’s not a total deal breaker and most games run without such hitches. But for me, it slightly undermines Ryzen’s appeal for a dedicated gaming rig. As it happens, the quad-core Ryzen chip is no worse and indeed knocks out similar frame rates to the six-core model in most games. So, of all the existing Ryzen processors, it’s perhaps the quad-core 1400 that’s most compelling. It’s cheapest and you lose little in games. For the same price from Intel you’re looking at the quad-core, quad-thread Core i5-7400, which rocks in at 3GHz base and 3.5GHz Turbo but no scope for significant overclocking. Overall, the choice between the Core i5-7400 and Ryzen 5 1400 is awfully tough. But if the decision is being driven primarily by gaming concerns, then with a somewhat heavy heart I still lean Intel. As things stand, I think you’re probably guaranteed a great gaming experience even with that relatively lowly Intel Core i5 processor. To be sure, the Ryzen chip will mostly be just as good. But just occasionally it will frustrate. The problem, therefore, is this. I reckon the mere knowledge that the Ryzen option might occasionally underperform can be quite damaging to one’s subjective enjoyment. I’m pretty sure every time a game felt a bit juddery I’d be wondering if the Ryzen CPU was to blame, even when the bottleneck was likely elsewhere. It’s a similar psychology that has always put me off multi-card graphics – that constant, niggling doubt whether it’s working properly. There’s not a lot in it, let’s be clear about that. But Intel retains its status as the go-to CPU option for gamers for now.

Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 00:19 GurtTractor says: From my experience of using my 1700x so far I can say that Total War Atilla is a bit of an outlier in terms of performance on these new CPUs. Empire Total War for example runs superbly, load is spread well across all threads, allowing me to run maximum size battles with no discernable slowdown. Total Warhammer has pretty consistent performance generally, though still can lag a bit in very large battles (maybe just because it is a bit more modern, though I get the impression that optimisation could be better). Atilla by comparison seems to run terribly, clearly lacking optimisation for high core count CPUs and/or the Ryzen architecture. Every other game that I have tried has seemed pretty solid on this CPU (Actually ARMA 3 is somewhat poorly optimised too). IMO the only two Intel chips that are worth buying at the moment are the low end Pentium G4560 which nearly matches the i3 chips at a much lower price, no competition from AMD for this one yet (Ryzen 3 should be soon), and the other chip that might be worthwhile is the i7 7700k which seems like the best chip if you really need that single core performance for high refresh gaming or productivity tasks that eat up clockspeed (I think some Photoshop stuff is mainly single core). Every other Intel CPU just seem seems like terrible value compared with the kind of general performance/price of the Ryzen chips. Like the 7600k vs the 1600 for example, 4 threads vs 12!! No 5Ghz overclock can really make up for that. Regarding the i5 7400 vs the 1400; you’re probably not going to be wanting to push the highest framerates with either CPU, but the eight threads of the 1400 vs the 4 of the 7400 should mean more consistent performance with most modern titles. Even if it is just for gaming I would definitely still go for the 1400 if that was my budget, here’s video comparing the two (not the most extensive of tests but I think it’s pretty fair) – link to youtube.com Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 06:45 SquarePeg says: Thanks for the link at the bottom of your post. That was a very solid comparison between the Ryzen 1400 and the i5 7400. Seeing how so many games only make use of four threads I’m very interested to see how the Ryzen 3’s perform. A quick check on pcpartpicker shows the R5 1400 as low as $159.99 here in the US. So I’m wondering how low AMD will go with say the R3 1100. $99 to $119 at launch seems to be a reasonable expectation. If the Ryzen 1100 can easily overclock to 3800mhz+ it would be an fantastic value. Also, given that a socket AM4 system will be upgradeable for several more generations of Ryzen CPU’s it makes the Intel i5 7400 a hard sell. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 08:08 Vesperan says: Slight correction for article – the base clock of the Ryzen 1600X is 3.6ghz, not 3.7ghz. I have an issue with this article, and its one I share with damn near every review out there – with the notable exception of Anandtech’s Ryzen 5 review. Which is unbelievably detailed in the permutations of CPUs/GPUs/resolutions it tests. The issue I have is that its too simple to say Ryzen is worse than Intel at gaming. Yes it is true if you match it with an Nvidia 1080 and a high refresh rate 1080 resolution monitor. But it’s less true with an Nvidia 1070 or 1440p monitor(GPU constraint kicking in). Go 4k monitor and its irrelevant entirely. Have a bog standard 1080p monitor and a Nvidia 1080? What the hell are doing matching that with an Nvidia 1080 GPU? The monitor is pretty much maxed out. Drop the graphics drop down to an Nvidia 1060/Radeon 480 and below – the GPU is pretty much your entire constraint. And so – is Ryzen “worse” at gaming? Sure – if you have one helluva graphics card, and monitor to match. But if you’re like me on something like a mid-range RX470 and budget 1080p monitor? (which I would say is a lot of people) Well, you just picked up a CPU that smashes the comparable Intel i5 chip in a lot of ways, for effectively identical gaming performance.

Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 23:56 sweenish says: There is a reason that CPU benches are run like that. While you’re correct that no one runs a setup like that, the point is to benchmark the CPU, not the GPU. They did what they said they would, and benchmarked the CPU. It’s up to you to determine how the CPU performance stacks up against what you want to do, and you can do that, because you have accurate CPU performance numbers. Log in to Reply 13/05/2017 at 20:42 Kasjer says: Yeah, this article completely misses the point that those budget Ryzen processors won’t be the ones that PC enthusiast will drop money for – taking in to consideration that new mobo and in most cases, DDR4 RAM (still on DDR3 like many of us? Tough luck) will be required. It’s not very realistic that Ryzen 5 (and even less likely with 3) CPU will be paired with GTX 1080 (or better) card. Considering the value, I think Ryzen 5 range will be very popular choice in pre-built PCs aimed at people who are looking for inexpensive PC or mid-tier one at best. This means land of 1080p/1440p 60hz monitors, anything from GTX 1050Ti, RX460 up to GTX1060 and RX480. And in such PCs, these CPUs will do quite well in terms of gaming. Plus, as it was said, Ryzen is based on new socket, which will be supported in years to come, this opens room for future upgrades of such PCs… can’t say that about buying older/second hand Intel i5/i7 CPUs. I’m currently on old i5 4460, 8GB DDR3 and 1050Ti (recent upgrade from 750Ti). In about two-three years (three is a stretch), as games will move more in to multi-threaded territory, I would have to buy new PC. Most likely I still will be stuck in 1080p 60hz land as I game on 1080p60 48 inch Samsung TV I’m not willing to retire any time soon (it’s not that old model and works great, so there is no point…). I suspect this PC will be based on second gen Ryzen processor unless Intel comes with something that can offer similar value. No going back to red team cards though, I’m too fond of low-powered silent ones from nVidia! Silent card can make huge difference when you are gaming in living room. Log in to Reply 14/05/2017 at 00:20 Jeremy Laird says: The first problem you have is that I didn’t say Ryzen 5 was “worse” for gaming. I’m afraid you made that bit up. In fact, I said, “to be sure, the Ryzen chip will mostly be just as good.” I also said that just occasionally it will frustrate. I said that based on the objective fact that it underperforms in some games. How many? Probably only a small number overall. So my broad take is that for a primarily gaming rig, I’d still lean Intel. It’s my view that you’re tangibly less likely to find a given game runs surprisingly poorly on the Intel chip. I think the Intel chip will give a good experience in pretty much every game. The AMD chip will be mostly just as good, occasionally sometimes better, but critically it will occasionally be poor. The occasionally better bit isn’t of significant value it’s better than something that’s already good – ie it’s better objectively in terms of the benchmarks, but you likely won’t be able to subjectively sense that advantage. When Ryzen occasionally runs poorly, you very much can sense it and as I said in the article, it’s not something that’s obvious from looking at the benchmark numbers. I don’t want to overstate the problem. But I tried to explain my viewpoint in the main piece. It’s not that Ryzen is a disaster. It’s that the knowledge that it occasionally underperforms in games can undermine your confidence and enjoyment. And that’s why I would be reluctant to build a gaming system around it today. You needn’t agree with that – it’s a viewpoint, not a statement of fact. But dismissing it as though I had simply said Ryzen is “worse” is to misrepresent what I wrote. And you’re wrong about the 4K thing. When Ryzen doesn’t get on nicely with a game, you can feel it at 4K as well. I’ve tried it! Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 08:52 Replikant says: I beg to disagree. The Ryzen processors are really good value for the money compared to Intels offerings and, in addition, they are probably a lot more future-proof, considering that newer games tend to have improved multi-core support and Intel is ramping up the core-count as well. Secondly, it’s a new platform, performance is bound to improve (wait for Zen+, maybe). Third, total cost of ownership of a Ryzen system should be lower than an Intel system, as far as I know, the AM4 socket is going to be around for a while. But, most importantly: We are just coming out of a ten year stretch when Intel ruled the (PC) world and followed the Way of the Dinosaurs: Become greedy, fat and lazy and hurt the (PC) environment as whole in consequence. AMD does not beat Intel in raw performance (that would be the i7 7700k) but has an advantage in terms of performance / price. So, having seen what a monopolized market looks like, we should all seriously consider buying AMD chips once in a while. Most of us probably won’t, though, because in Jeremy’s words: “The problem, therefore, is this. I reckon the mere knowledge that the Ryzen option might occasionally underperform can be quite damaging to one’s subjective enjoyment.” Funnily enough, gaming theory favors Intel. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 09:35 identiti_crisis says: Established PC programming practices favour Intel. Console game development probably points to the future of the bigger, high-sys-req PC games. This is where AMD’s long game with heterogeneous computing starts to pay off.

Log in to Reply 14/05/2017 at 00:34 Jeremy Laird says: The thing is, if Ryzen didn’t occasionally underperform, then we would all buy Ryzens. It’s not some irrational fear drummed up by Intel marketeers. The problem is that Ryzen is mostly fantastic, but where its performance is a little anomalous just so happens to take a form that slightly undermines it as a gaming CPU proposition. It’s by no means a terrible gaming CPU. It’s mostly a good gaming CPU. But if my life depended on a gaming CPU delivering a smooth subjective experience, I would choose Intel. In practice, if I was building a rig for myself today I would go Ryzen because I don’t have any PCs that are exclusively or really even primarily gaming PCs. They’re all multipurpose. I’d probably go with the 1700 and not need an upgrade for years. As an overall package, Ryzen is a really easy win. But for a system primarily for gaming, I still lean Intel for now. The margin isn’t huge. The trade offs are somewhat nuanced. But if I am providing advice about choosing a CPU for a primarily gaming rig, then that advice is that I think Intel remains the best choice today. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 09:15 Tyrmot says: I think as well while you *might* give intel the nod today, a very important consideration is that having 2 extra cores in your system right now is going to give a hell of a lot more future-proofing than going with 4. While it’s always wise to be a bit careful about future predictions, the scaling of software (including games) across more cores is, it’s reasonable to assume, pretty inevitable. Log in to Reply 14/05/2017 at 00:39 Jeremy Laird says: I would agree with that except games having been supposedly going multi-threaded for years. And yet even today so few scale well to those extras cores. I thought when the consoles went to eight weedy AMD mobile cores, that would change. But here we are years later and it still hasn’t happened. It will probably, maybe even certainly, happen one day. But will it happen within the typical lifecycle of a CPU bought today? Hard to say. And thus I lean towards buying what works best right now. it’s also worth noting that’s its’ probably going to be an awfully long time before a major game dev puts out a game that runs poorly on a quad-core Intel Kaby Lake CPU. I really can’t see that happening for many years. So, I’m largely unconvinced by the future proofing argument. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 09:27 Addie says: At the moment, having to buy a new motherboard and RAM (and probably a new graphics card to make use of the CPU) makes this look a not-too-compelling upgrade over my FX9370. But probably by the time they’re a significant improvement the prices will have come down a bit and any bugs will be squashed. I’d certainly be looking to buy an Ryzen system if I was building from new, though. Looks like the main difference between the x370 chipsets and the b350 chipsets is that the former supports SLI / CFx? I thought that dual graphics cards were basically dead in the water now anyway, being supported by very few new games, and that one graphics card at twice the price was a much more sensible investment? In which case, you can cut the price of the motherboard in half and buy more RAM instead. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 10:30 Arathorn says: The B350 motherboards might not be great for overclocking, at least that is how I understood it when I was researching for my build. Apart from that, it seems to be a great platform. It kind of depends on what you intend to do with it. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 13:09 GurtTractor says: I think most B350 boards should be fine for overclocking actually, you are more likely to hit the wall in the silicon lottery on your specific CPU than exceed the potential of the board chipset. Always a good idea to check reviews and forums for people’s overclocking results though. The main benefits to X370 are the greater number of ports and things like fan headers, many of the board’s VRMs and other components are in theory a little better but the difference is not huge. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 10:28 Arathorn says: An extra thing to keep in mind is that the 1600 comes with a bundled cooler, and the 1600X does not, so the plain 1600 is an even better price proposition than the X. RAM support for Ryzen is still somewhat crappy, making it hard to get fast RAM to work at full speed at the moment. And Ryzen benefits from fast RAM because its clock speed is linked to the communication speed between Ryzen’s two core complexes. I finally bought and built a PC with the 1600 and an RX 580 video card last week, and so far I’m very happy with it. I haven’t been able to test it with something heavy yet for lack of games, but Doom 2016 is on offer on Steam this weekend, so that sounds like a fine opportunity. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 16:05 Megadeth dude says: It’s a fallacy to assume you need “a decent X370 motherboard”. Why would you need at least that? You probably don’t know what the features are on an X370 and yet you’re assuming you need to spend the money for that. I personally got myself a cheap Gigabyte B350 Gaming (non-X even cheaper model) because I didn’t need crossfire or additional LED strip control. And this, for my Ryzen 7 1800X. And I am getting the most necessary feature, which is BIOS updates with new AGESA for memory compatibility updates. Disappointed in the article.

Ryzen and the AM4 motherboards require DDR4 memory, which is sadly quite expensive at the moment.

It has features that the majority don’t need, so perhaps you can save a few bucks with a 350 instead. That price difference might just as well go towards a 1600X.

Still not persuaded by AMD to buy their inferior cheap ass crap with awful drivers decade after decade written in a basement by a bunch of students somewhere in India. After a bunch of “value” videocards AMD is a “never again” company in my books. Sure it’s an awful thing to say but AMD, sadly, still isn’t a valid competition nor for NVIDIA nor for Intel and I see no point in supporting them just in case things get better somewhere in the future.

Cracking the challenging market is the next big task for Intel CEO Brian Krzanich , who is chasing an aggressive strategy to get its mobile processors into more handsets. At Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this week, Intel rebranded its Atom line with an easier-to-remember naming scheme for various models in the product family, to increase market visibility of the processors. The company also introduced the new Atom X3 chip, which will initially go into smartphones, and Atom X5 and X7 chips, which will be in tablets. A few handsets with the Atom X3 chip, code-named Sofia, were shown at Mobile World Congress. Sofia is the result of a speedier chip development strategy formulated by Krzanich to make Intel more competitive in smartphones. Krzanich sat down with the IDG News Service to talk about smartphones, wearables, services and the company's plans in new markets. Below is an edited version of the transcript. IDG: Intel last year beat its goal of shipping 40 million tablet chips. How do you approach the smartphone market? Krzanich: First we have to get the right products for the smartphone space. It's a tighter form factor, you've got to be just right. We've been working really hard on our modems with our [XMM] 7260, which was our first LTE modem; we announced 7360, which is the next-generation modem. You saw us announce our Sofia product line, which is really the first fully integrated SOC [system on a chip] with modem, all of the connectivity, all in one piece of silicon. IDG: Are you setting expectations for smartphones, like you did with tablets? Krzanich: When I think about cell phones, I think about two paths to market. One is going to be with our partners, especially some our of key OEM partners like Asus and Lenovo, and then our silicon partners with Rockchip and Spreadtrum. The other path is -- you can see us doing it already with the tablet space -- where we bring in some of the innovation we originally had for PCs and bring it down the stack. You saw RealSense [depth-sensing camera]. RealSense was originally created for the PC and 2-in-1 devices; we brought it down to tablets. You see us bringing McAfee down from the PC and it has made its way to wearables and cellphones as well. I want to enter this market smartly. It's not one you can force your way in. IDG: How often will mobile chips be upgraded? Krzanich: Right now there's a series of products. There's the Sofia line -- we're trying to come out with multiple products per year. At least one to two products per year within Intel on the Sofia line. Then you go to Cherry Trail, it will be like every other year. IDG: After early issues, are you comfortable with the 14-nanometer manufacturing process? Krzanich: Silicon-wise, the yields are strong: I'd call it a nicely maturing technology that we're able to launch any product that we need to on. Cherry Trail is just coming out, and there's a series of SKUs that will come out over the next couple of quarters. I'm pretty happy with Cherry Trail and there's a series of more products, including Skylake in the back half of the year, which is a "tock" on 14 nanometers which really brings a new level of performance. IDG: There were some announcements around end-to-end services, cloud and security related to mobile at MWC. Is this an indication that Intel mobile devices are being closely linked to Intel hardware in data centers? Krzanich: We are trying to do Wi-Fi gateways and things like that, trying to make it so you can recognize an Intel device faster. We have that silicon pathway, we're connecting silicon to silicon. We always make it so that we're agnostic to some extent, that we can connect to anybody and we can connect back to anybody's device. On services, security is a good example. We think there are connections between security and the silicon that we can make around secure boot, understanding the CPU ID and making sure that you are who you are and where you are, and True Key and those kinds of things where we could do multifaceted identification. In those cases, there is a connection between the silicon and the service, so we want to provide that mainly to use all of the capability of all our silicon. IDG: There's a roadmap for tablets and smartphones. Can you establish a roadmap for wearable products? Krzanich: I think there's a difference between wearables [and] most of those other devices. I'm a firm believer that if a bunch of tech companies design and build wearables, they will have limited success. There will be a bunch of tech people wearing them and the average person is not going to be a good user. People have been in the fashion industry and have worn fashion products for years because they are very good and know what people want. We have to go through those partnerships. We've established partnerships with key players in key areas. Luxottica for eyewear, Fossil for wrists, you can go through the list.

Intel has hailed Skylake as its most important chip architecture in a decade and now says that it will be used in mainstream Core i3, i5 and i7 PC processors as well as Xeon server chips. The first Skylake chip is expected to be Core M, designed to be used in Windows as well as Android tablets and hybrids. The first Skylake PCs are expected to be available in the second half this year. Dell, for example, has said it will launch Skylake laptops in that time frame. Intel's chips are used by most PC makers. Intel is expecting big graphics performance improvements, longer laptop battery life, and better CPU performance with the new chips. Skylake will also allow users to wirelessly charge laptops, connect to monitors, and transfer data to peripherals. "When I look at the range of what Skylake's able to deliver from the Core M level all up to the i7 and Xeon, it's just going to be a fantastic product," said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, in an interview with the IDG News Service at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Up to now, Intel had confirmed only that Skylake would be going into Core M chips. Intel is hurrying to get Skylake released and close the curtains on the troubled Broadwell architecture, which was delayed due to manufacturing issues and reached mainstream PCs just two months ago. Intel usually updates its chips on a yearly basis but Broadwell is expected to have a shorter-than-expected life since Skylake is just around the corner. Many PC makers like Dell and HP have skipped Broadwell chips in some laptops and are waiting for Skylake. Intel wants to move quickly on Skylake because of demand from the company's customers, which are mainly device and PC makers. "We didn't want to delay it, we talked to our customers, they didn't want to delay it. Everybody's just saying no, full speed ahead," Krzanich said. Skylake is an architecture upgrade -- which is called a "tock" -- and will be made using the 14-nanometer process. PCs with Skylake will be able to run the Windows, Chrome and Android operating systems. Intel could divulge more details about Skylake chips at the Computex trade show in Taipei, which will be held in June.

It's a list that is based on a photo from a power-point presentation, and seems the real deal e.g. Kaby- and Skylake-X processors. Interesting is that Intel is adding Core i9 processors. Intel likely releases Core i9 procs to battle the AMD Ryzen processors and their pending (TBA) processor line. The top of the line flagship model will be a Core i9 7920X, this processor will be a 12-core part with 24 threads and that confirms all rumors and discussion we have had in the past few months. However 12 cores is less then what AMD will be releasing with their 16-core / 32 threaded Ryzen Whiteheaven processors. Furthermore you are going to see a Core i9 7900X which will be a 10c/20t part. Then the Core i9 7820X, a 8c/16t part and then in the Core i7 line you may expect the Core i7 7740K and 7640K quad core processors. The Skylake X processor will all get a max 1MB L2 cache per core, that is a big increase coming from Skylake Core i7 7700k likely to increase IPC performance on the quad-core procs. The Core i9 processors are going to support quad-channel memory at 2667 MHz and will get a 160 Watt TDP, a maximum 16.5 MB L3-cache and 44 available PCI-Express lanes for inter-component connectivity. We think that in June this line will see an announcement, likely not at Computex. Albeit we do expect to see some stuff behind closed doors. It is also stated that the top flagship Core i9 7920X will be available as late as August. That again would validate an earlier rumor that Skylake-X biggest part being available move to August. Here is what the rumored linup would look like:   Intel C/T Clock Base Clock Boost L3 Cache PCIe lanes Architecture Core i9 7920X 12 / 24 n/a n/a 16,5 MB 44 Skylake-X Core i9 7900X 10 / 20 3.3 GHz 4.3 GHz (Turbo 2.0) 4.5 GHz (Turbo 3.0) 13,75 MB 44 Skylake-X Core i9 7820X 8 / 16 3.6 GHz 4.3 GHz (Turbo 2.0) 4.5 GHz (Turbo 3.0) 11 MB 28 Skylake-X Core i9 7800X 6 / 12 3.5 GHz 4.0 GHz 8.25 MB 28 Skylake-X Core i7 7740K 4 / 8 4.3 GHz 4.5 GHz 8 MB 16 Kaby Lake Core i7 7640K 4 / 4 4.0 GHz 4.2 GHz 6 MB 16 Kaby Lake   As much as we can argue and discuss, I would like to add a massive disclaimer, non of this information has been validated and thus please do take it with a grain of salt and as always, apply some common sense.  Rate this story Rating: 1 ...

Want above 4 cores, go to HEDT on 299 schmidtbag Maha Guru Posts: 1505 Joined: 2012-11-10 #5431140 Posted on: 05/12/2017 09:01 PM I remember back when Intel was first rumored to release a 6c/12t CPU and people called it the "i9". Turned out to just be called "i7", and I think Sandy Bridge started it. They had 8c/16t Haswell-E CPUs that they also called i7. There are 10c/20t Broadwell-Es also called i7. Meanwhile, AMD release a 4c/8t Ryzen 5, and now, 5 years later, Intel decides to cram their 6-core models under the i9 name, and they're creating a 4c/4t CPU under i7. This doesn't make sense - all this is doing is making AMD's mid-range stuff look better. It's all just so backwards. Pentium is slowly replacing i3 and now i7 is slowly replacing i5. To me, the logical approach for Intel would've been: Atom - 1c/2t Celeron - 2c/2t Pentium - 2c/4t i3 - 4c/4t i5 - 4c/8t or 6c/6t (IIRC, the latter seems to be a reality) i7 - 6c/12t or 8c/8t i9 - 8c/16t or better, or 4c/8t or better with quad channel memory Kaarme Master Guru Posts: 634 Joined: 2013-03-10 #5431145 Posted on: 05/12/2017 09:19 PM With Intel's pricing scheme, the Core i9 7920X might reach close to 2000 dollars. warlord Master Guru Posts: 639 Joined: 2012-10-22 #5431147 Posted on: 05/12/2017 09:30 PM So, it will not be earlier than 2018/2019 to see 6 and/or 8 mainstream cores from Intel Corp. 4 cores is their best bet for simple everyday peasants? AMD is gonna love Intel's greed. I can see more and more people going red. Blue is getting away from our hearts every minute since Ryzen's launch.

Same as those mobile chips... 2C/4T Intel Core i3-7100U 2.4GHz, 3MB Cache, $281 2C/4T Intel Core i5-7300U 2.6GHz ~ 3.5GHz, 3MB Cache, $281 2C/4T Intel Core i7-7500U 2.7GHz ~ 3.5GHz, 4MB Cache, $393 Yes, difference between i5 and i7 is 100MHz in base clock. Practical difference after 10minutes of heavy load is: i3 ~ 2.4GHz; i5 ~ 2.6GHz; i7 ~ 2.7GHz Btw. if anyone wonders how can there be notebooks with mentioned i3 when better i5 chip costs same... Yes, same good old intel: "Wanna i5, get this number of i3s."

There's nothing Intel can do, which will please you. You will still call Intel evil and the destroyer of your dreams. For others - I think news are great. Of course they mean Intel is not going anywhere from the top, which hugely irritates AMD fans, but they also mean we can finally expect some nice performance bumps from Intel, not another tock-tock-tock minor increases. Also I don't believe Intel will go crazy with prices. They indeed have some competition this time, so probably won't be happy to lose out just because of price difference. cryohellinc Master Guru Posts: 523 Joined: 2014-10-20 #5431155 Posted on: 05/12/2017 10:00 PM Great news, 8/16 most likely will be the sweet spot. chronek Member Guru Posts: 118 Joined: 2016-09-19 #5431156 Posted on: 05/12/2017 10:05 PM Just think, if not amd you would never see i9 Loophole35 Ancient Guru Posts: 7856 Joined: 2011-09-21 #5431159 Posted on: 05/12/2017 10:16 PM Two observations.

Btw, looking at all this makes current Intel quad-core lineup outdated already. I see lots of people saying this and i don´t understand why. Only 10 or 20% of consumers needs more than a quad or a dual core! For most people having a quicker cpu or one with more cores is totally useless because they don´t need it!!! It´s amazing the quantity of people falling for the "more cores" marketing started by Ryzen... Or by cell phone chip makers to be more accurate. I just hope that at least AMD can make profit of this... SOLLERHOLLER1 Newbie Posts: 12 Joined: 2017-04-16 #5431171 Posted on: 05/12/2017 10:59 PM that is the truth to the matter really...

In the first six months of the year, more than 43 per cent of Intel's hires in the US were women and minorities, up from 32 per cent at the end of 2014, the company reported in its first mid-year diversity report. At 43 percent, Intel said it was surpassing the 40 per cent diversity hiring goal it set for itself for the full year. Apple, meanwhile, boosted its hiring of women by 65 per cent globally over the past year, to 11,000, the company said in its second annual report. Apple made gains particularly in the US, where nearly half of its hires since January were women, African-American, Hispanic, or Native American, the company said. The lack of women and minorities in Silicon Valley has become a hot-button issue in the male-dominated technology industry. A sex discrimination lawsuit brought by former Reddit CEO, Ellen Pao, against her former employer has also brought attention to how women are treated in Silicon Valley. Over the past year, other companies including Google and Facebook have started to share numbers around their hiring of women and minorities. Companies have pledged to add more diversity to their ranks and expand their recruiting efforts. By 2020, Intel wants the diversity of its workforce to mirror the availability of workers by demographic. The numbers released by Apple and Intel, however, show that the overall representation of minorities at the companies has not dramatically changed. Between 2014 and 2015, Apple only grew its number of female workers from 30 per cent to 31 per cent. "We are proud of the progress we've made, and our commitment to diversity is unwavering," said Apple CEO Tim Cook, in the company's report. But, he said, "we know there is a lot more work to be done." Zach Miners covers social networking, search and general technology news for IDG News Service. Follow Zach on Twitter at @zachminers.

Fancy a Mac or Windows 10 PC with Intel's new processors code-named Skylake? That will soon be possible: Intel will launch its first chips based on the new architecture in the first week of August. The first Skylake chips will be high-end gaming processors that can be overclocked, and will be launched on or before August 7 during the Gamescom conference in Cologne, Germany, which runs from August 5 to 9, according to a source familiar with Intel's plan. Intel will also shed more technical details about Skylake at its Intel Developer Forum, which will be held between August 18 and 20 in San Francisco. Intel will talk about how Skylake will improve the experience of using Microsoft's Windows 10, which will be in PCs starting July 29. Intel declined to comment on the launch of Skylake chips. But one can expect Skylake chips for mainstream desktops and laptops to come in quick order during or after IDF. The first Skylake chips will be branded "Sixth Generation Core" processors and offer "great performance and reduced power consumption," Intel said on an IDF technical session page. Intel's goal with Skylake is to make PC usage more convenient. With that in mind, Intel has talked about "wire-free" technologies in Skylake so PCs could charge and transfer data to peripherals wirelessly. Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Asus will ship Windows 10 PCs based on Skylake in the second half this year. It's not clear when the chip will reach Macs, and Intel tends not to speak on Apple's behalf. Some Skylake features are already known. Asus last month showed all-in-ones and mini-desktops based on Skylake with support for the new DDR4 memory and USB 3.1 data transfer protocol. PCs based on Skylake will also have ports based on Thunderbolt 3, a new technology that runs on USB Type-C cables and can transfer data at 40Gbps (bits per second). One interesting technical session at IDF will detail overclocking the Skylake gaming desktop chips being announced in early August. In other sessions, Intel will demonstrate Skylake PCs running Cortana and Windows Hello, a new Windows 10 biometric feature in which faces, fingerprints or eyes can replace passwords. Skylake also has new virtualization, boot, system management and lockdown features, which will be detailed in technical sessions. Intel has hurried to get Skylake to PCs so it can close the curtains on the troubled predecessor Broadwell chips, which were delayed due to manufacturing issues on the 14-nanometer process. Intel has resolved manufacturing issues so Skylake processors are rolled out on time. Skylake will take on AMD's chips code-named Carrizo, which are now reaching PCs. AMD is rushing to release its next-generation chips based on a CPU core code-named Zen, which will be in PCs next year.

Brad Chacos (PC World (US online)) 10 July, 2015 00:52 - - - - print email Distributors ACA Pacific Alloys Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology Com1 International Dicker Data Dynamic Supplies Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology Samsung Communications Synnex Topstar Computer International Wholesale IT XiT Distribution Comments IBM reveals world's first 7nm processor View all images How far can we push Moore's Law? It's starting to become a concerning question as processors push into almost infinitesimally small process nodes. Intel's 14-nanometer Broadwell chips suffered from lengthy delays, stuttering Intel's vaunted tick-tock manufacturing schedule. TSMC, the company that manufactures graphics processors for AMD and Nvidia, has been stuck at the 28nm node for years now. Intel plans to push into 10nm in 2017, but IBM's looking beyond that, and just revealed the world's first working 7nm processor--but it took some pretty exotic manufacturing to get there. Creating a working 7nm chip required moving past pure silicon, IBM revealed. IBM--working with GlobalFoundries, Samsung, SUNY Polytechnic Institute, and others--carved the transistor channels out of silicon-germanium (SiGe) alloy in order to improve electron mobility at such a small scale. Intel has also said 10nm will be last gasp for pure silicon chips. IBM and co. had to turn to cutting-edge lithography techniques to etch features onto the chip. The companies utilized extreme ultraviolet lithography, which Intel has also been investing heavily in for years now. The details behind EUV get complicated, but essentially, it's a beam of light with a far narrower wavelength (read: width) than current lithography tools. The benefits of moving to a smaller feature-etching tool when working on a chip with 7nm components is obvious. The consortium also managed to stack the chip incredibly tightly, with a 30nm transistor pitch, which helped it achieve a nearly 50 percent surface area reduction over today's top-end chips. The 7nm SiGe chips are nowhere near production-ready, but when they're cleared for commercial use around 2017, IBM says they'll result in "at least a 50 per cent power/performance improvement for next generation... systems" on account of all those process improvements. Ars Technica has a wonderfully detailed write-up on the manufacturing process for IBM's 7nm chips. But that's not even the most impressive number. IBM says that when the industry embraces 7nm manufacturing techniques, processors will be able to be stuffed with an incredible 20 billion transistors. By comparison, Intel's new Broadwell-U processors pack "only" 1.9 billion transistors.

The companies hope to take High Performance Computing (HPC) beyond its traditional niche in areas like oil and gas exploration, financial services and life sciences and extend it to new markets including retail, personalized medicine and even police work. The new Intel technologies include an upcoming version of its many-core Xeon Phi processor code-named Knights Landing, a network fabric technology called Omni-Path, and Intel's Lustre software for high-performance storage. Those components will allow HP to offer a wider range of HPC configurations, including some that HP will tailor for particular industries, said Bill Mannel, who runs the HPC & Big Data business unit at HP. They will also allow it to boost performance for existing customers. The work with HP isn't exclusive, so expect Dell and Lenovo to employ the technologies as well. In fact, Intel says more than 50 system builders will adopt them, with the first systems coming to market later this year. According to Mannel, current technologies, including Intel's standard Xeon server chips, can't keep pace with the volumes of data HPC customers are trying to process. "A lot of the standard technologies, including x86, are running out of gas relative to customers' ability to process data more rapidly," he said. Xeon Phi is intended to address that. The Knights Landing version will have as many as 72 cores, with two vector processing units per core, Charles Wuischpard, head of Intel's HPC division, told reporters in a briefing last week. Intel will demonstrate the new chip in Frankfurt this week at the International Supercomputing Conference, where the announcements with HP are being made. For certain applications, such as video transcoding and seismic processing, workloads can be broken up and spread out over those many cores, speeding overall throughput, Manning said. The faster chips need a network that can keep pace, and Intel says its Omni-Path technology offers a switch messaging rate up to 73 percent faster than InfiniBand EDR. It's an evolution of the True Scale Fabric that Intel acquired when it bought QLogic's InfiniBand business several years ago. Omni-Path will be available in commercial systems in the fourth quarter, Wuischpard said, and Knights Landing is expected to follow soon after. HP isn't giving a ship date yet for its new servers. It wants to offer something differentiated from other vendors, including potentially unique processor models with its water-cooled systems. It seems likely they'll be out in the first half of next year. It expects to deploy the new Intel technologies up and down its HPC line. For its high-end Apollo 6000 and 8000 systems it will use an Omni-Path "switch blade" that sits inside the server enclosure, allowing it to get maximum performance. For the Apollo 2000 at the low end, it will probably offer an external top-of-rack switch, though it's still figuring that out, Mannel said. One emerging area that can benefit from HPC is deep learning, a type of advanced computing used by Google and Facebook for tasks like image recognition and natural language processing. Other industries are starting to see value in deep learning, according to Mannel, including large retailers who are using it to identify patterns in customer buying behavior, and police departments that can use it for facial recognition. Hospitals are also using deep learning for "precision medicine," he said, where they analyze the genome to figure out more precise treatments and therapies for patients. "It's big data, but it's also about performance. You want to get results quickly so you can start treatments quickly." One challenge is that few businesses have expertise with HPC clusters, so Intel and HP are opening a new center in Houston where potential customers can work with them to figure out which applications are suitable for the new architecture and build proof-of-concept systems. The Texas center will complement an existing one in Grenoble, France. Software also needs to be ported to take advantage of Xeon Phi's many cores. Intel didn't do a great job providing tools for that with earlier versions of the chip, Wuischpard admitted, and this time around it will have an improved SDK with scripts, sample code and more, he said. It will talk more about that at Intel's IDF conference in September. The new HPC technologies are part of what Intel calls its "scalable systems framework." In April, it said the framework will be used to build a supercomputer called Aurora for the Department of Energy that will be delivered in 2018 and have a peak performance of 180 petaflops. "Rather than building just big, one-off systems, the idea is to take those technologies and learnings and make sure they're available across the entire industry," Wuischpard said.

Revenue from Intel's Client Computing Group, which sells processors for desktops, laptops and smartphones, fell 14 percent from this time last year to $7.5 billion, the chip maker said Wednesday. Its Data Center Group, which makes the Xeon server processors, performed better, but not well enough to offset the ongoing slump in the PC industry. Intel's total revenue for the quarter ended June 27 was $US13.2 billion, down 5 per cent from a year earlier. Net income was $US2.7 billion, down 3 per cent. Its revenue and profit both beat the modest expectations of Wall Street analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue from the Data Center Group was up 10 percent year-over-year to $US3.9 billion, Intel said. Its sales into the Internet of Things market also expanded, to $US559 million. But Intel gets most of its revenue from chips used in PCs, and that market isn't doing well. Worldwide sales were down 12 per cent last quarter, IDC said recently, in part because buyers are holding out for Windows 10. CEO Brian Krzanich expects the Windows 10 launch, along with Intel's upcoming Skylake processor, to generate "excitement" in the PC market in the second half of the year, a company statement said. It's unclear how big the Windows 10 effect will be, however. That's because Microsoft is providing the OS as a free upgrade to existing users, giving people less reason to go out and buy a new PC. The slow PC market is also hurting Intel's smaller rival AMD, which warned last week that revenue this quarter would be lower than previously forecast. AMD is due to report its results on Thursday. Both Intel and AMD have struggled to profit from smartphones and tablets, the fastest growing parts of the computing market. Intel changed how it reports its financial results at the start of the year, making it harder to see how its smartphone business is doing. It used to break those numbers out separately, but it now rolls them in with laptop and desktop sales. James Niccolai covers data centers and general technology news for IDG News Service.

Intel gave an update on its chip-making plans Wednesday and revealed it will take longer than expected to introduce a new manufacturing process that will yield smaller, faster transistors. Intel plans to produce its first "10-nanometer" processors in the second half of 2017, CEO Brian Krzanich said Wednesday. Intel hadn't given a start date for the process before, but many observers had expected it to arrive some time next year. To make up for the delay, Intel has added a new chip design to its roadmap that will appear in the second half of next year, manufactured on its current 14-nanometer process. Code-named Kaby Lake, the new design will be "built on the foundations" of Skylake, Intel's latest microarchitecture, but with performance improvements, Krzanich said. The change is a big deal for Intel, and for the PC and server industry at large. Each new manufacturing process leads to smaller, faster transistors, and the regular introduction of new techniques is what's kept Moore's Law ticking along. In recent years, Intel has alternated between introducing a new manufacturing process one year and a new processor architecture the next, producing what's known as its "tick, tock" cadence. With 10nm pushed out to 2017 and the new chip design coming next year, it will now be on a "tick tock tock" cadence for the first time. The current 14nm process is the tick, the Skylake microarchitecture is the tock, and now Kaby Lake will be the second tock. Speaking on Intel's earnings call, Krzanich noted that this won't be the first time the pace of Moore's Law has shifted. When Gordon Moore made his famous prediction in 1965, he said the number of transistors on a chip would double each year for the following decade. In 1975, he updated that prediction to say transistor count would double every two years. "These transitions are a natural part of the history of Moore's Law and are a by-product of the technical challenges of shrinking transistors while ensuring they can be manufactured in high volume," Krzanich said. The pace at which Intel introduces new manufacturing processes had already been slowing, he noted, with roughly 2.5 years passing between its 22nm process and the launch of its current, 14nm process. The nanometer figure refers loosely to the size of the smallest circuits etched into the surface of the chips. By saying the 10nm process will arrive in 2017, Intel is making official a pattern that has already been under way. It did this partly to give its PC-making customers more certainty about what's coming up. "The feedback from customers said, 'We want you to be predictable,'" Krzanich said. "That's as important as getting to that leading edge." He didn't provide details for why the 10nm process has been pushed out, but he suggested the problems were similar to the hiccups it had with 14nm, which also arrived a bit later than expected. "I'd call it similar to what happened on 14 nanometer," Krzanich said. "On all these technologies, each one has its own recipe of complexity and difficulty." "The lithography is continuing to get more difficult as you try to scale," he said, referring to the process by which transistor patterns are drawn onto the silicon disks used to produce chips. He confirmed that Intel does not plan to use a lithography technique called EUV, or extreme ultraviolet, at 10 nanometers. Intel would like to get back to a two-year cadence when it moves from 10 to 7 nanometers, Krzanich said, but each process is unique, presenting its own challenges in materials science and other areas, so it's too early to say. "We'll always strive to get back to two years," he said. James Niccolai covers data centers and general technology news for IDG News Service. Follow James on Twitter at @jniccolai.

Lenovo, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Dell have announced faster servers with Intel's new Xeon E5-2600 v4 chips based on the Broadwell architecture. The chips have up to 22 cores and are significantly faster than the Haswell-based Xeon E5-2600 v3, which shipped last year. Dell measured a 28 percent improvement in server application performance based on SAP benchmarks on the new chips, compared to performance with the Haswell server chips. Lenovo benchmarks showed a 44 percent CPU improvement. Benchmark results vary depending on the application. The chips can be slotted into existing servers that have the Xeon E5-2600 v3 processor. Intel made the new chips socket compatible so companies wouldn't have to purchase new servers. Many servers announced on Thursday are incremental upgrades with the same sockets but the new chips. Intel had to compromise on some chip improvements to ensure the new chips were compatible with current technologies in servers. Intel didn't make major Ethernet, storage or I/O upgrades. Upgrades to technologies like Intel's emerging OmniPath interconnect -- which link up a multitude of memory, processing, storage and networking units -- will be available with a separate add-on card. HPE's new Proliant Gen9 servers stand out for "persistent memory," called NVDIMM, which merges DRAM and flash storage. HPE has put flash and DRAM chips on memory modules, which could help applications run faster. Persistent memory has the speed of DRAM and the ability to retain data once a computer is turned off. Data usually moves between storage and memory when programs are executed, but having both on NVDIMM helps run programs faster. HPE believes NVDIMM could benefit applications like databases, where in-memory processing is a fast-growing trend. For example, the SAP HANA database management system relies more on in-memory computing and less on storage. HPE says NVDIMMs provide 24 times more IOPS (input-output per second), and six times more bandwidth than SSDs based on the high-speed NVMe (nonvolatile memory express), in which drives are slotted in PCI-Express 3.0 ports. Dell tweaked some of its servers to fit more graphics processors, which could provide a performance boost for more visual and scientific tasks. It also implemented a new cooling system in its PowerEdge R730 server, starting at US$3,059, because the new 20- and 22-core Xeon chips could generate more heat. There are more mix-and-match combinations of memory and storage available in its Power R730XD server, starting at $3,899. Lenovo refreshed its two-socket System x3650 M5, System x3550 M5, Flex x240 M5 and NextScale nx360 M5 servers. The servers are roughly 23 percent faster in Hadoop performance and up to 30 percent faster in data encryption. Intel has made on-chip improvements that could boost the speed of some security tasks by up to 70 percent. Pricing for those servers wasn't immediately available.

The Xeon processor E7-8890 v4 chip is part of the Xeon E7-8800 v4 family of chips that Intel announced on Monday. It was announced just a week after Intel made headlines with a new 10-core Core chip for gaming code-named Broadwell-E. The 24-core chip will go, in many cases, into monster performer four- to eight-socket servers. An eight-socket system could have up to 192 cores, with support for up to 24TB of memory. In a data sheet, Intel estimated a 192-core system with 2TB of memory and two hard drives to be priced at about US$165,000. Add 24TB of memory, and the server price could skyrocket. About 18 server makers are coming out with 51 systems running the new processors, said Pat Buddenbaum, general manager of enterprise IT solutions in Intel’s Data Center Group. Lenovo and Dell will come out with integrated servers with storage and networking components. Some servers from other vendors -- likely SGI and Fujitsu -- could have up to 32 sockets, meaning systems could support up to 768 CPU cores. Seven new chips with between four to 24 cores are being introduced in the Xeon E7-8800 v4 family. The chips will succeed processors from the Xeon E7 v3 family, which were announced last year and had up to 18 cores. Except for Intel's Xeon Phi supercomputer chips, the Xeon E7 chips are Intel's fastest performing processors. Intel is placing more emphasis on Xeon chips as it reduces its reliance on PCs. The company had a 99.2 percent market share in servers in 2015, according to IDC, but that share could fall next year if ARM servers are adopted in wider numbers and as AMD releases new x86 server chips. The Xeon E7 chips are meant for high-uptime systems used by banks, financial organizations, and other industries. For example, banks use existing Xeon E7 v4 servers for real-time fraud detection and transaction analysis, Buddenbaum said. A number of servers with the new chips could be pooled to create a powerful deep-learning cluster, which could more precise analysis from oceans of data. It could be used to help autonomous cars recognize signs and images, or to run complex algorithms to make correlations in genomics. Intel's biggest focus for Xeon E7 v4 is in-memory processing, used for applications like databases. SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft, which sell analytics and database software, are placing more emphasis on in-memory processing because it's faster than continuously shuffling data between the CPU, memory, and storage. The chips support DDR4 memory. The Xeon E7-8800 v4 family plays into Intel's other areas of focus -- the Internet of Things, memory, and silicon photonics -- because powerful chips could help advance those technologies. Servers could be toolboxes where data collected from IoT clients could be analyzed, Buddenbaum said. Intel is putting emphasis on FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays), but Buddenbaum said E7 v4 chips aren't designed for use with them. FPGAs are a better match for the company's Xeon E5 v4 servers, which have between one to four sockets. The new chips are based on the Broadwell architecture and are socket compatible with the Xeon E7 v3 chips, meaning they can be plugged into existing servers using those sockets. The chip has similar error correction features to the predecessor chips. The 24-core Xeon E7-8890 v4 has a frequency of 2.2GHz, 60MB of cache, and draws 165 watts of power. The other chips in the E7 8800 line have clock speeds from 2.1GHz to 3.2GHz, cache between 45MB to 60MB, and draw between 140 watts and 165 watts of power. Intel also announced Xeon E7-4800 v4 series chips, which have between eight and 16 cores, draw 115 watts of power, and have 20MB to 40MB of cache. The chips have slower internal bandwidth but are designed for lower priced high-performance computers.

At Computex in Taipei Intel shed more light on the new chip technology, a much hyped successor to Intel's family of Broadwell family of chips. Here are five things we learned: 1) Skylake chips won't be released when Windows 10 becomes commercially available on July 29, so PCs with a combination of the new OS and chip technology won't be immediately available, said Kirk Skaugen, senior vice president and general manager of the PC Client Group at Intel, during an interview at Computex. Intel has built Skylake to work hand-in-glove with Windows 10, which among other new features offers biometric authentication that will allow a user's fingerprint or face to replace a typed password. Skaugen declined to provide a specific release date, but Skylake could be the centerpiece announcement at the Intel Developer Forum in mid-August. PCs could follow soon after. 2) Mobile and desktop chips will be released at about the same time: Intel will launch a whole line of Skylake chips for tablets, laptops and desktops without a long wait between releases, Skaugen said. Intel usually releases chips in phases, based on form factors. For example, Core M tablet chips were the first Broadwell processors, with laptop chips following four to five months later. Core M may likewise be the first Skylake chip, though this time, laptop and desktop processors would come swiftly afterward. 3) Manufacturers have Skylake PCs details set: Asus at Computex announced Zen AiO all-in-one desktops that have support for DDR4 memory and USB 3.1. The company also showed mini-desktops capable of 4K video. Intel showed a 7.8-inch millimeter thick tablet with a USB Type-C port on stage during a keynote at Computex. Dell has said it will ship Skylake chips in the second half of the year. 4) A wide variety of leading brands are on board with Wire-free computing: Intel wants to eliminate wire and cable clutter from PCs by offering wireless charging and data transfer circuitry in Skylake chipsets and motherboards. Users will be able to recharge laptops by placing them on tables or surfaces that support wireless charging based on magnetic resonance technology. Intel is getting restaurants, airports, cafes, appliance makers and car companies to install wireless charging surfaces. Hilton hotels, Emirates airlines, San Francisco Airport, Starbucks, Haier and Jaguar Land Rover are among those who have signed up. Another Intel plan to replace ports in laptops with wireless data transfer technology is a bit further out. Laptops will be able to wirelessly connect to portable hard drives, monitors and other external peripherals through a technology called WiGig, which can transfer data at 7Gbps (bits per second). But peripherals will also need WiGig circuitry, and it may be a while until that happens. 5) Thunderbolt 3 will start with Skylake: Intel is forecasting that about 30 laptops, tablets and desktops will ship by the end of the year with Thunderbolt 3, a new data transfer technology running on USB Type-C cables. At 40Gbps (bits per second), Thunderbolt is two times faster than its predecessor, and four times faster than USB 3.1 technology. It will also be possible to connect USB devices into the Thunderbolt ports. Do you need the blazing speed of Thunderbolt? Perhaps, if you want to connect two 4K displays to your PC simultaneously.

Their name for it? Fast Array of Wimpy Nodes (FAWN). The project, which the researchers detail in a paper presented at the Association for Computing Machinery's Symposium on Operating Systems Principles this week in Montana, provides massively parallel access to data by balancing I/O and computational resources. The researchers say it can handle 10 to 100 times as many queries -- while using the same amount of energy – as a typical disk-based cluster. The FAWN network boasts 21 nodes, featuring processors such as Intel's Atom and 4GB compact flash cards, and at peak utilization can drain less power than a 100-watt light bulb. Each node can serve up to 1,300 256-byte queries per second, according to the paper. "FAWN systems can't replace all of the servers in a datacenter, but they work really well for key-value storage systems, which need to access relatively small bits of information quickly," said David Andersen, CMU assistant professor of computer science, in a statement.  He leads the project along with Michael Kaminsky, senior research scientist at Intel Labs Pittsburgh. Such energy-efficient data center technology is important given that organizations are squeezing more and more hardware into data centers and trying to keep energy usage and costs under control while doing so. The National Science Foundation, along with Google, Intel and Network Appliance, are backing the project financially. The FAWN paper, recognized as the best paper at the ACM event, is but one of many projects discussed at the symposium. Other eye-catchers include: RouteBricks: Exploiting Parallelism to Scale Software Routers, largely an Intel Research project Automatically Patching Errors in Deployed Software, by researchers from VMware, MIT and other organizations; and Fabric: A Platform for Secure Distributed Computation and Storage, out of Cornell University Arrow APEX Puts Partners in F1 Pole Position More from Arrow ECS Follow Us Twitter LinkedIn Join the ARN newsletter!

Sign up now Menu ARN Secretive Intel quietly woos makers in China Secretive Intel quietly woos makers in China In addition to PCs and mobile devices, Intel is now trying to get hardware companies in China to develop drones, robots and IoT devices Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 15 April, 2016 05:29 - - - - print email Distributors Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology Dicker Data Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Synnex Comments Intel is in transition right now: An executive shakeup this month laid the path for new boss Venkata Renduchintala to put his imprint on the company's PC, Internet of Things and software operations. So no wonder the vibe at this week's Intel Developer Forum in Shenzhen was mellow. Intel kept the show a low-key affair, choosing not to bring it to the attention of a worldwide audience, unlike previous years. But IDF Shenzhen remains an important event on Intel's calendar. China is a huge market, and it's also a place where the chip maker encourages small hardware shops in the alleys of Shenzhen to experiment with PC, mobile and now, IoT ideas. There's also perhaps a strategic reason Intel didn't make much noise about IDF Shenzhen. The company this year has been generally quieter than usual, with fewer news announcements. There are also many questions brewing around products such as its Atom chip, which is struggling in smartphones and hasn't been updated for servers since 2013. Intel instead is trying to bring some coolness to its brand by presenting its technologies at events like Fashion Week, the Grammy Awards, the Superbowl and the X-Games, where it showed off its server, wearable, and IoT technologies. The chip maker even has its own reality TV show called America's Greatest Makers to reach out to the community of enthusiasts and do-it-yourselfers. Enthusiasts have not warmed up to Intel, relying instead on underdogs like ARM on top-selling developer boards like Raspberry Pi 3 and BeagleBone. But small Chinese hardware companies have benefited from Intel's efforts to fund PC and mobile device development and are loyal to the chip maker. Intel in 2014 said it would sell 40 million tablet chips through subsidies worldwide, which helped Chinese makers in particular develop innovative devices and bring tablet prices down. Intel's move at the time was an attempt to catch up with ARM, which ruled the then-hot tablet market. Intel sold 46 million tablet chips that year but took billions of dollars in losses in its mobile division. The outcome was considered a blunder for CEO Brian Krzanich, who has since opted not to make public declarations about aggressive sales goals. However, judging from recent announcements, Intel believes it has a good chance with Chinese companies in the IoT area. Chinese hardware companies are usually quick to hop on to the latest trends, and Intel wants its loyal Shenzhen base to consider developing robots, drones, sensor devices, and other home and industrial automation products. Intel at the show announced a "Makers Go Big" initiative, which "aims to foster the next generation of Chinese inventors and entrepreneurs," the company said. Intel will continue to invest in the Intel Mass Makerspace Accelerator Program, announced at last year's IDF in China to fund and support makers in China. It is also exploring opportunities to work with local partners to replicate its Greatest Makers television program in China. That would be the first expansion for the TV show outside the U.S. Also announced were the Robotics Development Kit for robotics and the Aero Platform for drones. At the center of both development kits is the RealSense 3D camera, which can recognize objects and determine their size, shape and contours . The 3D camera is like giving robots and drones a computerized eye to assist in navigation and avoid obstacles. The Robotic Development Kit can be ordered from Intel's website for US $249 and it will ship later this quarter. It includes a credit-card-sized board from Aaeon with an Intel Atom x5 Z8350 CPU, integrated graphics, 4GB of DDR3 RAM, 32GB of storage, an HDMI slot, Gigabit Ethernet, two USB 2.0 ports, a USB 3.0 port, 40-pin GPIO port, a camera interface and an eDP (embedded DisplayPort) slot to connect a display. The Aero Platform will have a flight controller, accelerometer, pressure sensors and programmable GPIOs. It will also have modules to support communications, storage, depth and vision capabilities. It will run on an Atom quad-core processor and be available in the second half 2016. Further details and price of the developer hardware will be available at a later date. Intel also announced key software tools for its existing developer boards and SDKs. A software kit for the Curie wearable development hardware will allow developers to exploit USB and Bluetooth Low Energy features. In addition, Intel unveiled an experimental RealSense Cross Platform API, which will offer tools for camera capture and "high-level vision functionality." That could aid robots and drones with image recognition. It will work with Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. A separate RealSense SDK that offers a comprehensive suite of computer vision algorithms is already available for use with the 3D camera.

She shared some observations on the state of the economy and said that by the end of 2017, two-thirds of global CEOs would have digital transformation at the centre of their corporate strategies. “By 2018, one third of businesses in the top 20 of every industry will be disrupted by digitally transformed competitors,” she added. Burleigh stressed that no industry was immune to digital disruption and used the changing nature of the workforce as an example of this. “By 2020, 50 per cent of the workforce will be millennials and 60 per cent of these millennials will rotate jobs within a three year period,” she said. The Intel chief mused that this landscape was a far cry from the work environment she came up through. Burleigh is a 17-year veteran of Intel.

The new MacBook is priced starting at $US1299, the same as the initial model introduced more than a year ago. With a new graphics chipset - Intel's HD Graphics 515 - the MacBook boasts a 25 per cent improvement in graphics performance, Apple claimed. The 1.1-GHz Skylake processor's lower-power demands should add an hour to the time between charge: Up to 10 hours of browsing, up to 11 hours of video playback. Apple also increased the speed of the flash memory that composed the 256GB SSD (solid-state drive) storage, from 1600MHz to 1886MHz. The MacBook was the first Apple notebook to get a processor from Intel's 14-nanometer Skylake line, the successor to 2014's "Broadwell." Other laptops, including Microsoft's Surface Book -- which debuted last year -- preceded Apple's to market. The MacBook form factor remains the same, with the system tipping the scale at 2 lbs. and taking the tape at a half-inch thick. Apple added rose gold - aka pink - to the previous color choices of gold, silver and space gray to match the available options for the iPhone and iPad. Most other features stay static as well, including the single USB-C port - the most controversial of Apple's design choices for the MacBook -- and the high-resolution 12-inch display that maxes out at a 2304-by-1440-pixel resolution. Both iterations of the MacBook - the more expensive option remains the $1,599 model with a 1.2-GHz CPU and 512GB of storage - are equipped with 8GB of RAM. Apple also said it has increased the standard RAM of the MacBook Air notebooks to 8GB. Now nearly ignored by Apple, the 2.4-lb. Air has not been refreshed since March 2015, and has not changed its design since 2006. It remains the only part of Apple's Mac line that lacks a "Retina" high-resolution display, whether standard or as an option. The new MacBook went on sale Tuesday on Apple's online store - early in the day, however, the purchase page was inaccessible - and was to hit its retail chain and some authorized resellers on Wednesday.

The layoffs account for about 11 percent of employees worldwide. Intel is also consolidating work locations worldwide in a move the company hopes will save it US $750 million this year. Data center equipment will be Intel's growth area growing forward, generating a large part of Intel's profits and potentially making up for the declines in the PC market. Growth drivers will include memory and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology, which the company added from its recent $16.7 billion acquisition of Altera, CEO Brian Krzanich said. Intel will take a charge of $1.2 billion in the second quarter related to the restructuring. Intel had about 104,800 employees in 72 countries at the end of the 2015, according to the company's annual IT performance report. The slowdown in PC shipments has hurt Intel's chip business. Worldwide PC shipments totaled 60.6 million units in this year's first quarter, declining by 11.6 percent compared to the same quarter a year ago, IDC said this month. Intel is also floundering in its efforts to break into the mobile device market despite an aggressive approach. Its Atom chips are in a handful of smartphones, but the company is doing better in a fast-declining tablet market. Servers are Intel most profitable unit but are also under growing threat from rival chip makers. Working with Rackspace, Google, one of the largest server buyers in the world, is designing a server based on IBM's Power 9 architecture and is also reportedly backing an ARM server chip from Qualcomm. Google's moves threaten Intel's dominance. Intel is chasing the IoT market through acquisitions and by wooing hobbyists and makers. It has spent millions of dollars producing the TV show America's Greatest Makers, which is an advertising vehicle for its development boards. Intel has innovations such as Optane storage in the pipeline that could improve PC usage. Krzanich is also shaking up the management to shape the company in his vision. He recently appointed a new second in command in former Qualcomm executive, Venkata Renduchintala, who will lead the PC, Internet of Things and software business as president of the client and IoT businesses and Systems Architecture Group. Renduchintala's appointment squeezed out former PC business chief, Kirk Skaugen, who is leaving the company. The mobile chief Aicha Evans has already left the company, and IoT chief Doug Davis is retiring. The layoffs were announced on the same day Intel announced its first-quarter results. Intel reported a profit of $2 billion for the first quarter of 2016, growing by 3 percent compared to the same quarter a year ago. It reported revenue of $13.7 billion for the quarter, growing by 7 percent compared to the year-ago quarter. Revenue for the Client Computing Group, which deals in PC and mobile chips, was $7.5 billion, up 2 percent year-over-year. Revenue for the Data Center Group, which deals in server chips and data-center equipment was $4 billion, growing by 9 percent. Intel also announced that Stacy Smith was moving from the role of chief financial officer to lead sales, manufacturing and operations. He will take the position once a replacement is found.

Mark Hachman (PC World (US online)) 20 April, 2016 20:00 - - - - print email Distributors Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology Com1 International Dicker Data Hills Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology Synnex Comments Right now, inside Intel’s headquarters, a deadly serious game of “Gladiator” is pitting Intel’s client products against one another. During its quarterly earnings call , Intel said it now expects the PC market to decline in the “high single digits” throughout all of 2016, rather than the mid-single-digit drop it previously expected. IDC and Gartner said recently that the PC market dropped between 10 and 12 percent during the first quarter. “Our projection of the PC market...is more cautious than third-party estimates,” chief financial officer Stacy Smith told analysts. That’s justification enough to begin extricating Intel from the PC market, Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich told analysts. As it has for years, Intel appears to be banking on the continued success of the high-margin data center business, while it seeks a new frontier that could evolve into the next PC: the Internet of Things. With the continuing decline of the PC, tablet, and smartphone businesses, Intel is coldly evaluating which products will stay, and which will fall. All in all, Krzanich described a strategy for Intel where underperforming products are abandoned and its assets repurposed away from the PC and into Intel’s new frontiers, including the data center (or cloud) and the Internet of Things. When that process is completed, Krzanich said, the company believes it will yield the highest amount of revenue per employee ever. What this means: Reading the tea leaves, it seems likely that Intel will gently remove itself from the low end of the PC market and concentrate on higher-margin products. This could be a shot in the arm to AMD, who might be able to make up through volume what it’s lost to Intel throughout the years. But the bottom line is that there’s going to be some brutal infighting going on soon within Intel, where jobs will be on the line. Intel’s bailing out of the PC market...or is it? “We’ve talked about this transformation, that we’re moving from client-centric...to a company that’s focused more on a much broader set of products, and really focused around the cloud,” Krzanich said. “The cloud, and all the connected devices that connect to that cloud. And that connectivity that brings those devices to the cloud. And that includes the PC, but it’s much more than that.” Currently, Krzanich said, 40 percent of Intel’s revenue and 60 percent of its profit margin already come from outside the PC. “It’s time to make this transition and to push the company over all the way to that strategy and that strategic direction,” Krzanich added. “That’s why we wanted to do it now.” Intel targets 2-in-1s, gaming PCs What this doesn’t mean, however, is that Intel is refusing to invest in the PC market. On the contrary, Krzanich identified several key areas where Intel plans to lead. Both 2-in-1s and high-end gaming PCs are growing at double-digit rates, he said. Set-top boxes, where Intel is gaining share, are becoming more like PCs. All three segments are areas where Intel will likely double down. “It’s not just about cutting cost in the client area,” Krzanich explained. “We think we can become more focused.” As part of the process, the company has asked Renduchintala to evaluate which areas of the PC are worth investment. Renduchintala joined Intel last November, as president of a newly created Client and Internet of Things (IoT) Businesses and Systems Architecture Group. Part of his job, according to Krzanich, is to evaluate which parts of Intel’s roadmap make sense, and to report back in the “near future," Krzanich said. Krzanich warned that not all products would survive the process. “I’m sure as we’re going through this that there will be some products that we’ll exit from,” he said. Manufacturing issues give Intel headaches Separately, Intel is grappling with its inability to keep up with Moore’s Law, which originally predicted a shrink in process technology every two years. Intel's actual record has varied from 18 to 36 months. As such, Intel has added a stopgap part, “Kaby Lake,” due to begin production later this year on its existing 14-nm technology. But a leaked memo also points to several new products in development: Kaby Lake and its successor, the 10-nm Cannon Lake, but also Ice Lake (the second 10-nm chip) and two others, Coffee Lake and Glenview, which the memo did not describe. One question will be whether Coffee Lake will be a third 10-nm part, or the first 7-nm product. The layoffs will have no impact on Intel’s process roadmap, Krzanich said. “I can truthfully tell you that we’re constantly trying to get back to two years,” Krzanich added.

The company is quickly distancing itself from basic tablets, a market it prized as little as two years ago, to go after detachable devices, hybrids, and high-end tablets that can double as PCs. Intel could also axe some Atom tablet chip lines that brought the company success two years ago. Intel this week laid off 12,000 people as part of a restructuring plan that could also include cuts in some product lines. Tablet chip shipments for Intel were down 44 percent in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the same quarter last year, the company said during its quarterly earnings call late Tuesday. That translates into roughly 4 million tablet chips shipped in the quarter, according to an estimate by analyst Dean McCarron of Mercury Research. It's a small number even in a declining tablet market. IDC is estimating worldwide tablet shipments will drop to 195 million this year, falling by 5.9 percent compared to 2015. Intel "had the same thing with netbooks," with the company targeting the market as it rose quickly before collapsing suddenly, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. Netbook shipments exploded in 2008, before starting to decline in 2010 after users started to move to tablets like Apple's iPad. Netbooks were criticized for being slow and small, and Intel's chips for those PCs were slowly phased out by 2013. A market for netbook-like PCs has re-emerged in recent years with Google's Chromebooks. In the tablet market, ARM-based processors offer a better mix of performance and power efficiency, and investing in low-cost Atom chips for tablets isn't worth Intel's time if profits are a priority, McGregor said. The failure in tablets is among a handful of recent short-sighted moves by Intel's management. Intel has invested in a number of failed efforts over the years, including WiMax and a TV service called OnCue, ultimately acquired by Verizon. Intel is now focusing on the Internet of Things, data centers, and connectivity. Intel aggressively chased the tablet market in 2014, and the company said it would sell 40 million tablet chips that year. It subsidized its Atom chips for tablet makers, particularly small Chinese companies, which helped bring tablet prices down. The goal was to catch up with ARM, which dominated the then-hot tablet market. Intel met its goals, selling 46 million tablet chips that year. But it lost money on the chips sold and took billions of dollars in losses in its mobile division. Realizing the blunder, Intel in the following year focused on profitability instead of volume and market position. The results are showing. Intel sold fewer, but higher-priced, tablets, which contributed to a profit for the mobile division in the first quarter this year. Intel is now looking to cut products as it restructures operations, and some low-cost and low-volume Atom tablet chips could be casualties. The company may elect to not release a successor or refresh its current Cherry Trail line of Atom chips, which are used mostly in mainstream tablets and some low-cost PCs. The company hinted as much at IDF Shenzhen, where Intel emphasized its focus on tablet-PC hybrids. A new lineup of upcoming Pentium and Celeron chips called Apollo Lake will succeed the existing Atom X5 Cherry Trail line of chips, said Navin Shenoy, senior vice president and general manager of Intel’s Client Computing Group, during a keynote. Apollo Lake, which will be released in the second half this year, will primarily serve as a successor to the existing line of Pentium and Celeron chips, called Braswell, for low-cost PCs and hybrids. But by merging the Cherry Trail chips with Pentium and Celeron, Intel may remove the confusion people may have about its low-end tablet and PC chip lines. About 100 laptops and hybrids with detachable tablet screens are being designed using Apollo Lake, said Shenoy, who showed some prototypes on stage. Some of the products being designed may not ultimately ship. Intel's Skylake-based Core M chip is looking more like the company's tablet and two-in-one chip of the future. Atom tablet chips are getting squeezed out as PC and tablet makers prefer the faster Core M chips, which offer close to the same battery life as Cherry Trail. The Core M chips are used in higher-priced tablets, a market Intel is targeting. Cherry Trail is used in Microsoft's HoloLens headset, which delivers an estimated 3.3 hours of battery life. That's a sign that Intel could redirect its future Atom chips to headsets, wearables, and other IoT devices. Intel also makes Atom chips for smartphones, but won't give up on that market considering the company's heavy focus on cloud hardware, McCarron said. Intel's Atom chips are installed in just a few handsets, and the company is trying to catch up with ARM. But there is space for Intel to compete in the smartphone market, with more than a billion units shipped each year. Intel made a valiant effort to succeed in tablets, but now it's time for them to chase more profitable markets like IoT and data centers, McGregor said.

Shipments dropped below 300 million for the first time since 2008, and IDC declared it the worst year in history. That explains a lot about what happened at Intel this week. The chip maker has been reducing its dependency on PCs for some time, preferring to focus on its more successful datacentre business. But the announcement that it would lay off 12,000 people is a sign that Intel is finally turning a corner. "Intel appears to have decided that it can’t wait any longer for a hoped-for revitalisation of traditional PC markets," as Pund-IT analyst Charles King put it. Intel will still make PC chips for growth areas like 2-in-1s and gaming. But the cutbacks will allow it to increase investments in forward-looking technologies like silicon photonics, FPGAs, its 3D Xpoint memory and the Internet of Things. Put another way: Intel missed the boat on smartphones, but there's always the cloud. "We're in the middle of some pretty big changes in the industry and we've seen the emergence of handsets as the primary client. Intel's piece of the business is the back-end, which is the cloud," said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. Here's a look at the markets that Intel CEO Brian Krzanich says Intel will focus on moving forward. 2-in-1s: Demand for convertible PCs -- those with keyboards that can be detached or that fold back to make a tablet -- is growing in an otherwise down market. Products like the Surface Pro spurred other PC makers to get on board. Intel provides 2-in-1 designs to PC makers to spur the market, and it will continue investing in low-power chips like the Core M that power them. Gaming rigs: Expensive laptops and desktops for gaming are also doing well, though they're only a sliver of the overall PC market. Intel reckons gamers upgrade their system every two years, or much more often than regular users. That means it can sell more of its pricey chips. A 10-core, Core i7-6950X could be on its way soon, and it's heavily anticipated by gamers. However, Intel still lacks a world class GPU, which is vital for gaming. 3D Xpoint: Intel promises huge speed boosts for this new technology developed with Micron. Intel claims it will be up to 1,000 faster than NAND flash, and 10 times denser than conventional memory. We'll see about that when it arrives. 3D Xpoint components are sampling now, and Intel says the technology will ship Optane-branded SSDs by the end of the year, with memory for PCs and servers to follow. FPGAs: Intel is thinking beyond CPUs with field programmable gate arrays, a type of co-processor that can be programmed to perform specific tasks very quickly. It got the technology from its $16.7 billion acquisition of Altera last year. Intel is shipping test chips that pair an Altera Arria 10 FPGA with a Xeon E5-2600 v4 processor in a multi-chip module. Ultimately, Intel will solder the FPGAs on the same die as its server chips. It also plans to sell FPGAs for cars, robots, drones and IoT devices. Xeon server CPUs: Let's not forget the humble x86 server chip. Servers have been driving Intel's revenue through the PC market slump and generating most of its profits. It faces new competition from IBM Power and even ARM-based processors, but the Xeon is still king of the data center. Intel says it takes a rack-scale view -- providing everything from interconnects to boards to networking and storage products -- which it hopes will help it stand out. Silicon photonics: Forget copper wires, Intel sees the future of data transfer using beams of light. That's the premise of silicon photonics, which the company hopes to initially implement at the rack level in servers. Optical data transfers will help servers communicate faster, and potentially change how systems are built by decoupling processing, storage and memory into different boxes. After delays, Intel will ship modules to implement silicon photonics later this year. Internet of Things: It's early days for IoT, and Intel is trying to find its place in the market by offering a whole suite of products, including not just chips but also analytics software and even cloud services to help collect and analyze all that data. It's trying to avoid a repeat of the smartphone market, which passed it by. Its efforts also include providing components for 5G networks, which could provide long-range communication for some IoT devices.

Sign up now Menu ARN How AMD is resurrecting itself as a formidable rival to Intel How AMD is resurrecting itself as a formidable rival to Intel AMD's Zen chips, an x86 licensing strategy, and world-class GPUs could be keys for the company to be the competitor it once was Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 23 April, 2016 05:44 - - - - print email Distributors Avnet Technology Solutions Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology Com1 International Dicker Data Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology Sektor Synnex Comments The rivalry between AMD and Intel peaked during the first decade of the 2000s, when the companies consistently challenged each other with a stream of chip innovations. Since then, AMD lost its way, and today it barely registers as a threat to Intel. But the competitive landscape could start changing as early as next year. Intel's x86 chips are installed in most PCs and servers, and AMD has been losing market share for years. AMD's chip technology has fallen behind Intel's after some ill-advised architectural changes, acquisitions, and manufacturing problems. Intel's x86 processor market share was 87.7 per cent the fourth quarter of 2015, growing from 86.3 per cent a year earlier. AMD held just a 12.1 per cent share, falling from 13.6 per cent, according to Mercury Research. But AMD has made some smart moves recently. It decided to cut its reliance on the declining PC market in 2013, something Intel finally acknowledged this week while cutting 12,000 jobs. AMD also has emphasized custom chips and hit paydirt with specialized processors for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. AMD is now poised to threaten Intel's market dominance. Only time will tell if AMD will be successful, but here are some technologies and business decisions AMD is relying on to better compete with Intel. Licensing x86 architecture It's possible we'll see PCs and servers using AMD-based chips not made by company, with AMD now licensing its top-line chip architecture. The long-running two-horse x86 race could then include more players, a development bound to hurt Intel more than AMD. Licensing is an easy way for AMD to expand the installed base of its processor technology while generating licensing revenue. AMD this week licensed its upcoming Zen server chip architecture to THATIC (Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co. Ltd.), a consortium of public and private Chinese companies, as part of a joint venture. Lead in graphics AMD has a valuable asset that Intel doesn't possess: the world-class Radeon and FirePro GPUs. Graphics processors are hot, with sales of gaming PCs growing in an otherwise slumping market. Intel wants to focus on gaming but only has a good CPU. AMD still has to compete with Nvidia in GPUs, but the company has a combination of hardware technologies that put it in a better position than Intel in virtual reality and gaming. Versatile CPU assets If you want an ARM chip for PCs or servers, AMD can make it. If you want x86, AMD has that, too. AMD officials have stressed the importance of versatility many times over the last two years. AMD's business relies on x86, but the company has stocked up on ARM technology, which could explode into servers and embedded devices in the coming years. Intel makes only x86 chips and doesn't have its sights on ARM. Zen CPU AMD is placing a lot of faith in its upcoming Zen x86 CPU -- if it fails, it could take the company down with it. But Zen could be equalizer AMD needs to compete with Intel in CPUs, and it could perhaps attract some enthusiasts over from the Intel camp. AMD claims Zen delivers a 40 percent performance improvement per clock cycle, which is higher than the single-digit gains delivered by recent x86 chips. The first Zen chips for enthusiast desktops will ship later this year. Servers The time is ripe for AMD to grow in the server market, where Intel's superior Xeon chips have destroyed AMD's Opteron processors. AMD once held a double-digit market share, but then came problems with the faulty and poorly constructed Bulldozer architecture. AMD's server strategy is now in shambles, and it is relying on the Zen chips for what it calls a "reentry" into the server market. The company will initially target Zen chips at hyperscale servers, then at other systems. Chinese market AMD is chasing the booming Chinese server market by licensing its upcoming x86 chip to THATIC. That frees up cash-strapped AMD from committing resources to selling chips in the country. AMD could also use the licensing strategy to sell more PC chips in China, where the company has a committed following among home PC builders. Custom chips AMD had to find a new place to sell its processors with PC shipments falling, so it focused on products like gaming consoles, gambling machines, ATMs, and automobiles, all of which require custom processors. The console makers are already coming back to AMD for more processors. AMD is now taking on only larger custom-chip orders that will bring in considerable revenue.

Intel on Thursday started shipping its latest Itanium 9700 chip, code-named Kittson, in volume. It's the last of the Itanium chips, which first appeared in early 2001. Beyond Kittson, there will be no more chips coming from the Itanium family, an Intel spokesman said in an email. That ends a tumultuous, 16-year journey for Itanium, which Intel once envisioned as a replacement for x86 chips in 64-bit PCs and servers. Support for Itanium has dwindled over the past decade, which has led to its gradual death. Server makers stopped offering hardware, software development stalled, and Intel has been openly asking customers to switch to x86-based Xeon chips. The Itanium 9700 is an incremental upgrade to the previous chips, code-named Poulson, and is targeted at high-end servers running Unix. The only major customer for Itanium remains Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which is upgrading its Integrity i6 high-uptime servers with the new chips. The servers provide rock-solid stability and run on Unix-based HP-UX. Intel can now focus on Xeon, which was rebranded last week to account for new technologies like co-processors and faster interconnects. Itanium has been on the chopping back for a long time, and it's demise isn't a surprise. Itanium was developed jointly by Intel and the company originally known as HP (before its breakup into HP and HPE). HP was looking to replace its aging PA-RISC with a modern 64-bit server chip that could run legacy OSes like Unix. At the time, Intel wanted to break into the high-end server market with a lead partner like HP, and take on older mainframe architectures like Oracle/Sun SPARC and IBM’s Power. "At the time it looked like a viable strategy for what they were going after," said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research When introduced in 2001, the Itanium instruction set was much more advanced than that of the x86. It had features like machine-check, ECC memory and RAS (reliability availability and serviceability). But the first Itanium chips were extremely power hungry. When employed by Motorola, McGregor was shown an early 1U server with two Itanium processors and a massive turbofan at the back. It was too power hungry, noisy and required a lot of cooling, he said. Intel hedged its bets and planned for Itanium 64 -- also called IA-64 -- to ultimately go down the stack from servers to PCs. But that never happened, and the market shifted quickly after AMD introduced the first 64-bit x86 server chips in 2003. That gave AMD a competitive edge over Intel, which still was offering 32-bit x86 chips. Intel got back to the drawing board and sped up the development of x86 chips with 64-bit extensions, which were released soon after. The transition disrupted Intel's vision of Itanium as an architecture of the future for 64-bit servers and PCs. Instead, x86 chips started moving up the stack into more powerful servers. But the real hit on Itanium came in 2010. That year Microsoft stopped software support for Itanium, declaring that Windows Server 2008 R2 would be its last server OS to support Itanium. In March 2011, Oracle made a decision to stop writing software for Itanium, saying "Intel management made it clear that their strategic focus is on their x86 microprocessor and that Itanium was nearing the end of its life." That spawned a legal battle with HP, which wanted continued Oracle software support and development for its HP-UX customers. Intel subsequently made a concerted push to move customers from Itanium to x86 in 2012 when it introduced the new 15-core Xeon E7 v2 chip with Itanium-like error correction and RAS features. At the time, HP also made it easier to transition from Itanium to x86-based Xeon servers. The message from Intel and HP, notes Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research, was clear: It was time to move on from Itanium. But customers weren't willing to move off Itanium, especially those users needing high-uptime servers to keep infrastructure stable and humming. HP remained committed to releasing servers based on the chip, and that contributed to Itanium surviving longer than expected. HPE has said it will keep support for Itanium servers up and running until 2025, and will release the latest HP-UX 11i v3 2017 update in June. Itanium 9700 is still there for those who need it, and they are socket compatible, meaning new chips can be plugged into existing servers with previous-generation Poulson chips. The servers are not for new workloads like machine learning or artificial intelligence, but for traditional mainframe-style workloads. Companies with machines running on HP-UX and Integrity will likely remain committed to Itanium, and won't transition for many years. But that won't stop HPE from trying to get customers to move to x86. HPE will enable "customers to re-host their HP-UX workloads on Linux-based containers running on industry-standard x86 servers in the future," said Jeff Kyle, director of product management for enterprise servers at HPE. The new Integrity i6 is priced starting at $14,500 and is available through resellers. The servers have NVMe support and all-flash 3Par storage integration. Xeon and x86 will drive Intel into the future, especially with applications and data center designs changing. "[Itanium] will be remembered as one of those interesting architectural experiments. It lived a lot longer than others," McCarron said.

The server can also be linked to HP's all-flash 3Par storage arrays, which are due to get Optane support later. Optane has stringent hardware and OS requirements. The first Optane products were low-capacity storage drives for PC caching and worked only with Intel's Kaby Lake chips and Windows 10. The first large-capacity Optane drive is the SSD DC P4800X Series, which has a capacity of 375GB and sells for $1,520. Like flash SSDs, it plugs into NVMe slots. Optane drivers for other kinds of configurations should be ready in the coming years, said Jeff Kyle, director of product management for enterprise servers. Next year, Intel will ship Optane memory DIMMs, which will run on the DRAM bus and be targeted at in-memory applications. But whether HPE customers adopt Optane immediately is a big question mark, Kyle said. Customers running mainframe-style mission-critical servers are averse to change and may not immediately adopt Optane, which is still spanking new technology. They may go for conventional NVMe SSDs, which are proven and reliable. Servers like Integrity i6 are used for more than five to 10 years, and it's not yet known if Optane can last that long, Kyle said. Intel provides a three-year warranty for its Optane SSD DC P4800X Series. But for those who adopt Optane, there will be benefits, Kyle said. Databases and other applications will run faster, and customers will need fewer CPU cores to process data, which adds up to lower licensing costs, he said. Optane was tested for more than two years on Linux servers hosted by IBM, Lenovo and Facebook. Another tester was database company Aerospike, which saw significant performance benefits. But details around overall performance, software cost, and licensing per core have yet to be sorted out, Kyle said.

Xeon chips are used in servers and workstations like Mac Pro. Xeon chips being released mid-year will be broken down into Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Bronze processors. The naming scheme -- derived from metals -- is a mix of Olympic medals and branding of credit cards from companies like Delta. A person familiar with Intel's plans earlier said the chips will likely be widely referred to as Xeon-P, Xeon-G, Xeon-S, and Xeon-B, with the P for Platinum, G for Gold, etc. The more valuable the metal, the more performance you get with the chip. The Platinum chip is the fastest chip and will deliver the performance similar to that of the high-end E7 chips, an Intel spokesman said. The Bronze processor is aimed at low-end serversÂ and will deliver the performance similar to the E5. The new branding will start with the server chips based on the enhanced Skylake architecture coming mid-year. Earlier this year, Intel released low-end E3 server and workstation chips based on the Kaby Lake architecture, and those chips will hang on to the old moniker. With Xeon Platinum, you will also get "hardware-enhanced security," Intel said. The chipmaker is putting additional hardware layers on its Skylake chips to provide data security. That feature is valuable in fault-tolerant, high-uptime servers used in financial and retail organizations that run high volumes of transactions. These servers have ECC memory and RAS (reliability, availability, and serviceability) features. The Xeon Gold tier of processors will add "enhanced performance, fast memory, more interconnect/accelerator engines, and advanced reliability." That would make Gold tier chips for applications like machine learning. Intel will hook up FPGAs and deep-learning chips from Nervana alongside the processors to carry out tasks like image recognition and natural language processing. Outside of servers, these chips could also go into car IT systems. Intel is also introducing the high-bandwidth OmniPath interconnect -- so far only available with its Xeon Phi supercomputing chips -- with its Skylake chips. That feature could be available with Xeon Gold. The Xeon Silver will provide "efficient performance at low power," while Xeon Bronze will be aimed at entry-level servers. There are many new features that will be available on most Skylake server chips. One is AVX-512, a package of vector extensions to speed up high-performance computing. Servers with the new chips also have as a feature called Intel Volume Management Device so SSDs like the super fast Optane DC P4800X and 3D NAND-based DC P4600 can be hot swapped. Intel is reorganizing its business to focus more on data centers, especially with a stagnant PC market.Â How IoT Is Leading A Revolution In Home Networking More from Leader Computers Follow Us Twitter LinkedIn Join the ARN newsletter!

New research by IC Insights suggest it might Leon Spencer (ARN) 09 May, 2017 13:59 - - - - print email Distributors ACA Pacific Alloys Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology Com1 International Dicker Data Dynamic Supplies Hills Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology Samsung Communications Synnex Topstar Computer International Wholesale IT XiT Distribution Comments Intel may soon be displaced by Samsung as the world’s top semiconductor manufacturer, according to new research by semiconductor market research company, IC Insights. Intel has held the top spot since 1993, when it introduced its x486 processor, and maintained its lead thanks, in part, to the later success of its Pentium processor, according to the market research firm. Intel claimed more than 15 per cent of the global market share as of 2016, according to Statistica, which places Samsung’s market share at around 11.6 per cent for the same period. Presently, both companies are headed for about $60.0 billion in 2017 semiconductor sales, according to IC Insights. In 2016, Intel claimed around $57 billion in semiconductor sales, while Samsung topped $44.3 billion. However, the research firm predicts that Intel’s continued dominance in the sector may be drawing to a close, with the market research firm suggesting that, if memory market prices continue to hold or increase through the second (US) quarter, 2017, and the balance of this year, Samsung could claim the top spot. “Using the mid-range sales guidance set by Intel for 2Q17, and a modest, yet typical, 2Q sales increase of 7.5 per cent for Samsung, the South Korean supplier [Samsung] would unseat Intel as the world’s leading semiconductor supplier in 2Q17,” IC Insights said. IC Insights points out that Intel’s sales were 40 per cent greater than Samsung’s in the first quarter, 2016, but that in just over a year’s time, that lead may be erased, with Intel potentially finding itself trailing in quarterly sales. According to the research firm, Samsung’s surge in semiconductor sales has been predominantly driven by the rise in its DRAM and NAND flash average selling prices. IC Insights said that it expects that the gains in DRAM and NAND flash pricing experienced through 2016 and into the first quarter of 2017 to cool in the second half of the year.

Samsung’s encroachment on the top spot comes as other players also narrow the sales gap between themselves and Intel. Qualcomm is currently ranked third, pulling in $15.4 billion in semiconductor sales in 2016, according to IC Insights’ figures, with Broadcom nipping at its heels in fourth place, raking in $15.2 billion in semiconductor sales in 2016. SK Hynix, Micron, TI, Toshiba, NXP and MediaTek fill out the remaining ranks in the top 10 worldwide semiconductor sales leaders, according to IC Insights. Read more Services segment lights fire underneath Apple's latest revenue surge Whether Toshiba will continue to hold its position on this list remains to be seen, with the Japanese technology company taking bids for its memory chip business in a bid to bolster its bottom line following a massive write-down caused by cost overruns of subsidiary business, Westinghouse Electric Company (WEC). A number of potential buyers are thought to be lining up for a chance to take on Toshiba’s memory chip business, according to media reports, with Western Digital, Foxconn Technology Group and Kingston Technology among those vying for a stake in the business. Some of the world’s largest tech companies, including Google, Amazon, and Kingston Technology have also reportedly been in the running, alongside a number of investment funds. In late March, private equity firm, Silver Lake Partners and Broadcom reportedly offered Toshiba about US$17.9 billion for its chip unit, according to Reuters.

Can Intel save the Ultrabook? The price is coming down .... Colin Neagle (Network World) 08 January, 2013 17:01 - - - - print email Comments LAS VEGAS -- Ultrabooks made a big splash at last year's CES, but sales over the course of 2012 were disappointing. Intel yesterday made a determined bid to change all that. Craig Stice, an analyst at HIS iSuppli, said one reason Ultrabooks didn't gain much traction was the $1000 price tag. At a CES press conference yesterday, Kirk Skaugen, general manager of Intel's PC client group, acknowledged this misstep, announcing that the company's manufacturing partners will soon roll out "dozens of platforms [priced] below $750," including touch-enabled devices for $599. IN PICTURES: The best of CES 2013 MORE: Ultra-hyped ultrabooks ultra-flopped in 2012 In his analysis of what went wrong with Ultrabooks, Stice added that Intel never made clear to consumers exactly what an Ultrabook was or why it was better than a notebook or tablet. Intel's Skaugen announced that the second-generation Ultrabooks would feature touchscreens and a convertible form factor, in addition to longer batter life. Intel executives showed off a handful of convertible notebook/tablet Ultrabooks, including the Lenovo Yoga 11s, whose screen can be folded all the way around to take the traditional notebook, tablet, and tent-style form factors, and the Acer Aspire, whose screen can be detached from its keyboard to act as a 10-millimeter-thin Windows 8 tablet. In terms of battery life, Intel delivered in this category, announcing that new, lower-power, third-generation processors shipping today will drop to 7 watts of power consumption. The previous generation consumed 15W, and many had expected the upcoming Haswell processor (which Skaugen said will launch within the next few months) to consume around 10W. Skaugen showed a concept platform called Northscape that, even at 17 mm thin, boasted 13-hour battery life. The update is the largest increase in battery life Intel has ever made between two generations of the same processor, Skaugen said. Much still needs to be done for Intel to climb out of the hole it dug itself into last year. Stice says marketing and advertising were particularly weak last year, for example. How Intel and its manufacturing partners handle that from here on out remains to be seen. But it could be that Intel accomplished exactly what it set out to last year. Stice says the true value of the Ultrabook's release in 2012 can be better measured by its impact on the design of future devices than its first-year sales. Given the leaps that have been made since then, CES 2013 may one day be seen as a turning point for the Ultrabook. Colin Neagle covers emerging technologies and the startup scene for Network World.

It appears that we might've just gotten a glimpse at the potential lineup of next-gen Intel processors running on the LGA-2066 architecture. According to a post on the Anandtech forums, the next generation of enthusiast-grade processors from Intel, codenamed Basin Falls, is said to have both Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X variants, with Kaby Lake-X being the "lower end" of the spectrum. If the provided image is to be believed, the lineup looks like this: Here it is in a separate table, in case the image is difficult to understand: Potential Intel Core i9 Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X processors Name Cores/ Threads L3 Cache (MB) Base clock/ Turbo clock (GHz) PCIe Lanes Supported Memory TDP Launch i7-7640K (Kaby Lake-X) 4/4 6 4.0 / 4.2 (Turbo 2.0) 16 2 x DDR4-2666 112W June 2017 i7-7740K (Kaby Lake-X) 4/8 8 4.3 / 4.5 (Turbo 2.0) 16 2 x DDR4-2666 112W June 2017 i9-7800X (Skylake-X) 6/12 8.25 3.5 / 4.0 (Turbo 2.0) 28 4 x DDR4-2666 140W June 2017 i9-7820X (Skylake-X) 8/16 11 4.3 / 4.5 (Turbo 2.0) 28 4 x DDR4-2666 140W June 2017 i9-7900X (Skylake-X) 10/20 13.75 3.3 / 4.3 (Turbo 2.0) 4.5 (Turbo 3.0) 44 4 x DDR4-2666 140W June 2017 i9-7920X (Skylake-X) 12/24 16.5 TBA 44 4 x DDR4-2666 140W August 2017 No pricing has been revealed just yet, but since these chips are pegged for launch next month, that detail could possibly pop up very soon.

The small chip company has brought giants like Intel to their knees in the realm of mobile phones and tablets, and now it's on the verge of being acquired by Softbank for a stunning US$32 billion. You may not know it, but outside of PCs ARM is in almost every device we use, from smartphones to TVs to home appliances. It licenses chip designs to manufacturers, and over the last 25 years, over 90 billion ARM-designed chips have gone into devices. ARM will continue designing processors for various segments of the computing industry after the acquisition, but investments will go up and product development will be faster, said Simon Segars, CEO of ARM, in a video. Here are three immediate things you need to know about the deal. Your iPhone or iPad won't be affected Apple's A-series smartphone chips for the iPhone and iPad are based on ARM architecture. Apple will look at the proposed acquisition closely with regard to their mobile chip future, but it will likely retain ARM architecture. For ARM, Apple has been a marquee customer that can highlight the chip architecture's capabilities. But Apple also has nowhere else to go now that Intel -- which was ARM's major mobile competitor -- has quit making mobile processors. An alternative is the struggling MIPS architecture, whose owner, Imagination Technologies, is reportedly up for sale, but it's doubtful Apple would make that choice. ARM processor designs are also in smartphones from top vendors like Samsung, LG and others. None of them should be affected by the deal. "I'm not expecting any changes because many of their contracts are long-term, tied to specific architectures and products," said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy. Faster technology development, and cheaper chips and devices After the acquisition, ARM CEO Segars said the company "will do more, we'll do it faster, and we'll do it with a greater degree of investment." That's bad news for Intel, which will suddenly have to contend with a chip company with big financial backing. That competition could lead to faster chip development and cheaper processors, like what happened for PCs and servers when competition between Intel and AMD was at its peak. A big reason Softbank acquired ARM was to expand in the internet of things; Intel laid off 12,000 employees to refocus on IoT and data center products. Cheaper chips could bring down prices for IoT devices and servers, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. ARM could also scale up development of wireless modems and sensor technology and add much-needed resources to chase servers, a market Intel dominates, McGregor said.

But its chip designs are being used in maker boards like Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone. No Brexit effect Softbank is a Japanese company, but ARM's operations will remain centered in the U.K. The chip designer has 1,600 employees in the U.K., and it will double that head count over the next five years. That's a show of faith in the U.K., which has voted to exit the European Union and has recently suffered currency fluctuations. ARM will also expand operations worldwide after the acquisition, and will be hiring in other countries. ARM has big operations in U.S., China and Taiwan.

Micron is one of the top five semiconductor makers in the world, and it has a lot to offer Tsinghua Unigroup, which has reportedly bid $23 billion for the Boise-based firm. In a reply to Computerworld, Micron denied it has received any offer from Tsinghua. Several analysts said The Wall Street Journal's report of a bid could likely be a "trial balloon." If real, however, the deal could become the largest Chinese takeover of a U.S. company on record. "I think Micron can turn down/reject the offer unless it becomes very attractive," Fang Zhang, a memory analyst with market research firm IHS, said in an email reply to Computerworld. Gregory Wong, an analyst with Forward Insights, said he's been aware of "rumors" of a Micron buyout for more than a month, and "not receiving a formal offer does not mean there have been no discussions." What makes a potential deal even more interesting is that Intel holds a 20% stake in Tsinghua, and Intel and Micron have also been involved in a close, long-term memory development partnership. So, on the surface, a buyout of Micron would not likely affect any current or future partnerships with Intel. As a result of its partnership with Micron, Intel gets half of the company's Utah fabrication plant's output sold it at cost. Intel, in turn, helps Micron design chips and develop new lithography processes. What would Tsinghua Univgroup get from the deal? It isn't surprising that a government-sponsored Chinese firm plans to enter the DRAM and NAND markets, considering the smartphone growth in China. While growth has slowed in recent quarters, China's smartphone market is still the largest in the world, according to IDC. During the first quarter of this year, 98.8 million smartphones shipped in China, IDC said. Jim Handy, an analyst with Objective Analysis in Los Gatos, Calif., however, is surprised that the company would plan to enter the market via an acquisition versus organic development. "We have been telling our clients for the past few years that either China or India would create a new DRAM/NAND manufacturing company, especially since memory chip makers have enjoyed a long period of profits, and this usually motivates outsiders to invest in new DRAM makers," he wrote in an analysis. "We have even heard that China's upcoming 5-year plan would include taking a 20% share of the memory chip business, which last year would have represented some $12 billion in revenues," he added. Acquiring Micron would give Tsinghua Unigroup a major stake in the DRAM and NAND marketplace. Micron "has a strong position in both NAND flash and DRAM sales, and has shown itself to be quite resilient during repeated market downturns that have cut DRAM supplier ranks from 28 companies in the middle-1990s to only 3 today," Handy added. Micron is the world's second largest DRAM producer behind SK Hynix, and is the third largest NAND memory maker in a market led by Toshiba/SanDisk and Samsung, according to IHS. Micron is also ranked third in terms of DRAM revenue (sales), behind Samsung and SK Hynix and third in terms of NAND flash revenue behind Samsung and Toshiba (SK Hynix comes in fourth). A buyout of Micron would give China instant "self-sufficiency" in DRAM and NAND semiconductor production, IHS's Zhang said, a market the country has yet to break into with any significance. Zhang added, however, said any such deal would not be easy and would require a long haul in convincing the U.S. government to okay it based on "security concerns." Handy agreed. "This kind of deal often must pass a lot of government scrutiny before it closes, and that could take several months," he said. "An exhaustive U.S. government review is very likely in this case." What is Tsinghua Unigroup? Tsinghua Unigroup is China's leader in fabless semiconductor manufacturing. Handy referred to Tsinghua Unigroup as a "relatively puzzling company" that is managed by Tsinghua University in China. The university has posted a sparse outline of its work on the web. "Unigroup itself has a Chinese-only website, which does have an "English" button that appears not to work," Handy wrote. A subsidiary of Tsinghua Holdings Co., Ltd., Tshinghua Unigroup is also funded by Tsinghua University. Last year, the chipmaker penned a series of development agreements with Intel Corp., which has also had a development partnership with Micron for more than seven years. In its deal with Tsinghua, Intel agreed to invest about $1.5 billion for a minority stake of approximately 20% of the holding company under Tsinghua Unigroup, which will own Spreadtrum Communications and RDA Microelectronics. Both Spreadtrum and RDA are leading fabless semiconductor companies in China. The Intel/Tsinghua agreement is still on hold pending U.S. government approval. At the time of the agreement, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich pointed to China as a huge market for smartphones and as having the largest number of Internet users in the world. "These agreements with Tsinghua Unigroup underscore Intel's 29-year-long history of investing in and working in China," Krzanich stated. "This partnership will also enhance our ability to support a wider range of mobile customers in China and the rest of the world by more quickly delivering a broader portfolio of Intel architecture and communications technology solutions." Micron is under no pressure to sell According to Handy, Micron's management is bullish about its prospects for the remainder of the year, and they may decide that the reported offered price, which is 19% above today's closing price, is insufficient. "Micron stock was trading in January at nearly twice today's value," Handy said. As of January 2015, Micron's market capitalization was $32 billion. Additionally, there has been a lot of concern recently that the Chinese economy may collapse, Handy said. "If the [U.S.] government approval process takes too long, then a China bubble burst could well prevent this deal from materializing," he said.

The chipmaker claims it acquired the mark when it bought McAfee Inc. in 2011, and has used and promoted it for security products, services, and publications for consumers and businesses. Security expert John McAfee has stated that he did not sign away rights to his personal name. Intel spun off last month its security business as a separate company, called McAfee, in which it now owns 49 percent of the equity, with the balance owned by investment firm TPG. The federal court had earlier refused John McAfee and MGT Capital a preliminary injunction until the resolution of the dispute on Intel’s transfer of marks and related assets containing the word McAfee as part of the spin-out. MGT Capital, which has John McAfee as CEO and executive chairman of the board, has indicated its interest in diversifying into the security market. It announced last month a privacy phone that will be “as hack proof as humanly possible,” with features such as a bank of switches on the back cover that will allow the user to physically disconnect the battery, the antennas for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and geolocation, the camera and microphone, and would also not allow the phone to connect to a Stingray or any other IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) catcher device. The phone will be available in August, MGT said. The company has referred to the phone largely as the Privacy Phone. But in a sentence lower down in the statement on its website it refers to “the John McAfee privacy phone,” which appears to have raised Intel’s concerns about the naming of the phone. John McAfee also referred to “The John McAfee Privacy Phone, by MGT,” in a tweet last month. In a submission to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, lawyers for Intel and McAfee have also objected to MGT asking for the depositions of McAfee’s CEO, Christopher Young, and Intel’s CEO, Brian Krzanich, “even though Plaintiffs can point to no relevant, unique information that these chief executives possess.” The companies have also complained that MGT and John McAfee have not produced required documents for discovery. The plaintiffs, MGT and John McAfee, “have produced almost no documents and are refusing to answer even the most basic interrogatories,” according to a letter to the court, asking for a conference in connection with a motion for a protective order to prevent the “harassing depositions” of the chief executives and another motion to compel MGT and John McAfee to “complete their document production and provide substantive responses to interrogatories about their name change and planned products and services.” In June last year, Intel sent a letter to MGT warning it of legal action if it changed its name “to one that includes the MCAFEE trademark or otherwise use the MCAFEE name as a trademark.” John McAfee does not have the right to use the McAfee name for security related goods and services, Intel added. John McAfee has said he had entered in 1991 into an agreement with McAfee Associates, a predecessor to McAfee Inc., to transfer certain assets to it in exchange for stock and a promissory note. But the entrepreneur submitted to the court that at no point in the agreement had he assigned the rights to his personal name through an assignment of trademark or otherwise, or agreed to restrict his right to do business using his own name. A recent settlement conference between the two sides failed.

Once again, reports have Intel near a deal with Altera Intel may announce a deal to acquire FPGA maker Altera on Monday, the Wall Street Journal reports, after the two companies returned to the bargaining table following a failure to come to terms earlier this year. The buy would strengthen Intel's already dominant hand in the server market at a cost of about $17 billion. NSA surveillance powers expire as Senate delays vote A controversial program allowing the U.S. National Security Agency to collect millions of domestic telephone records expired Sunday night after the Senate failed to vote on a bill to extend the authority for the surveillance. But senators moved closer to bringing the USA Freedom Act to a vote; that bill gives the agency limited power to obtain data on American residents under investigation. Some are still calling for more reform and better oversight. Asus ZenWatch 2 could keep on ticking for four days Asus showed off a preview of its next-gen smartwatch on the sidelines of Computex, and one of the highlights is a battery that could keep the device charged for up to four days. That's four times the staying power of the Apple Watch, whose design Asus echoes with the ZenWatch 2: It incorporates a metal crown and is designed to be a fashion accessory available in 49mm and 45mm sizes to suit men and women. ARM aims to extend battery life of IoT devices ARM is trying to resolve the thorny problem of battery life in Internet of Things devices with a new chip design that will significantly reduce the power consumed by processors, sensors and wireless chips. A design overhaul of low-power Cortex-M chips could almost double battery life, ARM executives said at Computex. Microsoft says Windows 10 will be available July 29 Microsoft's much-hyped new OS will be available on July 29, the company said in a blog post on Monday. Over the weekend, online retailer Newegg.com tipped its hand to show some Windows 10 pricing as it began taking pre-orders, Computerworld reports. The listings were for versions aimed at homebrew PC makers and those who want to run the OS in a virtual machine or in a dual-boot configuration, and showed the consumer version at $109.99, and the professional version at $149.99. Woman unwittingly recycles an Apple I, is owed $100K A woman who dropped an Apple I at a Silicon Valley recycling center in April has $100,000 coming to her if she steps forward, the San Jose Mercury News reports. When the recycling firm went through the boxes she left, it discovered the vintage computer, which is one of 200 put together by the Apple founders in 1976. It sold it for $200,000 to a private collection, and now the center wants to give the mystery donor half of those proceeds. Flaw in pre-2014 Macs could allow firmware attack If you let your older Mac go to sleep rather than shutting it off when you walk away, you may be leaving it vulnerable to an attack that could modify the system's firmware, a security researcher says. Pedro Vilaca found it's possible to tamper with an Apple computer's UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) on MacBooks made prior to mid-2014, because the UEFI code is unlocked when the system awakens from sleep mode.

View all images You win some, you lose some. Microsoft this week dropped support for ARM processors from its Surface tablets with the Surface 3, but adoption of the chip architecture in Chromebooks is growing. Chromebooks from little-known companies HiSense and Haier went on sale this week for US$149, and come with an ARM-based chip made by Rockchip. These are the least expensive Chromebooks, which usually cost $200 and up. Asus also announced a new ARM-based 10.1-inch Chromebook Flip hybrid, which can be a tablet and laptop and will ship in a few months starting at $249. Acer announced a Chromebase, a 21.5-inch all-in-one PC with Chrome OS and an ARM-based processor from Nvidia. The new PCs have strengthened a weak lineup of ARM-based Chromebooks. Most Chromebooks come with Intel chips and are considered better at running more demanding applications. But ARM-based Chromebooks could offer better battery life than Intel-based models. The new Chromebooks were launched just a day after Microsoft dropped ARM from its Surface lineup with the new 10.8-inch Surface 3, which has an Intel x86 chip. Microsoft is removing ARM processors from Surface as it prepares to pull the plug on Windows RT, a scaled down version of Windows 8 for ARM-based devices. Devices with Windows RT will not be upgraded to Windows 10, which is expected to ship later this year. PC makers have already discontinued Windows RT tablets and hybrids. Microsoft's older Surface and Surface 2 ran on ARM processors, and the company in February stopped making the ARM-based Nokia Lumia 2520 tablet. ARM's processor designs are used in some of the most popular mobile devices, and in Chromebooks from Samsung, Acer and HP. Rumors have surfaced about Apple porting its powerful ARM processors from the iPhone and iPad to MacBooks, but those plans haven't materialized yet. Windows 10 will support x86 processors from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices for desktop and laptops, while ARM will be supported by the OS's mobile version -- the next generation of the Windows Phone OS -- which will mostly go into handsets and tablets with screens under 7 inches. So while the market of Windows laptops and hybrids may have evaporated for ARM, new doors have opened up with Chromebooks, which are being adopted as a lightweight, low-cost alternative to Windows laptops. Chromebooks are mainly targeted at those who do most of their computing on the Internet. Chromebooks have usage characteristics similar to mobile devices', said Nathan Brookwood, principal analyst at Insight 64. "ARM will definitely do better with Chromebooks than they did with Windows RT, which was an unmitigated disaster," Brookwood said. Intel has a performance advantage in Chromebooks, but ARM-based Chromebooks will be good for browsing and basic apps, said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy. ARM is trying to scale up the performance of its chips for PCs and servers, much like Intel is trying to lower the size and power consumption of its chips for smartphones and tablets. "For them to scale up is as much a big challenge as it is for Intel to scale down," Moorhead said. The mobile market remains a pot of gold for ARM, which is making a half-hearted effort to grow in PCs, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. The PC market is flat, but ARM could usher in cheaper and thinner Chromebooks, he said. Analysts also said that ARM will focus on important markets such as Internet of Things and embedded, where the opportunities are larger.

Former CEO Paul Otellini admitted as much in a 2013 interview with The Atlantic. Intel has now bailed out of the smartphone chip market while Apple is flying high with its iPhones, based on its own A-series chips. Intel has cancelled its upcoming Atom chip lines for smartphones, including Broxton and the Sofia 3GX, Sofia LTE and Sofia LTE2 commercial platforms. That decision ends close to a decade of futility with Intel trying to outmaneuver rivals like Qualcomm, Apple, and Samsung, which make mobile chips based technology licensed from ARM. Intel still has a mobile strategy, but it's a major change in direction. The chipmaker is looking ahead to speedy 5G technology, which won't be limited to mobile devices. The technology will also be used in sensor devices, industrial equipment, cars, drones, and robots. The long-term view of 5G will help Intel play a role in the fast-growing Internet of Things market, with Gartner estimating 20.8 billion connected devices to be in use by 2020. Intel is making baseband radio processors, communications equipment, back-end appliances, and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) that will drive 5G deployments. Intel will continue to ship existing Sofia and Atom tablet chips, code-named Cherry Trail, to device makers. Cherry Trail chips will be followed by Pentium and Celeron chips code-named Apollo Lake, which are targeted toward hybrids and laptops. The Atom smartphone chip cancellations pull the curtain back on an ugly past in which Intel shot itself in the foot with bad timing and ill-advised executive decisions, analysts said. In early to mid-2000s, under then-CEO Craig Barrett, Intel started laying down an end-to-end mobile and networking strategy, which included making networking equipment and mobile phone chips. In a 2005 interview with IDG News Service, Barrett insisted Intel's mobile chips were popular with mobile phone makers. Intel's ARM-based StrongARM processors were a big part of its strategy, and the biggest competition at the time came from Texas Instruments' OMAP processors. But Otellini, who replaced Barrett, deemphasized the mobile and networking strategy to focus on Intel's core PC market. Intel's PC offerings then came under pressure when AMD became a serious competitor with innovative chips, said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. As new CEO in 2006, Otellini made one of his biggest announcements when Apple switched Macs to Intel's x86 chips. Intel in late 2006 sold the StrongARM assets to Marvell for US $600 million. Two major factors later changed Intel's view on smartphones -- the success of the iPhone, and how it cut into PC sales. Tablets then began to hurt PCs sales after the iPad was released in 2010, and those devices did not use x86 chips. "That painted a picture of, 'oh there's a market that's not a PC market'," McCarron said. Intel started retooling the Atom processor -- designed originally for netbooks -- to fit into Internet-connected devices like mobile Internet devices (MIDs), which were small-screen computers with Web browsing capability. Intel developed some prototype phablet-like devices based on a chip called Menlow, which was announced in 2008, but MIDs never took off. At the time, Intel viewed the MID as a smaller version of a PC that was Internet enabled. It couldn't perceive growth in the smartphone market because of mobile broadband connectivity issues and data limits at the time. PCs are "your expertise, that's your worldview, and that kept them from seeing the phone as a client," McCarron said. The next Intel smartphone chip called Moorestown was announced in 2010 but was too power hungry for smartphones. The first Intel-based smartphone was Lava's Xolo X900, which was released in April 2012 in India, followed by handsets from Orange and Lenovo. Those handsets had a new Atom processor code-named Medfield. While Intel struggled to make a competitive mobile processor, its failure in mobile software also burned the company. Intel in 2007 started working on Linux-based Moblin, which was merged with Nokia's Maemo into a new OS called Meego in 2010. The OS was then merged with LiMo into what is now Tizen. Intel ultimately warmed up to Android in 2011, but it was too late. Intel was trying to force its OS down customers' throats as Apple and Google were taking over the market, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. "They had a chance to jump ship to go with Android, but they didn't do it," McGregor said. Intel also spent billions retooling chip manufacturing with mobile in mind, with the focus being on low-power chips instead of performance. The goal was to catch up with ARM in power efficiency by using its manufacturing advantage.

Another mistake was the high priority placed in the now-declining tablet market. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, who replaced Otellini, set a goal to ship 40 million tablet chips by the end of 2014 using heavy subsidies on Atom chips. The company shipped 46 million chips that year, but the effort hurt Intel's profitability, and Krzanich decided not to repeat that strategy with smartphones. A move away from smartphone chips gives Intel a clean slate to envision an alternative, and more importantly, profitable mobile future. Intel's smartphone chips had thin margins, and now the company will focus on expensive server chips that will deliver Web services to mobile devices. Intel will also continue developing 5G modems. Intel discontinued one mobile project almost a decade ago only to regret it, but this time, the company may have taken the right decision, especially with smartphone prices falling fast and the promise of 5G. "I don't think it's shortsighted, it's realistic," McCarron said. Expanding sales and opportunities for data solutions More from Dicker Data Follow Us Twitter LinkedIn Join the ARN newsletter!

Right now Intel has the Core i3, Core i5 and Core i7 processors - but they will be joined by the high-end Core i9 family led by the Core i9-7920X processor reportedly launching in August. Intel's purported Core i9 processor will come in up to 12C/24T, matching the rumored next-gen Ryzen processors with 12C/24T of power.   Intel's upcoming i9-7900 series processors will support up to 44 PCIe lanes, while the i9-7800 will have 28 lanes, and the i7-7700/7600 have up to 16. We should expect TDPs in the 112-160W range, depending on the chip, while the i9 processors will rock a third clock state that Intel will call Turbo Clock 3.0, something that will allow the new CPUs to reach much higher clock speeds than Broadwell-E is capable of.   Intel will reportedly provide its next-gen Core-X processors with AVX512 extensions, and 1MB of L2 cache. Skylake-X will support quad-channel DDR4 at up to 2666MHz, while the lower-end mainstream Kaby Lake-X will support dual-channel DDR4.   NEWS SOURCES:Videocardz.com Recommended for You AMD Raven Ridge APU: 4C/8T CPU with Vega NCU tech Qualcomm announces Snapdragon 660 and 630 AMD Ryzen 5: best CPU launch in 7 years, says new...

By: Bloomberg | San Francisco | Published:May 13, 2017 3:19 pm Samsung, one of Qualcomm’s largest customers, and Intel, one of its biggest competitors, filed arguments in support of the FTC’s case against Qualcomm. (Image for representation) Samsung Electronics Co. and Intel Corp. weighed in with their own gripes about Qualcomm Inc. while cheering on the US Federal Trade Commission’s lawsuit accusing the chipmaker of trying to corner the market for semiconductors used in smartphones. The South Korean company, one of Qualcomm’s largest customers, and Intel, one of its biggest competitors, filed arguments Friday in support of the FTC’s case against Qualcomm. Both contend the San Diego-based company stops them from competing fairly against it by leveraging patents that cover the fundamentals of modern phone systems. “Intel is ready, willing, and able to compete on the merits in this market that Qualcomm has dominated for years,” Intel said in a posting on its website. “But Qualcomm has maintained an interlocking web of abusive patent and commercial practices that subverts competition on the merits.” Samsung claims its in-house chip unit is artificially held back by Qualcomm’s unwillingness to license its technology. License Refused “Despite having requested a license from Qualcomm, Samsung cannot sell licensed Exynos chipsets to non-Samsung entities because Qualcomm has refused to license Samsung to make and sell licensed chipsets,” Samsung said in a filing. Samsung, the world’s biggest smartphone maker, uses a mixture of suppliers — including itself and Qualcomm — for the crucial components in its handsets. Qualcomm didn’t immediately respond to requests seeking comment on the filings. The company is trying to fend off a series of legal and regulatory challenges to its business practices around the world, including a suit by Apple Inc., one of its largest customers. The chipmaker gets most of its profits from selling the rights to use patents that are essential to all modern mobile phone systems. Many of the cases target the link between those license fees and its semiconductor business. Also Read: Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 coming to India soon Earlier Friday, the FTC urged a judge to reject Qualcomm’s request for dismissal of the agency’s case. The allegations “present a forceful antitrust case,” the commission said in a filing in federal court in San Jose, California. A hearing is set for June 15. Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg said last month that the FTC’s complaint is riddled with “fallacies and failures.” “The Federal Trade Commission’s latest submission to the court does nothing to cure the fundamental flaws in its complaint against Qualcomm: no coherent theory of competitive harm and no allegations of the type of conduct that the antitrust laws are designed to address,” Qualcomm said Friday in a statement.

Political analysts will long debate over where Brexit, Trump and Le Pen came from. Many say income gaps. I’d say ... not quite. I’d say income anxiety and the stress over what it now takes to secure and hold a good job. I believe the accelerations set loose by Silicon Valley in technology and digital globalization have created a world where every decent job demands more skill and, now, lifelong learning. More people can’t keep up, and clearly some have reached for leaders who promise to stop the wind. Let me elaborate through a few conversations, starting with Brian Krzanich, the CEO of Intel, who recently remarked to me: “I believe my grandchildren will not drive.” Since he has teenage daughters, that means self-driving vehicles should be fully deployed in 25 years, at which time you won’t “steer” your car but will program it on a smartphone or watch or glasses. Sounds like fun — unless you’re one of the millions who drive a truck or cab for a living. But don’t think you’re safe as an accountant, either. Mark Bohr, Intel’s senior fellow for technology, explained to me that Intel’s main workhorse microprocessor today is the 14-nanometer chip it introduced in 2014. It packs 37.5 million transistors per square millimeter. By the end of 2017, thanks to Moore’s Law, Intel will begin producing a 10-nanometer chip that will pack “100 million transistors per square millimeter — more than double the previous density with less heat and power usage,” said Bohr. If you think machines are smart today ... wait a year. It’s this move from 14-nm to 10-nm chips that will help enable automakers to shrink the brain of a self-driving car — a brain that has to take in sensor data from 360 degrees and instantly process whether it’s a dog, a human, a biker or another car — from something that fills a whole trunk to a small box under the front seat, so these cars can scale. When you get that much processing power, putting out that much data exhaust with ever-improving software, you create a world where we can analyze, prophesize and optimize with a precision unknown in human history. We can see trends we never saw, predict when engine parts will break and replace them before they do, with great savings, and we can optimize everything — from the most energy-saving flight path for an airplane to the ideal drilling path for a natural gas well. I recently visited the control room at Devon Energy, a large oil and gas producer, in Oklahoma City. It’s half a floor of computer screens displaying data coming out of every well Devon is drilling around the world. At the bottom of each screen are two boxes that blew my mind. One box displays how much money was budgeted to drill that particular well per foot, and the other box displays — in real time — how much the drilling of that well is actually costing, as it bores through different rocks, and it’s updated every foot! A typical well might involve sending pipe 2 miles down and then turning horizontally for 2 miles east or west — with such precision it can hit a seam of gas as small as 20 feet wide. If you’re working on a Devon oil rig today, you’re holding a computer, not just an oily wrench. And if you’re getting a degree in auto mechanics at a community college today, it’s not to be a “grease monkey.” It’s to be a repairman for a computer with wheels. The notion that we can go to college for four years and then spend that knowledge for the next 30 is over. If you want to be a lifelong employee anywhere today, you have to be a lifelong learner. And that means: More is now on you. And that means self-motivation to learn and keep learning becomes the most important life skill. That’s why education-to-work expert Heather E. McGowan likes to say: “Stop asking a young person WHAT you want to be when you grow up. It freezes their identity into a job that may not be there. Ask them HOW you want to be when you grow up. Having an agile learning mindset will be the new skill set of the 21st century.” Some are up for that, some not; and many want to but don’t know how, which is why the College Board has reshaped the PSAT and SAT exams to encourage lifelong learning. “We analyzed 250,000 students from the high school graduating Class of 2017 who took the new PSAT and then the new SAT,” College Board President David Coleman told me. “Students who took advantage of their PSAT results to launch their own free personalized improvement practice through Khan Academy advanced dramatically: 20 hours of practice was associated with an average 115-point increase from the PSAT to the SAT — double the average gain among students who did not. “Practice advances all students without respect to high school GPA, gender, race and ethnicity or parental education. And it’s free. Our aim is to transform the SAT into an invitation for students to own their future.” So the tough news is that more will be on you. The good news is that systems — like Khan-College Board — are emerging everywhere to enable anyone to accelerate learning for the age of acceleration. Step back from all of this and it’s clear that thriving countries today won’t elect a strongman. They’ll elect leaders who inspire and equip their citizens to be strong people who can own their own futures.

Innovation fundamental for India to become digital economy: Intel  13 May 2017 - 11:01 Twenty-nine student innovators who are set to represent India at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) 2017 -- the world\'s largest pre-college Science and Engineering Fair -- in Los Angeles, US. IANS New Delhi: Innovation is fundamental for India to become a successful digital economy, a top executive from Intel said here on Friday. He was speaking at an event organised by Intel India, in association with the Department of Science and Technology (DST) and the Indo-US Science and Technology Forum (IUSSTF) to felicitate 29 Student Innovators who are set to represent India at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) 2017 -- the world's largest pre-college Science and Engineering Fair -- in Los Angeles, US. "As we stand today, we look at how the world is changing in terms of innovation. Skills of yesterday and skills of tomorrow are very different. The question is do we want our future generations to be mere users of the technology or become innovators?" Kishore Balaji, Director of Corporate Affairs Intel South Asia, told IANS on the sidelines of the event. "At Intel we have been engaged in trying to see how we can bridge this innovation skill gap among youth with various initiatives because we believe that innovation is fundamental for the country in its efforts towards realising its vision of becoming a successful digital economy," Balaji added. The students and their 20 projects were shortlisted from the Initiative for Research and Innovation in Science (IRIS) National Fair 2016, and will compete at the ISEF beginning May 14-19. "ISEF is a really good platform for us to showcase our talent and our research work in order to convey our message and idea to the world," said a student from Bengaluru. "Intel ISEF is lots of fun, science. The best minds from all over the world will come and we will get lots of opportunities," said a student from Raipur. This group of young innovators will represent India to compete against approximately 1,750 finalists from over 70 countries for approximately $4 million in awards and scholarships. Till 2016, a total of 91 Indian students have won 121 awards and accolades at Intel ISEF competing against more than 6 million high school students from across the world. From 1999-2016, 19 students from India also have had the unique honour of having minor planets named after them. "The children from India have done incredibly well and made us feel proud and they would continue to do so," Balaji said.   Share this post Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Cheap gaming chips from AMD Home Hardware Hands on with AMD’s cheaper Ryzen 5 CPUs By Jeremy Laird on May 11th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Serving up eight pukka CPU cores at a price mere mortals can afford was easily the most compelling part of the initial AMD Ryzen proposition. But there’s been some filling out of the Ryzen range since last we alighted the subject. Specifically, a load of quad-core and six-core models have hit retail. They’re significantly cheaper than the beefy eight-core beasts. Might they actually make more sense for gaming than those slightly flawed eight-core chips? It’s little more than journalistic OCD and of absolutely no consequence to the end-user experience. But it very slightly winds me up that AMD, like Intel, spurns logic with its CPU nomenclature. AMD has announced that Ryzen will come in three flavours for the foreseeable. Ryzen 7 is the performance king, Ryzen 5 balances price and performance and Ryzen majors on value. There are also – again for the foreseeable – three different basic configurations for Ryzen. Eight-core, six-core and quad-core. You might think they map neatly and logically to Ryzen 7, 5 and 3. But no, that would make too much sense. Ryzen 5 includes both six and quad-core models. Ryzen 3 has yet to be detailed. Anyway, the first thing to note about the latest quad and six-cores models is that some make a lot more sense in value terms than others. There’s about a £60 gap between the priciest six-core Ryzen, the £260 Ryzen 5 1600X, and the cheapest eight-core chip, the Ryzen 7 1700, for instance. Add about 5% to those numbers (and all the prices that follow, for that matter) for US $ prices. Given that you’re certainly going to also need a new motherboard and very likely some sticks of memory, too, the 1700 is the no brainer in that comparison. After all, you’re looking at perhaps £150 minimum for a decent X370 motherboard plus maybe £75 for 8GB of memory and perhaps a few more quid for sundry items like a new cooler. Factor in the motherboard, RAM and more and the cost of upgrading to Ryzen certainly adds up The plain old Ryzen 5 1600 non-X surely makes more sense at £219 given that it’s also six cores and likewise unlocked for easy overclocking, if you care about that sort of thing. It’s fully a £100 jump to the cheapest eight-core model from the Ryzen 5 1600. A similar logic applies to the quad-core models. The Ryzen 5 1500X clocks in at £179, which looks likes poor value when you can have 50% more cores for just £40 extra. To be honest, even the £159 Ryzen 5 1400 quad-core chip looks like marginal value when you factor in the overall costs of upgrading to Ryzen. Predictably, I’ve had a go with the two most difficult to justify models in the Ryzen 5 range, the 1600X and the 1500X. The former is clocked at 3.7GHz base and 4GHz Turbo, the latter at 3.5Ghz base and 3.7GHz Turbo. Both are a little quicker than their core-count-parity but cheaper siblings, the 1600 and 1400. But the point is that they’re broadly representative of the gaming experience you can expect from the six and quad-core breeds. Gaming joy in a small box? As it happens, when Ryzen was originally announced it seemed like the six core models could be the bang-for-buck sweet spot. Relatively affordable, reasonably high clocks for single threaded performance, plenty of cores and threads for multi-threading. Remember, every Ryzen can process two software threads in parallel per core. That’s pretty much how it pans out in practice. The 1600X makes similarly priced Intel processors look very, very silly in any software that’s multi-threaded, like video encoding. The catch, as it has been from the get go with Ryzen, is that the gaming performance is ever so slightly patchy. All Ryzen CPUs use the full eight-core processor die and disable cores in the two quad-core modules within the chip in symmetrical pairs. So, the configurations are therefore 4:4, 3:3, and 2:2 The benchmark numbers mostly look solid. But there’s no getting away from the fact that some games run tangibly less smooth on Ryzen than Intel CPUs. I had a good hard look, for instance, at Total War: Attila and every Ryzen chip I’ve dabbled with exhibits some stutter from which Intel processors simply don’t suffer. I even sense checked what I was seeing with passing colleagues. It’s unmistakable. And you simply wouldn’t spot it in the relatively small gap in average frame rate. It’s not a total deal breaker and most games run without such hitches. But for me, it slightly undermines Ryzen’s appeal for a dedicated gaming rig. As it happens, the quad-core Ryzen chip is no worse and indeed knocks out similar frame rates to the six-core model in most games. So, of all the existing Ryzen processors, it’s perhaps the quad-core 1400 that’s most compelling. It’s cheapest and you lose little in games. For the same price from Intel you’re looking at the quad-core, quad-thread Core i5-7400, which rocks in at 3GHz base and 3.5GHz Turbo but no scope for significant overclocking. Overall, the choice between the Core i5-7400 and Ryzen 5 1400 is awfully tough. But if the decision is being driven primarily by gaming concerns, then with a somewhat heavy heart I still lean Intel. As things stand, I think you’re probably guaranteed a great gaming experience even with that relatively lowly Intel Core i5 processor. To be sure, the Ryzen chip will mostly be just as good. But just occasionally it will frustrate. The problem, therefore, is this. I reckon the mere knowledge that the Ryzen option might occasionally underperform can be quite damaging to one’s subjective enjoyment. I’m pretty sure every time a game felt a bit juddery I’d be wondering if the Ryzen CPU was to blame, even when the bottleneck was likely elsewhere. It’s a similar psychology that has always put me off multi-card graphics – that constant, niggling doubt whether it’s working properly. There’s not a lot in it, let’s be clear about that. But Intel retains its status as the go-to CPU option for gamers for now.

Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 00:19 GurtTractor says: From my experience of using my 1700x so far I can say that Total War Atilla is a bit of an outlier in terms of performance on these new CPUs. Empire Total War for example runs superbly, load is spread well across all threads, allowing me to run maximum size battles with no discernable slowdown. Total Warhammer has pretty consistent performance generally, though still can lag a bit in very large battles (maybe just because it is a bit more modern, though I get the impression that optimisation could be better). Atilla by comparison seems to run terribly, clearly lacking optimisation for high core count CPUs and/or the Ryzen architecture. Every other game that I have tried has seemed pretty solid on this CPU (Actually ARMA 3 is somewhat poorly optimised too). IMO the only two Intel chips that are worth buying at the moment are the low end Pentium G4560 which nearly matches the i3 chips at a much lower price, no competition from AMD for this one yet (Ryzen 3 should be soon), and the other chip that might be worthwhile is the i7 7700k which seems like the best chip if you really need that single core performance for high refresh gaming or productivity tasks that eat up clockspeed (I think some Photoshop stuff is mainly single core). Every other Intel CPU just seem seems like terrible value compared with the kind of general performance/price of the Ryzen chips. Like the 7600k vs the 1600 for example, 4 threads vs 12!! No 5Ghz overclock can really make up for that. Regarding the i5 7400 vs the 1400; you’re probably not going to be wanting to push the highest framerates with either CPU, but the eight threads of the 1400 vs the 4 of the 7400 should mean more consistent performance with most modern titles. Even if it is just for gaming I would definitely still go for the 1400 if that was my budget, here’s video comparing the two (not the most extensive of tests but I think it’s pretty fair) – link to youtube.com Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 06:45 SquarePeg says: Thanks for the link at the bottom of your post. That was a very solid comparison between the Ryzen 1400 and the i5 7400. Seeing how so many games only make use of four threads I’m very interested to see how the Ryzen 3’s perform. A quick check on pcpartpicker shows the R5 1400 as low as $159.99 here in the US. So I’m wondering how low AMD will go with say the R3 1100. $99 to $119 at launch seems to be a reasonable expectation. If the Ryzen 1100 can easily overclock to 3800mhz+ it would be an fantastic value. Also, given that a socket AM4 system will be upgradeable for several more generations of Ryzen CPU’s it makes the Intel i5 7400 a hard sell. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 08:08 Vesperan says: Slight correction for article – the base clock of the Ryzen 1600X is 3.6ghz, not 3.7ghz. I have an issue with this article, and its one I share with damn near every review out there – with the notable exception of Anandtech’s Ryzen 5 review. Which is unbelievably detailed in the permutations of CPUs/GPUs/resolutions it tests. The issue I have is that its too simple to say Ryzen is worse than Intel at gaming. Yes it is true if you match it with an Nvidia 1080 and a high refresh rate 1080 resolution monitor. But it’s less true with an Nvidia 1070 or 1440p monitor(GPU constraint kicking in). Go 4k monitor and its irrelevant entirely. Have a bog standard 1080p monitor and a Nvidia 1080? What the hell are doing matching that with an Nvidia 1080 GPU? The monitor is pretty much maxed out. Drop the graphics drop down to an Nvidia 1060/Radeon 480 and below – the GPU is pretty much your entire constraint. And so – is Ryzen “worse” at gaming? Sure – if you have one helluva graphics card, and monitor to match. But if you’re like me on something like a mid-range RX470 and budget 1080p monitor? (which I would say is a lot of people) Well, you just picked up a CPU that smashes the comparable Intel i5 chip in a lot of ways, for effectively identical gaming performance.

Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 23:56 sweenish says: There is a reason that CPU benches are run like that. While you’re correct that no one runs a setup like that, the point is to benchmark the CPU, not the GPU. They did what they said they would, and benchmarked the CPU. It’s up to you to determine how the CPU performance stacks up against what you want to do, and you can do that, because you have accurate CPU performance numbers. Log in to Reply 13/05/2017 at 20:42 Kasjer says: Yeah, this article completely misses the point that those budget Ryzen processors won’t be the ones that PC enthusiast will drop money for – taking in to consideration that new mobo and in most cases, DDR4 RAM (still on DDR3 like many of us? Tough luck) will be required. It’s not very realistic that Ryzen 5 (and even less likely with 3) CPU will be paired with GTX 1080 (or better) card. Considering the value, I think Ryzen 5 range will be very popular choice in pre-built PCs aimed at people who are looking for inexpensive PC or mid-tier one at best. This means land of 1080p/1440p 60hz monitors, anything from GTX 1050Ti, RX460 up to GTX1060 and RX480. And in such PCs, these CPUs will do quite well in terms of gaming. Plus, as it was said, Ryzen is based on new socket, which will be supported in years to come, this opens room for future upgrades of such PCs… can’t say that about buying older/second hand Intel i5/i7 CPUs. I’m currently on old i5 4460, 8GB DDR3 and 1050Ti (recent upgrade from 750Ti). In about two-three years (three is a stretch), as games will move more in to multi-threaded territory, I would have to buy new PC. Most likely I still will be stuck in 1080p 60hz land as I game on 1080p60 48 inch Samsung TV I’m not willing to retire any time soon (it’s not that old model and works great, so there is no point…). I suspect this PC will be based on second gen Ryzen processor unless Intel comes with something that can offer similar value. No going back to red team cards though, I’m too fond of low-powered silent ones from nVidia! Silent card can make huge difference when you are gaming in living room. Log in to Reply 14/05/2017 at 00:20 Jeremy Laird says: The first problem you have is that I didn’t say Ryzen 5 was “worse” for gaming. I’m afraid you made that bit up. In fact, I said, “to be sure, the Ryzen chip will mostly be just as good.” I also said that just occasionally it will frustrate. I said that based on the objective fact that it underperforms in some games. How many? Probably only a small number overall. So my broad take is that for a primarily gaming rig, I’d still lean Intel. It’s my view that you’re tangibly less likely to find a given game runs surprisingly poorly on the Intel chip. I think the Intel chip will give a good experience in pretty much every game. The AMD chip will be mostly just as good, occasionally sometimes better, but critically it will occasionally be poor. The occasionally better bit isn’t of significant value it’s better than something that’s already good – ie it’s better objectively in terms of the benchmarks, but you likely won’t be able to subjectively sense that advantage. When Ryzen occasionally runs poorly, you very much can sense it and as I said in the article, it’s not something that’s obvious from looking at the benchmark numbers. I don’t want to overstate the problem. But I tried to explain my viewpoint in the main piece. It’s not that Ryzen is a disaster. It’s that the knowledge that it occasionally underperforms in games can undermine your confidence and enjoyment. And that’s why I would be reluctant to build a gaming system around it today. You needn’t agree with that – it’s a viewpoint, not a statement of fact. But dismissing it as though I had simply said Ryzen is “worse” is to misrepresent what I wrote. And you’re wrong about the 4K thing. When Ryzen doesn’t get on nicely with a game, you can feel it at 4K as well. I’ve tried it! Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 08:52 Replikant says: I beg to disagree. The Ryzen processors are really good value for the money compared to Intels offerings and, in addition, they are probably a lot more future-proof, considering that newer games tend to have improved multi-core support and Intel is ramping up the core-count as well. Secondly, it’s a new platform, performance is bound to improve (wait for Zen+, maybe). Third, total cost of ownership of a Ryzen system should be lower than an Intel system, as far as I know, the AM4 socket is going to be around for a while. But, most importantly: We are just coming out of a ten year stretch when Intel ruled the (PC) world and followed the Way of the Dinosaurs: Become greedy, fat and lazy and hurt the (PC) environment as whole in consequence. AMD does not beat Intel in raw performance (that would be the i7 7700k) but has an advantage in terms of performance / price. So, having seen what a monopolized market looks like, we should all seriously consider buying AMD chips once in a while. Most of us probably won’t, though, because in Jeremy’s words: “The problem, therefore, is this. I reckon the mere knowledge that the Ryzen option might occasionally underperform can be quite damaging to one’s subjective enjoyment.” Funnily enough, gaming theory favors Intel.

Console game development probably points to the future of the bigger, high-sys-req PC games. This is where AMD’s long game with heterogeneous computing starts to pay off.

Log in to Reply 14/05/2017 at 00:34 Jeremy Laird says: The thing is, if Ryzen didn’t occasionally underperform, then we would all buy Ryzens. It’s not some irrational fear drummed up by Intel marketeers. The problem is that Ryzen is mostly fantastic, but where its performance is a little anomalous just so happens to take a form that slightly undermines it as a gaming CPU proposition. It’s by no means a terrible gaming CPU. It’s mostly a good gaming CPU. But if my life depended on a gaming CPU delivering a smooth subjective experience, I would choose Intel. In practice, if I was building a rig for myself today I would go Ryzen because I don’t have any PCs that are exclusively or really even primarily gaming PCs. They’re all multipurpose. I’d probably go with the 1700 and not need an upgrade for years. As an overall package, Ryzen is a really easy win. But for a system primarily for gaming, I still lean Intel for now. The margin isn’t huge. The trade offs are somewhat nuanced. But if I am providing advice about choosing a CPU for a primarily gaming rig, then that advice is that I think Intel remains the best choice today. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 09:15 Tyrmot says: I think as well while you *might* give intel the nod today, a very important consideration is that having 2 extra cores in your system right now is going to give a hell of a lot more future-proofing than going with 4. While it’s always wise to be a bit careful about future predictions, the scaling of software (including games) across more cores is, it’s reasonable to assume, pretty inevitable. Log in to Reply 14/05/2017 at 00:39 Jeremy Laird says: I would agree with that except games having been supposedly going multi-threaded for years. And yet even today so few scale well to those extras cores. I thought when the consoles went to eight weedy AMD mobile cores, that would change. But here we are years later and it still hasn’t happened. It will probably, maybe even certainly, happen one day. But will it happen within the typical lifecycle of a CPU bought today? Hard to say. And thus I lean towards buying what works best right now. it’s also worth noting that’s its’ probably going to be an awfully long time before a major game dev puts out a game that runs poorly on a quad-core Intel Kaby Lake CPU. I really can’t see that happening for many years. So, I’m largely unconvinced by the future proofing argument. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 09:27 Addie says: At the moment, having to buy a new motherboard and RAM (and probably a new graphics card to make use of the CPU) makes this look a not-too-compelling upgrade over my FX9370. But probably by the time they’re a significant improvement the prices will have come down a bit and any bugs will be squashed. I’d certainly be looking to buy an Ryzen system if I was building from new, though. Looks like the main difference between the x370 chipsets and the b350 chipsets is that the former supports SLI / CFx? I thought that dual graphics cards were basically dead in the water now anyway, being supported by very few new games, and that one graphics card at twice the price was a much more sensible investment? In which case, you can cut the price of the motherboard in half and buy more RAM instead. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 10:30 Arathorn says: The B350 motherboards might not be great for overclocking, at least that is how I understood it when I was researching for my build. Apart from that, it seems to be a great platform. It kind of depends on what you intend to do with it. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 13:09 GurtTractor says: I think most B350 boards should be fine for overclocking actually, you are more likely to hit the wall in the silicon lottery on your specific CPU than exceed the potential of the board chipset. Always a good idea to check reviews and forums for people’s overclocking results though. The main benefits to X370 are the greater number of ports and things like fan headers, many of the board’s VRMs and other components are in theory a little better but the difference is not huge. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 10:28 Arathorn says: An extra thing to keep in mind is that the 1600 comes with a bundled cooler, and the 1600X does not, so the plain 1600 is an even better price proposition than the X. RAM support for Ryzen is still somewhat crappy, making it hard to get fast RAM to work at full speed at the moment. And Ryzen benefits from fast RAM because its clock speed is linked to the communication speed between Ryzen’s two core complexes. I finally bought and built a PC with the 1600 and an RX 580 video card last week, and so far I’m very happy with it. I haven’t been able to test it with something heavy yet for lack of games, but Doom 2016 is on offer on Steam this weekend, so that sounds like a fine opportunity. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 16:05 Megadeth dude says: It’s a fallacy to assume you need “a decent X370 motherboard”. Why would you need at least that? You probably don’t know what the features are on an X370 and yet you’re assuming you need to spend the money for that. I personally got myself a cheap Gigabyte B350 Gaming (non-X even cheaper model) because I didn’t need crossfire or additional LED strip control. And this, for my Ryzen 7 1800X. And I am getting the most necessary feature, which is BIOS updates with new AGESA for memory compatibility updates. Disappointed in the article. Everyone, please watch AdoredTV’s vids on YouTube instead of taking advice from RPS. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 18:07 GurtTractor says: There’s even going to be X300 motherboards at some point which will be a cut-down small form factor (Mini-ITX) version with fewer USB ports and stuff but will allow overclocking. Should be great for a portable PC or living room console replacement. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 20:20 wodin says: I’m considering an update to the 1600 chip. Currently have a AMD 6300. Also it seems the new Ryzen and MB’s use PCI Express 3 at last. Priced a 1600 and a 370 MB for around £350. Will my current Mem be OK in the 370 Motherboard? Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 21:34 GurtTractor says: If you mean can you use your DDR3 RAM that you are currently using with your 6300, then unfortunately that wont work as DDR3 wont be compatible. Ryzen and the AM4 motherboards require DDR4 memory, which is sadly quite expensive at the moment. Log in to Reply 12/05/2017 at 21:51 Megadeth dude says: In addition to what GurtTractor said, you might want to double check if you really need a 370 mobo. It has features that the majority don’t need, so perhaps you can save a few bucks with a 350 instead. That price difference might just as well go towards a 1600X.

Still not persuaded by AMD to buy their inferior cheap ass crap with awful drivers decade after decade written in a basement by a bunch of students somewhere in India. After a bunch of “value” videocards AMD is a “never again” company in my books. Sure it’s an awful thing to say but AMD, sadly, still isn’t a valid competition nor for NVIDIA nor for Intel and I see no point in supporting them just in case things get better somewhere in the future.

The South Korean company, one of Qualcomm’s largest customers, and Intel, one of its biggest competitors, filed arguments Friday in support of the FTC’s case against Qualcomm. Both contend the San Diego-based company stops them from competing fairly against it by leveraging patents that cover the fundamentals of modern phone systems. “Intel is ready, willing, and able to compete on the merits in this market that Qualcomm has dominated for years,” Intel said in a posting on its website. “But Qualcomm has maintained an interlocking web of abusive patent and commercial practices that subverts competition on the merits.” Samsung claims its in-house chip unit is artificially held back by Qualcomm’s unwillingness to license its technology.  License Refused “Despite having requested a license from Qualcomm, Samsung cannot sell licensed Exynos chipsets to non-Samsung entities because Qualcomm has refused to license Samsung to make and sell licensed chipsets,” Samsung said in a filing. Samsung, the world’s biggest smartphone maker, uses a mixture of suppliers -- including itself and Qualcomm -- for the crucial components in its handsets. Qualcomm didn’t immediately respond to requests seeking comment on the filings. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up The company is trying to fend off a series of legal and regulatory challenges to its business practices around the world, including a suit by Apple Inc., one of its largest customers. The chipmaker gets most of its profits from selling the rights to use patents that are essential to all modern mobile phone systems. Many of the cases target the link between those license fees and its semiconductor business. Earlier Friday, the FTC urged a judge to reject Qualcomm’s request for dismissal of the agency’s case. The allegations “present a forceful antitrust case,” the commission said in a filing in federal court in San Jose, California. A hearing is set for June 15. Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg said last month that the FTC’s complaint is riddled with ”fallacies and failures.” “The Federal Trade Commission’s latest submission to the court does nothing to cure the fundamental flaws in its complaint against Qualcomm: no coherent theory of competitive harm and no allegations of the type of conduct that the antitrust laws are designed to address,” Qualcomm said Friday in a statement. “The complaint therefore should be dismissed.” Shares of Qualcomm, the world’s fourth-largest chipmaker, have slumped this year on concern that the growing legal challenges will hurt its main source of profit. The stock has lost 15 percent in 2017 compared with a 15 percent gain by the benchmark Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index. The case is Federal Trade Commission v. Qualcomm Inc., 17-cv-00220, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose). Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

If you don't need to overclock and just want a rock-solid system on the Intel side of things, the H, B, and Q series chipsets make a lot of sense over the Z or X series chipsets. Today I will look at ASRock's Fatal1ty B250M Performance, a fancy B250 chipset motherboard that supports Intel's 6th and 7th generation processors.     You lose the following features when going from the Z270 chipset to the B250 chipset; overclocking, multi-GPU support, 12 PCI-E 3.0 lanes from the PCH, two USB ports, two M.2 storage slots, vPro, SIPP, and Smart Response Technology. Even though you lose those features, ASRock ensured the motherboard has two M.2 32Gb/s slots (no RAID support), RGB LED support, and even a strong VRM.   Let's see how this budget board fairs against its more expensive counterparts.     Specifications     The Fatal1ty B250M Performance offers Intel LAN, two 32Gb/s Ultra M.2 slots, SATA6Gb/s, USB 3.0, and even four fan headers.     Pricing   The Fatal1ty B250M Performance costs $84.99.

Here are five lines of the story to watch as it unfolds. What will Comey say? Sen. Mark WarnerMark WarnerSunday shows preview: Comey fallout continues as replacement interviews kick off Five story lines to watch in Trump-Comey fight Top Intel Dem: Congress must review any Trump-Comey tapes MORE (D-Va.) told MSNBC on Friday that Comey would not testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee next week, despite an invitation to brief the panel in a closed setting. Comey has weighed in this week’s dramatic events only by a letter to FBI employees so far, telling his colleagues that he’s long-believed “a president can fire an FBI director for any reason.” ADVERTISEMENT Associates of the FBI director, however, have leaked information to the media, including that at a private dinner, Trump asked Comey whether he had his loyalty. The White House on Friday denied that story. As long as the fight between Trump and Comey is on the front burner, more leaks are possible. While Comey was a controversial figure, the nature of his firing appears to have angered people in the FBI. The president had a manila envelope delivered to Comey’s office in Washington — when the director was in California, speaking to bureau employees. He reportedly found out when televisions in the room began broadcasting the news of his dismissal. Bureau employees were reportedly shell-shocked by the unexpected dismissal and angered by the way in which Trump delivered Comey’s pink slip. If the president continues to criticize the former director — or presents a version of events that FBI employees feel misrepresents the bureau — onlookers suspect that those leaks will continue. “You have members of the law enforcement community that have an ability not only to communicate directly to the public, but also to communicate to members of Congress — and the oversight committees,” said Kevin Madden, a GOP strategist and former public affairs official in George W. Bush’s Justice Department. What will Rod Rosenstein say and do? Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein wrote the memo the White House initially used as Trump’s rationale for firing Comey. He’ll be in the spotlight next week, when he is set to brief all 100 senators on the situation. Rosenstein has faced mounting pressure to appoint a special prosecutor to handle the Russia investigation, a push that Democrats have made for months but has been renewed by the outrage over Comey’s firing. On Thursday, twenty state attorneys general penned a letter to Rosenstein urging him to immediately appoint an independent special counsel. Rosenstein was confirmed in a bipartisan 94-6 vote, but his decision to write the memo appeared to offend many Democratic supporters. His own credibility is now at risk, and there are signs that the deputy attorney general is not entirely happy with how the White House has described his role in the affair. Will GOP continue to back Trump? Comey’s firing divided Republicans in the Senate. Most senators offered some degree of support for Trump, but a number expressed reservations or even said they were troubled by the firing. In the House, Oversight Committee Chairman Jason ChaffetzJason ChaffetzFive story lines to watch in Trump-Comey fight White House’s FBI story unravels Chaffetz asks Justice Department to investigate Comey firing MORE (R-Utah) called on the Justice Department inspector general to investigate the circumstances surrounding Comey’s ouster, while Rep. Justin AmashJustin AmashFive story lines to watch in Trump-Comey fight GOP's Amash: Sessions's call for tougher sentences ‘unjust’ GOP Rep. Amash endorses Dem push for independent Russia probe MORE (Mich.) became the second Republican to cosponsor a bill setting up an independent commission to investigate Russian election interference. Trump will survive this controversy as long as his party backs him, and all signs suggest they will. But the fractures are worrisome for the embattled White House. What will happen with the FBI investigation? Comey’s firing raises major doubts about the future of the FBI’s investigation into Russian election interference, including potential links between Trump associates and Moscow. Trump himself has said the Russian investigation, which he has repeatedly denigrated as unnecessary, was a reason for the firing. Democrats see it as part of an effort to close the probe. Republican lawmakers and the FBI itself insist the probe will go forward. “Ma’am, we don’t curtail our investigations,” Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe said this week in response to questioning from Sen.

But with Comey’s exit, and Trump’s subsequent threats about tapes of conversations he had with the former FBI director, there are real questions about whether the probe will be serious. Will Trump be able to restrain himself on Twitter? Trump has arguably made the political crisis surrounding Comey worse with his Twitter habit. His tweets Friday that Comey had better watch out in case there were tapes of his conversations with the president underlined comparisons already being made to the Watergate crisis. President Richard Nixon famously taped his Oval Office conversations, which ended up backfiring on him.  Trump further undermined the credibility of his embattled press shop by raising the specter of cancelling the daily White House press briefing because his spokespeople aren’t accurately representing him. When Trump feels threatened, he punches back hard to preserve himself. But the tweets have instead deepened his troubles.

Patrick Thibodeau (Computerworld (US)) 10 July, 2015 00:53 - - - - print email Distributors ACA Pacific Alloys Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology Dicker Data Dynamic Supplies Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology Samsung Communications Synnex Topstar Computer International Wholesale IT XiT Distribution Comments IBM says it has produced the world's first 7nm (nanometer) chip, arriving well ahead of competitors, thanks to advances in its chip technology. Chip makers are now producing 14nm processors, and the next big project for Intel and other chip makers has been the 10nm chip. IBM, in its announcement today, has upended the chip industry's development path. A 7nm chip will hold about four times as many transistors in the same area as a 14nm chip, said Richard Doherty, research director of Envisioneering, a technology assessment and market research firm. In terms of chip development, IBM has "moved the field goal out," he said. "For IBM to conquer 7nm without stopping at the 10nm that Intel is supposedly tackling, means that IBM has secured the future two steps out," Doherty said. To create its 7mn test chips with functional transistors, IBM made "fundamental changes" in the materials used to create the chip as well as adopting new lithography techniques, said Mukesh Khare, vice president of semiconductor technology for IBM Research, in an interview. Those technologies include the use of a silicon-germanium alloy, which improves the flow of electrons. IBM first described this technique in 2004, and said at the time it would lead to chip improvements in 10 years. A big advance in creating the 7nm chip was the use of extreme ultraviolet lithography. Optical lithography, which is now used in building chips, has a wavelength of 193nm, but extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) has a wavelength of 13.5 nanometers, which carves much sharper patterns on silicon. "IBM research is making sure that smaller transistors and scaling can continue," Khare said. "We want to make sure that high performance computing needs for IBM systems can be met for a very long time." IBM didn't disclose its timetable for commercial development, but said it is pushing the limits of technology "beyond" 7nm. For 50 years, Moore's Law reliably predicted the doubling of transistors on a chip every two years. But as chip sizes reach the limits of physics, production costs have increased, and chip makers have been searching for new technologies to keep advancing computing performance. A key issue will be whether IBM can bring its technology to commercial production, said Roger Kay, an analyst at Endpoint Technologies. For IBM, what follows "is the hard part" because of the cost and complexity of the equipment needed for mass production, he said. IBM isn't going it alone. Last year, it announced a $3 billion, five-year investment in chip technologies and is working with Global Foundries and Samsung, among others. Its researchers are also working at the State University of New York's Poly's NanoTech Complex in Albany. Intel hasn't detailed plans for 7nm chip but is expected to release a 10nm chip as later this year. Richard Fichera, an analyst at Forrester, said IBM's effort doesn't guaranteethatb it will beat Intel to a commercial product. But if IBM continues to work with its partners and stay active in this area, it will have technologies to keep their Power chips and mainframe technology "very competitive."

View all images China's largest chip foundry is entering into a joint venture with Qualcomm to develop chips, at a time when the country is looking for technology to emerge as a semiconductor producing powerhouse. The foundry, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), has partnered with Qualcomm, Huawei Technologies and Belgian firm Imec to establish the joint venture, the companies said Tuesday. In terms of chip technology, SMIC is still two generations behind its rivals including Intel, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). But the new joint venture hopes to help the Chinese foundry streamline its research operations. The joint venture's initial goal is to develop 14-nanometer chip manufacturing technology for mass production by 2020. Currently, SMIC is still producing processors at the 28-nm scale, while its competitors are already shipping processors at the 16 and 14-nm level. Although behind industry leaders, SMIC has the support of the Chinese government, which last year released a blueprint that called for the country to lead in the semiconductor market by 2030. The government has also been funding local players, including SMIC, to make this all happen. China hopes to eventually wean itself off foreign chip makers. But even so, U.S. companies including Intel and Qualcomm have all been working to keep their presence in the country's market over the long-term. For Qualcomm, China represents big business. It is not only the largest market for smartphones, but many device manufacturers are based in the country, and using its Snapdragon mobile processors. However, the company still faces competition from Intel and domestic chip vendors, which are all competing to grab a larger share of the mobile processor market. Intel, for instance, has been partnering with Chinese companies to develop and distribute chips for smartphones and tablets. "It's not surprising that Qualcomm is trying to do the same thing and find local partners," said Kitty Fok, an analyst with research firm IDC. "They want to secure their position in China." Qualcomm's own business was on shaky ground last year because of an anti-monopoly investigation in China that led to the company getting fined US$975 million in February. Partnering with SMIC could now give Qualcomm greater access to the Chinese market. "If you are not here in China, you cannot develop something proper for the local market," Fok said. SMIC will have majority control over the new joint venture. Before the joint venture announcement, Qualcomm was already partnering with SMIC to produce Snapdragon chips using its 28 nm process.

The chip maker will release a new generation of Pentium and Celeron chips, code-named Apollo Lake, in the second half this year. The chips will appear in low-cost laptops and desktops, and are based on a new, low-power CPU architecture code-named Goldmont. Future Atom chips will also be based on Goldmont. The Apollo Lake processors will offer better CPU and graphics performance and longer battery life, Intel executives said at the Intel Developer Forum in Shenzhen, China. Entry-level PCs usually come with Pentium or Celeron chips, and prices go up when they're configured with faster Core chips. The Apollo Lake chips will succeed existing Pentium and Celeron N3000 chips, also called Braswell. Braswell, based on the older Airmont architecture, were used in low-end laptops, Chromebooks and even some tablets. Intel will also ship new Core chips based on a new Kaby Lake architecture in the second half the year. The Apollo Lake chips will have fewer memory, multimedia and I/O features.

Sign up now Menu ARN Apple's emphasis on security makes ARM-powered Macs 'inevitable' Apple's emphasis on security makes ARM-powered Macs 'inevitable' Apple convinces analyst that Macs will eventually run on custom silicon, not Intel's processors Gregg Keizer (Computerworld (US)) 21 April, 2016 05:22 - - - - print email Distributors Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology Dicker Data Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Synnex Comments Apple will offer Macs equipped with an ARM processor, the same silicon used in the iPhone and iPad, an analyst said, calling the move "inevitable" because of the company's emphasis on security and encryption. "If Apple truly wants to bring their security philosophy to their products in every part of the ecosystem, they must also do what many predict and make A-series processors for Macs," said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies, in a piece posted to Tech.pinions Tuesday (subscription required). "[Apple] has convinced me even more [that] A-series processors for Macs are inevitable." Apple's in-house-designed system-on-a-chip (SoC), which powers the iPhone and iPad, are labeled Ax, such as the A9 inside 2015's iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, and this year's iPhone 5SE. A variation of that SoC, the A9X, powers the iPad Pro line. Bajarin's prediction was based in large part on a technical briefing Apple held with a small number of analysts last week. During the briefing, Apple focused on security and encryption - a topic that has put the company in the crosshairs of the US government over accessing criminal suspects' iPhones -- by explaining the integration between the 64-bit A-series silicon, the iOS operating system, and the "Secure Enclave" co-processor. In an interview today, Bajarin characterized Secure Enclave as the "heart of every bit of encrypted information" on an iPhone or iPad. The co-processor makes possible everything from secure boot and file encryption to its best-known task, processing the fingerprint data from an iPhone's TouchID scanner to authenticate the user for unlocking the device and authorizing electronic payment via Apple Pay. "Secure Enclave sits in the middle of making all secure bits secure," said Bajarin. "The more I look back on that, it's clear that Secure Enclave plays a much larger role than we have given it credit for." Apple, not surprisingly, has divulged few technical aspects of Secure Enclave, which it introduced with the iPhone 5S in 2013. When it rolled out that model, it said only that "all fingerprint information is encrypted and stored securely in the Secure Enclave inside the A7 chip on the iPhone 5S." In September 2015, Apple posted a security white paper that included a few more details of Secure Enclave. Bajarin didn't limit his analysis to Secure Enclave, but instead pointed out the top-to-bottom control that Apple maintains over security on its devices. It crafts the A-series silicon and the Secure Enclave co-processor; it develops and maintains iOS: nothing is off the shelf, and it relies on no outside party. "Security in all of its facets is being thought through every level of the product," Bajarin said in the interview of Apple's approach. "It's built from the ground up. Out of everyone out there, Apple is above and beyond on security." But if security is at root a critical component of Apple's strategy, Bajarin argued, it surely must expand from the iOS platform to the Mac. That's where ARM, the processor architecture that Apple's SoCs are based upon, comes in. "OS X has its own security story," Bajarin acknowledged. "But given the narrative Apple's trying to tell and how much time they've spent on this philosophy, if they're serious about security they need to bring it to every bit of their product line." To accomplish on the Mac what it's done on the iPhone, Apple would have to abandon Intel as its processor supplier, and use its own A-series SoC and Secure Enclave. In turn, that would mean OS X would be discarded, at least for those Macs equipped with ARM-based silicon, and replaced by iOS itself or a variation of the operating system. Apple's emphasis on security and encryption, and how they are implemented in the iPhone by Apple's customization strategy, said Bajarin, made it clear: "It signals that it's inevitable that they will do the same for all the products that they can," he concluded. Bajarin published an initial analysis of Apple's security strategy Monday; unlike yesterday's piece, the first can be read free of charge.

The latest Mac Pro was a relief to those clamoring for an upgrade from an older version of the computer, which last received a face-lift in 2010. But the Mac Pro is again falling behind the competition, with powerful new workstations from Lenovo, Dell and HP carrying superior technology. The PC companies are waging an active campaign to tempt Mac Pro users, many of them creative professionals, to move over to Windows PCs with better CPUs, GPUs, and memory. The new Windows desktops are targeted at video editing, professional applications and the creation of virtual reality content for headsets like Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. Among the powerful new Windows machines are HP's new Z Workstations. Starting at US $4,363, the Z Workstations announced this week can be configured with Intel Xeon E5-2600 v4 chips, which have up to 22 cores. Two Nvidia Quadro M6000 GPUs in an SLI (scalable link interface) configuration can provide super-fast graphics performance. The desktop supports DDR4 memory, and there are multiple slots for SATA, SAS (serial-attached SCSI) and NVMe (non-volatile memory) SSD storage. New Dell Precision workstations, announced last week, can also support the latest 22-core Xeon E5-2600 v4 chips, based on the Broadwell architecture and also introduced last week. By comparison, the Mac Pro -- which starts at $2,999 -- supports up to 12-core Intel Xeon E5 chips based on the older Ivy Bridge microarchitecture, which started shipping in the third quarter of 2013. The desktop has older AMD FirePro GPU models and DDR3 memory. The Thunderbolt 2 ports are also outdated, and Thunderbolt 3 is two times faster, with its 40Gbps data transfer rate. The Mac Pro is still a fast machine, but creative professionals want the latest and greatest hardware, said Bob O'Donnell, principal analyst at Technalysis Research. "I compare it more to a low-end workstation," O'Donnell said. The desktop is adequate for engineering applications and video editing, but faster computers will allow creative professionals to dabble in VR, O'Donnell said. VR is a niche but emerging market, and workstations will need more horsepower for visual computing, O'Donnell said. Apple hasn't indicated it is focused on VR, which still has an uncertain future. But earlier this month, Oculus founder Palmer Luckey said Rift headset support would come to Macs if Apple ever releases "a good computer” to handle the stereoscopic content. VR headsets require top-line CPUs and GPUs in desktops. Apple has more than VR to consider if it wants to retain Mac Pro users. Apple may enter the fast-growing car market, and computer-aided automobile design will happen on workstations like Mac Pro, O'Donnell said. O'Donnell also suggested Apple could opt to merge Mac Pro with the iMac. It's not an unprecedented idea; Apple in 2010 killed its Xserve product line and provided a guide for users to transition to the Mac Pro or Mac Mini. But patience has its virtues. If Apple hangs on before upgrading Mac Pro, some breakthrough technologies could put the desktop leagues ahead of its Windows rivals. Intel is developing super-fast Optane memory SSD products, which will come to high-end gaming desktops and workstations later this year. Intel claims that Optane, which is based on a technology called 3D Xpoint, is 1,000 times faster and durable than NAND flash storage. Faster GPUs are en route as well. Apple has shown an affinity for graphics processors from AMD, which plans to release GPUs based on its Polaris architecture later this year. AMD's rival Nvidia this week introduced a new GPU called Tesla P100, based on its new Pascal architecture and targeted at high-performance computing. Nvidia could also release Quadro GPUs, based on Pascal, for workstations later this year. Apple could upgrade the Mac Pro if only to show evidence of its technological superiority over Windows rivals. There's no mantra like "good enough" computing for high-end desktops like the Mac Pro, O'Donnell said. "It's about maintaining relevance," O'Donnell said.

Now HPE is offering a way out of the ancient OS using containers, which are small buckets running instances of applications. The containers will be offered with the Linux OS. HPE will provide containers to transition from conventional mainframe-style OSes to new hardware like x86-based Xeon servers. In this case, HPE is trying to get users to transition from Itanium chips. Intel started shipping its last Itanium 9700 chips -- codenamed Kittson -- on Thursday. Correspondingly, HPE announced new Integrity i6 servers with the new chips. But the future of HP-UX servers is uncertain because Intel has no new Itanium chips beyond Kittson. "We will enable customers to re-host their HP-UX workloads on Linux-based containers running on industry-standard x86 servers in the future," said Jeff Kyle, director of product management for enterprise servers at HPE. The Integrity servers are known for their rock-solid stability, which made them attractive to large organizations in sectors like finance and retail. But moving away from Itanium to x86 is a big investment in hardware and software changes. Moreover, companies are hesitant to quickly change IT infrastructures because downtime could severely hurt their bottom line. HPE is already making it easy to move from Itanium to x86 with a software tool and x86 servers with Itanium-like features. While newer x86 hardware can take on newer tasks like machine learning, HP-UX and Integrity were designed for old-school mainframe applications. Exactly how the containers will work isn't clear. It'll likely pull HP-UX workload instances and put them in Linux as micro-services. Containers are different from virtualization, which require hypervisors, software tools, and system resources. Containers allow customers to maintain mixed HP-UX and Linux environments and make the transition smoother. At the same time, Williams said HPE believes its HP-UX customers are important. HPE will continue to improve the Integrity i6 servers at the system- and the software-level, beyond just the processor. "This includes periodic future integrations with the evolving Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) technology and continued software innovation via yearly update releases," Williams said. Servers based on Kittson also support the OpenVMS OS, which previously belonged to HP, but now is being maintained by VMS Software. A key improvement in the Integrity i6 is its integration of 3Par all-flash storage. The servers, which are available through retailers, start at around US$14,500 for an entry level configuration.

The company also chose to create its own version of a hybrid drive for Macs rather than use one of several all-in-one offerings available from third party vendors. So when Apple Monday announced another first -- that the new MacBook Air will include native PCIe flash storage technology -- some industry pundits speculated that other hardware makers will follow suit. "It's coming," said Joseph Unsworth, research vice president for NAND Flash & SSD at Gartner. Michael Yang, an analyst at memory and storage research firm IHS iSuppli, said that while Apple's move is more evolutionary than revolutionary (PCIe flash cards for servers have been around for years), the addition of native PCIe flash in the Mac Pro and MacBook Air "officializes" the technology for the masses. The cost of flash has plummeted in recent years. Once a luxury, solid state drives (SSDs) now sell for under $1 per gigabyte. Today, most desktop and laptop manufacturers offer flash in the form of a SATA-connected SSD option in their systems. Once an expensive upgrade, vendors such as Apple charge about $100 for a 128GB SSD in a MacBook Pro. The upgrade provides a significant performance boost over hard drives. PCIe-based flash takes solid-state performance to new levels. Serial ATA, the most common interface for consumer NAND flash products, communicates through a high-speed serial cable over two pair of conductors. PCIe uses a switch architecture, which has multiple end points to allow the sharing of one endpoint with multiple end devices, according to IHS analyst Fang Zhang. For example, Apple's Mac Pro will boast 1.25GBps reads and 1.0GBps writes. The best consumer SATA III SSDs today offer about 550MB/sec speeds, or about half that of PCIe flash. "The benefits to a professional user is obvious and gives Apple more bragging rights in the art and publishing segment where it has been traditionally strong," Yang said. The flash storage in the MacBook Air is now up to 45% faster than the previous generation. The MacBook Air is available with up to 512GB of flash, and, according to AnandTech, has performance that approaches a mind-blowing 800MB/sec throughput. The 11-in MacBook Air model comes standard with twice the capacity of previous models - 128GB -- but still starts at starts at $999. Ezra Gottheil, an analyst with Technology Business Research, said Apple has already proven it can to a better job than other vendors at integrating solid-state storage with an operating system. In fact, Apple is the number one consumer of flash technology, according to IHS. And, Gottheil said, Apple never misses an opportunity to upsell. "At the higher end of their notebook line they sure want to look for every possible excuse for people to spend the kind of dollars they ask for those things," Gottheil said. "So assuming the power requirements are manageable for a laptop... yeah, they'll throw everything into their top of the line notebooks."

View all images Heated competition in the smartphone and tablet markets has required chip makers to speed up the pace at which they release new processors, the CEO of ARM said in an interview this week. Following in the footsteps of Apple, rivals like Samsung and HTC are upgrading their flagship devices on a near yearly basis, adding better displays, faster chips and more memory to entice customers into buying their products. ARM designs the microprocessors used in most of those devices, and the increased competition means it's having to push out faster, more power-efficient chips at a quicker pace, CEO Simon Segars said Tuesday. "We're always going to be looking to deliver more performance, make the best use of manufacturing technology ... and deliver better system-wide efficiency," he added. ARM creates chip designs that it licenses to other companies such as Samsung, Apple and Qualcomm, who then tweak those designs for use in phones and tablets. A report last week said ARM is making rapid progress on its next major processor design, which could turn out to be the quickest design upgrade it's yet produced. The new chip could be rolling off production lines by the end of next year and appearing in mobile gadgets soon after that, according to the report, from The Linley Group. That would mean it arrives just a year after its predecessor, the Cortex-A72, which was announced in March and is expected in devices at the end of this year. The A72 also arrived sooner than expected, but it was a much-needed upgrade to its predecessor, the Cortex-A57. That chip was announced in 2012 and took two years to find its way into mobile devices -- perhaps twice as long as the current chips. Segars declined to comment on specific plans for the newest chip, but he acknowledged that ARM has been accelerating its design efforts. That's possible partly because ARM has more CPU designers than it had in the past, he said. Beyond the CPU itself, ARM is looking at ways to improve memory and to speed up data exchange between components, he said. ARM's yearly upgrade cycle mirrors that of Apple, which releases new A-series chips for its iPhones on a similar 12-month schedule. Apple's new chips typically include upgrades for the CPU, connectivity and graphics components. The tech industry has grown accustomed to the pace at which vendors upgrade PC lines, which happens every year to 18 months. ARM is meeting the demands of a smartphone industry that's heading toward a cycle of six months to one year, said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. The faster refresh cycle is the fruit of investments ARM made a few years back to help it stay ahead of Intel, its primary competitor, McCarron said. Intel's smartphone chips are used in only a few handsets, but two years ago the company said it would upgrade its mobile chips faster in an effort to break ARM's dominance. Intel year released new Atom chips code-named Merrifield and Moorefield, and earlier this year it shipped chips code-named Sofia for low-end smartphones. The Sofia chips were made in conjunction with Chinese company Rockchip, which has experience turning around processor designs in a matter of months, McCarron said. Next year Intel will ship a high-end Atom chip called Broxton, which has a modular design that allows Intel to modify the chip and deliver updates at a faster pace. Broxton supports Intel's larger plan to deliver products that can be customized more easily, making its model more similar to that of ARM. For now, the intense competition has resulted in new chips coming to market more quickly, but designing and manufacturing chips is a complex business, and it remains to be seen how long the yearly upgrade cycle will continue.

We’ve constructed a timeline of these 5G trials, embedded below, to give you a visual sense of how much action has been taking place. + MORE: Read our 5G FAQ + Two of the earliest publicized trials of 5G technology began in 2014 – one was Japan’s NTT DoCoMo, in Yokosuka, and the other was AT&T’s site in Middletown, N.J., but large-scale testing hasn’t taken off until relatively recently. The new rash of 5G announcements really kicked off at this year’s Mobile World Congress, though, where a host of carriers, smartphone vendors and other stakeholders announced plans for 5G tests in February. Adding impetus was the FCC’s move this summer to open up frequency bands that 5G technology will need to use. It’s been the carrier equipment vendors that have been talking loudest about their plans, as Ericsson and Nokia, in particular, have been public about their involvement in multiple trials with multiple partners. That makes sense, given that 5G technology could be a particularly profitable upgrade cycle – large numbers of smaller base stations, deployed to cover areas of dense demand, are going to be a big part of 5G. Qualcomm, as well, hasn’t been shy about talking up its leadership in 5G technology – a large proportion of 5G data, particularly in the U.S., will travel to endpoints using its silicon, and the company has been publicly involved with trials and technology research with both carriers and hardware manufacturers as its partners. We’ve been talking about 5G, at least in concept, for at least 10 years. Craig Mathias, Principal with Farpoint Group The quickening pace of research and development means that we’re closer than ever to functional standards and reference designs for 5G tech, which is the main prerequisite for mass deployment. However, according to wireless analyst and Network World contributor Craig Mathias, elements of 5G tech actually predate 4G hitting the marketplace. “We’ve been talking about 5G, at least in concept, for at least 10 years,” Mathias said.  A caveat here about our timeline – carriers, equipment manufacturers and other stakeholders have been eager to trumpet the fact that they’re working on 5G technology, but occasionally less forthcoming about precise dates, times and the specific nature of their tests. This suggests that these companies think there’s still some competitive differentiation to be had. Major U.S. carriers, in particular, have been relatively tight-lipped. But that’s not to say they haven’t provided some glimpses into a 5G future. Sprint demonstrated centimeter-wave (15GHz) technology at a Copa America soccer match this summer in Philadelphia, providing 4Gbps download speeds to attendees and showcasing live 4K video feeds. And other carriers, albeit in somewhat different deployments, are reporting much higher speeds – NTT DoCoMo’s recent testing of millimeter-wave (70GHz) tech provided 48Gbps in throughput, and T-Mobile says it’s reached 12Gbps with less than 2ms of latency. These are eye-catching numbers, without a doubt, but need to be taken with a grain of salt – the real target speed for 5G connectivity is anywhere from 100Mbps to 1Gbps, depending on context and who you’re asking, which reflects the much higher load demands of a real-world environment. But even at the lower bound, it’s worth noting that that’s roughly 10 times faster than the U.S. average 4G connection, according to a February report from OpenSignal. The accepted timeline for 5G’s general availability sees the standards work completed by 2018 or 2019, and customer deployment by 2020, yet estimates differ. Ericsson, a key player in the development of 5G, recently predicted that about a quarter of mobile subscriptions would use 5G tech by 2022, which dovetails roughly with analysts like Mathias who see 2023 as the approximate splashdown date for 5G. But it seems clear that 5G is under more intense development than ever before – while there’s a long way to go before it hits the consumer market, the major stakeholders have the technology uppermost in their minds, and large-scale testing is well and truly under way.

The South Korean company, one of Qualcomm’s largest customers, and Intel, one of its biggest competitors, filed arguments Friday in support of the FTC’s case against Qualcomm. Both contend the San Diego-based company stops them from competing fairly against it by leveraging patents that cover the fundamentals of modern phone systems. More from Bloomberg.com: Trump Escalates War With FBI, and the Bureau Fights Back “Intel is ready, willing, and able to compete on the merits in this market that Qualcomm has dominated for years,” Intel said in a posting on its website . “But Qualcomm has maintained an interlocking web of abusive patent and commercial practices that subverts competition on the merits.” Samsung claims its in-house chip unit is artificially held back by Qualcomm’s unwillingness to license its technology.  License Refused “Despite having requested a license from Qualcomm, Samsung cannot sell licensed Exynos chipsets to non-Samsung entities because Qualcomm has refused to license Samsung to make and sell licensed chipsets,” Samsung said in a filing. Samsung, the world’s biggest smartphone maker, uses a mixture of suppliers -- including itself and Qualcomm -- for the crucial components in its handsets. More from Bloomberg.com: Trump’s Know-Nothing Tour de Force Qualcomm didn’t immediately respond to requests seeking comment on the filings. The company is trying to fend off a series of legal and regulatory challenges to its business practices around the world, including a suit by Apple Inc ., one of its largest customers. The chipmaker gets most of its profits from selling the rights to use patents that are essential to all modern mobile phone systems. Many of the cases target the link between those license fees and its semiconductor business. Earlier Friday, the FTC urged a judge to reject Qualcomm’s request for dismissal of the agency’s case. The allegations “present a forceful antitrust case,” the commission said in a filing in federal court in San Jose, California. A hearing is set for June 15. More from Bloomberg.com: White House Refuses to Say Whether Trump Tapes Conversations Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg said last month that the FTC’s complaint is riddled with ”fallacies and failures.” “The Federal Trade Commission’s latest submission to the court does nothing to cure the fundamental flaws in its complaint against Qualcomm: no coherent theory of competitive harm and no allegations of the type of conduct that the antitrust laws are designed to address,” Qualcomm said Friday in a statement. “The complaint therefore should be dismissed.” Shares of Qualcomm, the world’s fourth-largest chipmaker, have slumped this year on concern that the growing legal challenges will hurt its main source of profit. The stock has lost 15 percent in 2017 compared with a 15 percent gain by the benchmark Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index. The case is Federal Trade Commission v. Qualcomm Inc., 17-cv-00220, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose). Updates with Samsung, Intel allegations in second paragraph.

Home Archives Ed Morrissey Show Newsletters   Huh: Comey turns down Senate Intel Committee’s invitation to testify next week posted at 6:01 pm on May 12, 2017 by Allahpundit Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES It’s subpoena time. Senate Intel committee ranking member Mark Warner (D-VA) told MSNBC Friday that former FBI Director James Comey will not be appearing before the committee next Tuesday, despite an invitation to speak with the committee behind closed doors. That’s after a day of intrigue following President Trump taunting Comey over the prospect of “tapes” from their conversations before the firing. “He can’t look eager to shiv his old boss, can he?” tweeted my pal Karl, speculating about Comey’s motives. That’s probably right. With Trump immolating himself over this in interviews and on Twitter, replete with threats and insults, Comey’s better off getting out of Trump’s way and letting him continue to make trouble for himself. The narrative that’s being set up here for him by Trump’s critics is that he’s a flawed but well-meaning lawman who did his duty with the Russia probe and was punished for it by a lawless, vindictive president. If Comey goes up to the Hill and tears Trump up in front of the Intelligence Committee, he loses some of that perception that he’s above the fray, concerned only with duty. And if he cares as much about the FBI’s reputation as his allies claim, he must realize that ripping the president to a bunch of congressmen a week after he was fired won’t reflect well on a Bureau that’s already taken heavy flak for politicization. Or maybe the guy’s just tired of media heat and wants to let it cool down before he says something else in public: Source w/firsthand knowledge tells me Comey turned down Senate invite to testify b/c "wants to lay low for a while & take some time off" — Jim Sciutto (@jimsciutto) May 12, 2017 Worst-case scenario: The Committee subpoenas him and he goes to the Hill as the reluctant truthteller, forced to speak out against President Trump even though he was willing to stay home and not say a word. And if they don’t subpoena him, no worries. Comey himself is probably the source in at least half the stories this week citing a “source close to Comey” for his thinking. He has ways of getting his opinions out. Speaking of which, a … source close to Comey told Jake Tapper that Trump did ask him to pledge his loyalty at a dinner in January and that Comey was “taken aback” by it. Jeanine Pirro asked Trump if that’s true in an interview set to Saturday. Nope, said Trump — although he thought it wouldn’t be a bad question to ask and wouldn’t be inappropriate: Trump, after appearing to threaten the FBI director he just fired with a possible secret WH recording, now says he won't talk about it pic.twitter.com/qJnVJSqFdw — Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) May 12, 2017 Here’s Chris Wallace and Shepard Smith aghast at the idea that Trump not only might have recorded his chat with Comey but would want to advertise that fact.

Turns out, I was a bit early... but not by much. With the release of NVIDIA's GeForce 10 series, the company's mobile GPUs flaunt near-desktop levels of performance. Which makes buying a notebook in 2017 an exciting proposition. But how best to spend those valuable dollars while satisfying your gaming urges? Metabox's Alpha N850HK could be the answer. What Is It? Metabox's Alpha series represents the builder's more affordable range of notebooks. In terms of specifications however, they are in no way slouches. 15.6" and 17.3" units are available, all packing Intel's i7-7700HQ processor. The quad-core chip is close to the top-end of laptop CPUs. Where the main differentiation comes is the graphics. Depending on the model you go with, you'll get a GTX 1050 or 1050 Ti. The chips are comparable — 640MHz/1354MHz core and memory clocks versus 768MHz/1493MHz for the Ti. Both have a 128-bit bus. But the Ti has a little extra under the hood — 48 texture units and 32 render output units, up from the 1050's 40 and 16. For this review, we'll be looking at the N850HK, which comes with the 1050 Ti. Because Metabox allows you to customise almost everything about the build, here are the particulars of our configuration: 15.6" FHD 1920x1080 IPS WVA Matte 60Hz LED NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 4GB Intel Core i7-7700HQ Processor (up to 3.8GHz) 16GB DDR4 2400MHZ SK Hynix SC308 512GB SATA3 SSD Intel 3168 AC Dual Band Wi-Fi 378 x 267 x 26.9mm (WDH) 2.3kg (with battery) This level of customisation means the price can vary a lot. At the time of writing, going with the minimal build (no OS or hard drive), you'll be out $1349. The cheapest drive, a 128GB Intel SSD, brings this to $1449, while tossing in Windows 10 raises the total to $1594. Keep in mind that Metabox (and resellers) tend to have deals going at various times, so you can save a hundred bucks or so by timing your purchase. In terms of the design, the chassis is solid plastic, sturdy and low-fuss. The lid is tightly sealed — you'll need to hold the base down before cracking it open, lest you flip the thing. It's totally black, except for self-lit keyboard, grey Metabox logos and the gleam of copper through the cooling vents. Speaking of vents, there's three — a bottom intake and two outtakes positioned in the back-left and right sides. If you enjoy having a warm mouse hand, this is the notebook for you. At 2.3kg it's no ultrabook and sits on the borderline of being too weighty as an all-day backpack carry. But, given the hardware inside, it's a reasonable compromise. Finally, it comes with plenty of ports: 1x USB 2.0 3x USB 3.0 (1x Type C, 2x Type A) 1x HDMI 2x Mini DisplayPort 1.2 1x headphone jack 1x microphone jack 1x RJ-45 1Gb/s LAN There's also a six-in-one card reader (MMC, RSMMC, SD, miniSD, SDHC, SDXC) for all your photo and tiny storage needs. What's It Good At? Image: Metabox As a budget gaming notebook, the N850HK excels. You'll be hard-pressed finding a cheaper notebook with the same specifications and build quality outside of ridiculous discounts and second-hand gear. The i7 chip slays every game you throw at it, leaving the 1050 Ti as the deciding factor. We tested with two benchmarks — The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and 3DMark's Fire Strike. Because the former doesn't come with a benchmark mode, the game was played for a fixed period at each quality setting, starting with the game's first fight and riding to the next cinematic. Post-processing quality was left at "High". All benchmarks were conducted at the display's native resolution of 1920 x 1080 (click the images for larger versions). Image: Supplied Image: Supplied As you can see, if you blindly go Ultra and cross your fingers, you're going to be disappointed. Still, I was impressed that the game wasn't a slideshow at those settings. I wouldn't call it smooth, but it was definitely playable, if you prefer eye-candy over frames. Once you get to medium details, thing are more acceptable. It's important to keep in mind that The Witcher 3 is at the top-end. If almost any other game is your bag, the 1050 Ti will be able to handle it at high settings. When it can't a few strategic tweaks will almost certainly make things buttery smooth. What's It Not Good At? If you just want to play games at ultra levels, then the N850HK won't satisfy. You'll want a notebook with the 1060 at a minimum. The screen isn't the best going around, if you go for the 1920 x 1080 option. At over 15 inches, the discerning eye can pick up the subtle grid pattern of the display (I've been spoiled for years by the glorious screen of ASUS' UX32VD). Once anything of substance is happening though, it's almost impossible to notice. A 4K panel is an option for ~$350. Battery life also wasn't flash. Idling with the screen always on, the unit lasted three hours and 27 minutes. Under heavy load (FurMark's stress test) it managed 40 minutes, so don't expect to play demanding games for long unplugged. In terms of temperatures, the unit happily idled at 42°C / 46°C for the CPU and GPU respectively at 20°C ambient. Under load running Prime95 and FurMark, these hit 97°C and 77°C respectively. Unsurprisingly, the CPU's throttling logic was triggered, which brought the core down to 90°C for the rest of the test. Consider these numbers the upper limits. Normal use, even playing a demanding game, would never make the hardware this hot and the N850HK's cooling system is more than adequate for the hardware. Should You Buy It? The 1050 Ti can't quite take the crown as a bang-for-your-buck miracle... but it's close enough. If you're the sort of gamer that doesn't want to stuff around with optimal graphics settings, then you should turn your eyes to Metabox's 1060-equipped offerings, which start with its Prime range. The issue here is you're going to need to spend a couple of hundred extra dollars for the privilege. The 1060 Prime starts at $1799 — and that doesn't include an operating system. That said, if you have an extra $200-$300 to spend, it's worth paying for the 1060's grunt. All up, the Alpha N850HK is a fantastic balance of portability, power and price. Sure, a 1060 would be nice, but the 1050 Ti keeps the notebook in the ~$1500 bracket, which for a lot of people is the upper spending limit when it comes to notebooks. For the cost, the N850HK is about as good as it gets. Comments Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

Apple MacBook Pro vs. Microsoft Surface Laptop: What Apple Needs For Future Models. May 13, 2017 by Staff   Filed under Opinion, Tech/Internet, Weekly Columns 1 Comment Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 2 Tweet (ThyBlackMan.com) Cupertino based tech giant has not revealed the new Apple MacBook Pro release details and it seems that the company won’t bring it anytime soon. The last year’s MacBook Pro brings so much for the users, most importantly the Touch Bar version. On the other hand, Microsoft announced its Surface Laptop which is said to give nightmares to Apple. The Microsoft Surface Laptop is highly customizable and has a lot more to offer to its specified target audience, here’s a comparative analysis to find out what Apple needs for its MacBook Pro product line. Check out this Apple MacBook Pro vs. Microsoft Surface Laptop battle to see what Apple lacks and what it should do to remain at the top. In terms of design, the 13-inch Apple MacBook Pro when compared with the Microsoft Surface Laptop is found to be 5 percent shorter. The MacBook Pro feels lighter, but against its rival Surface Laptop, it is heavier. Microsoft has strategically delivered 13.5-inch display because it is undoubtedly bigger than what 13-inch Pro offers. Rivals have so much to make Apple nervous. Despite being so lightweight and bigger in size, Microsoft Surface Laptop also comes in the same aluminum body as Apple’s MacBook Pro. When it comes to color options, Surface again beats MacBook Pro with its four unique color options. Both the Apple’s MacBook Pro models (Touch Bar and non-Touch Bar) are powered by 6th-generation Intel core i5 processors, where the Touch Bar model is faster than the latter. Apple also allows users to upgrade to an i7 6th-generation processor. On the other hand, the Surface Laptop comes with 7th-gen i5 and i7 processors. Apple undoubtedly needs to bring a bit more powerful product in its MacBook Pro line. Apple delivers its MacBook Pro with 8GB RAM and it can be configured up to 16GB, while the Surface Laptop is set to give you 3 options to choose from (4GB, 8GB and 16GB RAM). You can see that Microsoft has introduced more options for different buyer categories. Even though the company aims to focus on students only, it still manages to bring multiple options. Battery life is one of the major concerns with today’s laptops. Microsoft promises 14.5 hour battery life. However the company hasn’t shared specific details about the battery it is using, but if the claim turns out to be true, Apple will be facing a strong competition. In Apple’s realm, the non-Touch Bar MacBook Pro features a larger battery than the Pro’s Touch Bar edition. But for both of them, Apple promises 10-hour battery life. The Apple’s MacBook Pro comes with TouchID fingerprint sensor that allows users to login easily. The same feature can’t be expected from the Surface Laptop, but there’s one thing you would want to see in MacBooks is the face recognition feature. For easy logins, Microsoft is giving a Windows Hello face recognition feature. Other than the soothing colors, Microsoft has given Alcantara fabric-covered keyboard in Surface Laptop which is absent in Apple’s MacBook Pro. The synthetic microfiber not only gives the keyboard a clean and elegant look, but it also makes the keyboard soft and surprisingly changes the key press sound. This is not something all the Apple MacBook Pro fans would want, since the wear and tear issues with this approach remain to be discovered. With Apple products, price has always been a subject of discussions. One of the reasons behind Apple’s success is its different pricing strategy, but it is also a reason why a large number of people are still choosing other brands over Apple. If you look at the Microsoft Surface Laptop’s price tag, it will tell you a clear story that the laptop is made for those who prefer functionality within budget. On the other hand, Apple MacBook Pro is available at almost US$500 higher price tag. Apple is undoubtedly doing well, but tech enthusiasts have high expectations and hopes. This time when Microsoft has jumped into the laptop market, it would be interesting to see what Apple does to hold the ground and its position. Staff Writer; Corey Shaw Have any Tech Tips? News?

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sun, May 14, 2017 - Page 16　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Intel to support FTC suit against rival Qualcomm RIGHT SALES:Chipmaker Qualcomm makes most of its profits from selling the rights to use its patents on systems essential to all modern mobile phones Bloomberg Intel Corp, the world’s largest chipmaker, is to go public with its support for a US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) lawsuit against Qualcomm Inc that accuses it of trying to maintain an illegal monopoly in the market for semiconductors used in smartphones. Intel was to make a filing and publish its reasons for supporting the FTC case on Friday, according to company spokesman Will Moss. Intel competes with Qualcomm in the market for chips that connect smartphones, including the iPhone, to mobile phone networks. Qualcomm is trying to fend off a series of legal and regulatory challenges to its business practices around the world, including a suit by Apple Inc, one of its largest customers. The chipmaker gets most of its profits from selling the rights to use patents that are essential to all modern mobile phone systems. Many of the cases target the link between those license fees and its semiconductor business. Earlier on Friday, the FTC in a filing in federal court in San Jose, California, urged a judge to reject Qualcomm’s request for dismissal of the agency’s case, saying the allegations “present a forceful antitrust case.” A hearing is set for June 15. “The Federal Trade Commission’s latest submission to the court does nothing to cure the fundamental flaws in its complaint against Qualcomm: No coherent theory of competitive harm and no allegations of the type of conduct that the antitrust laws are designed to address,” Qualcomm said in a statement. “The complaint therefore should be dismissed.” Shares of Qualcomm, the world’s fourth-largest chipmaker, have slumped this year on concern that the growing legal challenges would hurt its main source of profit. The stock has lost 15 percent this year, compared with a 15 percent gain by the benchmark Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index. This story has been viewed 919 times.

Apart from that, the Acer Predator Helios 300 will also boast of fast wireless connectivity and solid state drives, while Dual AeroBlade 3D fans will ensure that no matter how frantic the gameplay ends up, you will still have a nice and cool gaming rig to keep you in the hunt.

The Acer Predator Helios 300 will arrive in a classic but tasteful gaming chassis, where it boasts of an iron red backlit keyboard, while selected models will include a metal top cover and keyboard area that showcases additional strength and rigidity.

Expect the Acer Predator Helios 300 to retail for $1,299 onward for the 15.6-inch model, while the 17.3-inch model is going for a Benjamin more.

Centre Com sells a range of PC, peripherals and other technology products from vendors such as HP, Intel, Western Digital, ASUS, Samsung and Lenovo. The retailer, which operates its business via shopfront in 10 locations in Victoria, as well as online, and its sole director Raymond Xianke Huang, have agreed to pay Microsoft the money as part of a landmark settlement agreement. Microsoft's investigators purchased two new computer systems from Centre Com, according to the vendor, which were found to have counterfeit Certificates of Authenticity (COAs) attached, with unauthorised copies of Windows 7 Professional installed. Centre Com subsequently admitted to installing unlicensed Microsoft Windows operating systems on computers using leaked product keys and counterfeit COAs, Microsoft said. As part of the settlement, Centre Com has undertaken not to deal in any unlicensed Microsoft software products. Both Microsoft and Centre Com have said that they are "very pleased to have resolved the matter so they can continue to develop their working relationship,” according to the vendor. “Microsoft acknowledges Centre Com’s co-operation in this matter, and will continue its business relationship with Centre Com on the basis of the undertakings it has given,” Microsoft senior attorney, Clayton Noble, said. “Purchasing Microsoft products from unauthorised resellers compromises the integrity of software distribution channels, and is unfair to those Microsoft resellers who obey the law and purchase and resell only genuine and licensed Microsoft software products available from Microsoft’s authorised distributors,” he said.

The settlement comes just weeks after Microsoft was awarded damages of nearly $1 million after a legal battle over copyright infringements by online software seller, Moonbox Software. In April, it emerged that the Federal Circuit Court of Australia ruled that Microsoft should receive damages of $957,895 from Moonbox Software and its four directors, Jordan Barnett, Benjamin Davies, Daniel Leslie, and Frederick Porter, for infringement of Microsoft’s copyright. According to Microsoft, the damages awarded were comprised of compensatory damages and additional damages, with additional damages awarded because of the “flagrancy of copyright infringement” by Moonbox.

Tsering’s work for an Oregon Health and Science University hearing research lab has earned her scholarships and awards at state science fairs. This weekend, she heads to Los Angeles to compete in the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. Amanda Cowan/The Columbian Sixteen-year-old Tsering Shola of Camas was diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss in the fifth grade. The deficit requires a hearing aid but also prompted Tsering to get involved with hearing research. By Marissa Harshman, Columbian Health Reporter Published: May 13, 2017, 6:06 AM A   A In the fifth grade, a routine test revealed hearing loss in Tsering Shola’s right ear. Little did Tsering or her parents know, that diagnosis would set Shola up for success as a Camas High School sophomore. This weekend, Tsering is heading to Los Angeles to compete in the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair — the largest precollege scientific research event in the world. The trip will cap a string of successes the 16-year-old has had at state science fairs where she presented a project that made “a great contribution” to an Oregon Health & Science University lab. “She deserves the accolades coming her way,” said Peter Steyger, a researcher and professor of otolaryngology at OHSU. Steyger has been mentoring Tsering for about a year and a half. Validating work As an elementary school student, Tsering was diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss — the most common type of hearing loss. The deficit was great enough that Tsering needed a hearing aid, but it also sparked a career interest. “I thought it would be cool to be an audiologist,” she said. As an eighth-grader, Tsering decided to act on that interest and reached out to local professors, one of whom connected the middle schooler to Steyger. “I was very happy to take her on, primarily because she also has a hearing loss like myself,” Steyger said. “It’s been a very fruitful collaboration, really.” Because she wasn’t yet 16, Tsering couldn’t work in the actual lab. So Steyger presented her with a project that could be done anywhere Tsering could use a computer. When certain drugs — namely, a class of antibiotics called aminoglycosides — cross the blood-labyrinth barrier, they enter the tissues of the inner ear, such as the cochlear, and can kill the sensory cells that allow a person to hear. To learn how and why that happens, researchers segment images of the inner ear using a manual process that can take hours for each image, Steyger said. A colleague of Steyger’s developed an algorithm that allows a machine to do the segmenting. The problem was nobody had the time to test the effectiveness of the machine by comparing its results with that of manual segmenting, Steyger said. So, Steyger presented the project to Tsering. Over about seven months, the high schooler manually manipulated the images and then ran the same images through the machine and compared the results. She looked at 150 to 200 images. The manual segmenting took about two hours for each image; the machine did it in about 2 minutes. “It’s much, much faster if we can validate the process,” Steyger said. “And that’s exactly what (Tsering) tested, and she found the machine segmentation paralleled the manual segmentation.” “We now have very good confidence in our machine segmentation, thanks to Tsering,” he added. “That gives a good foundation to automate what we’ve been doing manually for 10 years.” While the work was important, it certainly wasn’t glamorous. “It really is grunt work,” Steyger said. For Tsering, just being exposed to Steyger and others in the OHSU lab pushed her to stick with the project, she said. She also tried to make the project fun. “I thought of spending hours on these images as a coloring book because that’s kinda what it is,” Tsering said. “I made it fun in quirky ways.” ‘Blessing in disguise’ That painstaking work is paying off for Tsering. In March, Tsering placed first in the life sciences category and second overall at the Southwest Washington Regional Science and Engineering Fair — her first science fair competition. The second-place finish earned her a spot in the Intel competition, which runs Sunday through Thursday. Then, in April, Tsering finished first in the biomedical and health sciences category at the Washington State Science and Engineering Fair. Her project was also one of the top 18 presented at the fair. At the state fair, Tsering was awarded an $80,000 scholarship to Ohio Wesleyan University and one paid quarter at The Evergreen State College. She also received a software license from Wolfram Research – Mathematica. Tsering isn’t putting pressure on herself heading into the Intel event this weekend. She’s found she performs best when she has a “try your best” mindset. And, for Tsering, just educating people about something that has changed her life is rewarding enough. “It’s a blessing in disguise,” Tsering said. “If I wasn’t diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss, I definitely wouldn’t see myself down this path.” “I’m glad I’m deaf.”     Marissa Harshman Columbian Health Reporter  360-735-4546  @MarissaHarshman  Send an Email  Facebook Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

Image Credit: Anthony Quintano/Flickr We all know the San Francisco Bay Area is home to Silicon Valley, but a few cities and states around the country are trying to recreate the region’s success. In Nebraska, you have Silicon Prairie, then there’s Silicon Alley in New York City, Silicon Roundabout in London, and Silicon Beach in Venice, California. Many of these have popped up in just the past few years, and some states are beginning to realize the importance of supporting these new innovation hubs. Among these is one of the most isolated states, geographically speaking: Hawaii. Working with the local community, the government has been pursuing efforts to establish a tech hub that is being dubbed Startup Paradise. During my last visit to Hawaii, I spoke with Governor David Ige and others about the initiative, which is meant to further diversify the Aloha State’s industries and retain its talent. Diversifying the economy Above: Waikiki beach photographed from a Genesis Aviation Helicopter tour. Much of Hawaii’s economy is reliant on tourism and hospitality. Image Credit: Edmund Garman/Flickr “I’m an electrical engineer by profession, a University of Hawai’i [alumnus], and I graduated in that first boom of tech,” Governor Ige said. “When I graduated…I had 41 job offers, 40 of them were on the mainland, and they were from everyone. My first time out of state was a job interview with Intel, IBM, and Hewlett Packard in Silicon Valley. So fast forward, once I became a legislator, I was on a mission to create more job opportunities for tech people and engineers…out of five friends in my EE class, four of them went to the mainland and never came back.” Finding a thriving tech ecosystem in Hawaii is really difficult — I tried. During my trip, I sought out people I knew to see if maybe there was a startup market that remained relatively off the radar. Though there are accelerators, such as Blue Startups and Elemental Excelerator, and innovation centers, it’s rare to see a local startup make it big in Hawaii. But efforts are now being made to change all of that. When I graduated from the University of Hawaii (UH), working in tech didn’t seem like a viable option — the focus was on travel and hospitality at that time. And unlike Stanford, Caltech, MIT, and others, Hawaii’s universities are perhaps known for their strong international business and research programs. So how can the state offer its young tech workers and entrepreneurs a reason to remain in Hawaii and contribute to the local economy? During his time in the legislature, Governor Ige wrote all of the state’s venture capital laws, including creating the Hawaii Strategic Development Corporation (HSDC), which is tasked with making investments to boost economic development. “When I started, we had zero venture investments in the state of Hawaii..people weren’t interested in making this kind of investment,” he said. “We’ve had great tech successes, when you look at UH and the kind of things that started and evolved here, what should have been and could have been, but there was really no environment. When you talk about the ethernet and the core, it really started at UH. AlohaNet and the Aloha Protocol was really the beginning of TCP/IP — it’s the basic underpinning of the internet. None of it comes back to Hawaii, but it definitely was started here.” Above: Hawaii Governor David Ige Image Credit: State of Hawaii/Flickr He continued, “Clearly for me, now as governor, it really is about how we can complete the environment. How can we create opportunities for people so that the electrical engineering graduate from UH today has 40 local job offers and 1 from the mainland? Because that’s really what we want. And if you look at our economy from the 30,000 feet level, the hospitality industry is number one. We started this transition in 1950 when we knew that sugars, plantation, and big agriculture growth was limited and we started to think about the next economic driver in our community.” Above: The Verifone credit card swipe reader was founded in Hawaii. Image Credit: Mike Mozart/Flickr While Hawaii is still largely focused on tourism, some believe diversification is the key to supporting the state’s economy, and the governor subscribes to that idea: “The challenge for us is that we’ve pretty much hit that ceiling to expand, and creating more jobs in the visitor industry really places too much of a burden on the natural resources that impact the community. So what’s the next great job creator for our community? It’s about innovation.” He alluded to how payment tech company Verifone got its start in Hawaii in the 1980s before eventually settling in San Jose, Calif. “If we had the right ecosystem and they stayed here, that definitely would be a great job creator,” he said. Starting in Hawaii but ending on the mainland Make no mistake, there are startups in Hawaii, but there are nowhere near as many as you’d find in cities known for being technology hubs. Startups based on the islands are not necessarily concentrated on consumer applications, but are more in tune with “non-sexy” technology fields, such as energy, biotech, and medicine, areas Hawaii is known for. Above: Hawaii-based Blue Startups brought its portfolio companies to San Francisco in 2016 to demo for investors. Image Credit: Ryan Ozawa But, as the governor said, talent is escaping the islands and as people leave, so do the startups. To counter this trend, Hawaii is working to aggregate enough venture capital to incentivize entrepreneurs to stay. Last year, Governor Ige proposed that there should be consistent state investment in private equity and risk capital. He wants to have the HSDC work alongside accelerators and venture funds to invest in projects. “Yes, it’s a big challenge,” he acknowledged. “I do think it’s about creating an ecosystem…I think it’s about creating an environment. I really do believe it’s a state of mind. People leave because they believe they have a better shot at being successful by going. I think it’s really about getting the startups here and it really takes just one that really commits to staying here. We have a couple of serial entrepreneurs that are committed to Hawaii. To me, that’s just as important as getting the equity. I mean, you want those business owners and entrepreneurs to be invested in Hawaii and really want to have their headquarters here.” Some of the people I spoke with described a less-than-ideal venture capital environment and said that local investors tended to be gun-shy about putting money in unless they can get a mainland firm like Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Sequoia Capital, or Andreessen Horowitz to participate. Above: Blue Startups’ managing director Chenoa Farnsworth Image Credit: Blue Startups “It’s on us to show the world that we can create that quality, competitive company here. We have to create enough companies [in Hawaii] that a VC will see a pattern or trend,” said Chenoa Farnsworth, the managing director of Blue Startups, one of the more active startup accelerators in the state. Governor Ige remains optimistic: “I do think that it’s a matter of mindset and if we can nurture enough of these startups and get them to the brink — and it’s really about getting one group of entrepreneurs who said that ‘we’re going to plant our flag in Hawaii’. And when they’re successful, other successes will follow.” It’s about execution Diversifying a state’s economy and moving forward with innovative technologies is definitely easier said than done, as the state has had at least one major stumble in recent history. In 2016, a Maui-based technology fund for early-stage startups, called Mbloom, was shuttered amid allegations that one of the investors engaged in securities fraud and that the fund’s initial investments were rife with conflicts of interest. The other major investment party to this was the state, and HSDC moved swiftly to terminate the venture, especially since it was supported by taxpayer money. Hawaii did offer startups tax breaks for doing business in the state some years back, through a law called Act 221. But it was not renewed due to concerns about whether it was really effective. Governor Ige voted in favor of Act 221 when he was a legislator and has previously stated that he believes it was a good law that needed a few tweaks: “Act 221 could be executed better. When we passed the law, we provided tremendous flexibility to the executive. We had a very broad definition, and we enabled the executive to implement. I believe that part of the challenges and the controversy truly was a result of poor decision-making on execution,” he explained. Above: Governor David Ige Image Credit: Anthony Quintano/Civil Beat While in his first term as the state’s chief executive, the governor has also proposed establishing a $30 million innovation fund, setting aside money from corporate tax revenues over six years to support startups. First announced in his 2016 State of the State address, Governor Ige revealed that he had submitted legislation that would take $5 million each year for five consecutive years. The money would go into a strategic fund that would be co-invested with a private provider. “What we’re trying to do is commit a steady flow of income that would allow [the fund investors] to begin to program and set up relationships so they can create a sustained kind of investment pool,” he explained. “It would be $30 million over the next six years that they can count on. I’m pretty confident that in six years, we’ll be able to prove success, that we’ll be able to convince the other legislators to…make bigger investments.” Above: Hawaii’s Governor David Ige gives his State of the State address in 2016. Image Credit: Screenshot During this year’s State of the State address, Governor Ige touted the impact of innovation, announcing that 145 startups have gone through six accelerator programs, receiving $10 million in venture capital and generating more than $250 million in total capital. “That’s why the budget includes additional funds for the Hi Growth program,” he said in prepared remarks. While the state executive and community organizations are behind this diversification effort, how does the general public feel about their taxes being used to boost tech companies? Governor Ige is bullish, telling VentureBeat, “I think that many of us who are residents see the same challenges. Our economy is doing great. Our unemployment is among the lowest in the country. The hospitality industry generates a lot of jobs, but they are living wage jobs. If you look at the median home price at $700,000, a lot of those jobs generated by the visitor industry would [make it] tough to be able to live here.” As for the business community, he said: “I think they get it. I have three children and they’re all in school. What decisions do we make today to give them the best opportunity to call Hawaii home, to be able to have them graduate and find a challenging and enticing job opportunity in Hawaii that pays them a living wage and allows them to purchase a home so they can choose to call Hawaii home? I think for me, and many of those in our community, it really is about how we can create these opportunities.” Above: Hawaii Governor Ige at the 2017 STEM conference. Image Credit: State of Hawaii/Flickr What Governor Ige, Farnsworth, and others in Hawaii are attempting isn’t new — others in the state have tried to establish a startup community of sorts. In 2012, the governor’s predecessor, Neil Abercrombie, signed into law HB2319, which would appropriate $2 million for a venture accelerator funding program. It was under Abercrombie that the aforementioned Hi Growth program, a state-sanctioned program to engage with the private sector, was created. In 2013, then-Governor Abercrombie proposed providing $20 million in funding to focus on “the critical building blocks of research commercialization, entrepreneur mentoring, and the mobilization of startup investment capital.” But while efforts have been made before now, the question is what it will take to make a real dent on the startup ecosystem. In search of a startup paradise “I’ve lived [innovation] and kind of understand how it works. I see the ups and downs in it,” Governor Ige said. “I understand how when it’s other people making investment, it’s about the money. So how do we create private equity and risk capital in Hawaii that believes in Hawaii?” “It’s so funny how at one point in time, green companies were an outlier. People thought: ‘Who cares if your policies are green or if your company takes care of itself?’ Today, you can’t be a successful company if you’re not green,” he continued. “What we’re looking to create are companies that are truly doing the right things in the right way in every step of the way. These are the kind of companies that we want to build.” To attract talent, startups, and investors, Governor Ige is backing the Startup Paradise initiative that was put forth by the local community and HSDC. As the name suggests, Hawaii believes that its real appeal lies in its being…well, Hawaii. The program also focuses on technological innovation, job growth, and economic strategies aimed at helping the state rival the tech hubs in other markets. Above: Manoa Innovation Center in Honolulu. Hawaii is home to some of the companies participating in Startup Paradise. Image Credit: Hawaii High Tech Development Corporation As of 2016, it was reported that 60 percent of the 145 startups participating in the program were based in Hawaii, and 78 percent of those are still operational. Nearly 40 percent of those participating in Startup Paradise are involved in software services, while 32 percent are in energy technology. The remaining startups deal with media (11 percent), hardware (6 percent), agriculture (6 percent), and life science or health care (5 percent). “Most people think that they can start [in Hawaii], but if I really want to make it, I got to go [to Silicon Valley]. It’s really about creating the support structure so that [entrepreneurs] have the capacity to choose to stay here,” Governor Ige explained. “Once we can get the one or two breakthroughs, then I think it’ll be like a dam bursting. People, given the choice, will want to live in Hawaii. If their business can be successful, they’ll choose here.” He doesn’t think Silicon Valley should have a monopoly on startups. “Nothing can be harder than Silicon Valley. Hawaii is a piece of cake compared to Silicon Valley, but Silicon Valley thrives. Why is that? It’s about the people. It’s about the human resource in the innovation economy that’s the most important resource.” “I believe our environment gives us a competitive advantage because that human resource wants to be in Hawaii,” Governor Ige said, echoing statements that have been previously reported. “It’s about really changing the paradigm for our young entrepreneurs to show that, yes indeed, it can happen in Hawaii. And we’re going to create that ecosystem that supports them and that we’re going to be working really hard to make sure that they have a pathway if they want to start a company in Hawaii, that we’re going to provide them support they need to get the second, third, or fourth round [of funding] and that big expansion,” he said. Above: Hawaii Governor David Ige meets with students at the University of Hawaii College of Engineering banquet. Image Credit: State of Hawaii/Flickr Major stakeholders concede that this is a long-term endeavor and that the current ecosystem is young, but they also see that it is growing and has potential. “Communities and cultures are not built overnight, and startup communities are no exception,” explained Dawn Lippert, a director at Elemental Excelerator, in a 2014 interview. Rather than going head-to-head with every other technology hub around the world, Hawaii is opting to focus on a select group of clusters, areas where the state holds a competitive advantage. The state has pledged to support 100 percent renewable energy, ethnic and cultural diversity, biomedical and pharmaceutical research, Hawaii’s cancer center, and hospitality and tourism. Is Governor Ige worried about any negative impact of innovation, such as gentrification and people being priced out of their home, things that have plagued cities such as San Francisco? He acknowledges the risk, but said: “It’s about changing the trajectory of Hawaii: What is it that we want? We want to support the innovators and creators that are committed to what’s special about Hawaii. It’s really about the integration of the host culture…celebrating diversity. I believe that Hawaii is the best place to raise kids and a family, bar none. So how do we keep it going?” Above: Hawaii Governor David Ige signs order instructing departments to submit documents using an electronic routing form template. Image Credit: State of Hawaii As part of that vision, the governor is in favor of disruptive technologies, even those that have run afoul of regulators, such as Uber and Airbnb: “Uber is successful and the traditional business guys want to shut them down because their platform, their technology, and business model is so different from the existing. But the flip side is that their business models respond exactly to the concerns that the traditional business lived with and built…” “So yes, it is disruptive,” he said, “and yes, we don’t want to clamp down and regulate them in the traditional sense. So how do we create an environment that is flexible? From a government side, that’s a challenge for us. I’ve challenged my cabinet to reinvent government to be flexible and innovate itself. How do we make sure that we don’t apply the same old regulatory tendencies onto these new areas? I’m not exactly certain, but I’ve encouraged the cabinet to think outside the box and encourage employees to not be close-minded and to think differently. I’m committed.” As governor, Ige has also vetoed a bill that required online lodging services such as Airbnb to collect state and local taxes. “It’s really about creating a vibrant innovation economy so that we can have the investment capital and we can find and grow the innovators here in our community that understand what it means to be in Hawaii, why it’s special, and why we have to take care of the environment, be respectful, and to celebrate the host culture, and celebrate our differences…Once we’ve gotten that first success, the rest of that will happen,” he said.

A rising tide seems to be lifting most, though not all, boats in the tech sector. The Nasdaq computer index closed Friday at 1586.15, up by more than 18 points, as all major U.S. exchanges rose on upbeat economic data. U.S. employers added 157,000 jobs in January, and added an average of 181,000 jobs a month during 2012, according to updated figures released Friday by the Labor Department. The revised figure is better than the 153,000 jobs added per month that was previously reported. The new figures fueled gains Friday for all major U.S. exchanges and indexes, after the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard & Poor's 500 indexes had their best January since the 1990s. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 14,009.79 Friday, which was the first time it topped 14,000 since 2007. Good sales numbers from major IT vendors over the past few weeks have played a big part in the general optimism. On Friday shares of tech industry heavyweights including IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Oracle, EMC and Google all closed up. Despite the general optimism, the newly rechristened BlackBerry, which shed its former brand name Research In Motion Wednesday when it launched its new BlackBerry 10 products, has been running into headwinds. The two new devices debuting at the New York event -- the touchscreen BlackBerry Z10 and a handset with a physical keyboard, the BlackBerry Q10 -- were designed essentially from scratch around a new platform based on QNX, an operating system the company acquired in 2010. Though analysts applauded the overhauled BlackBerry 10 platform interface, the company's March launch date for the U.S. disappointed. "The March date for the US launch is a bad surprise -- announcing a device over a month before launch is never great," said Jan Dawson, chief telecom analyst at Ovum. BlackBerry shares dropped by US$1.88 to $13.78 Wednesday and declined again Thursday before rising with the rest of the market Friday. Caution also greeted Facebook's earnings announcement Wednesday, even though the social networking company reported a 40 percent year-over- year jump in fourth-quarter revenue, to $1.59 billion. Facebook also posted its first quarterly profit ever, generating net income of $64 million for the quarter. But expenses also rose significantly, causing investors to balk. Facebook shares slumped $0.26 to $30.98 Thursday and continued to decline Friday, to $29.73 Apple also can't seem to catch a break. Shares closed down at $453.62 Friday, well below the company's 52-week high of $705.07. Though the company last week posted an increase in revenue in the fourth quarter, profits were flat as it faced increasing competition from Android-based mobile devices. The share slump Friday came even after Strategy Analytics reported earlier in the day that Apple outsold Samsung Electronics to become the number-one mobile phone vendor in the U.S. for the first time ever during the fourth quarter. The good news for the market in general was that mobile phone shipments rose 4 percent annually to reach 52 million units in the U.S. during the fourth quarter of 2012, according to Strategy Analytics. "The growth was driven by robust demand among consumers for 4G smartphones and 3G feature phones," said Neil Shah, senior analyst at Strategy Analytics, in the report. Otherwise, tech earnings news this week was good. Enterprise software vendor earnings, for example, showed a healthy market for business applications. Cloud-based business application vendor NetSuite said Thursday that revenue for the fourth quarter of 2012 was $85 million, a 33 percent increase over the prior year. Total revenue for the year was $308.8 million, a year-over-year increase of 31 percent. Storage vendor EMC reported that it experienced a fourth-quarter revenue jump of 8 percent, fueled by solid gains at its VMware subsidiary, while profit rose 5 percent. Revenue was $6 billion for the fourth quarter, while net income hit $870 million. On the hardware front, Lenovo Wednesday said quarterly profit skyrocketed 34 percent year over year to a company record of $205 million, as revenue rose by 12 percent to US$9.4 billion. Though PC sales are expected to grow slowly this year for the industry as a whole, Lenovo was helped by gains in its smartphone business in its home market of China.

This morning, the search for a new FBI director begins with the first round of candidates arriving at the justice department for job interviews. These interviews on the heels of president trump's latest tweet about fired director James Comey raising questions about whether or not the white house is recording conversations. Could the president's statements be used in a case against him? In said Comey better hope there are no tapes out there. Also the president is going to be traveling to Virginia where he's going to make his first extended public appearance since he gave Comey the ax. Trump will deliver a commencement address at liberty university, a Christian university founded by the pastor Jerry Falwell. You can see them setting up. Team coverage. Cokie Roberts, Ana Navarro are standing by. Lynchburg Virginia we'll kick things off at and David Wright. Reporter: The crowd just starting to gather at liberty university where president trump is going to give the commencement address later this morning. The white house is really trying to get back on track after the seismic shock of the president's firing of the FBI director. And the aftershocks keep coming. Even though former director Comey declined an invitation to testify before the senate Intel committee, the president opened up a whole new can of worms by tweeting this. James Comey better hope there are no tapes of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press. Say what? Does that mean the white house secretly recorded trump's meetings with Comey? Judge Jeanine piero on Fox News asked him about that in an interview to be broadcast today. I can't talk about it. I won't talk about that. All I want is for Comey to be honest and I hope he will be and I'm sure he will be, I hope. Reporter: Which is not exactly a denial. President trump, did he record his conversations with former FBI director Comey? I assume you're referring to the tweet and I've talked to the president. The president has nothing further to add on that. Are there recording devices in the oval office or in the residence? As I said there is nothing further to add on that. Reporter: Again not exactly a denial. The president is no fan of the briefings tweeting maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future press briefings and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy. You don't mean that. Well, just don't have them. Unless I have them every two weeks and I do it myself. We don't have them. I think it's a good idea. Reporter: Trump wouldn't be the first president to secretly record oval office meetings and former associates tell "The Washington post" they always assumed trump was recording his business dealings, quote, you never knew who else was listening. Now, the president says he stands behind his press staff even Sean spicer calling him a wonderful guy but suggested they may have a hard time keeping up with him. As for those possible oval office tape, well, a lot of presidents have done it going back to fdr, but ever since president Nixon was forced to hand over his tapes as part of the watergate investigation commanders in chief have thought twice about it. David Wright, thank you. We are learning more about the tense relationship between the president and his now fired This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.

Here’s our quick look ahead to next week in sunny Spain and the four main points we expect from the MWC show. 5G, or at least previews of it There’s been a big school of 5G press releases floating into our inboxes here in tech media just ahead of MWC (i.e., “Verizon plans 5G wireless trial service in 11 cities this year”), and it’s no real surprise – next-generation mobile networks are going to do a lot more than just boost speeds. They’ll also connect large numbers of devices – not just phones and tablets and laptops – to each other. Sure, finalized 5G specs from 3GPP are still years away, but companies like Ericsson, Intel, GE, Mimosa Networks, and many others have announcements around MWC focused on testing, equipment previews and more this year. Sessions at the show include a panel discussion featuring new FCC Chairman Ajit Pai dubbed “Building the 5G Economy” and another titled “5G Beyond the Hype: Value and Building Blocks.” Internet of Things We touched on this above already, but IoT’s arguably the single biggest-deal technological area at this year’s MWC. Connected homes, connected cars, industrial IoT and untold pitches for various parts of the infrastructure around all of it will be present in Barcelona. “Smart living will perhaps be the biggest overall consumer theme at MWC this year,” said UK-based analysis firm Ovum. “The concept captures an array of devices and services that will increasingly augment customers’ daily lives – from energy metering to health monitoring, smart cars, fridges and washing machines.” New devices, of course It’s not just going to be high-level stuff about 5G and IoT, of course – there will still be plenty of gadgetry on hand. Samsung’s likely not going to release a new flagship at MWC this year, though might at least give a clue about when the anticipated Galaxy S8 smartphone will be announced. Separately, LG is almost certainly going to come out with the G6, HTC could release a new flagship, though it probably won’t be called the HTC 11, and Huawei’s probably aboard the flagship bandwagon as well (renders of its new P10 flagship have leaked). So Android phone will grab the spotlight, while Apple as usual will not make itself heard at the event. Not actually a ton of wearables Oh, there will definitely be some of them – HTC and Sony, among others, could roll out a smartwatch or two – but the hour of the wearable as hottest new form factor in the gadget world is probably over at this point. There’s relatively little buzz around potential smartwatches, though separate from MWC, Apple Watch Series 3 rumors are heating up. Still, since smartwatches are more or less what we’re talking about when we talk about wearables, it seems safe to say that they won’t be the splashiest of topics at this MWC.

A shortage of DRAM, SSDs, batteries, and LCDs have conspired to drive up PC prices, Gianfranco Lanci, corporate president and chief operating officer at Lenovo, said during an earnings call on Thursday. The cost of purchasing these components is going up, which is triggering PC prices to also rise, said Lanci, a PC industry veteran. The shortage of components like memory will continue, Lanci said. As component supplies shrink, PC prices will rise, said Mikako Kitagawa, an analyst at Gartner. Moreover, PC makers are raising prices to squeeze more profits out of the shrinking PC market, Kitagawa said. The PC buyer profile is also changing, with gamers and millennials willing to spend more money on PCs. That's changing the mix of laptops, desktops, and 2-in-1s being shipped by PC makers, who are focused on selling higher-priced products that can deliver better margins. But low-cost PCs won't go away, Kitagawa said. There will always be cheap laptops available, though those markets aren't growing and not attractive to PC makers. Basic configurations of PCs remain affordable, but some PC makers are limiting customization, forcing users to buy additional components in certain configurations. Take Dell's XPS 13, which is priced at US$799.99 with 128GB of storage, 4GB of memory, and a Kaby Lake Core i3 chip. Upgrading hurts the wallet. A base Core i3 model cannot be configured to 256GB of storage, but for that, you'd need a faster Core i5 chip and 8GB of memory, which drives the price of the PC up to $1099.99. A 512GB SSD is available only with XPS 13 models with a Core i7 chip and touch screens that have a resolution of 3200 x 1800. That drags up the price to $1749.99. A chart shown at an Intel investor conference last week showed PC selling prices reaching its highest since 2011, when a decline in PC shipments started. Intel is also selling chips at higher prices, which is adding to PC costs. Intel PC chip prices went up by 7 percent in 2016, but the company also sold more Core i7 chips as sales of gaming and VR systems increased. Analyst firm TrendForce predicted SSD prices would go up in the first quarter of this year, continuing a trend from the previous quarters. SSD adoption, as a replacement for hard drives, is growing, but the supply of NAND flash has tightened, which is driving up prices. The price of DRAM is also going up because of shortages. Memory is a boom-or-bust market and extremely volatile with prices falling drastically when DRAM floods the market. PC DRAM prices went up by 30 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter, TrendForce said in a statement this week. TrendForce is predicting that DRAM prices may increase by up to 40 percent in the first quarter, due to undersupply. The news isn't any better looking forward. "Rising prices are expected for the second quarter as well," said Avril Wu, research director of DRAMeXchange, which is a part of TrendForce and tracks component pricing. Lenovo's Lanci also expected the memory shortage and price rises to continue for the coming quarter.

Amazon is changing the way products and services are delivered to customers, and so will autonomous vehicles, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang believes. The "Amazon effect," Huang said, will turn transportation on its head. Autonomous technology will play a big role for more point-to-point movement of products and people. Amazon has announced Prime Air, a future-looking program in which unmanned aerial vehicles will deliver products in under 30 minutes. Nvidia is backing the idea of autonomous cabs, and providing hardware and mapping technology for accurate point-to-point navigation. Self-driving cars from famous car brands are driving early excitement around autonomous vehicles, Huang said on an earnings call Tuesday. But the real appeal of autonomous technology is in areas like logistics and warehousing, which could also bring operational efficiency. In 2015, Daimler put a self-driving 18-wheeler truck on the streets, which was tested in Germany and at the time approved for use in Nevada. Last year, the autonomous truck delivered 51,744 beer cans from Denver to a facility in Colorado Springs.Â Self-driving tractors are also making farming efficient. The early batch of assisted self-driving cars need drivers at the wheel, and fully autonomous cars have been demonstrated by many companies. Google, Nvidia and Intel have put autonomous vehicles on streets, and tech companies like Apple are also chasing self-driving cars. Nvidia and Intel have announced computers for cars. Nvidia's GPUs drive AI systems and data collection by sensors in cars. Intel is in the process of acquiring Israeli company Mobileye to get a full technology stack for self-driving cars. 5G communications networks -- which could be live by 2020 -- will play a big role in allowing cars to communicate on bad road conditions ahead, or for ambulances to find the fastest route to patients or hospitals. Nvidia reported strong earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, mostly driven by the datacenter GPU business. Revenue was US$1.9 billion, up 48 percent from the same quarter a year ago. Profit totaled $507 million, growing 144 percent. During the quarter, Nvidia announced a deal with Paccar to develop autonomous trucks. Nvidia is holding the GPU Technology Conference in San Jose California, and Huang will share more details about its autonomous cars efforts during a keynote on Wednesday.

While the amount of DRAM in PCs grew by 56.1% in 2007 and 49.9% in 2008, it's been slipping for six years now, IHS iSuppli said. This year's increase will be only 17.4%, four percentage points less than in 2012. The rate of growth in PCs, both desktops and laptops, is expected remain comparatively low, rising by 21.3% next year and then remaining in the 20% range until at least 2016, IHS's report states. "For a generation, PCs have steadily improved their hardware performance and capabilities every year, with faster microprocessors, rising storage capacities and major increases in DRAM content," Clifford Leimbach, memory analyst at IHS, said in a statement. "These improvements -- largely driven by rising performance demands of new operating system software -- have justified the replacement cycle for PCs, compelling consumers and businesses to buy new machines to keep pace." As the pace of DRAM use has slowed, it reflects "the maturity of the PC platform" as well as a dramatic change in notebook computers as system manufacturers adjust to the rise of smartphones and media tablets, Leimbach said. The adoption of ultrathin notebooks such as the MacBook Air and Intel's ultrabooks means more focus on increased battery life so the systems can remain competitive with tablets. As a result, DRAM chips must share limited space on the PC motherboard with other semiconductors that control a notebook's other functions. Incorporating more DRAM can limit other notebook capabilities, IHS stated. "Notebook makers have shown a willingness to limit increase in DRAM on their systems, rather than sacrifice the thin form factor or eschew other features," iHS said. PCs historically have dominated DRAM consumption. However, starting in the second quarter of 2012, PCs accounted for less than half of all DRAM shipments, and for the first time didn't use 50% or more of the leading type of semiconductor memory. The trend is partly due to slowing PC sales, combined with the deceleration in DRAM use in the systems. For desktops, the maturity of hardware and operating systems means DRAM is now less of a bottleneck, tempering the need to increase it to boost system performance. Unlike previous releases, the latest version of Windows, for example, has not required a DRAM increase. "All told, PCs no longer need to add DRAM content as much as they did in the previous times, when failure to increase memory content in either desktops or laptops could have resulted in a direct impediment to performance," Leimbach said. "The new normal now calls for a different state of affairs, in which DRAM PC loading won't be growing at the same rates seen in past years."

Sign up now Menu ARN ARM seen making rapid progress on next high-end chip ARM seen making rapid progress on next high-end chip ARM is in the advanced stages of developing a top-line processor to succeed the Cortex-A72 Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 16 May, 2015 04:08 - - - - print email Distributors Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology Dicker Data Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Synnex Comments ARM's next major CPU design could be here sooner than you think. The company is in the advanced stages of development with its next high-end processor, which will succeed the Cortex-A72 and could reach smartphone and tablet makers by the end of next year, chip analyst Linley Gwennap said in a research note this week. ARM's chip designs are used in most of the world's smartphones and tablets, and its speedy development work reflects the intense pressure gadget makers are under to get new products to market quickly. It also reflects heightened competition from Intel. ARM hasn't discussed the new chip publically and even its name it not yet known. But the company seems to be accelerating the pace at which it gets new processor designs to market. The Cortex-A57 was announced in October 2012 and appeared in handsets two years later. The Cortex-A72, its successor, was announced this past February and will start to appear in mobile devices by the end of this year. Gwennap expects the next major Cortex design to start being manufactured late next year. It will take several months after that for licensees to test and validate the chip, and for device makers to get it to market. Development of the next-gen chip is so far along that the team working on the A72 might be able to "steal" design elements for use in their own product, Gwennap wrote. For example, he said, a new floating-point unit reduces latency by 33 percent. The A72 made up for some of the shortcomings in the A57, which despite its success wasn't fully optimized for the low-power needs of smartphones. The new design is expected to improve things further, allowing for faster smartphone and tablet chips that don't compromise battery life. "Although the high-level block diagram is essentially the same as for the A57, the new design includes many low-level improvements to reach its performance goal," Gwennap wrote. The new design could also be used in servers, a market ARM is trying to break into. After a lot of initial hope, ARM server chips from some vendors were delayed, though PayPal and some other big companies have said they're testing ARM servers. A spokesman for ARM declined to comment on The Linley Group's report. ARM is accelerating its development efforts to compete with Intel, which is also designing new chips at a faster pace, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. "ARM needs to continue to show innovation much more quickly," he said. In fact, ARM also faces competition from within its own camp. The company licenses its technology in different ways. Some chip makers license a finished processor design, such the Cortex products, while others take an architectural license, which allows them to design their own ARM chips from scratch. An off-the-shelf processor license helps companies bring chips to market more quickly and cheaply, but an architectural license lets a company design chips to meet its exact needs, and can allow it to better differentiate its products. Apple, for example, has an architectural license. That puts pressure on ARM to release off-the-shelf designs quite quickly, so that companies that license those products don't fall behind rivals who create their chips from scratch.

Verizon said its 5G pilot will be one of the world’s largest and will feature “several hundred cell sites that cover several thousand customer locations.” +More on Network World: Cisco execs foretell key 2017 enterprise networking trends+ Verizon said it will begin offering 5G to pilot customers during the first half of 2017 in the following metropolitan areas: Ann Arbor, Atlanta, Bernardsville (NJ), Brockton (MA), Dallas, Denver, Houston, Miami, Sacramento, Seattle and Washington, D.C. This is another important step in commercializing gigabit broadband service to homes and offices via a wireless 5G connection. Ericsson, Intel, LG, Nokia, Qualcomm and Samsung are also part of the Verizon pilot. For its part, Cisco said it will support a virtualized, cloud-based, 5G Technology Forum compliant packet core as part of the Cisco Ultra Service Platform. Cisco will also bring mobile backhaul infrastructure to deliver the faster gigabit broadband speeds 5G will offer. In addition, Cisco will bring Virtual Managed Services, a software platform that uses virtualization, automation, analytics and cloud to rapidly deploy security and network services, such as Cisco iWAN and threat-centric security solutions. As part of this effort, Cisco will also be deploying a pre-release version of a 5G-enabled router to deliver advanced services to enterprise, branch, and small-medium businesses, the company stated. +More on Network World: Cisco/Ericsson: Assessing the mega-deal a year later+ In addition to developing technologies that enable greater service agility, Verizon and Cisco will explore the connectivity and performance of the 5G network and how it can be harnessed across industry verticals. A new set of business applications, for instance using augmented or virtual reality, will require 5G’s low latency, quality of service and high capacity to be delivered across the network, Cisco stated. “As part of this activity, Verizon and Cisco will use enterprise SD-WAN functions that interact with the carrier 5G network to integrate security policy and manage the performance of applications such as unified communications,” said Shawn Hakl, VP of Business Networking and Security Services,Verizon in a statement. Cisco wrote earlier this year about 5G: The carriers’ next-generation 5G wireless networks are being built today. They can support more connected devices at a time, and more importantly, 5G networks have lower latency, which is critical in automotive applications (so cars can communicate with each other and with road-side sensors and transmitters): When your device is moving at freeway speeds, high latency communications between two cars can be extremely problematical. The carriers will end up setting standards for (and profiting from) the growth of networked devices.

This news runs right on the heels of the super-hot Core i9 processor from Intel, and news of AMD's next-gen Starship platform with 48C/96T of CPU insanity.     But now there are new rumors from Bitsandchips.it that point towards a new processor called ThreadRipper, and it'll be compatible with a modified version of AMD's current SP3 server socket, which will be deployed with Naples. The new ThreadRipper CPU will be launching with the Whitehaven platform, something we've been hearing rumbles of over the last couple of days.   The new ThreadRipper CPUs will rock 16C/32T of enthusiast power, with quad-channel DDR4 support, 180W max TDP, and comes on the huge 4094-pin SR3 socket. The difference between Naples and the new SR3r2 chip that ThreadRipper arrives as, Naples will support more than one CPU. So you can only imagine a single board with two or more 32C/64T processors powered by Zen CPU cores on the huge Naples platform, which also supports 8-channel DDR4, too.   NEWS SOURCES:Bitsandchips.it, Wccftech.com Recommended for You AMD Raven Ridge APU: 4C/8T CPU with Vega NCU tech Qualcomm announces Snapdragon 660 and 630 AMD Ryzen 5: best CPU launch in 7 years, says new...

Hewlett-Packard, the biggest tech company in the world, on Wednesday joined other bellwether vendors such as Intel, IBM, Google and Microsoft that have recently announced strong quarterly earnings. HP reported a 28 percent jump in profit compared to last year, to US$2.3 billion, for the quarter ending Jan. 31. It was the first major vendor to report results through the full month of January. For bottom-line watchers who are worrying about the pace of economic recovery, HP's 8 percent revenue gain, to $31.2 billion, should have been the most important figure in the report. While profit can be boosted by cutting costs, companies increase revenue by selling more products and services, ultimately the real path to recovery. HP's printer, industry-standard server and PC businesses all reported sales growth, though services revenue declined slightly. Dell on Thursday reported a drop in profit during the fourth quarter of the company's 2010 fiscal year, which ended Jan. 29, but said strong sales of laptops and servers helped revenue increase from the year-earlier period. Revenue improved in all businesses, rising to $14.9 billion, compared to $13.4 billion a year earlier. Investors will want to see the company's costs contained, because profit declined 5 percent to $334 million. The increase in sales is nevertheless another sign of recovery for the hardware market. Strong PC sales also mean good news for the chip sector. Signs that the chip arena is coming back to life came from different vendors this week. Applied Materials, which makes equipment used to manufacture semiconductors, said profit was $83 million compared with a year-earlier loss of $133 million for the quarter ending Jan. 31. Sales jumped to $1.85 billion from $1.33 billion. The company also said its revenue would rise more than 50 percent for the fiscal year ending in October, up from its prior growth forecast of greater than 30 percent. In another good sign for chips and hardware, graphics processor maker Nvidia on Wednesday reported a fourth-quarter profit of $131.1 million, compared to a year-earlier loss. Revenue jumped more than 100 percent to $982.5 million. The positive news this week went beyond the PC and chip sectors. Storage-equipment maker NetApp on Wednesday reported quarterly net income of $108 million, compared to a loss in the same period last year of $82 million. The company had revenue of $1.01 billion, up from $746 million in the year-earlier quarter. Meanwhile, upbeat predictions for the mobile market came out of Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this week. The ITU issued a statement predicting strong global mobile cellular growth around the world. Mobile cellular subscriptions globally will rise from about 4.6 billion at the end of 2009 to 5 billion this year, the ITU forecast. Advanced services and handsets in developed countries and increasing use of mobile health services and mobile banking in the developing world will spur growth in the market, the ITU said. "Even during an economic crisis, we have seen no drop in the demand for communications services," said ITU Secretary-General Hamadoun Touré at the conference. "I am confident that we will continue to see a rapid uptake in mobile cellular services in particular in 2010, with many more people using their phones to access the Internet." Despite the generally upbeat financial reports from IT companies since the beginning of the year, the value of tech shares on the markets have whipsawed along with other sectors. Macroeconomic news indicating the general state of the recovery has trumped tech sector reports about rising sales. On Thursday, for example, markets got what may be a short-lived reprieve, spiking on new data that show gains in the business activity index put out by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve, as well as a 10th straight monthly rise in the index of leading economic indicators issued by the Conference Board, an independent group of economists and analysts. The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 15 points to close at 2241. However, that's still below the 52-week high of 2320 the exchange hit a month ago, and U.S. exchanges -- including the Nasdaq -- started to decline again in Friday morning trading, on news that the U.S. Federal Reserve is hiking its discount rate for lending to banks. The overriding economic issues recently have centered around the frail jobs market and continued home mortgage defaults. For confidence in IT to grow, strong tech vendor sales need to be accompanied by solid signs of expansion in the larger economy.

FAQ: What is 802.11ay wireless technology? Emerging super Wi-Fi goes beyond 802.11ad wireless speed, range Bob Brown (Network World) 28 March, 2017 21:00 - - - - print email Distributors Alloys Anyware Corporation Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology CertaOne CommsPlus Distribution Dicker Data Dynamic Supplies Hills Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology Synnex Topstar Computer International Wholesale IT XiT Distribution Vendors Huawei Comments Products based on the IEEE 802.11ad (WiGig) standard have really only begun rolling out over the past year, but an effort to deliver an enhancement dubbed 802.11ay that promises to deliver faster and longer range W-Fi networks is gaining steam.  Here’s the lowdown on this newest in the 802.11 WLAN series…  I can’t believe I have another 802.11something-or-other to keep track of.  Believe it. Though really think of 802.11ay as an enhancement of 11ad in the unlicensed 60 GHz millimeter wave band of spectrum, so it should be a pretty natural upgrade. And it could really be worth any trouble given potential speed and range improvements. So what's the difference between ad and ay? The 802.11ad standard was published in 2012 and the technology gives devices access to the unlicensed and relatively unclogged 60 GHz millimeter wave spectrum band for multimedia streaming, VR headset connectivity, computer-to-monitor wireless links and other apps that don’t require more than say 30 or 40 feet of unimpeded space. It has been adopted by chipmakers like Intel, Peraso and Qualcomm as well as vendors of routers, access points or other devices such as Dell, TP-Link and Netgear. The Wi-Fi Alliance runs a WiGig certification program for vendors, and the early 11ad gear on the market most commonly supports data transfer rates of 4.6Gbps – way faster than 802.11n and 11ac, but more limited in range and unable to penetrate solid objects. The backwards compatible 802.11ay amendment to 802.11ad is designed to boost speeds several-fold. That initially would amount to a transmission rate of 20 to 30Gbps and a range of 33 to 100 feet with 11ay-to-11ay device setups, but once channel bonding, MIMO and other capabilities are exploited, you could be getting closer to 200Gbps and reaching distances approaching1,000 feet, according to industry players. 11ay, as the specs are being developed, “is really allowing for a wider range of products than you’d get with ad, which has one set of data rates that everyone supports… ay has a lot more parameters to play with in channel bonding, MIMO and features at the MAC level to allow a far greater range of performance and products,” says Brad Lynch, co-founder and SVP of product development at Peraso Technologies, which already has WiGig-certified 11ad chipsets on the market and is readying for 11ay.  MORE: Read our Q&A with Peraso's Brad Lynch By the way, don’t confuse 802.11ay with 802.11ax, which will work in the 2.5 and 5 GHz bands. What would 11ay be used for? It remains to be seen how soon the high speeds of 11ay will really be needed for internal uses, as 802.11ac — including Wave 2 products — are already pretty robust. But Peraso’s Lynch says that if 11ad doesn’t quite do it for you given its distance limitations, “11ay will finally be the technology that would let you snip that Ethernet cord – you no longer have to run Ethernet cables to everyone’s desk… there’s enough wireless bandwidth in ay.” Most of those we spoke with about 11ay were more enthusiastic about its potential as a fixed point-to-point or point-to-multipoint outdoor backhaul technology, especially in light of scaled back fiber rollout plans by providers like Google and Verizon in the face of extraordinary costs associated with such implementations. “I’m more bullish on using ad & ay for backhaul (instead of mesh) in the case of campus & city networks — provided that it has a useful range, says Claus Hetting of Hetting Consulting and Chairman of the Wi-Fi Now event. But it’s possible that 11ay could find a role in internal mesh and backbone networks as well as for other uses such as providing connectivity to VR headsets, supporting server backups and handling cloud applications that require low latency. “I believe that eventually, there will be enterprise applications for this - but it’s probably a few years into the future, given that we will have 802.11ax fairly soon & because there’s still a lot of 5 GHz band available for that (and ac),” Hetting says.  On the consumer side, the trend over the past year has really been to get rid of cables, so 802.11ay as an HDMI or USB replacement would be "a beautiful application," says Bernd Jungbluth, senior test engineer for testing laboratory TUV Rheinland. "It could make more of the equipment intuitive," as Bluetooth and Near Field Communication have done for certain applications, he says.  When will 11ay become reality? The 802.11ay task group had its initial meeting in 2015 and the spec only hit the Draft 0.1 stage in January. Though it is expected to reach Draft 1.0 by July, according to the IEEE task group. If that mark is hit, expect pre-standard 11ay products to start rolling out within a year of that time. Who is behind 11ay?  The IEEE task force leading the 11ay work includes representatives from Huawei, Intel, LG Electronics and Teradyne. Reps from companies including Ericsson, Sony, Qualcomm, Panasonic and Peraso have also attended meetings. The group states its goal as this: "Task Group ay is expected to develop an amendment that defines standardized modifications to both the IEEE 802.11 physical layers (PHY) and the IEEE 802,11 medium access control layer (MAC) that enables at least one mode of operation capable of supporting a maximum throughput of at least 20 gigabits per second (measured at the MAC data service access point), while maintaining or improving the power efficiency per station.  This amendment also defines operations for license-exempt bands above 45 GHz while ensuring backward compatibility and coexistence with legacy directional multi-gigabit stations (defined by IEEE 802.11ad-2012 amendment) operating in the same band."

As each new generation of computer processors arrives with a larger number of computing cores, computer scientists grapple with how best to make use of this proliferation of parallel power. Now researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have created a data structure that they claim can help large multicore processors churn through their workloads more effectively. Their trick? Do away with the traditional first-come, first-served work queue and assign tasks more randomly. MIT's new SprayList algorithm allows processors with many cores to spread out their work so they don't stumble over one another, creating bottlenecks that hamper performance. If it pans out in day-to-day operation, something like SprayList might pave the way for more effective use of new, many-core processors coming our way, such as Intel's new 18-core server chip,the E5 2600v3. Multicore processors, in which a single processor contains two or more computational cores that operate simultaneously, can present a challenge in programming. The problem is that the work a computer needs to do must be distributed evenly across each of the cores for maximum performance. When the first commodity two-core and four-core processors came out more than a decade ago, software researchers harnessed a simple and well-known computer science technique to dole out work, called priority queue, in which the task on top of the work queue is assigned to the next available core. The queue can be ordered through a combination of job priority and good old-fashioned first-come, first-served serialization. Traditional implementations of priority queue work fine for up to eight cores. But performance suffers when additional cores are added, the researchers said. Like having too many cooks in the kitchen, too many cores working on the top of a single priority queue can slow performance. Multiple cores hitting the queue at the exact same time can cause bottlenecks as each core contends for the top task. And because each core keeps its own copy of the priority queue in a cache, synchronizing the ever-changing queue across these multiple caches can be a headache -- if processors could get headaches, that is. So the researchers devised a new way of implementing priority queues in such a way that they will continue to be effective for up to 80 cores. Instead of each core being assigned the next task in the queue, the core is assigned a random task, reducing the chances of creating a bottleneck from two cores contending for the same task. Random assignment has traditionally been frowned upon by those who think a lot about computer processors, the researchers noted in a paper explaining the work. A random scheduling algorithm takes longer to jump around the queue than a conventional one does. Caches can't be used to store upcoming work items. And if a set of tasks needed to perform one job are executed out of order, then the computer needs additional time to reassemble the final results. But as the number of cores increase, these disadvantages are outweighed by performance gains of using a more "relaxed" style of random assignment, the researchers said. To test the effectiveness of SprayList, the researchers ran an implementation on a Fujitsu RX600 S6 server with four 10-core Intel Xeon E7-4870 (Westmere EX) processors, which supported 80 hardware threads. In effect, it mimicked an 80-core processor. When used to juggle fewer than eight processing threads, SprayList was indeed slower than a set of more traditional algorithms. As more threads were introduced, the performance of these established algorithms leveled out, and SprayList's performance continued to increase linearly, as measured by operations per second. SprayList does not pick tasks entirely at random, but rather works off a kind of priority queue called a skip list, which bundles tasks into different priority levels, ensuring high-priority items still get processed before low-priority ones. "Users who specifically choose to use a priority queue require that items with the highest priority are selected before items with low priority. Our work argues that it is OK to relax this somewhat -- we can process the tenth-highest priority before the first highest priority without too much problem," said MIT Graduate student Justin Kopinsky, who led the work with fellow graduate student Jerry Li. Pure randomization might lead the computer to first process tasks with very low priority. "Then you run into trouble," Kopinsky wrote by e-mail. For the work, Kopinsky and Li received help from their advisor Nir Shavit, an MIT professor of computer science and engineering, as well as Dan Alistarh, who works at Microsoft Research and is a former student of Shavit's. The researchers will present their work next month in San Francisco at the Association for Computing Machinery's Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming.

The makers of the cars are working to teach them to better adapt to human tendencies and local traffic customs, like the “California Stop” and the “Pittsburgh Left.” THE ASSOCIATED PRESS A self-driving Uber car stops at a red light on Liberty Avenue in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, Sept. 14. Experts say teaching autonomous vehicles the habits of human drivers will take years but eventually, they will coexist on roadways. DETROIT (AP) — In just a few years, well-mannered self-driving robotaxis will share the roads with reckless, law-breaking human drivers. The prospect is causing migraines for the people developing the robotaxis. A self-driving car would be programmed to drive at the speed limit. Humans routinely exceed it by 10 to 15 mph — just try entering the New Jersey Turnpike at normal speed. Self-driving cars wouldn’t dare cross a double-yellow line; humans do it all the time. And then there are those odd local traffic customs to which humans quickly adapt. In Los Angeles and other places, for instance, there’s the “California Stop,” where drivers roll through stop signs if no traffic is crossing. In Southwestern Pennsylvania, courteous drivers practice the “Pittsburgh Left,” where it’s customary to let one oncoming car turn left in front of them when a traffic light turns green. The same thing happens in Boston. During rush hours near Ann Arbor, Michigan, drivers regularly cross a double-yellow line to queue up for a left turn onto a freeway. “There’s an endless list of these cases where we as humans know the context, we know when to bend the rules and when to break the rules,” said Raj Rajkumar, a computer engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University who leads the school’s autonomous car research. Although autonomous cars are likely to carry passengers or cargo in limited areas during the next three to five years, experts say it will take many years before robotaxis can coexist with human-piloted vehicles on most side streets, boulevards and freeways. That’s because programmers have to figure out human behavior and local traffic idiosyncrasies. And teaching a car to use that knowledge will require massive amounts of data and big computing power that is prohibitively expensive at the moment. “Driverless cars are very rule-based, and they don’t understand social graces,” said Missy Cummings, director of Duke University’s Humans and Autonomy Lab. Driving customs and road conditions are dramatically different across the globe, with narrow, congested lanes in European cities, and anarchy in Beijing’s giant traffic jams. In India’s capital, New Delhi, luxury cars share poorly marked and congested lanes with bicycles, scooters, trucks and even an occasional cow or elephant. Then there is the problem of aggressive humans who make dangerous moves such as cutting cars off on freeways or turning left in front of oncoming traffic. In India, for example, even when lanes are marked, drivers swing from lane to lane without hesitation. Already there have been isolated cases of human drivers pulling into the path of cars such as Teslas, knowing they will stop because they’re equipped with automatic emergency braking. “It’s hard to program in human stupidity or someone who really tries to game the technology,” said John Hanson, spokesman for Toyota’s autonomous car unit. Kathy Winter, vice president of automated driving solutions for Intel, is optimistic that the cars will be able to see and think like humans before 2030. Cars with sensors for driver-assist systems already are gathering data about road signs, lane lines and human driver behavior. Winter hopes auto and tech companies developing autonomous systems and cars will contribute this information to a giant database. Artificial intelligence developed by Intel and other companies eventually could access the data and make quick decisions similar to humans, Winter said. Programmers are optimistic that someday the cars will be able to handle even Beijing’s traffic. But the cost could be high, and it might be a decade or more before Chinese regulators deem self-driving cars reliable enough for widespread public use, said John Zeng of LMC Automotive Consulting. Intel’s Winter expects fully autonomous cars to collect, process and analyze four terabytes of data in 1½ hours of driving, which is the average amount a person spends in a car each day. That’s equal to storing over 1.2 million photos or 2,000 hours of movies. Such computing power now costs over $100,000 per vehicle, Zeng said. But that cost could fall as more cars are built. Someday, autonomous cars will have common sense programmed in so they will cross a double-yellow line when warranted or speed up and find a gap to enter a freeway. Carnegie Mellon has taught its cars to handle the “Pittsburgh Left” by waiting a full second or longer for an intersection to clear before proceeding at a green light. Sensors also track crossing traffic and can figure out if a driver is going to stop for a sign or red light. Eventually, there will be vehicle-to-vehicle communication to avoid crashes. Still, some skeptics say computerized cars will never be able to think exactly like humans. “You’ll never be able to make up a person’s ability to perceive what’s the right move at the time, I don’t think,” said New Jersey State Police Sgt. Ed Long, who works in the traffic and public safety office. Copyright 2017 Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

These investigations are far too important to risk disruption, delay or interference." Feinstein's comments were part of a larger statement calling for the Judiciary Committee to hold hearings on President Trump's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey. Feinstein is the ranking Democrat on the committee. ADVERTISEMENT Democrats have doubled down on their push for the Department of Justice (DOJ) to name a special prosecutor in the wake of Comey's firing this week. But Sen. Dick DurbinDick DurbinDeputy AG sees no need for special prosecutor on Russia: report Feinstein calls for deputy AG to name special prosecutor or resign Deputy attorney general to brief Senate next week after Comey firing MORE (Ill.), the Senate's No. 2 Democrat, went further earlier Friday in calling on Rosenstein to either name a special prosecutor or resign "to preserve his reputation as a credible prosecutor." Rosenstein is increasingly under a spotlight for his role in Comey's firing. Rosenstein wrote the memo this week that the White House initially used as its public rationale for Comey's firing. But Trump told NBC News that he would have fired Comey "regardless" of the DOJ's recommendation. Feinstein and Durbin's statements come less than a month after senators voted 94-6 to make Rosenstein the No. 2 DOJ official. Both Feinstein and Durbin supported his nomination. Democrats pressed Rosenstein during his committee hearing to weigh in on their push for a special prosecutor to look into Russia's election interference. But Rosenstein sidestepped, noting that he didn't have the underlying facts. "I'm simply not in a position to answer that," he said in response to a question from Feinstein.  Tags Dianne Feinstein Dick Durbin   View the discussion thread.

Get a cup of coffee. This article is a big geeky at points by virtue of using a lot of acronyms. But be patient! It contains important information about the restructuring of the US workforce. By William Lazonick, professor of economics at University of Massachusetts Lowell. Originally published at the Institute for New Economic Thinking website How the U.S. New Economy Business Model has devalued science & engineering PhDs This note comments on Eric Weinstein’s, “How and Why Government, Universities, and Industries Create Domestic Labor Shortages of Scientists and High-Tech Workers,” posted recently on INET’s website. At the outset of his paper, Weinstein argues that: Long term labor shortages do not happen naturally in market economies. That is not to say that they don’t exist. They are created when employers or government agencies tamper with the natural functioning of the wage mechanism. The contention, written from the perspective of the late 1990s, is that in the first half of the 1990s an oversupply (“a glut”) of science and engineering (S&E) labor that depressed the wages of PhD scientists and engineers was primarily the result of the promotion of a government-university-industry (GUI) agenda, coordinated by the National Science Foundation under the leadership of Erich Bloch, head of the NSF from 1984 to 1990. Beginning in 1985, the NSF predicted a shortfall of 675,000 S&E personnel in the U.S. economy over the next two decades. According to a study by the NSF’s Policy Research and Analysis (PRA) division, quoted by Weinstein, salary data show that real PhD-level pay began to rise after 1982, moving from $52,000 to $64,000 in 1987 (measured in 1984 dollars). One set of salary projections show that real pay will reach $75,000 in 1996 and approach $100,000 shortly beyond the year 2000. Weinstein argues that the GUI agenda (inspired by Reaganomics) sought to prevent these salary increases. He contends that the legislation that enabled this oversupply was the Immigration Act of 1990 that expanded the H-1B nonimmigrant visa program and instituted employment-based immigration preferences. Given that most of these foreigners came from lower-wage (Asian) nations, it is assumed that they were attracted to work in the United States by what for them were high wages, whereas Americans with S&E PhDs began to shun S&E careers as the salaries became less attractive.1 There is a lot missing from Weinstein’s perspective, which is also the perspective of demographer Michael Teitelbaum, who Weinstein cites extensively and who was at the Sloan Foundation from 1983 to 2013, rising to Vice-President in 2006. Weinstein and Teitelbaum view the salaries of scientists and engineers as being determined by supply and demand on the labor market (“the natural wage rate” and “the natural functioning of the labor market”). From this (neoclassical) perspective, they completely ignore the “marketization” of employment relations for S&E workers that occurred in the U.S. business sector from the mid-1980s as well as the concomitant “financialization” of the U.S. business corporation that remains, in my view, the most damaging economic problem facing the United States. This transformation of employment relations put out of work large numbers of PhD scientists and engineers who previously had secure employment and who enjoyed high incomes and benefits as well as creative corporate careers. The marketization of employment relations brought to an end of the norm of a career with  one  company  (CWOC)—an  employment norm  that was  pervasive  in  U.S.  business corporations from the 1950s to the 1980s, but that has since disappeared. 2 The “financialization” of the corporation, manifested by massive distributions to shareholders in the forms of cash dividends and stock buybacks, undermined the opportunities for business-sector S&E careers. The major cause of marketization was the rise of the “New Economy business model” (NEBM) in which high-tech startups, primarily in information-and-communication technology (ICT) and biotechnology, lured S&E personnel away from established companies, which offered CWOC under the “Old Economy business model” (OEBM). As startups with uncertain futures, the New Economy companies could not realistically offer CWOC, but instead enticed S&E personnel away from CWOC at Old Economy companies by offering these employees stock options on top of their salaries (which were typically lower than those at the Old Economy companies). The stock options could become extremely valuable if and when the startup did an initial public offering (IPO) or a merger-and-acquisition (M&A) deal with an established  publicly-listed company. The rise in S&E PhD salaries from 1982 to 1987, identified in the NSF study that Weinstein quotes, was the result of increased demand for S&E personnel by New Economy companies, with some of the increase taking the form of stock-based pay, which in the Census data drawn from tax returns is lumped in with salaries.3 Competing with companies for S&E personnel, the rise of the NEBM in turn put pressure on salaries at Old Economy companies as they tried to use CWOC to attract and retain S&E labor in the face of the stock-based alternative. By the last half of the 1980s, this New Economy competition for talent was eroding the learning capabilities of the corporate research labs that, in many cases from the early twentieth century, had been a characteristic feature of Old Economy companies in a wide range of knowledge-intensive industries. 4 The CWOC norm under OEBM had provided employment security and rising wages from years-of-service with the company and internal promotion of S&E personnel (significant proportions of whom in science- based companies had PhDs). As I show in my book Sustainable Prosperity in the New Economy?, the beginning of the end of CWOC was the transformation of IBM, the world’s leading computer company, from OEBM to NEBM from 1990 to 1994. In 1990, with 374,000 employees, IBM still bragged about its adherence to the CWOC norm (calling it “lifelong employment”), claiming that the company had not laid off anyone involuntarily since 1921. By 1994 IBM had 220,000 employees, and, with senior executives under CEO Louis Gerstner themselves getting fired for not laying off employees fast enough, CWOC was history. Over the course of the 1990s and into the 2000s, other major Old Economy companies followed IBM’s example, throwing out of work older employees, many of them highly educated and with accumulated experience that had previously been highly valued by the companies. Already in the early 1990s, the marketization of employment relations was responsible for a precipitous decline of employment at the corporate research labs that had underpinned the twentieth-century growth of Old Economy high-tech companies, of which IBM was an exemplar. In 1993, a conference held at Harvard Business School decried the “end of an era” in industrial research, with papers from the conference appearing in a volume Engines of Innovation, published in 1996.5 In the introductory chapter, entitled “Technology’s Vanishing Wellspring,” conference organizers and volume editors Richard Rosenbloom and William Spencer argued that industrial research (as distinct from product development) of the type that had been carried out by corporate labs in the “golden era” of the post- World War II decades “expands the base of knowledge on which existing industries depend and generates new knowledge that leads to new technologies and the birth of new industries.” In the more competitive environment of the 1980s and 1990s, however, in the new industries of “biotechnology, exotic materials, and information products (and services based on them)”, Rosenbloom and Spencer observed that it was more difficult for companies “to keep new technologies fully proprietary”, and hence “research activities have been downsized, redirected, and restructured in recent years within most of the firms that once were among the largest sponsors of industrial research.” 6 There is little doubt that S&E PhDs were major victims of this transformation. But the problem that they, along with most other members of the U.S. labor force, have faced is not simply the marketization of employment relations. For reasons that I have fully described in my publications cited above, the transition from OEBM to NEBM was accompanied by the “financialization” of the U.S. business corporation as, from the last half of the 1980s, U.S. boardrooms and business schools embraced the ideology that, for the sake of superior economic performance, a business enterprise should be run to “maximize shareholder value” (MSV). Instead of retaining employees and reinvesting in their productive capabilities, as had been the case when CWOC had prevailed, MSV advocated and legitimized the downsizing of the company’s labor force and the distribution of corporate revenues to shareholders in the forms of both cash dividends and stock repurchases. 7 With the demise of CWOC, older employees were the most vulnerable, not only because they tended to have the highest salaries, but also because the shift from OEBM to NEBM was a shift from proprietary technology systems, in which employees with long years of experience were highly valued, to open technology systems that favored younger workers with the latest computer-related skills (often acquired by working at other companies). Under CWOC, older employees were more expensive not because of a “natural wage rate” that was the result of supply and demand on the S&E labor market, but because of the internal job ladders that are integral to a “retain-and-reinvest” resource-allocation regime. The salaries of S&E employees tended to increase with years of experience with the company, with a defined-benefit pension (based on years of service and highest salary levels) in retirement. These types of secure employment relations, and the high and rising pay levels associated with them, were the norm among established high-tech companies in the mid-1980s, but, as exemplified by IBM’s transformation, started to become undone in the early 1990s, and were virtually extinct a decade later, as Old Economy companies either made the transition to the NEBM, or disappeared.8 The culprit in the weakening in the demand for, and earnings of, S&E PhDs from the early 1990s was the demise of CWOC—a phenomenon that Weinstein (and Teitelbaum) entirely ignore. With the rise of NEBM, companies wanted employees who were younger and cheaper, and that was the major reason why at the end of the 1980s the ICT industry pushed for an expansion of H-1B nonimmigrant visas and employment-based immigration visas. It is not at all clear that an influx of PhDs from foreign countries via these programs was undermining the earnings of S&E PhDs in the early 1990s. Most H-1B visa holders had Bachelor’s degrees when they entered the United States. At the same time, large numbers of non-immigrant visa holders entered the United States on student visas to do Master’s and PhD degrees, and then looked to employment on H-1B visas to enable them to stay in the United States for extended periods (up to seven years).9 It was in response to the availability of advanced- degree graduates of U.S. universities that in 2005 an additional 20,000 H-1B visas were added to the normal cap of 65,000. Without the influx of foreign students into U.S. S&E Master’s and PhD programs, many of these programs would not have survived. Through this route, the H-1B visa program has made more foreign-born PhDs available to corporations for employment in the United States. But I posit that it has been the demise of OEBM and rise of the NEBM, not an increased supply of foreign-born PhDs, that has placed downward pressure on the career earnings of the most highly educated members of the U.S. labor force. Besides giving employers access to an expanded supply of younger and cheaper high-tech labor in the United States, the H-1B visa along with the L-1 visa for people who had previously worked for the employer for at least one year outside the United States have another valuable attribute for employers: the person on the visa is immobile on the labor market—he or she can’t change jobs—whereas under NEBM the most valued high-tech workers are those who are highly mobile. This mobility of labor can boost the worker’s pay package but is highly problematic for a company that needs these employees to be engaged in the collective and cumulative learning processes that are the essence of generating competitive products. Under OEBM, CWOC was the central employment institution for college-educated workers precisely because of the need for collective and cumulative learning. But it was the rise of NEBM, not the Immigration Act of 1990, that undermined CWOC. The growing dominance of NEBM with its open systems architectures then led employers to make increased use of H-1 and L-1 visas in the 1980s, prompting them to get behind an expanded cap for H-1B visas in the Immigration Act of 1990. 10 Once OEBM was attacked by NEBM, with its offer of stock-based pay, these corporations became fertile territory for the adoption of the ideology that a company should be run to “maximize shareholder value” (MSV). This momentous transformation in U.S. corporate governance occurred from the late 1980s, legitimizing the transition from a “retain-and-reinvest” to a “downsize-and-distribute” corporate- governance regime. In the 1990s and beyond, this corporate-governance transformation laid waste to CWOC across corporate America, knowledge-intensive companies included. 11 With corporate research eroding as high-tech personnel responded to the lure of stock-based pay from NEBM companies— including not only startups but also those such as Intel, Microsoft, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, and Cisco Systems that during the 1990s grew to employ tens of thousands of people, most of them with stock- based pay—senior executives at the Old Economy high-tech companies began to see their company’s stock price as not only key to the size of their own stock-based pay packages but also as an instrument to compete for a broad-based of high-tech personnel. As exemplified by IBM in the 1990s and beyond, a company’s stock price could be raised by laying off expensive older workers and using the resultant “free” cash flow (as the purveyors of MSV called it) to do stock buybacks. 12 As I have documented in detail, over the past three decades this legalized looting of the U.S. business corporation has only gotten worse. As shown Table 1, driven by stock buybacks, net equity issues by U.S. nonfinancial corporations were, in 2015 dollars, minus $4.5 trillion over the decade 2006-2015. In 2016 net equity issues were minus $586 billion. Net equity issues are new stock issues by companies (in this case nonfinancial corporations) minus stock retired from the market as the result of stock repurchases and M&A deals. The massively negative numbers in recent decades are the result of stock buybacks. I have calculated net equity issues as a percent of GDP by decade to provide a measure of the value of buybacks done relative to the size of the U.S. economy. In both absolute inflation-adjusted dollars and as a percent of GDP, buybacks have become a prime mode of corporate resource allocation in the U.S. economy. Contrary to popular belief, in aggregate U.S. corporations fund the stock market, not vice versa. Note that almost all of the buybacks in the decade 1976-1985 occurred in 1984 and 1985 after in November 1982 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted Rule 10b-18 that gave license to massive buybacks, in essence legalizing systemic stock-price manipulation and the looting of the U.S. business corporation.

Over the years 2006-2015, the 459 companies in the S&P 500 Index in January 2016 that were publicly listed over the ten-year period expended $3.9 trillion on stock buybacks, representing 53.6 percent of net income, plus another 36.7 percent of net income on dividends. Much of the remaining 9.7 percent of profits was held abroad, sheltered from U.S. taxes. Mean buybacks for these 459 companies ranged from $291 million in 2009, when the stock markets had collapsed, to $1,205 million in 2007, when the stock market peaked before the Great Financial Crisis. In 2015, with the stock market booming, mean buybacks for these companies were $1,173 million. Meanwhile, dividends declined moderately in 2009, but over the period 2006-2015 they trended up in real terms. Among the largest repurchasers are America’s premier high-tech companies. Table 2 shows the top 25 repurchasers over the decade 2006-2015. Among the companies that one would expect to employ large numbers of S&E PhDs are Exxon Mobil, Microsoft, IBM, Apple, Cisco Systems, Hewlett Packard, Pfizer, Oracle, Intel, General Electric, Johnson & Johnson, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips. We do not know the historical numbers of S&E PhDs at these companies, but I hypothesize that numbers would be much higher than they are if the companies were not financialized. Many of America’s largest corporations routinely distribute more than 100 percent of net income to shareholders, generating the extra cash by reducing cash reserves, selling off assets, taking on debt, or laying off employees.13 As I have shown, the only logical explanation for this buyback activity is that the stock-based pay that represents the vast majority of the remuneration of senior corporate executives incentivizes them to manipulate their companies’ stock prices, leaving most Americans worse off. 14 Table 2: The 25 largest stock repurchasers among U.S.-based corporations, 2006-2015, showing net income (NI) stock buybacks (BB), and cash dividends (DV) Source: Calculated from data downloaded from Standard & Poor’s Compustat database. The Weinstein-Teitelbaum focus on a GUI design to expand the supply of S&E PhDs ignores the transformations of corporate governance and employment relations that have decimated career employment for this group of workers over the past three decades. At the same time, the channeling of trillions of dollars of value created in U.S. nonfinancial corporations to the financial sector has opened up jobs on Wall Street that can provide quick income bonanzas for highly-educated members of the U.S. labor force, many of whom might have otherwise pursued S&E careers. Among the wealthiest of these Wall Street players are corporate predators—euphemistically known as “hedge-fund activists”—who have billions of dollars in assets under management with which they can attack companies to pump up their stock prices through the implementation of “downsize-and-distribute” allocation regimes and, even if it takes a few years, dump the stock for huge gains.15 In the case of Apple, we have shown how Carl Icahn used his wealth, visibility, hype, and influence to take $2 billion in stock-market gains by buying $3.6 billion of Apple shares in the summer of 2013 and selling them in the winter of 2016, even though he contributed absolutely nothing of any kind to Apple as a value-creating company.16 Apple CEO Tim Cook and his board (which includes former U.S. Vice President Al Gore) helped Icahn turn his accumulated fortune into an even bigger one by having Apple repurchase $45 billion in shares in 2014 and $36 billion in 2015—by far the two largest one-year stock buybacks of any company in history. Imagine the corporate research capabilities in which Apple could have invested, and the S&E PhDs the company could have employed, had it looked for productive ways to use even a fraction of the almost unimaginable sums that it wasted on buybacks.17 From 2011 through the first quarter of 2017, Apple spent $144 billion on buybacks and $51 billion on dividends under what it calls its “Capital Return” program. But the company is “returning” capital to shareholders who never gave the company anything in the first place; the only time in its history that Apple has ever raised funds on the public stock market was $97 million in its 1980 IPO. 18 A number of “hedge-fund activists”—Nelson Peltz of Trian, Daniel Loeb of Third Point, and William Ackman of Pershing Square are among the most prominent—have been able to put up one or two billion dollars to purchase small stakes in major high-tech companies, and, with the proxy votes of pension funds, mutual funds and endowments, have been able put pressure on companies, often by placing their representatives on the boards of directors, to implement “downsize-and-distribute” regimes for the sake of “maximizing shareholder value.”19 In the summer of 2013, Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund Management bought DuPont stock worth $1.3 billion, representing 2.2% of shares outstanding. In May 2015 Peltz lost a proxy fight to put four of his nominees on the DuPont board, but in October 2015 DuPont CEO Ellen Kullman, who had opposed Peltz, resigned, and the new management began to implement Peltz’s plans to cut costs and hit financial targets, to be done in the context of a merger with Dow Chemical, which had fallen into the hands of another corporate predator Daniel Loeb. Meanwhile, in October 2015, Peltz bought 0.8 percent of the shares of General Electric (GE), and began to pressure another iconic high-tech company to cut costs and increase its stock price. GE was already a financialized company that had done $52 billion in buybacks in the decade 2006-2015 (see Table 2)—a massive amount of money for the purpose of manipulating its stock price. Undoubtedly responding to additional pressure from Peltz, during 2016, GE, with profits of $8.0 billion, paid out $8.5 billion in dividends and spent another $22.0 billion on buybacks. This financialization of U.S. high-tech corporations undermines, among other things, the employment of S&E PhDs. We need research on this subject to quantify its impacts. I submit, however, that such a research agenda must focus on transformations of regimes of corporate governance and employment relations. Relying on the neoclassical economist’s notion of a “natural wage rate” determined by the interaction of supply and demand, Weinstein, a mathematician, and Teitelbaum, a demographer, missed the transformations in corporate governance and employment relations that marked the late 1980s and early 1990s—and beyond—and as result, in my view, failed to understand the changing fortunes of S&E PhDs in the marketized, globalized, and financialized New Economy. Given the dominance of what I have called “the myth of the market economy”20 in the thought processes of economists, Weinstein and Teitelbaum were by no means alone in erroneously focusing on supply and demand on the PhD labor market while failing to recognize the centrality of corporate governance and employment relations in determining the earnings and career prospects of S&E PhDs. It is time for new economic thinking on these critical questions.

Reply ↓ David McClain May 12, 2017 at 10:10 am As one who actually lived this process, I can tell you that the premise of this article must be basically true. Back in the early ’90s I set out to fill in the gaps of my own computer science background (I’m actually an astrophysicist). And my classes were filled entirely by people from Asia, except for myself and one other Anglo. Job ads in the journals were already beginning to ask for PhD level CompSci with emphasis on, e.g., voice recognition, for a pay rate of $26K (1992 !). That was definitely appealing to the foreign students and unappealing to American STEM students. During that period, the only job market for native PhD STEM students became the American Defense and Intelligence agencies, because they required security clearances and US Citizenship. I found myself driven in those directions too. Now, after many years doing my own thing, I look around at the STEM marketplace and I am shocked to find large numbers of compatriots being pressured into the GIG Economy, and pay rates are appalling by former standards.

From another perspective this is just over investment in education. Technology for the most part is just increasing complexity and increasing complexity has diminishing returns. With energy becoming less available, we probably need a lot less complexity. Reply ↓ anonymous in Southfield May 12, 2017 at 6:15 pm I was reading the article earlier at work and thought I would finish reading the comments With energy becoming less available, we probably need a lot less complexity. Relevant in many ways. Take intensive horticultural methods which could increase yields on agricultural products. Organic gardening (a garden is anything smaller than a field (about 40 acres)) can yield up tremendous amounts per square yard because the soil is tilled intensively and carefully. The organic content of the soil in commercial farming districts is very low as the methods used (particularly intensive nitrogen implants) destroy the Soil microorganisms thereby lessening the amount of nutrients available to vegetative methods in the roots. So by taking the technology level down (small equipment and lots of loving labor, lots of mulching a careful cohabitation of plants) the yields per acre can be in fact astronomical with organic methods.

Reply ↓ Altandmain May 12, 2017 at 10:21 am Basically the rich are waging class war. That’s the problem no matter how you slice and dice this one. This whole “New Economy” has been one big war on wages. I mean look at the collusion too between Google, Apple, and Intel to keep wages low. https://www.wired.com/2015/01/apple-google-tech-giants-reach-415m-settlement-poaching-suit/ Considering how slap on the wrist this was, what incentive is there to not do it again? They know they can get away with this. Not to mention, this H1B and L1B program has become a way to keep wages low in the technology sector. In many sectors, there really isn’t a “shortage” of Americans. Oh and for all the talk of these companies being “innovative”, if they are prioritizing money on stock buybacks over R&D, that’s not really innovative as much as it is trying to boost salaries by capitalizing on the huge cash reserves they get for being the dominant companies in their sector. Same could be said about Exxon. Not much being spent on R&D means that they are more about rent seeking rather than innovation. Perhaps not yet as blatant as those patent trolls, which are little more than shell companies that sue other companies over patents, but that is their ideal business model. I think that at the end of the day, even though many engineers in the tech companies are in the top 10% in terms of income percentile, their interests are closer aligned with working class people. The other issue is that I bet when many of these engineers turn into their 40s, they are going to witness first hand the very real age discrimination that exists in the technology industry. Basically it comes down to, the rich are really greedy. The issue right now for the rich is that they are desperate to keep the looting from happening, while people are increasingly aware that the system is against them. Bernie Sanders got a lot of support in the Valley and while it is a very Democratic leaning area, I cannot imagine that Trump’s anti-H1B and L1B stance would have been opposed by the average employee. I think that the rich are not going to concede anything and that there needs to be some sort of solidarity union amongst all workers.

Early on, the use of stock-based compensation drove down wage-based compensation and increased the role of financial speculators. Today, the speculators get the stock, but wages remain suppressed and only foreign workers will accept them. The author is correct: the causes are complicated, but the result drove down wages and job security for STEM workers. Reply ↓ mary May 12, 2017 at 11:30 am I got my Ph.D. in biology in 2000.

Many JD’s will not practice law; those who do will only practice for a short time before being replaced with a new law grad. Applying, seeking an income, to a non-law job produces a range of disbelief to anger from employers that someone with a JD is applying to a nonlaw job. Reality is there are few law jobs for the multitudes of JDs. The legal profession is broken. Law schools exist to support the former Supreme Court law clerks and Ivy League grads. Indebtedness of JD graduates is ignored. It breaks my heart. Reply ↓ fritter May 12, 2017 at 11:40 am Its not just PhDs. I know several Engineers who advise their children to do something else.

Reply ↓ cr May 12, 2017 at 12:01 pm Post WWII labor overplayed its hand by the 1970’s. Corporations and their decided they had had it. Corps and management proceeded to change the rules of the game on everything–courts, trade, taxation and regulation. These countermeasures have had disastrous long term consequences. Corporations now run the country in a fascist manner. Government capture has created myriad problems beyond financialization, only one tool in the corporate quiver. Oligopolies across most to all industries comes to mind. Rail, air, health insurance, banking, defense, telecom, entertainment…. But this paper is also lamenting a lack of business capex, which is directly correlated to public investment. When you decided to offshore manufacturing and fail to invest in infrastructure you get a double whammy that hits business capex. Increasing regulation and taxation on small and midsize companies has lead to consolidation. Approximately 5000 public companies have likely been consolidated. Sarbanes-Oxley added millions to compliance costs making it highly uneconomical to be a public company with less than $300 million in revenue. Dodd-Frank has created increases in cost for financial firms that had nothing to do with the crisis. In fact, the big banks have benefited enormously from implementation of this legislation.

Reply ↓ tony May 12, 2017 at 3:20 pm Frankly, labour underplayed its hand. At one point it had capital by the throat, and should have finished it off then.

Reply ↓ Sluggeaux May 12, 2017 at 4:53 pm Labor did NOT overplay its hand after WW2 — Taft-Hartley was a HUGE smack-down to labor after the privations of the Depression followed by the war effort. The decent wages during the post-war period were part of a concerted effort to convince workers that they didn’t need unions and to be complacent. Labor leadership certainly became corrupt from all the money sloshing around without global competition due to war devastation of Europe and Japan, the Cold War, and the death throes of colonialism, but this was not due to “overplaying” their hand.

Reply ↓ shinola May 12, 2017 at 1:02 pm To me, this is the money quote (literally): “Many of America’s largest corporations routinely distribute more than 100 percent of net income to shareholders, generating the extra cash by reducing cash reserves, selling off assets, taking on debt, or laying off employees … the only logical explanation for this buyback activity is that the stock-based pay that represents the vast majority of the remuneration of senior corporate executives incentivizes them to manipulate their companies’ stock prices…” This not only applies to the STEM sector, but nearly every large corp. in America. “Earnings quality” (i.e stock price) takes precedence over everything else leading to the crapification of products & services and devaluation of employees. Thank gawd this type of thinking wasn’t around when Jonas Salk was working on the polio vaccine. Reply ↓ nowhere May 12, 2017 at 2:30 pm Which begs the question: what discoveries are we missing out on now because of this short sighted approach? Reply ↓ LT May 12, 2017 at 8:51 pm There’s probably not a discovery to be made that this economic system couldn’t turn to crap. Reply ↓ Jim Haygood May 12, 2017 at 1:27 pm “In November 1982 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted Rule 10b-18 that gave license to massive buybacks, in essence legalizing systemic stock-price manipulation and the looting of the U.S. business corporation.” How can you have “looting” without lootees? The stockholders aren’t complaining. If any party is being disadvantaged by borrowing to fund stock buybacks, it’s existing bondholders. As David Swensen describes in an extended example in Pioneering Portfolio Management, managers compensated by stock options tend to treat corporate debt holders quite shabbily by piling on more debt, compromising the interest coverage ratio. High tech companies use stock buybacks to offset their widespread granting of stock options which — absent Rule 10b-18 — would badly dilute existing stock holders over time. Trying to paint the well-disclosed practice of stock buybacks as “looting” is histrionic ax grinding on Lazonick’s part. Over-leveraged companies are going to regret it in the next recession. But that’s a lamentable social phenomenon in a bubble-driven economy. Those who disagree with it are free to sell short over-leveraged stocks — perhaps a more meaningful way of expressing dissent than scribbling academic screeds.

Reply ↓ fritter May 12, 2017 at 2:22 pm Well Jim, ponzi schemes work pretty well for those at the top. I suppose we shouldn’t worry about it until we start getting complaints.. Actually though, watching the train wreck that is the outlook for the youngest generation today, provides some grim amusement. For instance noting that the “bubble-driven” economy composed of companies desperate to prevent their stock becoming “badly diluted” by having fire sales on capitol and expertise that probably took their predecessors decades to build can really only have one outcome. Depression, misery, socialism. Maybe we skip the Mao route this time, maybe not. Reply ↓ Alejandro May 12, 2017 at 2:38 pm Here’s some related “histrionics” of your channeling D.D…. an excerpt of a debate about “creative destruction” (emphasis mine) from 1991(context), chronologically, roughly following the tandem of Ronnie and Maggie. Gregory Peck: “The Robber Barons of old at least left something tangible in their wake — a coal mine, a railroad, banks. THIS MAN LEAVES NOTHING. HE CREATES NOTHING. HE BUILDS NOTHING. HE RUNS NOTHING. And in his wake lies nothing but a blizzard of paper to cover the pain. Oh, if he said, “I know how to run your business better than you,” that would be something worth talking about. But he’s not saying that. He’s saying, “I’m going to kill you because at this particular moment in time, you’re worth more dead than alive.” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJRhrow3Jws Danny Devito: “Let’s have the intelligence, let’s have the decency to sign the death certificate, collect the insurance, and invest in something with a future…”Ah, but we can’t,” goes the prayer. “We can’t because we have responsibility, a responsibility to our employees, to our community. What will happen to them?” I got two words for that: WHO CARES? Care about them? Why? They didn’t care about you. They sucked you dry. You have no responsibility to them. For the last ten years this company bled your money. Did this community ever say, “We know times are tough. We’ll lower taxes, reduce water and sewer.” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62kxPyNZF3Q Reply ↓ John Wright May 13, 2017 at 9:41 am In this statement: “managers compensated by stock options tend to treat corporate debt holders quite shabbily by piling on more debt, compromising the interest coverage ratio.” you suggest what might limit the corporate stock buyback trend might not be legislation but future bond buyers refusal to accept the corporation’s terms on new debt.. Perhaps there will be a requirement to preserve a debt/equity ratio within a range, perhaps a minimum interest coverage ratio will be required. Perhaps a debt buyback provision will be triggered if more corporate stock is purchased. Low interest rates make bond buyers more desperate for yield, so it seems unlikely this will happen near term. A future bondholders’ revolt might put a damper on this corporate stock buyback trend before any legislation ever does. Reply ↓ oho May 12, 2017 at 1:29 pm IBM. Poster child of everything wrong at the executive-level and the shareholder-level. Reply ↓ David Barrera May 12, 2017 at 2:09 pm Oho, Yes, the IBM reference is interesting.The author gives an ordinal lead to IBM as a mover from the OEBM to NEBM. I ask myself if, from a mere one large corporation managing perspective, this was IBM’s 11th hour response to the by then devastating rise of its competitors like Apple & Microsoft. Also the irony that it did not help IBM at least in the midterm. So, IBM was the prime mover to initiate some aspects of a model change -change which every major player adhered to- in response to a new technological disadvantage vs. competitors, and in turned did not seem to do much for IBM in the immediate years. Although, if I recall well, IBM was immersed in many political battles and internal problems, legal and otherwise. Nevertheless, I doubt there was a historic inevitability on IBM’s ordinal force. Outstanding work by Lazonick Reply ↓ Trout Creek May 12, 2017 at 3:23 pm Let me quote a noted tech analyst on IBM : “IBM is the poster child for shenanigans. Last month, IBM reported its 20th quarter in a row of declining year over year revenues….. a 13% drop in earnings, profit margins that declined in every business segment ( much worse than expected ), free cash flow that plummeted over 50% year over year and an earnings “beat” of 3 cents per share. How could this “beat” happen? ….. a negative tax rate of -23%…. This is why they pay the CEO Rometti the big bucks ( estimated at $50 to $65 million last year).” And this is one of the Bluest of the Blue Chip companies in the world. Reply ↓ Sue May 12, 2017 at 6:12 pm I read IBM spent a fortune at that time defending itself against monopolistic claims litigation. This was happening while Microsoft and Apple were clearly consolidating their oligopolistic empires. I read reports stating Oracle initial breakthroughs were taken from IBM’s research work.

You’re a potential pure play. It’s not about how much you earn, it’s about what you’re worth. And who’s worth the most? Companies that lose money. Pinterest, Snap chat… No revenue.

With all the financialization the only products of S&P500 corporates are their stocks and they are recently very bad in selling that too having to borrow a cool $Trillions to buy stocks back or pay a bribes (dividends on supposedly growth stocks) to market mass concentrated monopolistic investors. Reply ↓ Wisdom Seeker May 12, 2017 at 5:50 pm Just wanted to point out that there is one more link in the chain to be followed: the financiers would not have such an easy time playing Nero with our economy, if the banking sector were still properly constrained by a gold standard (=limited supply of printed credit), the risk of bank runs by outraged consumers, the Glass-Steagall separation of commercial from investment banking, personal rather than corporate punishment for fraud and abuse, antitrust enforcement, etc. In addition, the rise of 401(k) based investing, in which workers are tax-incentivized to buy in to the corporate stock scheming, but lack the normal shareholder voice in corporate governance, has taken the chains off the looters as well. It’s time to end the impunity. The government has been corrupted by the corporations, so only a populist uprising will produce reform. The uprising will require sacrifices of time, income, security. It will require boycotts of products that people like, but whose producers and vendors are evil. The products will not disappear while demand persists – but the producers and vendors must be brought to heel. Consider the following inductees into the Corporate Hall of Shame: Wells Fargo – customer abuse United Airlines – customer abuse UBER – employee abuse; legal system abuse Mylan (Epi Pens) – Monopolistic price abuse Hewlett Packard (spyware on laptops) – customer abuse … pick an industry, you’ll find a Hall of Shame candidate. Hit them all in the wallet until they reform.

Reply ↓ Winston May 12, 2017 at 11:46 pm This is related to the Lasonick article: “the returns to companies’ R&D spending have declined 65% over the past three decades. Not coincidentally, this decline in companies’ research quotient or RQ (a metric I’ve developed that measures R&D productivity, or how much output they get for their innovation inputs) mimics the decline in U.S. GDP growth over the past 30 years.” https://hbr.org/2017/03/is-rd-getting-harder-or-are-companies-just-getting-worse-at-it Is R&D Getting Harder, or Are Companies Just Getting Worse At It? Reply ↓ cnchal May 13, 2017 at 7:58 am Despite the importance of innovation to companies, as well as to the broader economy, despite the 250% rise in the number of scientists and engineers engaged in R&D, and despite all the experts dedicated to helping companies innovate, the money companies spend on R&D is producing fewer and fewer results. . . So, a supply and demand problem? When scientists and engineers come up with idiocy such as Juiceroo, the well of ideas appears empty. No one got the memo from Milton, from way back in 1960, that individuals are now their own means of production and are capitalists, whether they like it or not. Looked at that way, your employer is the enemy because the value you create within the company is stripped from you and transferred to the boss. All you get out of your effort is a declining paycheck while your boss get’s rich, sitting on his or her ass in an air conditioned office with extended lunch breaks, while the whip is snapping on the sweaty shop floor. Your boss is a sadistic middle man, paying as little as possible for your labor, selling your output for as much as possible, keeping the difference, all the while enjoying treating you like crap. It’s called experience! Reply ↓ Ep3 May 13, 2017 at 10:23 am Yves, another wonderfully great post. But this is just another sliver of the overall pie. We are only out to gain for ourselves. Everyone, from the local garbage man to Icahn, human survival instincts will cause us to act to benefit ourselves first, without a care of future results. Apple says “we could invest all that money in the next phone device. But that same investment could bankrupt us and all that money we had could go down the toilet. It’s better to suck up all the available money now, and if the ship sinks, at least the gold won’t go down with it”. Said another way. “We could all be gone tomorrow. What matters is what happens today.” Who cares if I dump trash in the ocean. I don’t have to drink that water. And I have insulated myself from the effects from my ways so that I won’t ever have to realize the consequences. It all comes back to accountability. If you aren’t held responsible for your actions, then you will continue to escalate the amount of looting and destruction that you can do.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Don’t have a solid state drive? These five… Don’t have a solid state drive? These five SSDs will help you get with the times, on any budget By Tyler Lacoma — Updated May 13, 2017 12:01 pm Subscribe Share Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Are you looking for a massive upgrade to your computer storage? We probably don’t have to tell you about the lightning-fast speeds that solid state drives provide: The best SSD options are now bigger, more affordable, and more compatible than ever, which makes this a good time to buy. If you’re looking for a storage option that also comes with a significant speed boost, we have the top options in several different price ranges for you to consider. Note on hard drive capacity: Some companies quote capacity after overhead, and others before. This leads to uneven rounding practices, and explains why you see some drives at 256GB and some at 250GB. Even then, it’s rare for a drive to have exactly its stated capacity, though variance is generally less than 10GB. Under $150: Samsung 850 EVO 250GB ($108) This 2.5-inch SSD gets a lot of attention as a broadly excellent upgrade choice for a variety of needs. Samsung has plenty of experience creating solid state drives, and the 850 EVO is one of the best SSD products yet, combining both simplicity and quality performance. The interface for this drive is SATA 6Gb/s, with a sequential read speed of 540 megabytes per second and a write speed of 520 MB/s. Reviews have shown it to be one of the quickest SATA drives available. Like most of the SSDs on our list, the Evo comes in several different size options ranging from 120GB to 2TB of storage, with costs varying accordingly. We picked the 250GB version for a couple reasons. It’s a good size for an all-purpose SSD designed for the general user, and it provides a widely-shared base storage number to help you compare it with other models. While MSRP says the drives cost $100 and $150, don’t worry — this model is frequently available just under $100, making it the best option for an SSD under $100. Buy it now from: Amazon Best Buy Walmart Under $200: Samsung 850 Pro 256GB ($150) Get used to the Samsung models, because they keep getting top marks in multiple price ranges. The 850 Pro gets praise as an ideal upgrade for a performance-focused computer made for games or entertainment. It utilizes Samsung’s 3D V-NAND memory — it’s the first in Samsung’s library of SSDs to use it — interfaces via SATA III, and has a sequential read speed up to 550 MB/s and a write speed up to 520 MB/s. Except for a few data format differences, you may think this model isn’t much different from the Evo we just talked about. But those data differences add up to a generally faster, slightly more capacious model that’s a better fit for high-end computers – and very attractive in light of falling prices that help make the Pro and Evo more direct competitors. The 850 Pro comes with options ranging from 128GB to 2TB. Again, the 256GB model, which can be found between $150 and $160, stood out as a well-rounded option. Buy it now from: Amazon Best Buy Walmart Under $300: Western Digital Blue 1TB SSD ($280) This is another great SSD model that gets frequent recommendations for upgraders and has our full support. Note that we picked the 1TB for more robust storage options, but there are three different sizes available depending on your needs. It’s available in SATA or M.2 configurations, and two smaller sizes — 256GB and 512GB. The Western Digital Blue 1TB SATA version offers sequential read speeds up to 488 MB/s and write speeds up to 520 MB/s. It’s not exactly the fastest drive on the market, but it’s quick enough to keep up with most users, especially for such a killer price. Read our full review Buy it now from: Amazon Under $400: Samsung 950 Pro 512GB ($324) If you need more space than a few hundred GBs and are interested in a high-quality, forward-looking SSD, we highly recommend the 950 Pro 512GB from Samsung. Some of the specs are indeed similar to the 850 Pro model, including 3D V-NAND, but the differences are stark. The 950 gets sequential read speeds up to 2,500 megabytes per second and write speeds up to 1,500 MB/s, making it one of the best SSD options in terms of speed. Samsung also claims that it is 1.5 times more power efficient than the 850 model. Why such a big difference between the two models? This is the first M.2 PCI Express-only model on our list. Replacing SATA with this newer interface allows for a bundle of new tricks, including better performance for certain types of data and greater compatibility with cutting edge protocols designed to increase efficiency. Of course, you should make sure that your computer can handle M.2 PCI Express attachments before jumping on the 950. Support will be dependent on your motherboard. Buy it now from: Amazon B&H Adorama Any Price: Intel 750 Series 1.2TB ($900) While we mentioned PCI Express, we haven’t yet talked about NVMe, or Non-Volatile Memory Express. It’s a very similar connection standard that uses the same physical interface, but also adds additional features specifically for storage purposes. The Intel 750 SSD shows off the advantages of this approach with its flexible installation options and high speeds. This is obviously going to make the drive extra fast — in ideal scenarios, it can exceed transfer speeds of two gigabytes per second — but the high-end SSD has other advantages, too. One of the most interesting is the choice between add-in card and 2.5-inch form factors, which allow you to pick a design that fits your upgrade plans and current drive standards. The lightning speeds and compatibility of the card put it on the top of our list, but you’ll have to pay at least $1,000 for the 1TB model. Just make sure you really want it!

The Administration began interviews for Comey's replacement on Saturday, talking with eight candidates for the role. Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers have expressed concern over Trump’s decision to fire Comey last Tuesday. The White House, which has offered varying reasons for Comey’s dismissal, will not be sending a member from its communications department to make the rounds on this week’s shows. ADVERTISEMENT “Even Fox News is having trouble getting WH surrogate for Sunday shows: ‘They're not answering the phone,’ Chris Wallace says of press shop,” a reporter from Bloomberg News wrote on Twitter. Trump on Tuesday sent shockwaves through Washington when he fired Comey, who was leading the FBI’s probe into Russia’s attempts to interfere in the U.S. presidential election and any possible ties between Trump campaign staff and Russia. Here is the full lineup: ABC’s “This Week”: Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and former Director of National intelligence are slated to appear. Sen.

If you’re looking out for a decent monitor, beefy power supply, or spacious solid-state drive, be sure to jump on these offers before they expire or sell out. Big ticket items such as the GTX 1070 video card from Gigabyte and a 144Hz monitor from Acer can also be snagged at a discount. If you’ve found any other great deals we missed, please let us know in the comments below; sharing is caring! Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1070 – $369.99 From Newegg The GTX 1070 is a terrific mid-high range graphics card capable of handling modern games with maximum quality settings at 1440p. It’s even powerful enough to do 4K in some games while pumping out playable frame rates. This particular model from Gigabyte has a dual fan cooler and an overclocking mode that’ll boost the core clock to 1771 MHz. ADATA Ultimate SU800 512GB SSD (3D NAND SATA III) – $135.30 (promo code: EMCRFBD32) From Newegg Prices for solid-state drives continue to fluctuate, but this 512GB model from ADATA is one of the better deals right now, especially for the amount of storage. If you’re still using hard disk drives exclusively, now would be a good time to make the jump for faster storage. Be sure to use the promo code to swoop this up for cheap. Cooler Master Hyper 212 LED CPU Cooler – $19.99 From Newegg Cooler Master’s Hyper 212 CPU coolers are regarded as some the best air coolers for the price. This particular model is equipped with a red LED fan, but still sports the design and efficiency of other Hyper 212 coolers. It’s a great upgrade if you’re still using stock coolers on your Intel or AMD processors. Take note, the Hyper 212 is not compatible with AMD Ryzen’s AM4 socket designs. EVGA SuperNOVA 850 Watt Modular Power Supply, 80 Plus Gold – $93.55 From Walmart The SuperNOVA from EVGA provides plenty of juice for most systems with its 850 watts and 80 Plus Gold certification. This power supply would fit perfectly for multi-GPU setups. It’s also modular, which will benefit the cable management process. ECO Mode helps keep fan noise down during low-load operation and increases power efficiency. Acer GN27HL 27-inch 144Hz Monitor – $259.99 (promo code: 513514WKSE39) From Newegg Acer is known for manufacturing reliable and affordable monitors, and the GN27HL is yet another. It’s a high-refresh rate 27-inch display with a one millisecond response time and native resolution of 1080p. If you really want to take advantage of the 144Hz refresh rate, make sure you’re equipped with a video card capable of pumping out high frame rates at 1080p. Don’t forget to use the promo code to get it for this price. Logitech G602 Wireless Mouse – $39.99 From Best Buy The G602 wireless mouse from Logitech seems to be on sale quite often, but that doesn’t mean it’s still not a great deal for this price. It takes on the design of the highly regarded G502 gaming mouse with deep grooves, 11 programmable buttons, and on-the-fly sensitivity switching. It also has extensive battery life with several power modes.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Augmented Reality Is About a Lot More Than Dog Ears and Puking Rainbows Augmented reality could kick off the next phase of the digital age, tying the knot between people and information. Nicholas Rossolillo (nrossolillo) May 13, 2017 at 5:38PM Augmented reality (AR) has been getting a lot of attention of late.Last summer it was the blockbuster Pokemon GO game that put the technology on everyone's radar. The rage now is apps that enable real-time overlay of images or video onto the real world: Think Snap, Inc.'s (NYSE:SNAP) new Snapchat feature, World Lenses, or its long-loved dog ears filter. Beyond the recreational uses currently available to the public, companies are working on developing AR into so much more: a workplace enhancement, a productivity booster, and an information synthesizer. Image source: Getty Images. The next stage of the digital revolution? Human beings have embraced the flood of information that came with computers and the internet -- so much so that in the last digital-age breakthrough, we took that information mobile. In a few short years, life without a smartphone, tablet, or some other connected device that helps us access information, or communicate with others whenever we want, will seem unthinkable. The tech community now thinks that AR could be the next big development in this digital age. While the technology has obvious appeal in the gaming community (who wouldn't want to defend their backyard from an army of zombies?), the idea is that AR is really all about information, and how to deliver relevant information in an efficient manner. Some big names have talked up the potential. Snapchat recently rolled out some new World Lenses filters, objects, and content, but that's all fun and games. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) expanded on its plan to become a vertically integrated augmented- and virtual-reality company at its F8 conference a couple weeks ago. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also rumored to be in the race. For now, uses for the technology are limited and accessible primarily via a smartphone. However, these companies are working to expand on AR's capability, first by projecting digital images and objects from a phone onto glasses, with a goal of eventually having a stand-alone pair of glasses or even contact lenses. The real reason AR is exciting Some estimates put AR at the helm of a $100 billion-a-year industry by 2021 -- compared with $3.9 billion between AR and VR last year. That could be a boon for device makers, but the information it can deliver is where the potential really is. Microsoft's HoloLens AR device for developers. Image source: Microsoft. Imagine: engineering or industrial workers getting instructions delivered to them as they work on tasks, or office workers utilizing AR to handle video conferences, virtual projects, and task management without the use of a traditional desk. The possible uses are only limited by the imagination; many may seem superfluous, but businesses are investing in them to see if they lead to lower overhead costs by way of a more efficient workplace. Case studies so far suggest AR does just that. Microsoft has built a headset called HoloLens, which is being touted as a multiuse workplace device; if you're a software developer or just a tech tinkerer, a HoloLens can be yours for as little as $3,000. A company called DAQRI has built an Intel-powered work helmet and headset as well, along with a heads-up display for autos, developed with the future industrial worker in mind. These devices are still in development phase and look big and clunky to wear around, but represent a first step toward the vision of AR delivered via a less obstructive medium. The DAQRI Smart Helmet for industrial workers. Image source: Daqri. AR could even eventually become a seamless part of who we are. Ever the visionary, Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk announced a new company called Neuralink. The idea of the company is to merge the human mind with digital information and artificial intelligence by embedding electronics in the brain, with content being pulled up by merely thinking of it. Perhaps it's a few too many steps ahead of where we are today, but the idea of usable and interactive information, delivered right before our eyes at the time we need it, lies at the heart of the AR movement. Investing in the potential There isn't much in the way of an AR pure play in existence today, at least not in investment form. Investors excited about the possibilities are relegated to one of the aforementioned diversified tech companies, each of which is working on its own version of the technology. That may not be the most exciting sounding place to start with the development of AR, but it's another compelling reason to have big tech as part of the core holdings in your investment portfolio, as the digital age continues to reshape the world in which we live.

In the case of the latter, now some of Qualcomm’s biggest rivals have chimed in, offering statements to the FTC in support of their monopoly accusations. Back in January the FTC filed a complaint in federal court that states Qualcomm uses standards-essential patents to force phone makers and others in the mobile processor industry to pay higher royalties and license payments, which is a violation of the FTC’s rules on FRAND terms, or “fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory.” This week both Samsung and Intel have filed amicus briefs with the court supporting the FTC’s lawsuit and opposing Qualcomm’s request to dismiss the case. Each company notes that Qualcomm uses its patents in order to remain the dominant player in the mobile chip industry. “Qualcomm has maintained an interlocking web of abusive patent and commercial practices that subverts competition on the merits,” wrote Intel. Samsung noted that because Qualcomm refuses to offer the necessary license, its Exynos chips aren’t available to other companies. The FTC trial is scheduled to begin on June 15th, so we’ll soon find out if Qualcomm will need to start playing fairly.

May 13, 2017May 13, 2017 Joel Harding From vulnerable smart fridges to personal care robots that go crazy, a military think tank is preparing for the digital worst. by Ben Fox RubinMay 9, 2017 5:00 AM PDT @benfoxrubin There’s not a whole lot for Mike to do most days. Thanks to a trusty artificial intelligence platform, he can kick his feet up and let the machine handle the logistics work at his Brooklyn distribution company. But today is different. Today the AI system gets hit with a flood of requests as if everyone in Manhattan simultaneously ran out of milk. The network is so slammed that workers at the nearby port in Red Hook switch to random manual scans of incoming containers, since several scanners are down. Just as Mike senses something’s wrong, a dirty bomb explodes close by. Scores are killed. The bomb, it ends up, snuck through thanks to a terrorist-controlled botnet made up of millions of smart refrigerators that all started crying for milk. We were undone by our fridges. *** That story, predicting a cyberattack in 2025, wasn’t created by a sci-fi author. The US Army whipped up this tale to prevent attacks like it from ever happening. This is the first installment of a two-part series on cybersecurity and West Point. Aaron Robinson/CNET It’s one example of an idea called “threatcasting,” which tries to anticipate and influence the world 10 years from now. The concept is being developed by the Army Cyber Institute (ACI) at West Point, a new military think tank created to study the not-too-distant future of cyberspace. Threatcasting and the institute are part of a broader effort by the military to prepare for a tech-stuffed future when even a toothpick may have an internet connection. That future could allow cyberattacks to evolve from the mostly digital sphere into destabilizing physical attacks and informational warfare, similar to the hacks during the US and French presidential elections. Smart home hijacks? Economy-busting disinformation campaigns? Spam advertising hacks on connected contact lens? Sure, it’s all possible, and the ACI is thinking up these sometimes terrifying, sometimes oddball ideas in hopes of keeping those concepts in the realm of “Mr. Robot” and “Black Mirror.” “Part of what we do with threatcasting, you’re trying to put yourself into what the attack surface will look like in 10 years,” Colonel Andrew O. Hall, the think tank’s director, told me. “Because we know the attack surface is going to be huge.” Full Metal HoloLens I’m sitting across from Hall in his office at a circular wooden table decorated with dozens of commemorative military coins under glass. We’re in a drab, 1960s-era brick building called Spellman Hall just outside of the imposing grey stone arches of the US Military Academy at West Point, in upstate New York, where many of the institute’s staff teach. Hall, wearing a crisp blue service uniform and shiny black shoes, filled his office with memorabilia of his past lives. On the windowsill, he keeps two combat helmets, one from his time during the war in Iraq. His bookcases are lined with math and military textbooks — “Statistical Techniques for Manpower Planning,” “Adventures in Stochastic Processes” — that he’s collected since his graduate degree studies in applied math and operations management. His desk also has a Pikachu mug on it — he’s a big Pokémon fan. Colonel Andrew O. Hall is director of the Army Cyber Institute at West Point, a new military think tank. Nic Henry/CNET The roughly 50-person think tank, a tiny piece of the government’s vast cyberdefense resources, was created five years ago to study online warfare and build new military partnerships with universities and companies. The ACI also houses several labs, including an “internet of things” space jammed with smart home devices and a virtual reality and augmented reality lab where workers can test military applications for the Microsoft HoloLens and View-Master VR headset (yes, the one for kids). “We’re trying to ask and answer the questions that others would not necessarily be thinking about,” Hall said. Which get us back to threatcasting. The idea can be used to look at the futures we want and the futures we want to avoid, then reverse-engineering from there to determine what we’d need to do today. In a measured, earnest tone that belied the sci-fi nature of the subject, Hall discusses some of the concepts the institute is noodling as part of its threatcasting project. He talks about hijacking a personal-care robot to harm its owner, or hacking a dam, causing catastrophic damage. He also touched on autonomous war drones coordinating with tanks and bionic warriors working with teams of 10 to 15 robot soldiers. A little surprised, I asked him: “That’s really the conversations you’re having here?” “That’s definitely what some people would consider sci-fi,” Hall responded. “When you think about where we could be 10 years from now, most people don’t think that we will have cyborg soldiers, but we may … We definitely have to think about it before we can even count on it happening or discount it.” Science fiction prototyping Threatcasting first developed eight years ago with the help of Brian David Johnson, Intel’s first futurist who’s now Arizona State University’s futurist in residence. Johnson adapted the concept from “futurecasting,” a similar idea he’s used for more than two decades to help tech companies he’s worked for anticipate technological changes just over the horizon. “Everybody always thinks the future is set. They’ll ask me, ‘How do I prepare for the future?'” Johnson told me on a call a few weeks ago. “I’ve spent my entire career telling people the future is built by people, the actions of people. So you have to take action. If you don’t, you’re ceding control.” He started working on threatcasting with the US Air Force Academy nearly a decade ago and took the concept a step further by opening the ASU Threatcasting Lab to manage the ACI project. A future cyberthreat? Aaron Robinson/CNET Back at West Point, I spoke with Major Natalie Vanatta, the ACI’s deputy chief of research and Johnson’s counterpart at the think tank. Sitting at a mock living room set up at the internet of things lab, she wore a typical West Point garb of Army fatigues and combat boots. The ACI and ASU, she said, plan to host two threatcasting workshops every year with academics, military personnel, policy makers and business leaders to come up with dozens of future scenarios like Mike’s untimely death in Brooklyn. Those futures will then be compiled to find trends and work out actions the government and businesses can take. The point of making these scenarios into specific stories, something called “science fiction prototyping,” is to make them more approachable to anyone, not just technologists or military staff. The first of these workshops was held last August at West Point, and a second just wrapped up earlier this month in Arizona. The Marine Corps Warfighting Lab hosted similar exercise last year with sci-fi writers that looks even further into the future. The intent is to “start a larger conversation and create a public body of knowledge in this space as we work through what some of these challenges might be,” Vanatta said. “Because let’s be honest, the challenges the Army is going to face on the cyber or the digital domain are going to affect the nation too and everybody else.” Cyber Pearl Harbor Are you still skeptical? You’re not alone. Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder and chief technology officer of cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike, applauded the mission of the ACI but questioned the viability of threatcasting. He noted that the potential of a “Cyber Pearl Harbor” has been bandied about in his industry for the past 25 years, but it’s never happened. “A lot of these threats that are real and we’ve seen for so many years,” he said, referring to data hacks, “we’re continuing to ignore and focusing on the sexy new ones that may never come.” Chase Cunningham, a Forrester security analyst and Navy veteran, offered another concern. “The nature of the threat changes so fast,” he said, “trying to forecast any further than a couple years is like throwing darts at a wall.” At the Army Cyber Institute’s AR and VR lab. Ben Fox Rubin/CNET Vanatta and Johnson say threatcasting is nothing like staring into a crystal ball. The ACI’s work is fluid, with forecasts changing depending on new events and whether certain mile markers set by researchers come along. If one idea becomes more plausible, then that will gain more focus. “These threats are never going to go away completely, but what we’re trying to do is to start taking action,” Johnson said. All these folks would agree that, if anything, the future is hard to predict. It’s probably even harder to notice a catastrophe was averted thanks to forecasting and preplanning years in advance. So it’s possible the ACI will someday prevent some digital disaster, and no one — including the think tank itself — will know it did.

Only a handful of Windows 10 handsets were on display on the show floor of Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this week, but with some device and chip makers announcing their intentions to support Windows 10 on smartphones, that could translate to many more handsets becoming available by year end. Microsoft has said that Windows 10 will provide a more consistent user experience across smartphones, tablets and PCs. A technical preview of the OS is already available, with the final version expected to reach handsets later this year. Some handsets, but not all, running Windows Phone 8.1 will be upgraded to Windows 10. At the show Microsoft announced a new smartphone, the Lumia 640XL, which it demonstrated running Windows 10 Technical Preview at its booth. It will ship with Windows Phone 8.1, but can be upgraded to Windows Phone 10. A spokesman demonstrated the Cortana voice interaction and said it would work with Office 365, OneDrive and other Microsoft technologies. More forthcoming was Alcatel One Touch, a brand of TCL Communication, which was showing a technical preview of Windows 10 on a new 5-inch Pixi 3 smartphone. Pixi 3 is one of the rare handsets where users can select their OS -- Windows Phone 8.1, Android or Firefox -- and Windows 10 will be offered as an option on release. Carriers in Europe are asking for the new OS more than for Windows Phone 8.1, and Alcatel One Touch will oblige, said Fernando Mercader, a manager handling carrier relationships at the company. It's not going to be a complicated decision for the manufacturer as the Pixi 3 smartphone runs on a chipset from Qualcomm, which supports Windows Phone 8.1 and also Windows 10. Acer has only offered Android smartphones until now, but announced a US$89 Liquid M220 handset with Windows Phone 8.1 that later this year can be upgraded to Windows 10. It's the first of many premium and budget handsets coming from Acer that will run Windows 10. Acer wasn't enthused by Windows Phone 8.1, but believes there is more awareness around Windows 10. The new OS makes it easier to share content and run applications across Windows 10 tablets, laptops and smartphones, and users want a consistent experience, said Wahid Razali, marketing manager for Acer in Europe. Until now handsets with Windows Phone OS have only come with Qualcomm chipsets. But by the end of the year, Windows 10 will also be on handsets with Intel's Atom X3 chip, code-named Sofia, which was announced at the show. Intel's chips are in just a few Android handsets, and support for Windows 10 is important as the chip maker takes on ARM, which dominates the smartphone market. In 2014, Windows Phone went into 34.9 million handsets, a market share of just 2.7 percent, according to IDC. That is tiny compared to Android handsets, which numbered 1.06 billion, an 81.5 percent market share, and devices with Apple's iOS, which totaled 192.7 million, a 14.8 percent market share. There is enthusiasm around Windows 10, and a sense among device makers that there's an opportunity to sell more handsets with a new OS, said Bob O'Donnell, principal analyst at Technalysis Research. Microsoft's taking the right steps to becoming relevant in mobile again, tying software like Office 365 and services across all devices, O'Donnell said on the show floor. O'Donnell projected Windows 10 to have a 10 percent smartphone OS market share by 2020. Agam Shah covers PCs, tablets, servers, chips and semiconductors for IDG News Service.

Apple struck first back in January and has since expand its lawsuit to additional countries, while Qualcomm has officially hit back with a countersuit. While the Federal Trade Commission had originally stated that Qualcomm had monopolistic like qualities, the trade group this week has yet again slammed the chip maker… Spigen TEKA RA200 Airpods Earhooks Cover In a filing with the US District Court in San Jose, California, the FTC accused Qualcomm of being a monopoly and preventing key customers, like Apple, from doing business with other companies. The FTC ultimately says that the case should proceed (via CNET): “Qualcomm uses its monopoly power to make [handset manufacturers] pay a royalty overcharge — a tax — when buying modem chips from its competitors,” the FTC filing reads. “Qualcomm further hampers those competitors by denying them the licenses it promised would be available on FRAND terms during standard- setting. And Qualcomm foreclosed its competitors from selling to a uniquely important customer, Apple, for half a decade using exclusive contracts.” Furthermore, several other companies have filed amicus briefs in support of the FTC. Most notably, Samsung on Friday expressed its support for the FTC’s statement, saying that the case should proceed and that it has also suffered from and been harmed by Qualcomm’s practices. Samsung accuses Qualcomm of refusing to “license its patents on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms.” Samsung goes on to explain that these actions prohibit it from making and selling its own licensed chipsets: “Because Qualcomm does not license [chipset] competitors, handset manufacturers have no choice but to accept Qualcomm’s onerous terms,” Samsung said. “Qualcomm directly excludes competitors and harms competition.” Additionally, Intel has also filed an amicus brief in support of the FTC, saying that Qualcomm has “driven nearly all of its competitors out of the premium LTE chipset market.” Earlier this month, it was reported that Qualcomm was seeking an iPhone import ban in the United States as Apple and its suppliers withhold some $1 billion in royalty payments. Tim Cook has publicly discussed being open to settling the legal dispute with Qualcomm, although he expects the legal battle to be a lengthy one.

Linux-based platforms are gunning for iOS and Android, and Chinese companies want to price the iPhone and the Galaxy S line out of the market. Mike Elgan (Computerworld (US)) 26 January, 2013 12:11 - - - - print email Distributors ACA Pacific Alloys Arrow ECS ANZ Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology CertaOne Com1 International Dicker Data Dynamic Supplies Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology rhipe Samsung Communications Sektor Synnex Topstar Computer International Wholesale IT XiT Distribution Vendors HP Huawei Comments Just five years ago, the global epicenters of the mobile phone universe included Finland and Canada, where Nokia and Research In Motion are headquartered. After the launch of the Apple iPhone in 2007, and after Android phones started getting really good, iOS and Android devices began their sustained assault on market share, and today they dominate totally. From the perspective of who is making the majority of physical smartphone handsets, the clear leader is South Korea's Samsung, which sells more than one quarter of the world's smartphone handsets, followed by Apple, which sells about 18%. No other company gets anywhere near a two-digit market share globally. From the perspective of platforms -- who makes the operating systems and controls both the functionality and the app ecosystem that powers the world's smartphones -- it's clear that Google's Android is by far the world's leader, followed distantly by Apple's iOS. From a business perspective - who's making money on mobile phones in one way or the other - the clear winners are Apple, Google (via advertising, mostly) and Samsung. So today, we can say that the smartphone market is solidly controlled by two companies that are less than nine miles apart from each other in Silicon Valley in the U.S. (Apple and Google), plus Samsung in South Korea. These three companies in two countries ship the handsets, make the operating systems and collect most of the profits. But what will the mobile market look like five years from now? Meet the new operating systems All is not well in the universe of mobile platforms, or operating systems. Apple's iOS platform used to be much better loved by Apple fans. It had by far the most and best apps, and it was perceived by most to be innovative and leading edge. But the Android platform is either catching up to, or has already surpassed, iOS in both innovation, as well as the quantity and quality of available apps. When you combine software improvements on Android with a vastly greater variety of available handsets, many former iPhone users are defecting to the other side, or thinking about it. While users are growing ever fonder of the Android platform and its apps, hardware makers that create Android-powered phones are growing less fond. The issue is direct competition from Google itself. Google has twice launched phone initiatives where it decided to sell Google-branded phones. The first initiative was in early 2010 when Google launched the Nexus One, followed by the Nexus S. They were manufactured by HTC, but the fact that Google was involved in their design and sold them directly gave the phones a huge advantage over any phone HTC might sell -- or any phone HTC's competitors might sell. Google later came out with the Galaxy Nexus (made by Samsung) and later still the Nexus 4. Google also bought Motorola last year, both for the patents and also presumably to assert some control over the direction of Android mobile devices. The first serious assertion of that control may be the development of a device called the Google X phone, which is being developed at Motorola and which is expected to be unveiled at Google's May developer's conference, Google I/O. Nobody knows what the Google X phone (and tablet) will be like, but hints, rumors and speculation agree that it will be very different from existing Android phones. All this strong competition from Google makes handset makers wonder whether Google is friend or foe, and whether they might be better off with another software platform. These disaffected Google partners may be looking more closely at Microsoft's Windows Phone 8, now that Nokia reported some impressive numbers (both of which included the numeral 4, oddly enough): The company sold 4.4 million Lumia Windows Phone devices and reported a year-over-year quarterly U.S. market revenue increase of 444%. Although the market punished Nokia's earnings, a careful analyst might notice that Nokia's Lumia line failed horribly in the so-called "emerging markets" of China and elsewhere, but succeeded in the U.S. and Europe. The company is making more money on far fewer handsets than before. In other words, Windows Phone 8 may be helping Nokia's economic situation become less like Google's (high volume, low margin) and more like Apple's (high margin, low volume). Beyond iOS, Android and Windows Phone, there are other emerging platforms under consideration by some current Android handset makers. In fact, Google's biggest and most profitable Android partner, Samsung, is supporting a new platform called Tizen. (Intel is also a backer.) If Samsung switched from Android to Tizen, the phone platform scene would be transformed overnight. The first Tizen devices are expected within three months. Mozilla, the people who make the Firefox browser, are developing the Firefox OS for smartphones. The first Firefox phones are expected to hit next month. The people at Ubuntu Linux, the most popular client version of that operating system, are building a version for smartphones. HP's WebOS, acquired from Palm, is still a potential factor, especially since HP plans to release an open-source version called Open WebOS. Note that all of these platforms -- Tizen, Firefox OS, Ubuntu Linux and Open WebOS -- are Linux-based and all or most will be relatively open compared with Android. Meet the new handset makers While upstart platforms threaten to take advantage of weaknesses in the iOS and Android worlds, a similar thing is happening in handsets. Right now, Samsung and Apple dominate. But in China and in other markets, Chinese companies are growing faster than the global leaders. Sometime this year, we'll reach the point where half the mobile phones sold in the world will be smartphones, rather than feature phones. The reason for that shift is partly caused by a drastic reduction in pricing for smartphones, thanks to low-cost Chinese brands. And also high-end brands. In China itself, for example, Samsung is the No. 1 handset maker. But No. 2 is Lenovo, a Chinese company, and its handset business is profitable, too. According to one article, there are more than 100 Chinese companies now making smartphone handsets, and they all want to be Samsung. Rumors have been circulating that Lenovo is in talks to buy RIM -- a development that, combined with continued aggressive growth, could thrust Lenovo into Samsung territory as a global maker of phones. So if Samsung is No. 1 and Lenovo is No. 2, Apple must be No. 3, right? Wrong! No. 3 in the Chinese market is Huawei, followed by ZTE, followed by Coolpad. By unit sales, Apple is the No. 6 handset maker in China -- and its market share is shrinking. These companies, especially Huawei and ZTE, are bringing the smartphone revolution to emerging markets, for the most part. And now they want entry into the U.S. and European markets. Huawei and ZTE each had a large presence at the International CES trade show, which served as a kind of coming out party for those companies in the U.S. Samsung and Apple fans may scoff at the idea that some obscure Chinese brand like Huawei or ZTE could take market share away from the leaders. But if either or both of these companies can make phones that are 95% as good as Samsung's best phone, and cost half the price, people are going to buy them in large numbers. Apple, Google and Samsung control the global market for smartphones. But over the next year or two, all that could change as new software platforms and new handset makers take advantage of the leaders' stumbles to gobble up market share, market power and influence over the direction of mobile devices.

The single-rack prototype will have 2,500 CPU cores and an impressive 320TB of main memory, CTO and HP Labs Director Martin Fink told reporters at the HP Discover conference Wednesday. This is more than 20 times the amount of any server on the market today, he claimed. But there's a catch: the prototype will use current DRAM memory chips, because the advanced memristor technology that HP eventually plans to use is still under development -- one of the big reasons The Machine remains several years away. HP is placing a huge bet that it can develop a new type of computer that stores all data in vast pools of non-volatile memory. HP says the Machine will be superior to any computer today. A system the size of a refrigerator will be able to do the work of a whole data center, it claims. Rivals have scoffed, pointing to the massive task of rewriting software for a new architecture. But HP thinks it's the only way to deal with tomorrow's vast data sets in an energy efficient way. In current server architectures, the CPUs lie at the center, with multiple layers of memory and storage attached, including DRAM and hard disk drives. HP's goal is to do away with disk drives altogether, and replace DRAM with pools of non-volatile memory. That type of memory keeps its data when the power is switched off, so the Machine can be highly energy efficient. Non-volatile memory exists today, for example NAND Flash, but its performance is slow, at least in high-performance computing terms, and memristors should offer far greater storage density. Next year's prototype machine won't be very energy efficient, however. HP will have to keep all that DRAM powered up so that the data will be available to applications. But it will act as a "proxy" for non-volatile memory, Fink said, allowing partners like SAP to start testing applications. He sees a later version of the Machine using phase-change memory, which is another type of nonvolatile memory still under development, and memristors arriving after that. The Machine makes memory "a first class citizen," he said, with memory pools linked by high-speed silicon photonics that will carry data at 1.2TB per second. "The Machine is driven by making memory the center of the universe, with the processors surrounding it," he said. And he has a new name for the architecture the Machine is based on: Memory Driven Computing. HP is having a "huge debate" about the applications that will run on the machine. Most people want to transfer over existing workloads, which HP says will be possible, but more interesting are the new applications not possible today. Fink offered the example of a plane that lands at an airport 30 minutes early but can't make use of a nearby empty gate, because the airline's computer systems aren't smart enough to know it's available. The Machine will let airlines store all the details about every arrival and departure time, along with gate information, weather data and all the other variables, all in-memory and available for immediate processing. It's a great story, but as with any major new technology that's still five years out, it's impossible to say if it will pan out. Intel once thought it would take over the world with a new processor architecture called Itanium, and that chip seems headed for the scrap heap. But HP is pushing full steam ahead. A Labs booth on the HP Discover show floor has been given over to showcasing technologies that will go inside the new system, including the silicon photonics components. One booth shows an emulation tool HP engineers are using to develop the Machine's OS and firmware. On a laptop, it can simulate the huge memory pools the system will use even though the hardware itself doesn't exist yet. Known as the Machine Architecture Simulator, it can also simulate compute nodes for the Machine, and engineers can select from x86 or ARM-type processors, indicating The Machine will be processor agnostic. In fact, the type of processor isn't important, Fink said. Large companies could even design their own, application-specific CPUs, or attach GPUs or network interface cards. One booth shows a mock-up of what part of the Machine will look like -- but it's a non-working model, a reminder of the work HP still has to do.

Mark Hachman (PC World (US online)) 02 December, 2015 02:07 - - - - print email Distributors Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology Dicker Data Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Synnex Comments Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg Following the birth of their first child, Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife ,Priscilla Chan, announced that they will give away 99 per cent of their Facebook shares, currently worth about $US45 billion, to a new charity the couple has founded. The couple announced the birth of their daughter, Max, on Zuckerberg’s Facebook page. But the real news is a plan to establish the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative “to advance human potential and promote equality for all children in the next generation,” outlined in a letter addressed to Max. “Our initial areas of focus will be personalised learning, curing disease, connecting people and building strong communities,” Zuckerberg and Chan wrote in the joint letter. They explained that “by starting at a young age, we hope to see compounding benefits throughout our lives.” The charity will be funded, according to the letter, via 99 per cent of the Facebook shares that the couple holds together. The $US45 billion in shares will be donated “during our lives,” the couple wrote. Zuckerberg also said that he plans to continue to serve as Facebook CEO for “many, many, years to come.” The story behind the story: Zuckerberg and Chan aren’t the first tech titans to announce they’ll donate the bulk of their fortunes to charity. Bill and Melinda Gates established an eponymous foundation designed to stamp out many first- and third-world problems, including poverty and shortfalls in education. Others—including AOL founder Steve Case, Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, and Russian VC Yuri Milner—have signed the Giving Pledge, which calls for those who’ve signed in to give at least half their wealth to charitable causes either during their lives or after deaths. The Zuckerbergs certainly aren’t obligated to donate their wealth to charity, but the money, and the purpose to which it will be put, will certainly help make the world a better place for their daughter. We can only guess that she (and perhaps any future siblings) will be heir to the Zuckerberg’s 1 per cent reserve—which we can currently estimate at about $US450 million. Not a bad nest egg to inherit. Arrow APEX Puts Partners in F1 Pole Position More from Arrow ECS Follow Us Twitter LinkedIn Join the ARN newsletter! Join Error: Please check your email address.

A Windows Mixed Reality headset from Acer is already being seeded to select developers by Microsoft, but isn't available to consumers yet. So far three PC makers -- Lenovo and HP as well as Acer -- said they would ship headsets later this year. Dell is still mulling a release date. The headsets will start at $299, the rough minimum price suggested by Microsoft. The headsets need to be wired to Windows 10 PCs. Once on, they will transport you to a virtual world where you can, for example, roam, Skype-chat and play Xbox games. It's like computing in a 3D world, without the use of a mouse or keyboard. Acer will ship its Windows Mixed Reality headset to consumers for $299 in the fourth quarter, said Gregg Prendergrast, president of Acer Pan America. The Acer Mixed Reality headset has a liquid crystal display with a 1440 x 1440 pixel resolution per eye. The display's refresh rate is 90Hz. It also has audio out and microphone support and inside-out tracking. HDMI 2.0 and USB 3.0 connectors are bundled in one cable, needed to hook the headset up to PCs. On its part, HP will also ship its version of the headset in the fourth quarter, said Ron Coughlin, president for personal systems at the company. He could not provide price guidance, but the company is making a major VR push later this year. It's already working to connect Oculus Rift and HTC Vive headsets to its PCs. Lenovo has already shown off its Windows Mixed Reality headset, coming later this year, a company spokeswoman said. That points to late third or fourth quarter. Meanwhile, a Dell spokesman said the company doesn't want to share its schedule publicly. "We can confirm we’re developing a headset, like many other OEMs, based on the Microsoft spec. Right now we’re busy hammering away at the overall experience to ensure the device aligns to Dell expectations," the spokesman wrote in an e-mail. 3Glasses and Asus are also developing Windows Mixed Reality headsets, though shipment dates for their products weren't immediately available. 3Glasses is a lead partner for Microsoft, and its headset could be shown off at a Microsoft hardware event to be held later this month in Beijing. The Windows headsets won't work with just any PC. At a minimum, the PC will need Intel's Core i5 Kaby Lake chip, and it will later support Intel's integrated graphics. Good PC performance is important for a smooth experience, said Greg Sullivan, a Microsoft spokesman. A discrete GPU will provide a better experience. That's a minimum requirement for the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive headsets, which don't work on integrated graphics. The headsets will support PCs based on the x86 instruction set, Sullivan said. He couldn't provide specifics on support for AMD's Ryzen chips. Microsoft has previously said that headsets will support AMD's next-generation chips, which are Ryzen. Microsoft's specifications for the headsets do not include Windows 10 2-in-1s and laptops based on ARM-based Snapdragon chips from Qualcomm, which are expected later this year. However, Qualcomm has said that all Windows 10 applications will work with ARM PCs, so in theory, headsets could work when plugged into the ARM PCs.

M. Lau , Department of Computer Science, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Cho-Li Wang , Department of Computer Science, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong ABSTRACT Scalable locking is a key building block for scalable multi-threaded software. Its performance is especially critical in multi-socket, multi-core machines with non-uniform memory access (NUMA). Previous schemes such as in-place locks and delegation locks only perform well under a certain level of contention, and often require non-trivial tuning for a particular configuration. Besides, in large NUMA systems, current delegation locks cannot perform satisfactorily due to lack of optimized NUMA policies. In this work, we propose SANL, a locking scheme that can deliver high performance under various contention levels by adaptively switching between in-place locks and delegation locks. To optimize the performance of delegation locks, we introduce a new NUMA policy that jointly considers node distances and server utilization when choosing lock servers. We have implemented SANL and evaluated it with four popular multi-threaded applications (Memcached, Berkeley DB, Phoenix2 and SPLASH-2), on a 40-core Intel machine and a 64-core AMD machine. The comparison results with seven other representative locking schemes show that SANL outperforms them in most contention situations. For example, in one group test, SANL is 3.7 times faster than RCL lock and 17 times faster than POSIX mutex.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars DEV Everything Microsoft announced at Build 2017 Paul Sawers@psawers May 13, 2017 4:03 AM Above: At the 2016 Microsoft Build conference in San Francisco. Image Credit: Jordan Novet/VentureBeat So Microsoft’s annual Build developer conference came and went, and the computing giant unveiled a number of initiatives aimed at the software engineers and web developers of the world. From Windows 10 to Cortana and bots, here’s a quick recap of everything announced at Build 2017. Embracing the competition A core theme to emerge from Build 2017 was Microsoft’s tacit acknowledgement that it needs to embrace competing platforms if it’s to thrive as a software and services company. Though iTunes has been available on Windows for more than a decade, Microsoft revealed that Apple’s media-focused software would be landing in the Windows Store later this year, a key launch given the impending arrival of Windows 10 S which can only use apps available in the Windows Store. Elsewhere, Microsoft also announced that its cloud storage service, OneDrive, would soon work with Apple’s iMessage, letting users share documents and photos with friends without leaving their iMessage chat. As part of the same announcement, Microsoft revealed that it was opening offline access to folders within OneDrive on Android, with support for iOS users coming later this year. Microsoft also unveiled Xamarin Live Player in preview, which is effectively a “live coding environment” for developers to debug Android and iOS apps without SDKs or emulators. Additionally, Microsoft’s integrated development environment (IDE), Visual Studio, was also launched out of preview for Mac. And as another swift reminder that Microsoft has been increasingly prioritizing the “big 2” mobile operating systems over its own, the company finally revealed that Visual Studio Mobile Center was finally getting Windows support — seven months after debuting with support only for Android and iOS. In a show of support for developers and fans of Linux, Microsoft also revealed that Ubuntu, Suse Linux, and Fedora are all coming to the Windows Store, making it easier to run Linux apps on Windows 10 devices. Bots, Cortana, & AI A little more than a year after launching its Bot Framework, Microsoft revealed that it’s now used by over 130,000 developers. With that in mind, the company used Build 2017 to announce that Bing search results now include Skype bots, in addition to myriad chat apps including Slack, Facebook Messenger, and Telegram. Bots will also soon be able to join video conversations in Skype, with developers able to use the BotBuilder RealTimeMediaCalling extension on Github, which just entered preview. Microsoft also revealed that Cognitive Services, a conduit for third-parties to access its AI algorithms for “vision, speech, language, and knowledge,” was arriving on a bot-to-bot communication platform Interbot, a product from Gupshup. Related to this, Microsoft announced it was releasing four new customizable artificial intelligence services via Cognitive Services, allowing developers to build even more AI into their own products. A number of announcements were also made relating to Cortana, Microsoft’s voice-enabled digital assistant. The company announced a public preview of its Cortana Skills Kit that enables developers to create voice apps for Cortana, and more than 20 such apps made their debut at Build. The software giant also revealed that it was working with both Intel and HP to bring more Cortana-powered devices to market. Microsoft’s bread and butter Microsoft announced some interesting tidbits about its core bread and butter services, in addition to making a few surprise announcements. The company gave a glimpse into how it wants to tie its various apps, products, and platforms together with the Microsoft Fluent Design System, which is effectively guidelines to enable Microsoft to evolve its Metro/Modern UI design language, replete with rules for developers creating software to run on Windows 10. Microsoft also demonstrated Windows 10 running on devices with ARM processors, with full support for existing Win32 apps. And it also revealed that Windows 10 is now installed on more than 500 million devices, a feat that took around 21 months to achieve. Looking to the future, Microsoft announced a new Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, which is coming later this year, with the company teasing a new creative app called Windows Story Remix that uses the Microsoft Graph to transform and combine your photos and videos. As part of the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, Microsoft also outlined plans to launch OneDrive files on-demand, a feature that lets users access their files online without having to download them and consume valuable storage space on their devices. Elsewhere, Microsoft had a little news to share around its cloud computer service Azure. With Azure Cosmos DB, Microsoft is offering a globally distributed database with five consistency choices, rather than forcing developers to choose between strong and eventual consistency. Other notable announcements to emerge from Build include: developers can now publish Microsoft Teams apps to the Office Store, while Microsoft unveiled its first Windows Mixed Reality motion controllers, alongside a mixed reality developer kit. Finally, one of the more interesting early-stage products to emerge at Build was the Emma Watch, a wearable that counters Parkinson’s tremors through using vibrations.

Agents said that Roberts told them he hacked into in-flight entertainment systems by connecting an Ethernet cable to an electronics box under the airplane seat in front of him, and issued a command that caused the aircraft to climb. Apple still trying to get mapping right, buys a startup Apple has acquired Coherent Navigation to give its mapping services a boost, the New York Times confirmed after MacRumors reported the deal. Apple has been working to get mapping right since it moved away from relying on Google Maps, but has suffered some detours on the way. License plate readers worried FBI lawyers, documents reveal As license-plate-reading technology spreads and huge databases are built up across the U.S. that could be used to track innocent people's movements, it emerges that the FBI had its doubts, at least for a while. Wired reports that the FBI's lawyers recommended that it stop buying the devices in 2012. Seems that the moratorium was temporary, though. Just click 'buy' -- coming soon to Google search results Google will include a "buy" button in its search results on mobile devices in the coming weeks, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unnamed sources. Google will let shoppers store payment information, and products will still be sold and shipped by retailers. Macy's is apparently in talks to sign on to the program. Alibaba sued over sales of luxury counterfeits Alibaba is facing a lawsuit in New York federal court brought by luxury brands that are alleging the Chinese e-commerce giant is deliberately promoting fakes on its online marketplace. Attorneys for Gucci, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta and Yves Saint Laurent say that Alibaba is knowingly helping an "army of counterfeiters" by directing consumers to their products when it's obvious that they aren't offering the real deal. ARM moving fast on next high-end chip ARM is in the advanced stages of development of its next high-end processor, and it could reach mobile-device makers by the end of next year. The company's designs are used in most of the world's smartphones and tablets, and its speedy development work reflects both the intense pressure to get new products to market quickly, and heightened competition from Intel. European telcos split on sanity of blocking Google's ads After some European mobile service providers were reported last week to be considering a scheme to block Google's mobile ads across their networks in a ploy to force the search giant to share revenue, a few other big carriers have stepped forward to say the plan is ill-conceived. Both Deutsche Telekom and Swedish operator TeliaSonera said they would not engage in the plan; a representative of the latter pointed out that Google's apps and services drive traffic, and data consumption, and tangling with it doesn't make sense.

Through a new specification announced on Monday, the Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA) Foundation wants to provide a common framework through which developers can write an application once and then run it across servers, mobile devices, gaming consoles, appliances and PCs running on different processors. The HSA 1.0 specification provides underlying guidelines so applications can also effectively harness the joint computing power of processing units available in computing devices. It is the first specification released by the HSA Foundation since it was established in 2012. The goal of HSA 1.0 is to not only ensure programs run faster, but also more power-efficiently. Some applications, like graphics software, can consume a lot of power, and balancing processing across GPUs, CPUs and specialized chips could help extend battery life on devices. The benefit is limited to those programs written using the HSA 1.0 spec, and to the hardware supporting it. It's also up to operating system providers to support the specification and build in drivers so that compiled programs can exploit the hardware features. Hardware in mobile devices and PCs is getting increasingly complex, and it's a growing challenge for programmers to write applications for multiple devices. The new specification would allow developers to write applications that are architecture agnostic, meaning a single program will work across x86 and ARM CPUs. Multicore programming has also been a challenge since the days of Windows, with most of the processing happening on or via the CPU. But GPUs are becoming important at processing video, and digital signal processors are handling tasks like voice recognition, processing audio and taking calls. The HSA 1.0 specification automatically assigns tasks to relevant cores, relieving stress on developers of programming for task execution tasks on specific cores. There are other open parallel programming standards like OpenCL trying to solve the same issue, but they are mostly used in supercomputing. Some of the world's fastest supercomputers harness the joint computing power of CPUs, GPUs and accelerators for scientific and mathematical calculations. HSA Foundation has expressed a desire to succeed OpenCL with support for a wider range of devices. Some big names backing the new standard include AMD, Qualcomm, ARM, Imagination Technologies, MediaTek and Samsung. AMD is designing its chips to be compatible with HSA standards by breaking the stranglehold on CPUs -- which have typically played a big role in scheduling execution of programs -- and providing direct access to memory and other processing cores. Through the HSA chip design, AMD in particular wants CPUs and GPUs to be equal players in program execution, particularly with more importance being placed on graphics in PCs, mobile devices and supercomputers. But key companies like Intel and Nvidia are not participants in HSA, which could hobble the specification's adoption. Nvidia's proprietary CUDA standard is designed for its Tesla supercomputing graphics chips and Tegra mobile chips, and Intel is providing its own parallel programming suite for use with its chips. The companies have a lot running on their proprietary programming standards, which could help improve chip sales. HSA 1.0 will initially support popular programming languages like Java, C++, OpenMP, Python and others. Companies will also have to ensure their hardware is compatible with specifications. Qualcomm, which is one of the world's largest mobile chip vendors, has said the custom CPUs, Adreno GPUs and digital signals processors will be HSA compatible. Imagination Technologies, MediaTek and chip designer ARM also said they will bring HSA compatibility on chips and processor designs in the future. Other key HSA Foundation members include Oracle, Sony, LG Electronics, Marvell, Toshiba, Broadcom and Texas Instruments.

Now AT&T is giving the COW acronym a new high-flying meaning: Cell on Wings. Bob Brown (Network World) 15 July, 2016 00:24 - - - - print email Distributors Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology Dicker Data Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology Synnex Westcon – Comstor Comments You might be familiar with the Cell on Wheels (COW) concept that carriers have deployed to bring temporary wireless service to busy venues or disaster relief areas. Now AT&T is giving the COW acronym a new high-flying meaning: Cell on Wings. The carrier at its Shape Tech Expo at AT&T Park in San Francisco this week provided an update on its drone (unmanned aerial vehicles) efforts, including what it calls flying COWs. John Donovan, chief strategy officer and group president for AT&T Technology and Operations, wrote in a blog post that AT&T this week was starting the trial phase of its national drone program. "Connecting drones to our nationwide LTE network lets us capture data and feed it directly to our systems. In turn, this can allow us to make changes to our network in real time," according to Donovan. This echoes what another AT&T official told us in May about the carrier's drone intentions, including plans to support assorted internet of things applications. MORE: Commercial drones gaining altitude with top IT vendors With flying COWs, AT&T refers to tethered drones that would boost LTE cell coverage at events such as concerts where people amp up the selfies and videos. Of course, most such venues actually have bans on drones right now for safety reasons, so AT&T would need to do a bit of negotiating (of course it might be on the inside track at AT&T Park, for starters). Flying COWs would be in addition to existing AT&T drone-related efforts, such as for cell tower inspections. AT&T and Intel said during Mobile World Congress in February that they have joined forces to test how UAVs equipped with Intel modems and crash avoidance technology work over AT&T’s LTE network. AT&T and other tech companies have been buoyed by FAA regulations published last month that will allow more freedom for those who would use drones commercially. Verizon, for example, is working with NASA on its development of Unmanned Traffic Management solutions and investing through Verizon Ventures in startups such as PrecisionHawk, which provides aerial data and safety platforms for commercial drones, with an emphasis on users in the agriculture, insurance and telecom industries.

It’s been hard to ignore CBRS of late, as everyone from Google to the big carriers to GE has been touting the potential benefits of indoor and outdoor LTE services within shared 3.5 GHz spectrum opened up by the FCC for commercial use. We’re talking carrier-based cellular service extensions, cable companies looking to get into wireless as well as private LTE networks within enterprises, sports stadiums and conference centers. Such services promise to complement -- and in some cases replace -- Wi-Fi, as well as pave the way for 5G wireless services “3.5 has pretty good potential to disrupt the enterprise market,” says consultant Chetan Sharma, fresh off surveying the scene at the big Mobile World Congress show in Barcelona. “It has much better performance [than the alternatives].” Adds Iyad Tarazi, CEO of CBRS player Federated Wireless: "A lot of the hurdles to creating a private LTE system are going away." Given that CBRS involves an innovative new spectrum sharing scheme, it has had to overcome early skepticism, such as from the WiMAX Forum and certain entities in the utility industry. Even now, more trials and government approvals will be required before CBRS spectrum, long reserved for specialized users such as the U.S. Navy and satellite service providers, can be employed commercially. But early rollouts are expected by year-end, so it's essentially full speed ahead for CBRS. MORE: Everything is built to connect to the internet, so why can’t I?  CBRS activity cropped up at Mobile World Congress last year, but the action was even more brisk in advance of this year's MWC and at the event itself: *The CBRS Alliance announced that all of the Big 4 U.S. carriers have now joined its ranks, as has Samsung, bringing the total number of members near 40. The Alliance was formally introduced in February of 2016 with six founding members who had come together the previous summer, and has since added the likes of Cisco, Huawei and Comcast. *Qualcomm and Nokia, two of those founding CBRS Alliance members, along with GE Digital, announced a private LTE-based trial network for industrial IoT. Qualcomm and Nokia also joined forces with Google parent company Alphabet’s Access Group to demo a private LTE network over CBRS spectrum at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, where fans were taken inside race cars via 360-degree virtual reality. *Alphabet’s Access team demonstrated a handful of consumer gear such as smartphones and Mi-Fi devices working with CBRS base stations and launched a program for testing whether CBRS base stations work with its Spectrum Access System (SAS). *Federated Wireless, another of the founding CBRS Alliance members, disclosed that it has received conditional certification from the FCC for its cloud-based spectrum controller for enabling CBRS deployments.  Federated also revealed it is partnering with Nokia to provide a CBRS-based LTE offering, and has tested its SAS with radio gear from Ericsson. *The Small Cell Forum and CBRS Alliance, whose members and focus overlap to some degree, are working on a liaison agreement, according to the former. *A slew of vendors, including Accelleran, Ruckus Wireless and SpiderCloud Wireless, all had CBRS-related demos at Mobile World Congress. CBRS ALLIES Neville Meijers, VP of Business Development at Qualcomm Technologies and chairman of the board for the CBRS Alliance, says “operators are looking at [CBRS] for additional allocation of spectrum they can utilize for broadband -- some fixed, some mobile -- and there are a number of ideas around private LTE networks with respect to campuses, enterprises and industrial IoT… This is a near-term opportunity.” A Verizon VP last week told Fierce Wireless that the carrier plans to use 3.5 GHz spectrum “as soon as practically possible,” for example. CBRS Alliance/Qualcomm CBRS Alliance Chairman Neville Meijers: "A lot of regulators are looking to the U.S. on the CBRS band." CBRS will attract providers who already own spectrum, including those dabbling in LTE-U services that share spectrum used by Wi-Fi networks, as well as those who don’t own spectrum, Meijers says. Coverage will easily handle the inside of a home and require just a couple of small cells in an enterprise; outdoors, line-of-sight distances supported could extend beyond a mile. The 3.5 GHz (3550-3700 MHz) band at the heart of CBRS has been identified by the FCC as an underused resource, but one that still needs to be handled smartly to avoid any possible interference with applications by incumbents. So the FCC has put rules in place requiring SAS and environmental sensory networks to manage the fair and safe use of the spectrum both by Priority Access License holders to be determined via an auction likely to be held in 2018 or 2019 and by everyone else, lumped into the General Authorized Access bucket. Google and Federated Wireless are the first two outfits to jump into the spectrum management pool, and have begun testing their offerings with one another as well as with other assorted vendors in the wireless market.  MORE: Wi-Fi hotspot blocking persists despite FCC crackdown The FCC has already been doling out licenses for vendors to perform trials, and is working with the Wireless Innovation Forum (WInnForum) to come up with an equipment certification process for later this year. As William Graff, ‎Global TCB Program Manager at testing laboratory TUV Rheinland, says: It's a challenge building “radios smart enough to wake up, listen before they talk and figure out how not to stomp on each other.” The CBRS Alliance will add an extra layer of certification to ensure that LTE providers in this spectrum band won’t mess up each other’s services. While chipmakers, service providers and other equipment makers have been among the earliest supporters of CBRS, end user device makers have been slower to embrace the opportunity, at least publicly. Apple, HP and Lenovo are among those that have not signed on as alliance members. One reason for that could be that the FCC hasn’t provided a lot of information on exactly what equipment makers will need to do to make their products work in 3.5 GHz environments. “I just had a question from one of my clients – and I went and sent something right to the FCC -- about the implementation of Part 96 [of the FCC rules] and whether people who have Part 90 stations are going to have to flip them into Part 96 and in what time period,” says TUV’s Graff. In theory, manufacturers with Part 90 radios might be able to just change out some of the logic to comply, he says. CBRS Alliance’s Meijers says:  “If the big handset vendors support the band then there will be a rich and robust handset ecosystem, and that is largely driven by the large mobile network operators in terms of specifying their own device requirements. But outside of that there are a lot of device manufacturers who are interested in providing modules for IoT purposes or tablets or laptops that would also be connected into the network.” ENTERPRISE OPPORTUNITY Federated Wireless has been a mover and shaker in CBRS from the start, having written the charter for the CBRS Alliance and recruited Intel and Qualcomm as founding members. The Arlington, Va., company plans to deliver its spectrum controller to existing service providers, cable companies and new managed service providers such as building management companies as well as integrate it with OEM gear such as access points and small cells. Applications such as point-to-multipoint, small cell backhaul and last-mile fiber replacement will emerge first, CEO Tarazi says. But the former Sprint and Nextel VP is particularly bullish on the opportunity for private LTE networks in the 3.5 GHz band and the path such 4G networks could provide to 5G. Private LTE networks supporting IoT applications in factories and refineries could very well start emerging late this year or early next year, Tarazi says. Federated Wireless Federated Wireless CEO Iyad Tarazi: "If anyone would tell you today there is too much spectrum available... we'd all laugh." It was important to get Intel involved in CBRS from the start, Tarazi says, to ensure 3.5 GHz technology would get built for general purpose computing devices such as laptops in much the same way Wi-Fi support did. “This is not some kind of closed carrier system,” he says. That’s crucial in that the 3.5 GHz band is actually shaping up as a 5G wireless band in other countries that didn’t have the spectrum allocated for specific applications as the United States did. “This sharing system allows the United States to participate in 5G over time… and have global coordination and harmonization,” Tarazi says. “Both Intel and Qualcomm have announced chipsets that are compatible with 5G that are in the 3.5 GHz band.” Tarazi foresees 4G services up to 1Gbps and 5G services 5 to 10 times that, especially for outdoor point-to-point and last-mile replacement purposes. Private LTE services will blow away Wi-Fi for applications such as streaming 4K video, he claims. The hope is that if resource sharing in the 3.5 GHz band pans out that lots more spectrum will be freed up for sharing. And that goes beyond the United States. Meijers of the CBRS Alliance says the world is watching how the U.S. 3.5 GHz experience goes. "There is really very little spectrum under 6 GHz and even in millimeter wave that can be cleared very quickly and licensed out," he says. "So the shared model is one that a lot of regulators are looking to the U.S. on the CBRS band to actually prove out. And if we are able to prove out that people can utilize the spectrum efficiently and fairly, then I think a lot of regulators would be extremely interested to deploy the same kind of model to free up shared spectrum in their own markets, whether it be in LTE or 5G in the future."

The event in Berlin still has several days left to run, but here are the biggest trends we've seen so far. Everything is connected If the companies hawking gadgets at IFA are to be believed, every appliance in our homes will soon be connected and controlled from a smartphone. SmartThinQ LG Electronics rolled out the SmartThinQ sensor, which can be attached to existing appliances such as washing machines and refrigerators to make them smarter. Attached to a washing machine door, for instance, it can tell you when your wash is done. The company also announced a connected oven and air conditioner. European appliance maker AEG also showed a connected oven --with a built-in video camera so you can see from afar when your roast chicken is browned to perfection. And Samsung Electronics launched the new SmartThings home automation hub, and unveiled the SleepSense sleep tracker. IFA Samsung's SleepSense, which it announced at IFA, comes with an app that lets users keep track of their sleep patterns. The connected future won’t be as straightforward as vendors here make it out to be, of course, with appliances from different suppliers all humming along in perfect harmony. They don’t mention what might happen if your heating system gets hacked, how the data collected from these systems will be used, or how complicated things could get when multiple vendors have their own apps to control things. Hold tight, it could be a bumpy ride. More choice for smartwatch fans Motorola, Samsung and Asus all launched new smartwatches, and if there was a common theme it was more choice. That includes in sizes, designs, colors and wristbands. Florence Ion Zenwatch2 Motorola and Asus both showed two sizes of their respective watches, the Moto 360 and the ZenWatch 2. The ZenWatch, with an oblong face, is available with a 1.63-inch or 1.45-inch display. The screens on the round Moto 360 measure 1.56 inches or 1.37 inches. While the 360 and ZenWatch 2 are based on Google’s Android Wear, Samsung is betting on its Tizen OS, used in the Gear S2 and S2 classic. Samsung is also going against the grain by using a rotating bezel to control the interface. The watches will all be shipping by the end of October. Gaming rigs give PC industry some hope Roaming the halls at IFA, you could also be forgiven for thinking the PC industry is doing well. With Windows 10 now out, manufacturers hope Intel’s new Skylake processor will give them a much-needed sales boost. One group they're all going after is gamers. Acer announced new Predator laptops that will compete with Asus’ G752. Acer also unveiled the intriguing Revo Build, a PC made up of blocks stacked on top of each other. The base model will cost €199 ($220) when it goes on sale in Europe in October. Revo Build Your next TV will be more colorful TVs have been big part of the IFA lately, and this year was no different. The main trend was the addition of HDR (high dynamic range), which is meant to improve contrast and color reproduction. LG and Panasonic showed 65-inch OLED TVs -- the 65EF9500 and TX-65CZ950, respectively. The image quality on the Panasonic looked impressive under the optimized conditions on the show floor here. Pricing wasn’t announced, but you can be sure that neither set will be cheap. Sony is also betting big on HDR, and said it will upgrade many of its existing 4K TVs to support the technology. However, even with a TV that’s HDR-compatible, there isn’t much content yet to watch. Amazon is leading the way here.

So too will be the vendor battles that erupt and the commercial uses to emerge around the technologies. So says Tom Mainelli, program vice president for devices and AR/VR at IDC, which held its annual Directions conference in Boston this week. Mainelli is excited about the prospect that these eventually comingled technologies will enable us to “fundamentally rethink how we create information, share information and absorb information.” VIRTUAL REALITY Mainelli first dove into VR, which he said basically involves “leaving one reality for another.” A recent IDC survey of more than 2,000 U.S. consumers found that three quarters of them said they had heard of VR and knew what it was – not surprising in light of all the new technology rolled out last year from the likes of Samsung, Facebook/Oculus and HTC. So yes, VR has gotten off to a faster start than AR through gaming apps and low-end gear such as Google Cardboard, but it could eventually become a subset of AR, the industry watcher said. MORE: Ga-ga for goggles -- AR & VR bring the masses to Harvard The vast majority of VR apps are being run on Android and Windows devices, setting up a battle between Google and Microsoft on one side, and VR platform vendors such as Steam/HTC and Facebook/Oculus, whose tech runs on Windows or Android. “Expect to see some friction as the operating system companies begin to battle the ecosystem companies for a place at the table of VR,” Mainelli says. We’re talking about a big market here, growing from 10 million units of tethered headsets/standalone devices/phone-based systems in 2016 to six times that by 2020 if IDC’s estimates prove accurate. VR competition will increase as a flood of new content, from movies to marketing, emerges this year. “I would make the argument that the big crossover moment in VR is right around the corner. And what is that? It’s live sports. If there’s one thing a lot of people in this room would pay money for it is access to live sports.” Commercial applications, from those for medical training to those for construction, are starting to make their mark, too. Mainelli recounted visiting Nvidia on the west coast last week and checking out how the graphics processing unit maker has pre-visualized its new headquarters building in virtual reality. “This has allowed their CEO and other executives to walk through the building before it’s built,” allowing them to tinker with everything from doors to skylights before it’s too late, he says. Not that VR isn’t without its challenges, Mainelli stresses. Interfaces, especially when you consider the use of intrusive controllers, are still at a relatively primitive state, and VR product makers have serious compute demands on them that will only get harder as more data-intensive apps catch on. Societal impacts can’t be overlooked either, from the addictiveness of such technology to the potential for illegal behaviors (i.e., harassment) by users as VR becomes more of a social experience. Mainelli also shared this cautionary tale: When Intel demoed its latest VR technology for the press at the big CES show in Las Vegas, the company equipped the leather seats provided with barf bags. “Some percentage of people will not be able to enjoy VR” because it will make them sick to their stomachs, and we won't know what that percentage is until bigger numbers of units ship, he says. AUGMENTED REALITY “As excited as I am about VR, I think AR is the real game changer,” Mainelli says, in that AR adds pertinent information to the reality we are already in and encourages more interaction with those around us. As with VR, Mainelli sees a vendor battle taking shape in augmented reality, and one that “could be even more dramatic.” You’ve got operating system and hardware players Microsoft (HoloLens and its recently renamed Mixed Reality platform), Google (Tango, via your smartphone) and drumroll please… Apple, which hasn’t technically rolled out or announced anything yet. But Mainelli fully expects the next iPhone will support augmented reality (as has been heartily rumored about the iPhone 8 or iPhone X). “Apple doesn’t really tell anybody what they’re going to do, but based on their acquisitions and based on the fact that [CEO] Tim Cook can’t stop talking about augmented reality makes me think that Apple sees it as a huge opportunity,” he says.  Mainelli pits those companies against players delivering or readying AR-specific hardware. These include Daqri, Meta, ODG -- all of which are shipping hardware that runs on someone else’s OS -- and the much hyped and well-heeled MagicLeap.  Just as Mainelli surveyed consumers about VR, he asked enterprises about AR. More than a quarter of the 500 people surveyed said their organizations are using or testing some sort of AR software on phones, tablets or PCs. Drivers include the potential for enabling more effective hands-free work and improvements to safety in the field.  IDC sees commercial AR apps falling into two general areas: compute-intensive and creative AR applications, such as for engineers and architects, and low compute Internet of Things-focused apps for people working on manufacturing lines or climbing up poles in the field. While AR product shipments are currently small and will be far fewer than those of VR systems by 2020, Mainelli does foresee AR software/services/hardware spending blowing away numbers on the VR side. AR has its challenges, too, though. These include big investments needed in optics and hand/eye tracking. What’s more, networks and back-end systems will need to be bolstered to handle the delivery of data required by AR apps, Mainelli says. 5G wireless networks could be shaping up just in time for that, he says.

FAQ: What in the wireless world is CBRS? Explainer on the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) shared spectrum in the 3.5 GHz band Bob Brown (Network World) 15 March, 2017 05:43 - - - - print email Distributors ACA Pacific Alloys Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology Dicker Data Dynamic Supplies Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology Samsung Communications Synnex Topstar Computer International Westcon – Comstor Wholesale IT XiT Distribution Comments IDG First off, CBRS is an acronym for Citizens Broadband Radio Service, and the upshot for enterprise IT pros is that it could result in improved LTE services from service providers as well as enable enterprises to build their own private LTE networks (See also: "The big CBRS promise: Private LTE networks"). Here’s a primer on CBRS — because you are going to want to know about this. Citizens Band/CB, as in CB radio? No, good buddy, this has nothing to do with the Citizens’ Band radio service used by truckers for two-way voice communications and that lives in the 27 MHz spectrum band in the U.S.  CBRS lives in the 3.5 GHz band. How did the 3.5 GHz band suddenly become available for new commercial services? Isn’t spectrum a super scarce resource? The freeing up of the 3550-3700 MHz band stems from the 2010 National Broadband Plan issued by the FCC, which set out to make 500 MHz of additional spectrum available for new mobile uses. The FCC zeroed in on the 3.5 GHz band in rules issued in April of 2015, then reaffirmed those rules about a year later. Aren’t the previous users of this spectrum band bummed out now?  They’ll deal with it. A portion of the 150 MHz of spectrum in question has been used by the U.S. Navy, satellite service providers and utilities, but protections have been built into the CBRS rules to safeguard this Incumbent class of spectrum users. Spectrum Access System (known as SAS) and Environmental Sensing Capability services must be implemented to avoid any possible interference between users. Other classes of users are being designated Priority Access and General Authorized Access, the former of which will gain this privilege via a spectrum license auction for Priority Access Licenses (PALs) expected to take place either in 2018 or 2019. So who’s going to use this spectrum? Carriers look forward to extending coverage and capacity of their LTE services via the 3.5 GHz band. As we know from their efforts to horn in on the 5 GHz band used for Wi-Fi via a technology called LTE-U, carriers seek access to more spectrum. But cable operators looking to get into wireless also want in on this action, as will assorted managed service providers, which could include building management companies. What’s more, enterprises could use the spectrum to set up their own LTE networks, including to support internet of things devices. LTE services in the 3.5 GHz band will work indoors and outdoors. What sort of applications will CBRS be used for? Service providers are expected to use CBRS to replace last-mile fiber access, deliver fixed wireless services and even point-to-multipoint offerings. Enterprises and managed service providers could exploit the 3.5 GHz band for IoT connectivity and even for Wi-Fi replacement or supplementary services. LTE services could hit 1Gbps indoors and maybe 5 or 10 times that for outdoor uses with line-of-sight access. CBRS backers say the economics of this technology are much better than those of distributed antenna systems and they contend the speed and consistency of service will be much better than Wi-Fi. CBRS supporters also say imaginative new services will be enabled by availability of more cheap spectrum: Nokia, Qualcomm and Google parent Alphabet’s Access group recently demoed a private LTE network over CBRS at Las Vegas Motor Speedway designed to give fans a 360-degree virtual reality view into speeding race cars in real time.  Where will software, equipment and services come from to support all this? Here’s one clue: Almost 40 vendors, from the Big 4 carriers to service provider equipment vendors Ericsson and Nokia to enterprise equipment companies like Cisco and Ruckus to chipmakers like Intel and Qualcomm have banded together in the CBRS Alliance. Look for smartphone and computer makers to join too, once carriers make their requirements clear. Samsung already belongs to the CBRS Alliance. Apple? “Apple will follow the market. Apple will get here,” says Iyad Tarazi, CEO of CBRS Alliance founding member Federated Wireless. “We’ve been careful at this point not to focus on the handset makers because that relationship is typically owned by the carriers. What we have focused on is making sure the chipsets and modems and all of the capabilities are coming this way.” What’s the timeframe for CBRS from here? The FCC has doled out licenses for vendors to conduct CBRS trials, and some of these companies showed off their wares at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona earlier in 2017. The FCC is expected to begin certifying equipment later this year, working with the Wireless Innovation Forum, and the CBRS Alliance later also hopes to begin certifying service providers before long. So expect rollouts by the second half of 2017.  Will changes in the FCC’s leadership have any impact on CBRS? While the FCC under new Chairman Ajit Pai has embarked on a course to undo data privacy, net neutrality and other rules put into effect during the Obama administration, CBRS supporters claim they feel comfortable that the commission will not mess with CBRS to any large degree. Pai and fellow Republican FCC member Michael O’Rielly both initially voiced concerns about the 3.5 GHz shared spectrum rules, though did go along with the eventual plan as part of a unanimous ruling. The fact that the FCC did recently give the go-ahead to cellular base stations from Nokia and Ericsson for use in LTE-U networks, indicates support for shared spectrum endeavors. There could be tweaks forthcoming to the Priority Access License plans though. What's all this mean for 5G wireless? While the initial talk about CBRS focuses on 4G LTE services, there are no restrictions on using the 3.5 GHz band for 5G services as they emerge. In fact, it's quite likely that the band will be used for 5G, and that might synch nicely with services offered in other countries that are actually targeting the band for 5G services. What's more, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is making moves to enable 5G radios to work in shared spectrum environments.

Shlain, whose eye-opening Shatterbox film 50/50 illuminates history’s often-overlooked female leaders, created the event to inspire activists from across the world to bring vital dialogues about this ongoing battle back to the places where change matters most: their homes, offices, schools, and everywhere in between. With a little help from powerhouse celebs like Eva Longoria and tireless organizations ranging from Intel to NARAL Pro-Choice, 50/50 Day spurred a conversation about women's rights that crossed continents and cultural barriers, fueled by screenings of Shlain's film, discussion groups, and a 24-hour panel that linked participants in their joined advocacy for equality. Ahead, check out the myriad ways 50/50 Day pushed this essential fight forward.

About Lambert Strether Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

Reply ↓ allan May 12, 2017 at 7:23 am It turns out that when Miller said, “people will go to jail”, he meant Occupy protesters, not banksters. Reply ↓ russell1200 May 12, 2017 at 8:49 am Most State AGs can only go after civil penalties. New York is one of the (very) big exceptions. So having the State AGs leading the charge was always problematic at best. They had a hammer, civil penalties, and that’s what they used. Criminal indictments would have had to come from somewhere else. Reply ↓ Stormcrow May 12, 2017 at 10:23 am Independent Probe: The Game Plan The Democratic game plan is evident Sic Semper Tyrannis 11 May 2017 It is not going to be possible to remove President Trump from office by declaring him unfit for office. … The next best possibility from the POV of the “resistance,” (with HC and the mookies in the lead?) is impeachment and trial in the senate. … Essential to this course of action is the campaign for Congressional investigations, an independent prosecutor or a commission to investigate and “expose” Trump’s treason and malfeasance in office. … Once this is accomplished the Republican weaklings in the senate could perhaps be intimidated into conviction. http://turcopolier.typepad.com/sic_semper_tyrannis/2017/05/the-democratic-game-plan-is-evident.html#comments The thread is worth reading.

Reply ↓ Rik May 12, 2017 at 7:38 am You may have missed this one from David Roberts at Vox. Seems the best analysis of Trump to date. 40 tweets in all; ones that stand out are no.9 and no. 26. I’ll just quote no. 9 here: 9. Here’s the thing: Trump, by all indications, does not have beliefs, intentions, etc. that are stable, persistent across contexts. See also Heidi N. Moore’s RTs (± 13:35 CET, 12-5-17) from Politico and The Hill for confirmation. Reply ↓ dontknowitall May 12, 2017 at 10:42 am Yay! Another psychiatric assessment from 140 word from all of 40 tweets. /snark Reply ↓ jrs May 12, 2017 at 12:30 pm it’s moderately interesting, not bad for a twitter stream. One can criticize twitter as a means of communication, it short circuits full evaluation the message IMO, but we have Presidency by tweet at this point so … the medium is the presidency .. So call it speculation. I don’t think we can always fully know the motive of the powerful, though many will write books on it. Was Obama evil, corrupt, just not too bright? I don’t know. His actions like drone killing were harmful. And the same is true of Trump, his policies are harmful, only in spades and getting worse by the day. Reply ↓ jrs May 12, 2017 at 12:37 pm at least a full tweet stream like that uninterrupted by replies is easier to follow. Twitter may be improving (in a few ways). But it’s all speculative, if you choose not to have a TOM, you still have a TOM (or no mind as it were). Reply ↓ lambert strether May 12, 2017 at 11:26 am I see very little point in armchair diagnosis, whether by actual doctors (Frist of Schiavo) or by laypersons Reply ↓ MLS May 12, 2017 at 3:02 pm you’re right, of course, but armchair quarterbacking is a US national sport and we aren’t about to stop now. Reply ↓ reslez May 12, 2017 at 2:00 pm You can’t judge Trump from his words. He contradicts himself too much. I agree with Roberts’ argument that Trump is highly focused on appearing dominant at all times. That was how he crushed his opponents in the Republican primary. “Low energy” Jeb, “Little” Marco. Primary voters loved that. They ate it up. To properly evaluate Trump you have to disregard his statements — he disregards them too. The only metric for Trump is what he does. And 5 months into his first term, his actions show he’s either failing or declining to do what he campaigned on. What disturbs me most is Trump pushing for the AHCA. It shows a total lack of awareness, an investment in the mendacious Republican party line. This is not a man who’s going to get re-elected. Trump actions: Withdrew from TPP Failed to ban Muslims Increased military spending 10% while pushing cuts to Medicaid Nominated Gorsuch Bombed Syria Heightened tensions in North Korea Expanded bombings and troops in America’s multiple, failed, on-going wars Pushed terrible AHCA through House Fired Flynn and Comey (The reasons behind them we can’t evaluate, because that would require examining Trump’s unreliable statements. However, Flynn is a nutjob who wanted to bomb Iran and Comey had it coming) So far the evidence is that Trump’s instincts on foreign and economic policy are pretty awful, that he has no intention of abiding by his campaign promises, and that he’s not competent enough to execute on most of his goals. There will be a major third party candidate in 2020. Reply ↓ craazyboy May 12, 2017 at 4:02 pm Betcha Little Marco has his big hand wrapped around a Bull high energy drink! Reply ↓ lyman alpha blob May 12, 2017 at 6:30 pm This is not a man who’s going to get re-elected. Agreed. Lots of talk about which Democrats will challenge him in 2020 however not nearly as much regarding who in the Republican party will primary him. I highly doubt it will be one of those elections where the party in power defers to the incumbent.

Bageant’s Deer Hunting with Jesus, is an absolute must read. It’s the perfect companion to Listen Liberal, and I might even say the first half is better than LL. Bageant identifies and talks with those “deplorables” left behind (no trampled) by neoliberalism all the way back in 2007, while providing some great insights into the mortgage exploitation market and the hollowing out of the manufacturing sector, all wrapped in an extremely entertaining personal story and experience. Reply ↓ Montanamaven May 12, 2017 at 11:55 am Yes, the Jack Justice article was welcome and “about time”. Our Huey Long wrote this about New York state’s Appalachia where I now spend half my time: Huey Long  May 10, 2017 at 7:36 pm   Plenty! All of the upstate cities are bombed-out de-industrialized shadows of their former selves and NYC lost most of its manufacturing in the decades immediately following WWII.  Most of the industry packed up and moved south of the Mason-Dixon line or overseas with Alexander Smith Carpet and American Safety Razor leading the way. Other industries became victims of technological progress, such as the demise of the American Locomotive Company and later Kodak.  The local, state, federal governments played no small role in killing industry in NYC. The feds closed the Brooklyn Navy Yard in 1966 killing thousands of industrial jobs, the state (Nelson) wasted enormous sums of money on Empire State Plaza, Roosevelt Island, and other boondoggles rather than on industrial infrastructure, while the city did all it could to zone industry out of Lower Manhattan and the waterfronts of both Manhattan and Brooklyn. The only industries still going strong in NYC are grift, propaganda, and artisanal pickle making. And the Prisons. More on how NY led the way on that at: Prison Industrial Complex Here in Upstate Hudson Valley NY there are also all the prisons which seem to be a main source of work. When I mentioned that we had 1/5th the world’s population and incarcerate more people than Russia or China to a local, he was surprised. When I mentioned this to my rancher husband he said, “We must have more bad guys.” I said, “More bad guys than China, Russia, Mexico, Pakistan….?” He conceded that point and said there must be something pretty fishy going on. Ya think? Prisons are a lousy substitute for Kodak and American Safety Razor. And the local here said that many of the young guys that go into the corrections business can become kind of mean. Ya think? Reply ↓ Lambert Strether Post authorMay 12, 2017 at 1:07 pm > New York state’s Appalachia where I now spend half my time I’d be interested to hear comparisons of NY and Montana. Upstate New York is a lot like Maine, at least in terms of industrial devastation. Reply ↓ Montanamaven May 12, 2017 at 2:49 pm Montana has always been a colony rather than an industrialized state like Maine or New York with their good ports for transport of goods easily. I first heard Montana described as a colony by Brian Schweitzer when he was running for the Senate in 2002. We export lumber, copper, coal and cattle and have to import most food and dry goods. Hence, a colony. He ran in 2002 and then successfully for Governor in 2004 on trying to bring industry like furniture making and slaughter houses to Montana. He wanted our own health care system like our neighbor to the North. He became popular for driving bus loads of Seniors across the border to Canada for cheaper medicine. Reply ↓ mpalomar May 12, 2017 at 2:53 pm “Here in Upstate Hudson Valley NY there are also all the prisons which seem to be a main source of work.” I recall reading an article years ago about the prison industry and migrated upstate NY prison population, examining the mechanism by which discriminatory drug laws and sentencing were removing significant numbers of inner city blacks and hispanics, taking them off local voter rolls in Brooklyn etc. but counting them in mostly white, upstate voting districts (despite the fact they could not vote) and also using them as cheap labor for prison industry schemes. I’m not sure if it still works that way. Reply ↓ Olga May 12, 2017 at 12:45 pm Great interview! Thanks. The section on nature and having it in one’s bones is priceless. Reply ↓ JohnnyGL May 12, 2017 at 7:54 am Can someone explain to me how Jeremy Corbyn is rated so poorly on a personal level, while Labor’s policies are so popular?

Reply ↓ Katniss Everdeen May 12, 2017 at 8:58 am +1000 Reply ↓ Carolinian May 12, 2017 at 10:07 am Yes. In a Trump/Sanders race the press might very well have decided that they preferred Trump. The notion that Sanders would have easily won is an untested assumption that, as is so typical these days, has been converted into an indisputable fact. Reply ↓ Andrew Watts May 12, 2017 at 11:01 am Sanders was obviously a Soviet spy given his honeymoon in the Soviet Union. /sarc Reply ↓ AbateMagicThinking but Not money May 12, 2017 at 8:37 am It seems that Corbyn isn’t presidential. It is not a presidential system but the party leader seemingly has to have the expected presidential persona. We had that with Blair and that got us Afghanistan and Iraq. Of course, Trump has knocked “presidential” into a cocked hat – and a very entertaining one at that. I think that the main issue is that Corbyn got his position as leader in a non-traditional manner – voted in by the party membership – not by the Labour Party members of parliament – the people he has got to wrangle if Labour does win power. Legitimacy is in question. The interesting thing for me in comparing the British scene with the US system is that us Brits know exactly who the political leaders are. Who leads the Dem.s now? Don’t tell me who it is in the congress or senate, or potential presidential candidates, but who the Leader is. Reply ↓ Altandmain May 12, 2017 at 10:44 am Strictly if you think about it, Labour’s way of voting in by membership is more democratic than Parliament members of Labour. It’s sad though that people would rather vote for someone that looks like a PM on appearances rather than someone who would fight for the policies of the common citizen. Reply ↓ PlutoniumKun May 12, 2017 at 8:39 am I can’t explain it entirely, but I don’t think its too hard to understand in broad terms. I think Sanders is something of a genius communicator, with an ability to de-idiologize contraversial ideas without ever pandering, patronising, or over-simplifying. And he’s a sort of loveable grandfather figure who is hard, even for opponents, to dislike (it seems that even the Republicans who have dealt with him in the Senate like him personally). Attempts to demonise him by the media have failed miserably because quite simply, he comes across much nicer than the people attacking him. He has also been politically smart enough to sidestep issues which label him in regular peoples mind with classic urban liberalism, such as gun control, abortion, etc. Corbyn, on the other hand, seems incapable of breaking out of the mould of the ideological lefty backroom operator, always breaking into jargon when he should be explaining things clearly. He has wasted too much political capital on issues with matter a lot with the left, but don’t resonate with the public (such as nuclear disarmament). His incoherence on issues like Brexit have turned off many potential supporters. He does not come across on TV as particularly likeable. His personal traits, such as his casual dress and cycling everywhere therefore comes off as wierd and stubborn, rather than rather loveable eccentricities as they would if they were done by Sanders. So attacks on him by the media have stuck in the way they’ve just bounced off Sanders. Personality really does matter. Just look at the Clintons – they are true partners in everything they have done politically, but BC’s personality makes him hard to dislike even for those who hate much of what he did, while HRC’s personality (or lack of one) attracts a level of bile (especially from the left) that Bill rarely had to face. I know people ascribe it to misogyny, but I think this is simplistic. Bill, like Sanders, has a likeable personality, HRC and Corbyn for various reasons don’t. It would be nice to say that only policies should matter, not personalities, but there are plenty of psychological studies which show that even very informed people can be swayed by people they like and respect far more than they can be by rational arguments put forward by people who they don’t like. Reply ↓ NotTimothyGeithner May 12, 2017 at 9:20 am A few thoughts on polls: -pollsters create expectations of the electorate often missing non-governmental phenomenons. Polling in 2016 was based on expectations of a 2008 turnout ignoring changes in 2010, 2012, and 2014. Brexit’s surprise was largely a surprise because of expectations created by pollsters who used previous election data to set a baseline instead of calling a representation of the populace and breaking it down from there. -position of questions in polls. People who stay on the phone longer are looking to give the correct answer which is “yes.” I believe this is why Obama and Clinton remained personally popular while their party’s fortunes soured. -polls also suffer from constantly changing political titles such as “liberal. ” Democrats pointed to Obama’s popularity with self described “liberal Democrats” to paint lefty or liberal critics as not a problem for their electoral fortunes. About personality, Bill Clinton had 43% of the vote and saw noticeable decline in youth and minority voting in 1992 and 1996 when the GOP faced major conservative defections to a third party or non voting. Perhaps, Bill was never that popular and was entirely reliant on Team Blue tribal loyalty? After all, he lost majorities, and his VP and wife have now lost three times in their quest for the White House. Narratives about the real Hillary who was very liberal seem to be flat out rejections of Bill even by loyalists.

Also, the symbolic monarch being a glorified celebrity is actually cheaper than the President’s pomp. A good juxtaposition might be the fortress we build around the President such as Jill Biden’s community college being put in lock down for a surprise visit from Biden while David Cameron was photographed napping with 10 Downing Street’s resident ratter who goes where he pleases.

Reply ↓ vidimi May 12, 2017 at 9:41 am i think this is spot on and see it in myself. in france, despite knowing on an intellectual level that le pen would be worse than macron as a president, i secretly wanted macron to lose just because he comes across as a complete twat and has an eminently punchable face. although another important reason was the media’s love for him and the dishonest way he was portrayed (i.e. centrist rather than right-wing). i suspect spiting the media was also motivation for a lot of people who voted for trump.

Imagine Sanders would have become the party leader. He now needs. To work with people who despise him, mostly for the fact that he unfairly deprived them of their​ god given right to run affairs as they please. You’d get a similar level of leaks, anonymous briefings and outright sabotage as you see in Labour. And he is now the head of the party so at least some of the party’s stunts fall back on him. Meanwhile the dethroned Clintonites take all their loyalists in the press with them and spend most of their waking hours whining to them. Continue for two years, then stir. Also we shouldn’t forget that Corbyn’s foreign policy is far outside the mainstream whereas Sanders still signs AIPAC letters from time to time.

Reply ↓ Jeff W May 12, 2017 at 6:06 pm The short answer that Corbyn takes more of an anti-imperialist stance than Sanders does. Corbyn (rightly or wrongly) advances foreign policy positions that are unpopular in addition to—or, perhaps, ahead of—taking positions on domestic economic issues that are popular with his base. Reply ↓ JohnnyGL May 13, 2017 at 12:45 am I wanted to shoot a quick “thank you” comment to those who chimed in on my question from this morning. I think it’s an interesting one because there may be possible lessons that can be learned from the relatives successes and failures that we see from Sanders and Corbyn. Some of the highlights for me were: Darius and Carolinian pointing out that the Dems would have McGovern-ed Sanders pretty hard, had he won the nomination. And if he won the presidency, I think they would have Carter-ed him, too. AbateMagic pointed to contextual difference in party structure, asking who leads political parties in the US, and questioned what it means to be a ‘leader’ and be ‘presidential’. PlutoniumKun says it’s at least partially personal and Sanders is more charismatic. JeffW and generic pointed to foreign policy differences, Corbyn being much more overtly anti-imperialist. I’ll put my thoughts below: 1) generic also pointed out that Corbyn won and Sanders didn’t. I think this is right that it makes him more of a lightning rod for the establishment. Corbyn grabbed(or maybe was handed) control of a major political party. That means the establishment smells danger. For Corbyn, himself, I get the feeling he didn’t really have a plan he was prepared to implement as he’s spent so much time as an activist and protest candidate. The same might have happened to Sanders, had he triumphed. 2) PlutoniumKun is right about personal differences. He might be onto something with the point about Corbyn talking about nuclear arms giving the vibe that he’s a bit out of touch. Sanders is clearly a grandmaster of kitchen table issues. He’s been incredible with his ability to maintain focus on what he sees as the important stuff like higher wages, publicly funded higher education and healthcare. Without Sanders, the news would be all palace politics about Russia investigations and inside baseball in congress and in Trump’s team (of course, it still is, but Sanders just keeps hammering away). I actually think Sanders repeated disappointment on foreign policy issues partially comes from his incredible focus on the stuff that he’s confident in. I also think Sanders is more of a deal-maker who sits on the periphery, but is still influential and knows how to score understated, but important victories (like on ACA). Sanders immediately found himself in a very comfortable position after the election. He was still on the periphery, but much less so and now had more of a brand and a bigger megaphone. He clearly observed that what he was doing in 2016 was working and decided that he needed to do more of it. It’s still working. 3) Societal context. I think the skimpier welfare state in the USA, especially the massive student debt problem creates circumstances where someone like Sanders finds a more receptive audience. 4) The Trump factor creates fractured opposition whereas Corbyn is up against the entire British establishment. I think this is working to Sanders’ advantage here. Trump derangement syndrome is clearly a real thing and is deeply corroding the brain power of coastal media elites that cheer for team blue. They still haven’t come to grips with the reality that they lost to Trump and are obsessed with the idea of impeachment as a way of cutting short this ongoing ego-bruising they’re having to endure. It’s like Dems are okay with losing to another Bush or even an unelected Pence, but losing to Trump is an insult and an affront that they still can’t handle. This makes the Dem elite look more foolish to the public and reinforces the notion that they’re out of touch. To counteract this, they need to keep Sanders no more than arm’s length away because they quietly, reluctantly have to admit to themselves that they need Sanders’ voters to win elections, at least while they continue their long term project of lusting after wealthy suburban republican voters. Whenever it looks like Sanders is getting the better of the elites of team Dem, the knives come out for Sanders again. However, it doesn’t seem to be denting the popularity of Sanders. Corbyn is in a much tougher set of circumstances. Blairites in the Labor Party are, for the moment, happy to sabotage their own party as they focus on regaining control. They seem perfectly comfortable with May as PM and don’t mind waiting their turn. It’s too early to say Corbyn is failing. We’ll get a better read after the election, but facing a united British establishment is a much more difficult task. Reply ↓ Jeff W May 13, 2017 at 5:56 am I liked your recap and your take on both Corbyn and Sanders. Sanders is clearly a grandmaster of kitchen table issues. He’s been incredible with his ability to maintain focus on what he sees as the important stuff like higher wages, publicly funded higher education and healthcare.…I actually think Sanders repeated disappointment on foreign policy issues partially comes from his incredible focus on the stuff that he’s confident in. I don’t know what Corbyn’s background is but Sanders was a highly-regarded mayor of Burlington, a Congressman and now a Senator. In those situations, especially in a small state like Vermont, you really have to talk to the voters, I think. And I’ve also been impressed by his focus on higher wages, publicly funded higher education and healthcare also, not just because of those issues themselves, but because Sanders refuses to be drawn into the politics or the horse race or any of the trivial, idiotic topics that mainstream media likes to ask about. He doesn’t take the bait, he sets the terms and the frame of the conversation, and it makes him particularly impervious to attack. Sanders is clearly more confident on domestic issues than on foreign policy but I’ve always thought that his focus on domestic issues itself reflected a policy bias—we should be focusing far more on how to improve things at home rather than engaging in X abroad. (X is whatever the Washington Consensus says the US should be doing in foreign policy.) He’s by no means an isolationist and he’s not an anti-imperialist in the same way Corbyn is but he’s simply not interested in the “projection” (to use the international relations term) of US power around the globe. Reply ↓ johnnygl May 13, 2017 at 8:45 am Yes, he’s mastered keeping the dem party line at arm’s length. He’ll make a bland, generic statement on russia or syria that reflects a watered down beltway consensus view. He does enough so dems can’t complain he’s not playing along, but then quickly pivots back to his campaign speech. I think context matters here, too. His focus on issues wouldn’t work this well if the rest of the dems weren’t overcome with trump derangement syndrome and yelling about russia. If sanders had tried to start a new party or tried to push to close military bases all around the globe, i don’t think he’d resonate as much. People are desperate right now and they need solutions on immediate problems. Corbyn is stuck facing proud, delusional tories and blairites that want him out and don’t care what tories are doing. If a non-trump repub had won, things would be harder for sanders. Reply ↓ Jeff W May 13, 2017 at 3:45 pm I agree completely. In a way it’s a “perfect storm” favoring Sanders. The fact that Trump—Trump (!)—the buffoonish reality show host who the Washington establishment laughed at—won against the reigning Washington establishment politician certainly gives credence to Sanders’ underlying critique. The Democrats can’t accept that critique—they’re in deep denial as well as being deeply cynical—so they’ve resorted to the Russia-Comey-etc. defense of why their candidate lost (i.e., anything but policy). If a non-Trump Republican had won, things would be harder for Sanders—it would be far less clear, at least in the minds of the media who really don’t want to know, what the voters were endorsing or rejecting. (In the typical US situation, where voters are asked to choose between two alternatives neither of which they want, it’s hard to say, on the basis of that choice, what they do want.) Sanders alone put things on the political agenda (Medicare-for-All, tuition-free college, higher minimum wage) that have been squelched by the Democrats for close to 40 years. It wasn’t even hard—I had been saying, like, forever, that it wasn’t hard—he just had to make a few simple statements. It wasn’t hard but he deserves the credit. He did it.

Reply ↓ polecat May 12, 2017 at 3:36 pm With regard to traps, I take soda bottles (Large ones), cut off the top an inch below the shoulder, invert it, place it inside the ‘new rim, and either staple, or tape (aluminum duct type works well), then attach a wire hanger on it, and fill 1/3rd -1/2 with water/honey combo (sugar water or pop can be used, but not as effective). Works great ! I do make a flap-shaped cut further up the trap (leave the bottom of flap UNCUT) so one can empty drowned wasps and old syrup before refilling. I use these when the wasps begin to predate on my bee hives in late summer. It doesn’t eliminate them, but does nock-down their numbers somewhat. PLEASE NOTE : Be careful while cutting bottle plastic … as cutting blades can SLIP or cut where you don’t want them to, such as fingers ! ‘;0 …. best to drill a small hole, and then proceed with a small scroll saw blade to complete the cut.

In fact, it poses an existential threat “Sorry, no money for more color revolutions.” At home, the best thing we can do is to give all the gold in Fort Knox to the people…Gold People Power…or People Gold Power.

Reply ↓ José May 12, 2017 at 2:41 pm One could also argue that in the European case adopting the gold standard would have been not as bad as adopting the euro. For one simple reason: it’s very easy for a country under the gold standard to either devalue the currency relative to gold or go altogether off gold. A mere stroke of the pen is suffficient in both cases – while unilaterally exiting the euro is so costly and risky that it’s virtually impossible. A country under the gold standard is not a full monetary sovereign – but it keeps its own currency. A Eurozone member lacks both sovereignty and a currency. That makes it much more a type of inmate of a prison with no exit than would be the case under gold. Reply ↓ John k May 12, 2017 at 5:16 pm I fear it. Recessions prior to 1933 were depressions. GD was neither the longest or deepest in the previous century. Recession/ depression happened every 3.5 years.

And country size does not matter, if you can’t save the banks and depositors every few years you get routine chaos. During GD farmers were very near armed insurrection. Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef May 12, 2017 at 9:39 pm During the Great Depression, the government removed gold from the private sector. FDR should have distributed gold from Fort Knox.

We believe many current members of Congress will support this plan, and we expect that as the campaign becomes stronger, more and more members of Congress will endorse our platform. Reply ↓ Katharine May 12, 2017 at 12:55 pm But I don’t think Brand New Congress absolutely rules out existing members if they are sufficiently progressive. They’re not crazy enough to waste resources trying to replace someone sufficiently progressive to work with. Reply ↓ Vatch May 12, 2017 at 2:07 pm Well, I don’t know. But this part of their web site seems to imply that they don’t want incumbents. Maybe I’m wrong. https://brandnewcongress.org/plan Basically, we want to do what we have to do as a country and remove ‘politically impossible’ as a reason not to do it. It will take at least until 2020 to achieve all of that, but the first step is to achieve a majority in the House and win as many of the 33 seats up for re-election in the Senate as possible in 2018. Our plan to accomplish this is to recruit over 400 extraordinary ordinary Americans to challenge both Democrats and Republicans in congressional primary races across the country in order to replace almost all of Congress in one fell swoop. These will be people who have track records of integrity and service in their communities and who are not all career politicians — we’re looking for nurses, teachers, engineers, scientists, factory workers, and so on. They will represent not just all the various professions in our country (unlike our current Congress which represents mostly lawyers), but also be representative of our population’s demographics — more than half of them will be women and we will have just representation for people of color. Every candidate we recruit, regardless of party, will be a firm believer in the Brand New Congress platform and pledge to work to enact it once elected to office. Reply ↓ Lambert Strether Post authorMay 12, 2017 at 2:27 pm I don’t see Justice Democrats adopting this strategy at all.

In regional dialects the words for “eight” and “fortune” are also similar, e.g., Cantonese “baat3” and “faat3”. The word is also phonetically similar to the word for a hundred (百), alluding to greater wealth. Note as well, this particular symbol matches the mathematical symbol of infinity. While Chinese does have other words for luck, this full understanding of luck that includes the infinity concept marries into a Chinese understanding of this particular word. There is also a visual resemblance between two digits, “88”, and 囍, the “shuāng xĭ” (“double joy”), a popular decorative design composed of two stylized characters 喜 (“xĭ” meaning “joy” or “happiness”). The number 8 is viewed as such an auspicious number that even being assigned a number with several eights is considered very lucky. In 2003, A telephone number with all digits being eights was sold for CN¥2.33 million (approximately US$280,000) to Sichuan Airlines in Chengdu, China.[2] The opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics in Beijing began on 8/8/08 at 8 seconds and 8 minutes past 8 pm local time (UTC+08).[3] China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia and Singapore use the time zone UTC+08:00. A man in Hangzhou offered to sell his license plate reading A88888 for ¥1.12 million (roughly $164,000).[3] A Chinese man in Las Vegas purchased bulb #8 and #88 from the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign on 8/8/2008. The Petronas Twin Towers in Malaysia each have 88 floors. The minivan that GM makes for the Chinese market is called the Buick GL8, but the minivans it sold in other countries didn’t have that name. The Air Canada route from Shanghai to Toronto is Flight AC88. The KLM route from Hong Kong to Amsterdam is Flight KL888. The Etihad Airways route from Abu Dhabi to Beijing then onwards to Nagoya is Flight EY888. The United Airlines route from Beijing to San Francisco is Flight UA888, the route from Beijing to Newark is Flight UA88, and the route from Chengdu to San Francisco is Flight UA8. The Air Astana route from Beijing to Almaty is Flight KC888. The British Airways route from Chengdu to London is Flight BA88. One of Cathay Pacific’s flight numbers from Hong Kong to Vancouver and New York is CX888. Singapore Airlines reserves flight numbers beginning with the number 8 to routes in China. SriLankan Airlines reserves flight numbers beginning with the number 8 to routes in China. The US Treasury has sold 70,000 dollar bills with serial numbers that contain 4 eights.[4] Boeing delivered the 8,888th 737 to come off the production line to Xiamen Airlines. The airplane, a Next-Generation 737-800, features a special livery commemorating the airplane’s significance.[5] In Singapore, a breeder of rare Dragon fish (Asian Arowana) (which are “lucky fish” and being a rare species, are required to be microchipped), makes sure to use numbers with plenty of eights in their microchip tag numbers, and appears to reserve particular numbers especially rich in eights and sixes (e.g., 702088880006688) for particularly valuable specimens.[6][7] As part of grand opening promotions, a Commerce Bank branch in New York’s Chinatown raffled off safety deposit box No. 888. An “auspicious” numbering system was adopted by the developers of 39 Conduit Road Hong Kong, where the top floor was “88” – Chinese for double fortune. It is already common in Hong Kong for ~4th floors not to exist; there is no requirement by the Buildings Department for numbering other than that it being “made in a logical order.”[8] A total of 43 intermediate floor numbers are omitted from 39 Conduit Road: those missing include 14, 24, 34, 54, 64, all floors between 40 and 49; the floor number which follows 68 is 88. Similar to the common Western practice of using “9” for price points, it is common to see “8” being used in its place to achieve the same psychological effect. So for example menu prices like $58, $88 are frequently seen. You wouldn’t expect a socialist country to be so superstitious as to open the Olympics at a certain time.

Reply ↓ Katniss Everdeen May 12, 2017 at 9:37 am RE: Donald Trump has no idea what health insurance costs Vox I often ask Obamacare enrollees what they think would be a fair price for health insurance. Usually I hear something between $50 and $100 seems reasonable. The mental math going on here is that you have to pay something in order to get a plan that will cover doctor visits and hospital trips and prescription drugs. They know, from their experience, that health coverage is not as cheap as $15, and have more realistic assumptions than the one Trump makes in this answer. Is she seriously suggesting that $50 or $100 per month is more “realistic” than $15, or that obamacare defenders, who routinely ignore un-meetable deductibles and narrowing networks, do have “an idea what health insurance ‘costs’?” This is just pure piling-on, which seems to be preferable, these days, to making substantive, constructive suggestions that might actually address the issues.

Look at Pelosi, Feinstein, and Waters in recent days. 77, 83, and 78. You can see their anger over Trump, but they don’t seem to be as credible as they used to be. Pelosi unlike most Congress Critters has a real job in Speaker. She actually has to do stuff everyday. She works for 180 or so people in a way. I checked this yesterday, but if ballotpedia is up to date, Waters is serving on one committee the last few years. A 77 year old run that is serious and not Mike Gravel style (which was awesome) would be a terrible idea. Assume Bernie Sanders will not run for President unless he is suffering from old age’s effect on the mind. If Bernie had not been actively searching for people to run against Hillary, his eventual run might have been easy to dismiss as an old man. Given Sanders almost did it, it would be best if he wasn’t encouraged. He’s a Senator. Hes still a narcissist. Sanders age was a legitimate concern in the Spring of last year, just not next to a 69 year old. Hillary’s mother (how old was she? 147?) was alive in 2008 if I recall, and she seemed alert on tv. That alone probably diffused question about Hillary’s age this cycle. Reply ↓ marym May 12, 2017 at 12:11 pm It’s extremely important IMO to reference HR 676 and to keep concepts like public financing, public administration, and not-for-profit in the discussion. HR 676 addresses most of the mostly false or alarmist trolling of single payer, for example. in today’s Health Affairs “Premium Support” post, the claim that it would raise taxes (without analyzing the kinds of taxes or savings on out-of-pocket costs, or claiming it wouldn’t be as good as employer based coverage). In addition HR 676 has provisions for salary continuation and priority job placement for insurance company workers; migration of private provider entities to strictly public or non-profit; and price negotiation. All are much better grounds for discussion than just a reference to single payer. Sanders has introduced a bill in the past that was similar to HR 676, but with some differences. One was that it was a state-by-state plan, not a national plan. I think during the presidential campaign he may have been persuaded to change his recommendation to a national plan. Reply ↓ Elizabeth Burton May 12, 2017 at 3:32 pm My thoughts on Bernie’s wanting his own bill in the Senate is that having two provides more wiggle room. It also keeps the opposition having to expend time, effort, and money attacking two targets, which might not be a bad thing. Finally, given the ratios of GOP to Dems in both houses, he may be thinking that if 676 gets shot down in flames, there’s still a chance of finding enough courageous moderate Republicans fearful of losing their seats to help support it.

Holder Jr. and directed his federal prosecutors Thursday to charge defendants with the most serious, provable crimes carrying the most severe penalties. The Holder memo, issued in August 2013, instructed his prosecutors to avoid charging certain defendants with drug offenses that would trigger long mandatory minimum sentences. Defendants who met a set of criteria such as not belonging to a large-scale drug trafficking organization, gang or cartel, qualified for lesser charges — and in turn less prison time — under Holder’s policy. But Sessions’s new charging policy, outlined in a two-page memo and sent to more than 5,000 assistant U.S. attorneys across the country and all assistant attorneys general in Washington, orders prosecutors to “charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense” and rescinds Holder’s policy immediately. http://tinyurl.com/n3j57lh What a horror: fill the Gulag to bursting; bust up families; ruin lives — all to act out Ku Klux Jeff’s medieval fanaticism regarding forbidden substances.

Some cock-ups are inevitable for a completely new party, of course, but these mistakes are bound to have an impact on Macron’s image: he has so far been uncritically presented by the media as a kind of boy-wonder savior of the nation. The interesting point is Bayrou though. There was a lot of speculation at the time of his declaration of support for Macron about what he was getting in exchange. As of today, it looks like nothing at all. Had Bayrou run in the first round, he might well have peeled off enough of Macron’s support to stop the young chap getting into round two.

Also that they were only just now hiring people. The administration isn’t the only Beltway institution with empty seats, apparently. Obama was a real neutron bomb for the party….

Somehow, by disregarding that advice, owning a few shares in the company one slaves for will stop jobs from being shipped overseas? Does he believe the government should nationalize banks or drug companies? Reply ↓ jrs May 12, 2017 at 12:59 pm There is a difference between owning a few shares and ownership. Employee ownership would be full ownership. It’s true employee stock plans might be just a few token shares (which may or may not be a good investment for an employee, but have absolutely nothing to do with ownership and control). So equating employee ownership with ESOP, as these proposals might, doesn’t seem to make sense. Nationalizing banks and drug companies isn’t even designed to address the same issue that employee ownership is, which is working conditions, not the whole of every possible thing that might be wrong with the economic system (including externalities), but primarily the workers powerlessness in this economic system. Something nationalizing banks and drug companies might not do (they still might be terrible places to work afterall). It’s true worker owned businesses are a very small part of the economy, which is a decent reason for some skepticism IMO. But maybe favorable bills could help as long as they aren’t equivocating between owning a few shares and real daily control over the business. Because worker owned businesses do I think need some government help to become a larger share of the economy. Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef May 12, 2017 at 1:41 pm I ask the questions because the economy is dominated by big corporations. Is it possible for workers to have full ownership of Apple, Amazon or Chase bank by buying shares themselves? It’s good the corner pizza place is employee owned and I will do business there. The real impact is with the big companies, who will send jobs overseas. If workers had the money, why hadn’t they bought up Amazon already? I can see a socialist or communist government nationalize a humongous corporation and turn it over to the workers. Reply ↓ Jeff W May 12, 2017 at 7:49 pm “It’s true worker owned businesses are a very small part of the economy…” In the US, worker-owned businesses have very little support, politically or financially. In Italy, by contrast, the Marcora Law allows a group of ten unemployed workers to receive a lump sum of money as capital for a cooperative, instead of the monthly payments they could receive as individuals. As a result, two out of every three people in the Emilia Romagna region of northern Italy belong to worker coops which produce about one-third of that region’s GDP. (I’m not sure what to make of the fact that two-thirds of the workers produce one-third of the GDP.)

The short version — [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1fqRigFtTw]. Chomsky the linguistics professor has been speaking to punctuate his concepts of the innate capabilities of the human cognition coupled with the theme how innate capabilities are innate limitations on what we can truly know and understand. There are several hour plus lectures on youtube exploring these themes and calling attention to recent work substantiating what is one of Chomsky’s life works. I haven’t been able to parse it all yet but what I have grasped is extremely intriguing — relating to questions of consciousness, AI, what makes us human and how remarkably recent and homogeneous humankind is relative to other creatures. “What happened in the origin of human consciousness?” [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.b.10041/full] “The precedence of syntax in the rapid emergence of human language in evolution as defined by the integration hypothesis” [https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00271] “Language as a Critical Factor in the Emergence of Human Cognition” [http://www.humanamente.eu/PDF/Issue27_Papers_Tattersall.pdf] Reply ↓ Susan the other May 12, 2017 at 1:48 pm I really enjoyed that article/research too. And yes, reading it was like incipient brain damage – because I didn’t have the words! But I got the drift. I suspect the origin of human consciousness is just finding the right word ;-). When it said that “ancestries (variations in genes) fluctuated but remained distinct long enough to correlate with language” I thought that was the coolest sentence I had almost ever read. And the conclusion to all those correlations was to point out that evolution of the genome is kinda socio-cultural. So which came first, the gene variation or the word? Hmmm.

The speech that Obama gave after getting the 2017 “Profiles in Courage” prize from the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation last Sunday – that’s what. The Venality of Hope In his ponderous address, Obama showed that his aptitude for grandiose, fake-progressive oratory has not been extinguished by dips with Richard Branson in the cool Caribbean (more on that below). Obama’s brash Orwellian chutzpah was on grand display. He praised freshly elected Congresspersons for having the “political courage” to “save the financial system…even when it was unpopular” in 2009. Yes, these dauntless peoples’ representatives had the epic valor required to boldly defy public opinion by expanding a major taxpayer bailout to the well-heeled Wall Street parasites who crashed the national and global economy through their selfish and reckless behavior –opulent bloodsuckers who grant lucrative salaries, speaking fees, and other neoliberal disbursements to not-so public officials who do their bidding while “serving” (the Few) in government. Ask Obama. Ex-prez “O” has been spotted kiteboarding with Branson, the British billionaire airline mogul, who is leading the charge for the privatization of the United Kingdom’s National Health Service. Obama’s been seen boating in the Pacific with Oprah Winfrey, Tom Hanks, and Bruce Springsteen on a $300 million luxury yacht owned by recording mogul billionaire David Geffen. The Obamas reached an eight-figure publishing deal ($65 million) for his-and-her memoirs on their years in the White House. And Obama will speak for $400,000 at a Wall Street health care conference in September, hosted by Cantor Fitzgerald LP. Nothing says, “show me the money” like POTUS on your resume.

Reply ↓ lyman alpha blob May 12, 2017 at 2:08 pm I was wondering what he was getting at there. So much nonsense it’s hard to keep track of what’s true but IIRC, the reason they defenestrated Flynn was because he claimed one thing and then the spooks came out and said that didn’t match what he said on the recording they had. (Of course the fact that the spooks are recording everything anyone in DC says is just taken for granted, but that’s another issue). Is he implying that when Comey starts chirping, he has recordings that might contradict what Comey says? Very odd, much like that “I know you told me three times I wasn’t under investigation but you’re fired anyway” line he threw at him. Could be he’s crazy like a fox but judging by other comments and actions he’s made, it seems like that would be giving credit where it isn’t remotely due. Reply ↓ fresno dan May 12, 2017 at 2:42 pm lyman alpha blob May 12, 2017 at 2:08 pm Apparently, if it is not outright bribery, what exactly did Flynn do wrong? The non reporting of foreign contacts is obviously wrong and something Flynn is guilty of, but I don’t its all that big a deal. Proving actual “collusion” and “conspiracy” I think would not be possible. I think the only person who can really harm Trump is Trump….and I think Trump is up to the task. I think this is where Trump’s sense of grievance and vainglorious self image can do Trump real harm. One gets the impression that the blob thinks DISCUSSING sanctions – with Russians – before Trump was inaugurated is a crime – something I do not believe is true (I would appreciate if anyone can speak on this authoritatively). But if Trump believes – from watching TV – that the kerfuffle over sanctions is something he could never own up to, I could see Trump denying that he ever was involved. Does Trump HAVE tapes??? Trump is getting himself ever deeper into subpoena land – and Trump’s thoughtless answers that he provides that are inconsistent will be to people and institutions that will have the means to take actions much graver than yammering about 2 scoops of ice cream on cable TVee….

I’ve only been to a hospital once in my life (knock wood) for ligament surgery and subsequent physio. Again, no paperwork and no hassle. The cost at origin was zero. No paperwork, no deductibles, no “interpretation” of covered procedures and on and on. And the service has always been excellent and hassle free. The NHS is fully audited.

So, we have a bunch of miscreants peopling websites passing bullshit off as knowledge and being seconded by a giant cadre of those unwilling to ever consider much of anything. I wish I could say that such nonsense is restricted to right wings sites, but the supposedly liberal sites are not much better. Why is it so hard to actually think? I don’t get it.

I think lack of trust leads to inequality, not the other way around (or maybe they reinforce each other, but I think lack of trust comes first). In that case, what causes lack of trust? Trust but verify. If you verify, you don’t need trust. If everything is written down and verified, you don’t need trust. When you are Robin Hood and men in tights, you have to be able to trust each other. In simpler times, there is more trust. When the other guys are too learned, too educated, you have to be careful…well, you have to respect them…their chess moves…Not simpler times, less trust…but more smart men. Reply ↓ Jeff W May 12, 2017 at 9:35 pm I’m not sure that lack of trust leads to inequality but inequality can leads to lack of trust in the following way: Person A has more money, time, resources than person B. In given situation, A can “spend more” to arrange the contingencies so that the outcome favors A (or is adverse to B) than he might otherwise if A and B were on an equal footing. So, for example, the Koch brothers can spend more to get the outcomes they favor than you (presumably) or I can. They can “buy outcomes” where, ostensibly, the outcome is something that is determined by that is not subject to buying, i.e., one person/one vote. I’m not so sure, in a theoretical sense, you need to actually see something like the influence that the Koch brothers have on affecting outcomes for trust to be eroded. It might be that just the presence of the inequality (in the absence of some countervailing force, like publicly-financed campaigns) is enough to erode trust. Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef May 12, 2017 at 9:46 pm Assuming lack trust occurs first before inequality, your example shows the subsequent ‘they reinforce each other.’ I think lack of trust occurs before when people become apathetic, stop caring for people in general. It becomes easier to take advantage of others. That leads to concentration of wealth and inequality. Then comes the reinforcing each other part.

The first commercial flight of the ERJ 145 occurred on April 6, 1997, with U.S. airline Continental Express. “The ERJ 145 marked Embraer’s commercial renaissance, paving the way for the development of new programs, such as the E-Jets, which moved the Company into the lead of the commercial jet market for up to 130-seat aircraft,” said Paulo Cesar de Souza e Silva, Embraer President & CEO. “Personally, I have a great affection for the program, which brought me to Embraer. I participated in practically all the jet’s sales campaigns as Vice President of Customer Financing.” The ERJ 145 family of jets consists of the ERJ 145 (50 seats), the ERJ 135 (37 seats), the ERJ 140 (44 seats) and the ERJ 145 XR (long-range 145 version). Since its entry into operation, the ERJ 145 family has accumulated more than 27 million flight hours and almost 730 million passengers transported, being used by more than 120 operators. Over the last seven years, the ERJ’s global customer base has almost doubled, from 39 operators, in 2010, to 70, today. During the same period, the application and use of ERJ models has been growing in emerging markets, such as Africa, where the ERJ fleet has increased from 16 units in 2010 to almost 60 jets in 2017. Robust and with excellent operating history, the ERJ platform is a success in commercial aviation, with almost 900 units delivered, having applications in the business aviation market, with the Legacy 600 and Legacy 650 jets, as well as in defense, such as the AEW&C, Multi-Intel and maritime patrol for the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) segment. In total, more than 1,200 aircraft based on the ERJ 145 platform have already been delivered worldwide, making the ERJ program one of the most successful in the aircraft industry.

The FTC ultimately says that the case should proceed (via CNET): “Qualcomm uses its monopoly power to make [handset manufacturers] pay a royalty overcharge — a tax — when buying modem chips from its competitors,” the FTC filing reads. “Qualcomm further hampers those competitors by denying them the licenses it promised would be available on FRAND terms during standard- setting. And Qualcomm foreclosed its competitors from selling to a uniquely important customer, Apple, for half a decade using exclusive contracts.” Furthermore, several other companies have filed amicus briefs in support of the FTC. Most notably, Samsung on Friday expressed its support for the FTC’s statement, saying that the case should proceed and that it has also suffered from and been harmed by Qualcomm’s practices. Samsung accuses Qualcomm of refusing to “license its patents on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms.” Samsung goes on to explain that these actions prohibit it from making and selling its own licensed chipsets: “Because Qualcomm does not license [chipset] competitors, handset manufacturers have no choice but to accept Qualcomm’s onerous terms,” Samsung said. “Qualcomm directly excludes competitors and harms competition.” Additionally, Intel has also filed an amicus brief in support of the FTC, saying that Qualcomm has “driven nearly all of its competitors out of the premium LTE chipset market.” Earlier this month, it was reported that Qualcomm was seeking an iPhone import ban in the United States as Apple and its suppliers withhold some $1 billion in royalty payments.

Nevertheless, with more than 8,000 company-operated stores in the U.S., the move by Starbucks will create a substantial network and infrastructure for wireless charging in the hospitality sector and lead to shipments of more than 100,000 Powermat wireless chargers, according to IHS research. There are now three wireless charging consortiums vying for dominance in the market, which has enormous potential. The combined global market for wireless power receivers and transmitters is expected to rise to 1.7 billion unit shipments in 2023, up from about 25 million last year, according to IHS. Powermat wireless charging stations in a Starbucks cafe. According to IHS, 80% of consumers want wireless charging in public places, so the move by Starbucks was expected. Starbucks, which has been testing wireless charging in San Francisco and Boston, will deploy 'Powermat Spots' in designated areas on tables and counters where customers can place their compatible device to charge wirelessly. Customers can find enabled locations on Powermat's website. "From Wi-Fi and the in-store Starbucks Digital Network to mobile payment and digital music downloads, we have always tried to anticipate our customers' needs early in the adoption curve and provide a world-class solution," Adam Brotman, chief digital officer at Starbucks, said in a statement. Duracell Powermat is a member of the Power Matters Alliance (PMA), one of the three consortiums rolling out products. The PMA earlier this year announced a deal to share technologies with the Alliance For Wireless Power (A4WP). That partnership pitted the two against the largest of the industry groups, the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC), which touts the Qi (pronounced "chee") wireless charging specification. Of the 20 million consumer devices estimated to have shipped in 2013 with wireless charging capabilities, nearly all were built with the Qi specification, according to IHS. The majority of the Qi technology was built into devices such as the Google Nexus 4 and 5 smartphones, Google's Nexus 7 second-generation tablet and a number of models in Nokia's Lumia smart phone range. An example of Texas Instrument's wireless charging coil and chip technology that adheres to the Qi specification. The device can be much smaller and would be the electrical receiver in a mobile device. "These devices will not be compatible with the wireless chargers due to be installed in Starbucks stores," said Ryan Sanderson, IHS's associate director of Power Supply & Storage Components. Still, devices that come native with the PMA wireless charging being installed in Starbucks stores are beginning to emerge, Sanderson said. Since May, Sprint and Virgin Mobile US have both been offering the Kyocera Hydro Vibe, a low-end smartphone, with PMA wireless charging built in. AT&T now offers an upgrade for the Samsung Galaxy S5, which supports the PMA specification, and an add-on case for the Apple iPhone is also available from Duracell Powermat. "The number of consumer devices in circulation that are compatible with Powermat's PMA compared with those built to the longer established Qi specification is, however, still minimal," Sanderson said. Along with Starbucks coffee shops, McDonald's has also rolled out Powermat pilots in restaurants. The conflicting and competing standards continue to create uncertainty for mobile device manufacturers looking to adopt wireless charging. So what's the difference? There are two types of wireless charging -- loosely coupled magnetic resonance and tightly-coupled inductive charging. Both are based on the same science of creating a magnetic field through which power can be transferred between devices using the same frequency. The WPC's Qi standard enables inductive or pad-style charging, and the group is working on a specification for short-distance (1.5cm or less) magnetic resonance charging. The PMA also champions a magnetic inductive wireless charging technology that requires a more tightly coupled link between the charger and device. In addition, the PMA developed an open network API for network services management. So, for instance, Starbucks would be able to identify mobile devices charging in its cafes and gather usage pattners or target users with marketing and advertising. "The open network API is certainly a valuable part of PMA's offering. It allows for a lot of flexibility and future development," Sanderson said. In contrast, the A4WP-developed "Rezence" magnetic resonant wireless charging spec allows for a loosely coupled power transfer -- meaning multiple devices can be placed on a charging pad and moved around with little affect to the charge. The A4WP and the PMA have agreed to share each other's specifications so they can offer both types wireless of charging, but the two technologies are still independent. The multi-mode charging designs can provide interoperability for future designs, but at an added cost, according to Sanderson. Mark Hunsicker, senior director of product management at Qualcomm, demonstrates Rezence wireless charging in an IKEA coffee table. "A developer who wishes to produce something compatible to both standards needs to be a member of both associations, so they both exist very much as single entities still," Sanderson said. "Producing something compatible with both will cost more and provides a reasonable challenge (multiple antennas, separate shielding etc.)." All three wireless charging consortiums have massive backing from large mobile device manufacturers and consumer product brands. The Qi specification, however, has the greatest industry support. More than 200 companies, among them a veritable who's who of electronics, such as LG Electronics, Sony, Nokia and Verizon Wireless. By comparison, the A4WP now has 100 members, including Broadcom, Delphi, Fairchild Semiconductor, Haier, Intel, LG Electronics, Qualcomm, Samsung Electronics, SanDisk, TDK and Texas Instruments. The PMA has 72 members. Among the tech firms that haven't weighed in one way or the other on wireless charging is Apple. Long-term, the added premium that multi-standard wireless charging demands is unlikely to allow for mass adoption, said Sanderson, adding that a single mode solution will be required to drive costs down.

The charging stations from Aircharge are based on the Qi (pronounced "chee") wireless standard, which is backed by the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC). Of the 20 million consumer devices estimated to have shipped in 2013 with wireless charging capabilities, nearly all were built with the Qi specification, said market research firm IHS. According to IHS, 80% of consumers want wireless charging in public places. Prior to this latest announcement, only nine McDonalds restaurants in Hannover, Germany had installed Qi chargers in its tables. "This is a major step for McDonalds, but in a way, they are catching up with other restaurants across the world who have already deployed Qi in their establishments, " said John Perzow, vice president of market development for the WPC. Other restaurants, such as Kitchen 67, based in Michigan, and the Kanga Café, Balzacs Coffee Bar, Sense Appeal and Thor -- all in Toronto -- have also installed Qi-standard wireless charging. The expanded rollout comes after a successful initial market test between Aircharge and McDonald. The largest rollout of wireless charging technology has been at Starbucks, where last year the coffee shop conglomerate announced a nationwide rollout. Starbucks, which like McDonald's spent months testing the technology in city locations, is deploying Duracell Powermat chargers. Duracell 'Powermat Spots' are being placed in designated areas on tables and counters where customers can place their devices to charge wirelessly. Duracell Powermat is a member of the Power Matters Alliance (PMA), one of the three consortiums rolling out products. The PMA last year also announced a deal to share technologies with the third consortium, the Alliance For Wireless Power (A4WP). Earlier this week, the PMA and A4WP announced a merger that pits them squarely against the WPA. The A4WP is backed by more than 140 companies, including Intel and Samsung Electronics, and the PMA has 70-members that include ATT on its board. The WPA consortium, however, is the largest; it has 217 members that include Philips, Qualcomm and Nokia.

Baca, Henry Y. Huang and Matthew J. Rizzolo Ropes & Gray LLP Your LinkedIn Connections at Firm The pending Supreme Court case of Impression Products v. Lexmark International could affect what companies and consumers do with products they buy, based on the doctrine of patent exhaustion.� Following oral argument on March 21, three attorneys from Ropes & Gray's intellectual property practices discuss the background of the case and potential consequences.� Hear commentary from Megan Baca, a partner in IP transactions, and Matt Rizzolo and Henry Huang from the firm's IP litigation practice. Click here to listen to the podcast Transcript: Hello, I'm Matt Rizzolo, IP litigation counsel in the Washington, DC office of Ropes & Gray.� Today I'm joined by my colleagues Megan Baca and Henry Huang.� Megan is a partner in Ropes & Gray's intellectual property and technology transactions practice group, and is resident in the firm's Silicon Valley office.� Henry is an IP litigation associate at Ropes & Gray, also in the Silicon Valley office, and is a former district court and Federal Circuit clerk. In today's special bicoastal edition of our Supreme Court podcast, we're going to talk about a Supreme Court case that may have an effect on what consumers can do with products that they buy�the pending case of Impression Products v. Lexmark International, which was argued on March 21.� Henry, I'll begin with you�what's this case about? Henry: This case is about patent exhaustion, which deals with the rules about what happens to patented products after they are sold.� Generally, in patent law, after a company sells a patented product, it can't control what customers do with that product after buying it.� That means that the patent owner has "exhausted" its rights in the patented product.� So as the customer, you can re-sell the product or give it away, and you can break it, throw it away, or use it for an entirely different purpose.� Matt: I promise that I will do my best today to avoid any bad puns about being exhausted.� Patent exhaustion is also sometimes called the "first sale" doctrine, isn't it? Henry: Yes, that's right.� Here, what were being sold were patented printer cartridges.� Lexmark makes and sells toner cartridges under two different sales programs.� Under the regular program, you can buy a cartridge at full price, without any restrictions at all�once you buy it, you can sell it to other people, re-use it, re-fill it, etc.� But under Lexmark's "Return Program," a customer is able to buy the cartridges at about a 20% discount, but in exchange, has to agree not to re-use them or re-sell them to anyone else.� Lexmark also puts chips in their cartridges to prevent people from re-filling them.� Matt: So who is Impression Products?� How did they become involved?� Henry: Impression Products is a small company in West Virginia who makes and sells aftermarket cartridges for dozens of different printers and copiers.� As part of their business, Impression purchases used Lexmark cartridges from Lexmark's customers and then refurbishes, re-fills, and re-sells these cartridges to new customers.� Lexmark sued Impression for patent infringement, but Impression has argued that Lexmark's patent rights were exhausted when Lexmark first sold these cartridges, so Lexmark cannot now use patent law to restrict what customers do with the printer cartridges. Matt: Megan, how does a case about printer cartridges affect companies and consumers? Megan: The outcome of this case could be important for the public because it affects what people can do with the products they buy.� For companies, the issue is whether they can buy and re-sell products without worrying about patent infringement.� This involves products sold both in the United States and in other countries.� For individual consumers like the three of us, there isn't as much risk because companies generally don't sue end users for patent infringement�that's generally bad business.� For example, Lexmark didn't choose to sue its own customers for selling the spent cartridges to Impression Products.� But for end users, if patent owners can keep greater control over their products, it's possible that prices for certain goods could be higher. Matt: I imagine that there are probably many companies who use a business model similar to Impression's in other industries who are watching this case closely, too. Megan: Absolutely. This case will impact all manner of businesses that sell articles into a supply chain, where the seller would like to control the use of its article farther downstream in the supply chain � such as by limiting resale in undesired markets, restricting sales to competitors, or placing other restrictions on the use of the article. Matt: Now, turning to the specific issues that were presented to the Supreme Court here, I understand there are two questions involving exhaustion � one being domestic, within the United States, and one foreign, outside the country.� What is the issue with respect to exhaustion for sales within the United States? Megan: The first question presented at the Supreme Court is just about so-called "conditional sales," meaning sales with restrictions on customers, in this country.� Those are like Lexmark's Return Program sales for printer cartridges in the U.S.� An important point about this issue is that exhaustion has to be considered together with other unlawful restrictions in patent law.� Under antitrust law, there are other doctrines that prevent patent owners from expanding their patent rights.� For example, a patent owner can't engage in "tying," which is forcing their customers to buy related products.� That would be like Lexmark forcing its printer cartridge customers to buy all their printer paper from Lexmark, too. Matt: Right, and patent exhaustion involves only post-sale restrictions that are otherwise lawful under those antitrust rules.� What about the second issue involving foreign sales? Henry: The foreign exhaustion issue is simply about whether selling products in other countries also exhausts patent rights in the U.S.� So when Lexmark sells their printer cartridges in Germany, for example, does that mean German customers can import those cartridges back into the United States without worrying about infringement?� This is also an interesting issue because it implicates extraterritoriality in U.S. patent law.� Generally, U.S. patent law applies only in this country, with some limited exceptions. Matt: Now, the two sides in this case also have different views about the legal source of the patent exhaustion doctrine in the first place.� What's the difference there? Megan: That's an important issue, too.� The disagreement is whether exhaustion comes from common law, or from the federal patent infringement statute.� Impression Products and its supporters claim that patent exhaustion is based on court-made common law.� According to historical sources (dating back as far as 1628), courts have generally held that there can be no post-sale restrictions on personal property, so that after you buy a product, you can do whatever you want with it.� Lexmark disagrees�it looks to the infringement statute, 35 U.S.C. ��271(a), which prevents others from making, using, or selling a patented product � quote � "without authority."� According to Lexmark, it's those words "without authority" that cover patent exhaustion.� Under Lexmark's view, the common-law tradition does not apply here, and patent owners can give as many or as few of their rights to their customers as they want, in the form of post-sale restrictions. Matt: This isn't the first time the Supreme Court has addressed the issue of exhaustion with respect to IP rights in the last few years, is it?� It seems like there also may be some possible overlap with copyright law here. Henry: That's right�in 2013, the Supreme Court decided a case called Kirtsaeng, which involved a student from Thailand buying copyrighted textbooks in Thailand and then selling them for a profit here in the U.S.� The Supreme Court said that the publisher exhausted its copyright protections when it sold the textbooks in Thailand, even though it included notices saying that the books were for use only in certain countries.� So the question here, is why should patents be treated any differently?� Also, the Supreme Court has made some broad statements about the relationship between copyright and patents.� For example, in the recently decided the SCA Hygiene case, which dealt with the doctrine of laches, they held that the same principles applied in both the copyright and patent context.� The issue of how analogous the copyright and patent laws are in the exhaustion context came up repeatedly during the oral arguments in the Lexmark case. Matt: Megan, as a transactional lawyer, you deal with IP licenses and IP agreements every day.� Why can't patent owners simply use contracts to enforce post-sale restrictions instead of having to try to raise patent infringement claims? Megan: That's an issue that came up at the Supreme Court.� Some parties argue that contracts are exactly what patent owners should use, instead of trying to extend their so-called monopoly rights.� But the patent owners say that contract law won't work well � even if the contractual obligation is passed down through contract � because the patent owners are not in privity with downstream customers.� So for example, if I buy a printer cartridge from Impression, and I don't have a contract with Lexmark, Lexmark can't sue me for breach of contract.� And even if companies use contracts, such as shrink wrap agreements or click through agreements, there are still questions about what constitutes proper notice to consumers. Matt: And as we mentioned earlier, for a number of reasons patent owners probably don't want to sue their own customers for breach of contract.� Henry, this is a case that received a lot of attention from a diverse group of interested parties.� Who seemed to take an interest in this case? Henry: There were a lot of amicus briefs filed.� The list includes technology companies like Intel and Qualcomm, groups of law professors, and public interest groups.� As Megan noted, many companies and industries could be affected by exhaustion.� Retailers like Costco also filed a brief because they're concerned about patented products in their complex supply chains.� Another major group of companies was composed of medical device and pharmaceutical companies.� Those companies of course want keep control of their products, but they also argued that stronger patent rights allow them to make sure their medical products and drugs are used safely. Matt: Oral argument was held on March 21.� Did the Justices give an indication of how they're going to decide this case? Henry: The bench was actually pretty cold, and did not ask a lot of questions.� Justice Breyer seemed to accept the argument that the principle of "no alienation"�that is, no restrictions on re-selling property�has been established for hundreds of years, which seems to indicate a vote for Impression.� Justice Alito, on the other hand seemed skeptical about the issue of foreign exhaustion because U.S. patent law generally doesn't apply overseas, which would favor Lexmark, at least on the foreign exhaustion issue.� Overall, other commentators are expecting a split decision towards the end of the current term in June.� It's worth noting that the last time the Court considered IP exhaustion, in the Kirtsaeng case we just discussed, the Court was divided 6-3. Matt: Well, I guess now we play the waiting game for the Court's decision.� Unfortunately, that is all the time we have today�thank you both for joining me.� We'll get together to do a follow-up podcast after the Court rules.� And thank you for listening to this Supreme Court podcast.� Please visit our Capital Insights page for more news and analysis on noteworthy issues arising out of Washington, D.C.

Chris Player (Good Gear Guide) 25 February, 2016 11:37 - - - - print email Distributors ACA Pacific Alloys Australasian PC Distributors (APCD) Avnet Technology Solutions Bluechip Infotech BMS Technology CertaOne Dicker Data Dynamic Supplies Impact Systems Technology Ingram Micro Australia Leader Computers Multimedia Technology Samsung Communications Synnex Thousand Hands Technologies (formerly Hemisphere Technologies) Topstar Computer International Westcon – Comstor Wholesale IT XiT Distribution Vendors F-Secure Huawei Comments The Micro Bit View all images The Micro Bit Mobile World Congress is the go to event for all things mobile. While it has a huge focus on enterprise and business to business tech, it is still the go to place for consumer releases from all the big brands, excluding Apple which does not participate. It is also one of the best places to see concepts from vendors like Samsung, Sony and LG to name just a few. After two days of running around the enormous show floor (and not seeing even close to all that was on display), we have compiled a small list of cool products and concepts you may not have heard of. The BBC's Micro Bit The BBC has developed a mini-computer, the Micro Bit, designed to run code that will let programmers display text and patterns on its LEDs and make use of its built-in sensors and buttons to build simple games and other programs. Sounds like a gimmick? you haven’t heard the coolest part, the broadcaster is going to put one of these into the hands of every year seven child in Britain to encourage coding at an early age. The BBC announced the plan back in March 2015, but was at MWC in the Samsung booth to show off the new app for the vendor’s smartphones that can work with the device. The plan is that kids can ‘code on the go’ and create features like a selfie remote button or dice-like random number generator. An amazing concept to address what will soon be a huge shortage of engineering talent for the workforce of the future. Monster GODJ Monster has built a great little unit for ametur dj/producers looking for a portable device to mix tunes and make music on the go. The GODJ is tiny for a device of its type, measuring 250 x 66 mm. It has built in fader with three curve settings, sound effects, sample trigger and even a guitar mode that lets you play chords or use preset notes. The Monster GODJ Read more: The best smartphones of 2015: What a year for comebacks It has a file manager that supports MP3, WAV and 96kHz audio files. It also records in WAV and high resolution. Internal memory gives 2GB for music and 1GB for recording. The unit also supports an SD card for up to 2TB of additional storage and will sync with your PC so you can pull tracks straight from your music library. Sadly. it is not yet available in Australia. F-Secure Sense Finnish IT security company, F-Secure, has built a sleek looking little unit designed to eliminate the need for multiple anti-virus licences. It is designed to connect to your router and protect every device on your network from PCs to IoT devices like Smart TV’s that can’t run on-board security software. It will protect your devices in the home and outside provided you install the Sense App. F-Secure's Sense Read more ​The PS4 is the fastest selling console in Sony’s history Given the increase in connected devices, products like the Sense (and BitDefender’s Box), may become the default way we secure ourselves against cyber crooks in the future. F-Secure said it is working on adding a VPN feature to the device for even greater protection. No release date has been given for Australia. Sony Xperia Ear Sony used its impressive booth to display a number of impressive new products and concepts but the one that stood out for us was the Xperia Ear. It’s an earpiece with bluetooth connection you are supposed to wear all day and stop you constantly looking down at your phone to check email alerts, texts and social media updates. The Sony Xpreia Ear Read more Sony Xperia Z5 Compact review: In a league of its own The Ear will give you audio prompts to let you know if you have a new message, email or call. With so many of us tethered to our devices, this is Sony’s attempt to give you some of your life back without you feeling that you are missing out on all the wonderful things the connected world has to offer. Alcatel Plus 10 2-in-1s are by no means a new thing but the Alcatel Plus 10 caught our eye because it can double as a Wi-Fi hotspot for up to 15 devices including itself. It runs Windows 10, has a 10-inch IPS 1280×800 display and an Intel quad-core processor. The Alcatel Plus 10 The most impressive thing about this neat little unit is the base unit that, with its sim slot, will let you hotspot up to 15 devices without the tablet connected. Alcatel said the 8,410mAh battery should give you around eight hours of usage to keep you hotspotting to your heart’s content.

No sooner have you spied the latest handset, then there's anticipation of something else, the next big thing. We've rounded up the best smartphones for 2017, those we consider to be the best across all platforms, and we've regularly updated that list as the smartphone world has evolved. You can find those in our Best smartphones 2017: The best phones available to buy today feature. If your budget is a little smaller, there is also our Best budget smartphones 2017: The best phones available to buy for under £250. Here we're looking at those phones that haven't yet launched, the best upcoming phones for 2017. We'll be updating this list on a regular basis, with those device rumours we think are credible and exciting, and devices just announced but yet to hit the shelves. Best upcoming phones 2017 Before we dive into the detail, here are some of the anticipated upcoming handsets for 2017: HTC U 11/HTC Ocean Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Motorola Moto X4 Apple iPhone 8 Apple iPhone 8 Plus OnePlus 5 Google Pixel 2 @evleaks HTC Ocean / HTC U 11 HTC's next flagship handset is thought to be going under the name of HTC U 11, previously known as HTC Ocean. HTC launched its first handsets for 2017 in the form of the U Play and U Ultra, but at the time said this wasn't the flagship and there was more to come. It's now thought this more will be coming on 16 May 2017 after the Taiwanese company sent out a save the date to press. The new device is rumoured to offer new methods of interaction, with suggestions of a touch-sensitive frame called Edge Sense, and HTC's social campaign promoting squeeze. According to the speculation, the HTC U 11 will have a 5.5-inch Quad HD display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset, a 12-megapixel rear camera, 16-megapixel front-facing camera, 64GB or 128GB of internal storage, microSD card slot, Android 7.1 Nougat and HTC's own Sense 9 UI. HTC U 11 'Ocean': Everything you need to know Slashleaks Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Sure, the Note 7 didn't go so well, but it seems that the family isn't dead: the Note 7 is getting refurbished and released as the Note 7R in some territories and it looks like Samsung still has plans for the next model, the Note 8. This was confirmed by Samsung soon after the Note 7 failed, suggesting an upgrade programme to the new model when it launches.  That launch is expected to be some time in August or September, with IFA 2017 getting a recent suggestion. There's very little detail to go on in terms of what to expect, but we'd expect the S Pen to come back, we'd expect software upgrades and there's talk of the introduction of a dual camera system. Exactly how large the Note 8 might be if it adopts the 18.5:9 aspect display like the Galaxy S8, we just don't know. Samsung Galaxy Note 8: What's the story so far? Pocket-lint Motorola Moto X4 Motorola, under the stewardship of Lenovo, is planning to update the Moto X in 2017. Previously called Moto X (2017), it now has some branding in the form of Moto X4. We're expecting a mid-range handset, which will likely mean a metal body and more powerful hardware, with screen sizes somewhere around 5.5 inches.  There's no knowing if Moto will include compatibility with the Moto Mods of Moto Z 2016, with early leaks suggesting an entirely different design. Exactly how Motorola will keep distinction between E, G, X and Z remains to be seen, but there's a growing body of evidence to suggest the Moto X4 is coming.  Pocket-lint Apple iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus The iPhone 8 is reported to shake things up completely when it appears later this year. The iPhone 7, surprisingly, didn't make a huge change over the iPhone 6S, but the biggest hint at what to expect from the iPhone 8 might have come from Apple Watch. With the release of the Series 2 device, Apple introduced a ceramic version. This, paired with the jet black colouring for the iPhone 7, might point to future changes in materials for the iPhone 8. Some are suggesting that the iPhone 8 will be mostly glass and introduce wireless charging, but there's expected to be a special edition ceramic version too. There have also been talks of an OLED curved display for the iPhone 8, as well as a rear mounted fingerprint sensor. Taking it further, it's suggested that there will be an iPhone 7S and 7S Plus too, alongside this roaring iPhone 8, with the iPhone 8 being the more premium of the three. Apple iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus: What's the story so far? Pocket-lint OnePlus 5 Wait, what? No, you're not going mad. There's a rumour that OnePlus will be skipping the 4 number and heading straight to OnePlus 5. The OnePlus 5 could land with a glass or ceramic body, moving on from the OnePlus 3T to present something a little different. It wouldn't be the first time that OnePlus has used something different, as it did in the OnePlus X. A 5.3-inch display might meet a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset for loads of power. This could all be heading your way in May or June. OnePlus 5: What's the story so far? Pocket-lint Google Pixel 2 The Google Pixel has received great acclaim for it's pure Google phone approach, with a lot of people really loving the camera experience.  Rumours are light on the Google Pixel 2 - we don't even have confirmation of the name - but it has been confirmed that there will be a new Pixel device in 2017. That was confirmed by Rick Osterloh, SVP of hardware at Google, i.e., the chap who will be responsible for it. Other details are light, but Osterloh also confirmed that the Pixel 2 would retain its premium positioning. That's about all we know so far, but you can expect Android O, and potentially another phone manufactured by HTC. We'd expect it to launch about October time, about a year after the original. Google Pixel 2: What do we want to see? Pocket-lint Nokia 8 Nokia made it's play at Mobile World Congress 2017, launching three Android devices. The lead device was the Nokia 6, but notably missing was a true flagship smartphone, colloquially dubbed the Nokia 8.  Originally leaking as the P1, and then finding itself levelled with the name Nokia 8, we're expecting a premium build, with an IP68 rating, a 5.5-inch display with 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution. Most of the hardware rumours have said Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, but with plenty of mixed messaging coming from the flagship rumours and those wrapped up in the Nokia 6/5/3, we're going to be watching and waiting to see how the story of Nokia's flagship unfolds. Nokia 8 Android phone: Release date, rumours and specs facebook/designer Microsoft Surface Phone The Surface Phone is something of a Windows phone holy grail. With Nokia then Microsoft Devices producing plenty of Windows Phones, the spectre of the Surface Phone has been hanging around as the idea of the ultimate Windows mobile device. Given the recent sale of virtually all of its phone patents, and announcement that it's no longer focusing on Windows Phone development, the Surface Phone may never see the light of day. It's rumoured that the new premium device will be Surface branded and Intel powered, possibly coming in three different variants. Given the same team behind the Surface Tablets are said to be behind the Surface Phone, you can expect a solid build if it ever does appear. There's also the suggestion that Surface Phone will run a brand new update of Windows 10, aiming to capitalise on the branding and offer the ultimate experience. Launch originally wasn't expected until the latter half of 2016, but this has since shifted to 2017. That's if it appears at all. Microsoft Surface Phone: What's the story so far? Upcoming phones already announced... Pocket-lint Nokia 6 The Nokia 6 is now a global device, offering a lovely build on mid-range specs. It has an aluminium body, fronted by a lovely 5.5-inch Full HD display. It's powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 chipset and offers a 16-megapixel camera on the rear, 8-megapixel on the front. Most attractive, however, is that it's pure Android, with no bloat at all - the only thing Nokia changes is the camera app. The Arte Black special edition (pictured) is only €299, the normal version is €229, meaning this is a serious bargain for Nokia's return to smartphones. There are also Nokia 5 and Nokia 3 handsets, which drop the specs down - the Nokia 6 is our star pick, however.

A source at the EFCC said that the anti-graft boss was also “exposing privileged information to those who should not be allowed access.”   The “rejected” anti-graft boss who was strategically appointed to cover up corruption cases for a ruling party chieftain has failed to comply with legal regime framework as required by the Egmont group.   “All effort to get the EFCC to comply has been resisted by Mr Magu,” the source said.   ‘Blackmail’   In his desperate bid for confirmation, Mr Magu has used highly sensitive information under the NFIU to blackmail people.   Mr Magu’s EFCC has also failed to share financial intelligence with other law enforcement agencies as required by the international standard agency law.   Though the NFIU has always been under the control of the EFCC, the group has now raised concern that the financial intelligence dissemination is now subject to manipulation and lack of credibility.   Staff told DENISAURUS News that the implication of this cut off would be disastrous to the country. It means that Nigeria will no longer have access to data that would help it investigating money laundering and the financing of terrorism.   This newspaper gathered that Mr Magu has warned his staff not to discuss the fact that the server had been disconnected with anyone.   Instead of fixing the issue, Mr Magu is looking to sacrifice Barrister Francis Oka Phillips-Usani, the DG of NFIU by replacing him with a notorious corrupt official, that was mentioned in the famous wiki leak expose on the anti-graft commission.   This corrupt NFIU official, known as Mo, is also involved in various corrupt case. EFCC sources say that it will be an error to put him in charge of the sensitive financial intelligence unit.   ‘Magu Is a Liability’    This website has published several report on the level of corruption being perpetuated by the Borno born Deputy Commissioner of Police. This allegations were later confirmed by the Department of State Service, DSS.   In its 14-paragraph confidential report, the Director-General of the DSS said that Mr Magu has failed the integrity test and that if confirmed, he could eventually constitute a liability to the anti-corruption drive of the administration.   It meant that in March, Mr Magu’s nomination to be the 4th substantive chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC was rejected by the Senate.   This newspaper discovered through members of staff that access to the Egmont Group’s financial server was disconnected following several misuse by the EFCC acting boss.   In an interview with DENISAURUS News, members of staff explained that it was not the first time the country had been disconnected from accessing crucial data from the server.   “It is worthy to note that, the only time the US residence body, Egmont Group, disconnects an FIU member state, is when it has been confirmed that the Head in that country us running a fowl game, with the Financial Intel access granted,” a staff explained to reporters from DENISAURUS News   This was the case when the erstwhile EFCC Chair, Ibrahim Lamorde, made corruption and impunity a “blood running in his vein” at the anti-graft agency.   “Exactly the path Mr Magu has towed in running down the revered name of the EFCC, owing to several complaints by Staff members at the anti-graft agency.”   EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwajuren did not respond to a request for comment. – Source: DENISAURUS News Previous Article Abia: Between Politics And Leadership – By Mark Mbam Jnr.

The bipartisan legislation would provide clear and equal protections under federal law for all Americans in vital areas of life, like employment, access to public spaces, housing, credit, education, jury service, and federally-funded programs. Today, in a majority of U.S. states (31), LGBTQ people remain at risk of being fired, evicted or denied services because of who they are. 'No person's fundamental rights should be determined by which side of a state line they live on,' said HRC President Chad Griffin. 'The Equality Act will once and for all end the unacceptable patchwork of non-discrimination laws across this country that leaves LGBTQ people at risk. Every American should have a fair chance to earn a living, provide for their families, and live their lives without fear of discrimination. And at its core, that's what the Equality Act is all about.' Discrimination is a real and persistent problem for far too many LGBTQ Americans. HRC polling has found that nearly two-thirds of self-identified LGBTQ Americans report experiencing discrimination - including people like Carter Brown, a transgender man from Texas who lost his job after he was outed by his colleagues. Currently, 50 percent of LGBTQ Americans like Mr. Brown live in states where they are at risk of being fired, denied housing, or refused service because of who they are. There is no federal law explicitly protecting LGBTQ people from discrimination, and 31 states still lack fully-inclusive non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people. Today's announcement included unprecedented support from the business community: 92 major corporations have now joined HRC's Business Coalition for the Equality Act. While the overwhelming majority of America's leading businesses have already started addressing workplace fairness for LGBTQ employees, these major employers know how important the need is for a federal standard that treats all employees the same no matter which state they live in. The slate of companies endorsing the Equality Act have combined operations in all 50 states, headquarters spanning 23 states, and collectively generate $2.6 trillion in revenue. In total, these companies employ more than 5.8 million people across the United States. The overwhelming majority of Americans support full federal equality for LGBTQ people. Polling released last year by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) found that support for a bill like the Equality Act topped 70 percent nationally, including a majority of Democrats, Republicans and Independents. PRRI's groundbreaking survey included 42,000 interviews in 50 states and found majority support for the Equality Act in all 50 states. The Equality Act is co-sponsored by 240 members of Congress. It was first introduced in 2015 by Representative David Cicilline (D-RI) and by Senators Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Cory Booker (D-NJ). Major corporations in the HRC Business Coalition for the Equality Act include Abercrombie & Fitch Co.; Accenture; Adobe Systems Inc.; Advanced Micro Devices Inc.; Airbnb Inc.; Alcoa Inc.; Amazon.com Inc.; American Airlines; American Eagle Outfitters; American Express Global Business Travel; Apple Inc.; Arconic; Automatic Data Processing Inc.; Bank of America; Best Buy Co., Inc.; Biogen; Boehringer Ingelheim USA Corp.; Booz Allen Hamilton Inc.; Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc.; Brown-Forman Corp.; CA Technologies Inc.; Caesars Entertainment Corp.; Capital One Financial Corp.; Cardinal Health Inc.; Cargill Inc.; Chevron Corp.; Choice Hotels International Inc.; Cisco Systems Inc.; The Coca-Cola Co.; Corning Inc.; Cox Enterprises; CVS Health Corp.; Darden Restaurants Inc.; Delhaize America Inc.; Diageo North America; The Dow Chemical Co.; Dropbox Inc.; E.

Home Archives Ed Morrissey Show Newsletters   Kellyanne Conway on Comey: The president expects people who work for him to be loyal to the country and administration posted at 8:41 pm on May 11, 2017 by Allahpundit Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES He wanted an FBI director who was investigating his own campaign associates to be “loyal” to the administration? If that doesn’t mean “He wanted Comey to tank the probe,” what does it mean? The weirdest thing about the last 52 or so hours isn’t the fact that Comey was fired (although the timing is pretty weird), it’s the completely self-defeating spin that keeps coming from the White House. After the news broke and the White House cited Rod Rosenstein’s memo as a key factor in the firing, critics turned around and yelled, “Liar! Trump wanted Comey out, not Rosenstein!” So, earlier today, Trump goes on NBC and says … right, I wanted Comey out. Rosenstein didn’t matter. Then the critics yelled, “You only wanted Comey out so that you could stop the Russia investigation!” So here’s Sarah Huckabee Sanders at today’s White House briefing: The White House said Thursday that removing FBI Director James Comey from his post may hasten the agency’s investigation into Russian meddling. “We want this to come to its conclusion, we want it to come to its conclusion with integrity,” said deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders, referring to the FBI’s probe into Moscow’s interference in last year’s election. “And we think that we’ve actually, by removing Director Comey, taken steps to make that happen.” “All you wanted was a lackey at the FBI who’d be loyal to the president,” the critics hollered, “not an independent investigator who’d find the truth!” So Kellyanne Conway goes on Fox and insists that one of the problems with Comey was his … lack of loyalty. Not the first time we’ve heard that this week, either. The DOJ isn’t supposed to show “loyalty” to the White House when it’s investigating something, particularly if the investigation may involve, uh, the White House, so what’s she talking about? Why can’t they just settle on “Comey had lost the public’s trust after last year” as their message and stick with it, for cripes sake? Here’s the latest. So … Comey was fired because of the Russia investigation? Trump to NBC: "When I decided to [fire Comey], I said to myself, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made up story." — Philip Rucker (@PhilipRucker) May 11, 2017 The key bit with Conway comes at 7:10 of the clip below. Sanders also claimed at today’s briefing that she’s heard from “countless” FBI agents who support Trump’s decision to fire Comey. I’m sure some do support it, but agents typically don’t chatter approvingly to people at the White House (let alone to a high-ranking press person) about a major political decision precisely because they’re not supposed to show political “loyalty.” Intel people interviewed by the media are far less approving of Comey’s firing, although a press that’s hostile to Trump can go out and find hostile sources with ease. We’ll know from the scope of the leaks in the weeks to come how angry the feds are about it. For what it’s worth, though, the visit to FBI headquarters that Trump had considered making tomorrow is reportedly off.
