It can be easy to forget that the lion's share of PC displays get their marching orders from the pixel pushers integrated into Intel's ubiquitous mobile and desktop CPUs. The graphics driver update du jour comes from the bunnysuits at Santa Clara and packs support for a couple of new games and fixes for a handful of problems. The Intel Graphics Driver for Windows version 15.45 is out now for the 64-bit flavors of Windows 10 and Windows 7. The driver promises improved performance for Intel Iris graphics processors in Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War III and Titanfall 2. Some graphical anomalies should now be gone when playing the pre-alpha of Unreal Tournament or Doom under the Vulkan API, too The release notes also say the new version corrects a problem that would deny a user access to the Steam folder. Intel says that applications should no longer move to the primary monitor after waking from sleep when third-party display EDID overrides are enabled. Streaming 4K Netflix requires a heap of hoop-jumping on PCs, but Kaby Lake systems that meet all the DRM requirements should use a little bit less power when binge-watching Lady Dynamite. Scrolling through a browser window when it's streaming a video should no longer cause screen flicker, too. Eager gerbils can proceed directly to Intel's driver download page. The timid ones can check out the release notes before setting these bits loose upon their systems. Tags: Graphics Gaming Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

SHARE TWEET PIN-IT Tom Williams/CQPHO By Matt Shuham Published May 5, 2017 1:23 pm Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) wrote Friday that he had sought records to determine whether he or other members of Congress had been surveilled by the Obama administration or by the intelligence community. The announcement came after a series of tweets on surveillance: Did the Obama admin go after presidential candidates, members of Congress, journalists, clergy, lawyers, fed judges? https://t.co/h7rsjvNLHM — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) May 5, 2017 Did the Obama admin use warrantless "wiretapping" on other candidates besides @realDonaldTrump? https://t.co/h7rsjvNLHM — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) May 5, 2017 I have formally requested from the WH and the Intel Committees info on whether I was surveilled by Obama admin and or the Intel community! — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) May 5, 2017 Paul’s press office did not respond to TPM’s questions about what prompted the tweet, but the news website Circa reported a couple hours later that Paul had written to the White House on April 10 claiming that “an anonymous source recently alleged to me that my name, as well as the names of other Members of Congress, were unmasked, queried or both, in intelligence reports of intercepts during the prior administration.” In a press release obtained by TPM, Paul cited Circa’s reporting and attached his letter to Trump. Two of Paul’s tweets link to a call from Circa for the Trump administration to release “records showing how often government officials have searched National Security Agency intercepts for intelligence on U.S. presidential candidates, members of Congress, journalists, clergy, lawyers, federal judges and doctors and how often such Americans had their identities unmasked by the intelligence community after Barack Obama made it easier to do so in 2011.” The publication doesn’t make clear what changes occurred in 2011, but another report from the publication linked in the same article describes “a series of orders that began in 2011, moves that were approved by the [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court].” Circa reported, based on unnamed intelligence officials and classified documents, it said, an increase in 2016 in U.S. names searched for and unmasked in intercepted communications, among other things. Among names unmasked in 2016 and early 2017, it reported, “were campaign or transition associates of President Trump as well as members of Congress and their staffers, according to sources with direct knowledge.” In the final days of his administration, Obama announced new rules broadening the NSA’s authority to share large amounts of collected data with other agencies. The senator, a proponent of privacy protections against government surveillance, has played sympathetic to President Donald Trump’s unsubstantiated claim in February that Trump Tower had been wiretapped on former President Obama’s order. Trump has since dramatically expanded his accusation to include “unmasking” by the Obama administration of his or his associates’ names in communications, which would include their names being unveiled as part of separate conversations. In April, Paul said, referring to the former national security adviser, “I believe Susan Rice abused the system and she did it for political purposes. She needs to be brought in and questioned under oath.” He added: “This was a witch hunt that began with the Obama administration, sour grapes on the way out the door. They were going to use the intelligence apparatus to attack Trump, and I think they did.” House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes (R-CA) said in March that he had seen proof of that unmasking after secretly meeting with a source he called a “whistleblower” a the White House. The ranking member on that committee, and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, said the documents showed no evidence of improper surveillance. Nunes subsequently stepped aside from the committee’s probe of possible connections between Russia and the Trump campaign.

Kentucky senator Rand Paul, apparently concerned that he was under surveillance by the Obama administration, is demanding answers from the intelligence community. “I have formally requested from the WH and the Intel Committees info on whether I was surveilled by Obama admin and or the Intel community!” Paul tweeted Friday morning, providing no evidence for the claim, which appeared to reflect President Donald Trump’s own unfounded claim that both his campaign and Trump Tower were bugged by the Obama White House. It’s not clear whether this is a cry for help or attention, or whether Paul has simply been spending too much time next to Kellyanne Conway’s microwave. His series of tweets linked to a Circa report on N.S.A. surveillance, claiming that the agency collected and “searched” information pertaining to nearly 2,000 Americans abroad in 2016, after loosening privacy protections in 2011. “Did the Obama admin go after presidential candidates, members of Congress, journalists, clergy, lawyers, fed judges?” Paul wondered. “Did the Obama admin use warrantless ‘wiretapping’ on other candidates besides @realdonaldtrump?” https://twitter.com/RandPaul/status/860462292386938881 https://twitter.com/RandPaul/status/860480504168165378 https://twitter.com/RandPaul/status/860482401109258242 F.B.I. director James Comey, National Security Agency director Mike Rogers, and Republican House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes have all said that there is no evidence Trump, Trump Tower, or his campaign were ever illegally surveilled. Still, it’s not paranoia if they’re really out to get you. Last month, Paul sent Trump a letter asking him to look into a claim made by an “anonymous source” that Paul’s name was “unmasked” in the intelligence reports collected during the Obama administration. “In light of the revelations that the names of persons associated with the Trump campaign were unmasked,” Paul wrote, “I believe the allegations that myself and other elected members of the legislative branch may have also been unmasked or caught in the intelligence gathering warrants investigation.” Now he wants Trump to conduct a formal investigation to determine whether he and other members of Congress were spied upon. Earlier this year in a Fox News interview, Paul erroneously claimed that “everybody admits that somebody spied on Mike Flynn, and he was part of the Trump campaign. So, it sounds like what the president said has already been proven true.” In fact, reports suggest Flynn was surveilled while communicating with the Russian ambassador to the U.S., as most communications with Russian officials are monitored by the N.S.A. His various attempts to obfuscate those communications ultimately cost him his job.

Jonmichael Hands, a product marketing manager at Intel, said the company's two new 3D NAND SSDs were specifically designed for cloud data center scenarios, but that those conditions apply to more than cloud service providers. In a telephone interview with EE Times, he said that although many organizations are spending more money on the public cloud, “at the same time, enterprise IT is moving toward the private cloud.” Either way, they are seeking performance and efficiencies. Intel's 3D NAND SSDs are aimed at converged infrastructure deployments where capacity is important, but also flexibility so that enterprises can easily re-task systems for new workloads, as well as improved both CAPEX and OPEX, said Hands. The DC P4500 line is optimized for reads and is aimed at helping data centers get more value out of servers and store more data, said Hands, while the DC P4600 series accelerates caching and enables more workloads per server. Both use Intel's TLC 3D NAND combined with a new, Intel-developed controller, new firmware and PCIe/NVMe. Both series will initially come in a half-height half-length add-in card and U.2 2.5-inch form factors in 1, 2 and 4TB capacities. Intel's new firmware includes support the NVMe-Management Interface (NVMe-MI) specification, said Hands, and offers manageability features to reduce server downtime through improved update processes and expanded monitoring capabilities, with management coverage is now expanded across a wider range of drive states. The new controller, meanwhile, supports scaling as high as 16TB, he said. “That's really only limited by the amount of flash you can fit in that form factor," he added.  Hands said Intel is confident in the forward momentum of NVMe, noting that both Microsoft and Facebook have seats on the NVM Express board, and cited its scalability, open standards and flexible form factors as attributes contributing to adoption. “The industry has chosen NVMe," Hands said. "It is the next protocol for SSDs." Hands added that all new SSD deployments in the hyperscale segment are NVMe, although the overall enterprise market is slower. “The inflection point is happening," he said.  Intel's DC P4500 line is optimized for reads and is aimed at helping data centers get more value out of servers and store more data, said Hands, while the DC P4600 series accelerates caching and enables more workloads per server. Hands said the SATA to NVMe transition is inevitable, as the older interface is becoming a bottleneck, while NVMe higher performance enables systems to get better value from the flash. “We can take full advantage of the 3D NAND," he said. “You're exposing it on a interface that's been designed for SSDs." Intel has been expanding Fab 68 in Dalian, China, to increase its 3D NAND supply to better meet the storage needs of customers. Intel initially developed its 3D NAND technology in collaboration with Micron, opting to leverage floating gate technology that has been easier to manage than the problematic charge trap approach being used by everyone else, said Jim Handy, principal analyst at Objective Analysis. “Because Intel and Micron chose not to use charge trap in their flash, they've been able to ramp it faster than everyone else," Handy said.  And although the two companies have joint product facilities, their arrangement gives them liberty to build their own, said Handy. “Intel is ramping up production ability, enabled by the success of its 3D production with Micron," he said.  He said pretty much all hyperscale data centers are using flash in form or another. “They see it as a path to getting the most performance for their dollar," Handy said. In most cases it's a combination of flash, DDR and spinning disk, with the latter is still be used for cold storage, he said, even in hyperscale systems. In the long term, it will be planar NAND that becomes the odd man out as 3D NAND costs go down. “There's a real limit for how many applications that will be suitable for planar NAND," said Handy. While it's possible it could displace NOR flash in some applications, there will barriers as its necessary to license sophisticated software. And although it doesn't make sense to put 3D NAND in small USB thumb drive, it's making its way into endpoint devices. “The limiting factor is the smallest 3D NAND chips you can buy are 128Gb or 16GB," Handy said. "Anything that's got less than 16GB in it is not going to use 3D NAND." —Gary Hilson is a general contributing editor with a focus on memory and flash technologies for EE Times.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Announcement  ⋮  Hardware Intel Xeon Scalable Processor Family Detailed, Takes on AMD Naples Server Chips – Xeon Platinum With 28 Cores, 56 Threads and 8S+ Configuration By Hassan Mujtaba 12 hours ago 12Shares Share Tweet Submit Intel has shared more details of their upcoming Xeon Scalable processor family. The new family of server and datacenter aimed processors will not only feature a new architecture but also be branded with a new naming scheme. Intel Xeon Scalable Processor Family Detailed – Will Tackle AMD’s Naples 32 Core Chips With Xeon Platinum Based on the Skylake architecture, the new processors will be part of the Skylake-SP (Scalable Processor) family. The processors will follow an entirely new nomenclature which will differentiate them from rest of the Xeon products. Intel would still use the E3/E5/E7 branding for the various segments but they won’t be termed as E/EP/EX. The processors will follow the Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum branding which is an interesting name choice. Related Prey PC Benchmarks Show Better Performance on NVIDIA GeForce Pascal and Maxwell Compared To AMD’s Polaris and GCN GPUs The Intel Xeon Processor Scalable family is re-architected from the ground up and will be the successor to the Intel Xeon processor E5 and E7 product lines. It will incorporate unique features for compute, network and storage workloads, and impressive performance gains of up to 3.9x higher scalability for virtualized workloads as compared with the 4-year-old systems widely used in the market today, allowing customers to run more and a more diverse variety of workloads on each system. via Intel The new processors have been long due for launch as Intel first shared their details a year back. The new processors are designed to feature higher core count and new technologies which have been detailed by Intel. The imminent launch of AMD’s Naples server platform with 1P and 2P configuration aims to disrupt Intel’s server dominance by offering up to 32 cores, 64 threads and an architecture that performs on par in IPC with Intel’s current generation CPUs. Related AMD Radeon RX Vega High-End Enthusiast Graphics Card Packaging Pictured – Supposedly Bundled With Quake Champions Intel Xeon Skylake-SP Architectural Features – Omni-Path Interconnect Fabric, AVX-512, Optane Storage Support So aside from an architectural upgrade moving from Broadwell to Skylake, the new Xeons will also adopt several enhancements that come integrated within the CPU die and some featured on the platform as a whole. Some key technologies mentioned by Intel include Intel Omni-Path Architecture, Intel Quick Assist, Intel Ethernet and Intel AVX-512 acceleration support. These technologies are embedded inside the CPU themselves. Now the platform comes with additional technology support such as Intel Optane Storage. Intel has recently launched their Optane SSD DC P4800X and Optane SSD DCP4600 which are meant for datacenter consumption. The new storage powerhouse delivers exponential increase in overall data and media transfer rates with lower latency times. Since we are talking about a Scalable platform, Intel is also mentioning other products such as Intel FPGAs, Nervana, Xeon Phi and other Silicon based products to be optimized for the new platform. These solutions will come as add-in offerings on the Xeon platform. Advertisement Intel Xeon Skylake-SP Purley Platform Specifications – LGA 3647 Socket and 8S+ Configuration Support For Top Xeon SKUs Intel’s Skylake-SP family will be supported by a new platform known as Purley. The Intel Skylake Purley platform will be divided between four categories that include 2S, 4S, 8S and 8S+ configurations. The E5 family includes the dual socket and quad socket designs (2S and 4S) where as the Xeon E7 line includes the 8 socket and 8 socket plus design structure with the C602 chipset and a scalable memory buffer. One of the biggest advancements that Skylake will have is the Intel Omnipath Architecture integration which will be called Storm Lake (Generation 1). The PCH will be codenamed Lewisburg and will also ship with updated Ethernet controllers. Another very important point to note is that the platform will be scalable beyond 8 sockets – which is frankly an absolutely insane amount for CPUs working in tandem in any given configuration. Another interesting point to note is the fact that not only will Purley update the number of PCIe slots to 48 but they will finally be configurable in x4, x8 and x16 divisions ( a major update). According to Intel’s own slides, Skylake Purley is poised to be the biggest update since the age old Nehalem platform. Along with the improved performance per watt that comes with every article iteration, Skylake EX Purley will actually ship with 6 channels of DDR4 as opposed to 4. It will also include the AVX 512 instruction set and will boast the 100G OmniPath interconnect. Skylake Purley will also have Cannonlake graphics support not to mention FPGA integration (another important upgrade). The new platform also comes with an updated socket. The socket has been upgraded to feature 3647 pins that gives it the LGA 3647 name. The socket is surrounded by 12 DDR4 DIMM slots. This is due to support next-generation hexa-channel memory and Intel’s Optane DIMMs for faster latency solutions. Overall, Purley will be expanding Intel’s server platform with a range of new features. Intel Xeon E7 Scalable Family Featuring Xeon Platinum and Xeon Gold Processors Moving to the processors, the Xeon E7 family is what will be aimed at 4S, 8S and 8S+ socket configurations for platforms with disruptive core count and higher processing capabilities. There will be two segments of Xeon E7 family, the Xeon Platinum and Xeon Gold. The Intel® Xeon® Processor Scalable Family is the new foundation for secure, agile, multi-cloud data centers. It represents the biggest platform advancements in a decade. The processor family is architected for exceptional workload-optimized performance and hardware-enhanced security. Designed for trusted data service delivery, the processor family is fueled by significant leaps in I/O, memory, storage and network technologies. Intel Xeon Platinum processors will offer the best performance, hardware-enhanced security and best business agility.

There are little details on these processors but key details are mentioned. Intel Bronze series will be entry level chips with lower prices, lower cores and moderate clock speeds. We can also expect minimal power draw compared to the higher core and clock speed variants. The Xeon Silver will be the mid-range processors that deliver best performance at low power, maintaining higher efficiency. Intel has said that they are targeting a mid-2017 launch for the Skylake-SP family. The next family in line is Kaby Lake-SP but there are no words or details on that launch yet. We will probably have more info by Intel at Computex with AIB partners revealing several racks designed for Intel Xeon series processors.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware Intel Says i7 7700K CPUs Shouldn’t Be Overclocked In Response To Countless Overheating Complaints By Khalid Moammer 11 hours ago 389Shares Share Tweet Submit Intel i7 7700K owners have flooded the company’s official forum with countless reports and complaints about overheating issue that sends their CPUs’ temperatures shooting up to 90+ degrees Celsius with very minor computational loads and in some cases even when the processors are idling. A number of i7 7700K owners have written about the issue to The Register which subsequently broke the story. One owner wrote “My own chip suffers from it, (without any overclocking) which is quite an annoyance. This despite a delid modification and a proper water loop, resulting in the fans ramping up and down very frequently, and the temperature appearing to frequently spike near the danger zone.” Related New AMD Ryzen Microcode Update Will Expand Memory Support The complaints have been piling up for over three months prompting Intel to finally end the silence and respond to the cries of the community yesterday. Intel’s Response : i7 7700K Owners Should Not Overclock, Overvolt Or De-lid Their CPUs “We appreciate the feedback you have provided, and your patience as we investigated this behavior. The reported behavior of the 7th Generation Intel Core i7-7700K Processor, showing momentary temperature changes from the idle temperature, is normal while completing a task (like opening a browser or an application or a program). In our internal investigation, we did not observe temperature variation outside of the expected behavior and recommended specifications. For processor specifications, please refer to the Intel Core i7-7700K Processor Product Specifications.  Most motherboard manufacturers offer customizable fan speed control settings that may allow for smoother transition of fan revolutions per minute (rpm). Please consult your motherboard manufacturer’s manual or website for instructions on how to change default fan speed control settings. Related AMD Radeon RX Vega Specs Leaked In Linux Patch – Features 4 Shader Engines, 256 TMUs & 64 ROPs Advertisement We do not recommend running outside the processor specifications, such as by exceeding processor frequency or voltage specifications, or removing of the integrated heat spreader (sometimes called ‘de-lidding’). These actions will void the processor warranty.” Intel states that the temperature spikes and variations in their testing do not exceed the maximum safe temperature which is stated as 100c for the i7 7700K. Intel maintains that this behavior is normal and not unexpected. The company continues to state that it recommends against overclocking, overvolting or de-liding the CPU. Users who choose to do so will void their warranties. Why Don’t Worry It’s Normal & Run At Stock Speeds Are Not Sufficient Responses Unfortunately Intel’s response did not sit well with the disgruntled owners who claim to be experiencing this overheating issue at stock settings without applying any additional voltage or raising the frequency reports PC Gamer. Paul Lilly – PCGamer The TL;DR version is that everything checks out on Intel’s end and users should not overclock their Core i7-7700K processors, which have unlocked multipliers specifically for overclocking. “Three months waiting for Intel to come out with a solution, and now this?! This is all you can say?! We know already what you’ve just said… You know what, never mind, this would be my last product from Intel,” the user wrote. Another user called Intel’s response “BS,” noting that “some 7700K [processors] run even hotter than an AMD Bulldozer overclocked at 5GHz.” “I don’t even have the major issue like everyone else is having. However, after Intel’s response just now, they are not getting another penny out of me. I’m going to sell my Intel stuff and go to Ryzen,” yet another user wrote. What’s bizarre is that Intel doesn’t seem to understand or acknowledge that the reason so many i7 7700K owners have proceeded to de-lid their chips is precisely because they ran too hot. The process of removing the IHS is quite risky and can irreparably damage the CPU by directly damaging the silicon die itself.  Which is understandably why it voids the warranty. Despite the incredible risk, enthusiasts choose to do it because it can shave up to 25 degrees off the temperatures. One would think that if you have to go out of your way to attempt such a risky endevour just so your CPU wouldn’t overheat then there’s something clearly not right. This is one of the reasons why many of the i7 7700K owners who have taken to the Intel forum to air their grievances were the least happy about the company’s response. After all the i7 7700K’s main selling point over the i7 7700 is that it features an unlocked multiplier specifically for overclocking. And now owners are being told that not only are the high temperatures normal but that they shouldn’t even attempt to overclock their CPUs. The very same CPUs that were specifically marketed and sold with overclocking as a feature.

Intel’s Kathy Winter (from left), Doug Davis, and Patti Robb cut the entrance ribbon, officially opening Intel’s Silicon Valley Center for Autonomous Driving in San Jose, California, to the public on Wednesday, May 3, 2017. (Credit: Intel Corporation) The new facility will join Intel’s other related facilities located in Arizona, Oregon, and Germany. These facilities were created specifically to aid the company in its further entrance into the rapidly growing “next gen transportation” sector — which encompasses self-driving vehicles, vehicle-to-vehicle communication, AI, connectivity, sensor technology and processing, etc. The press release provides more: “With the slew of information captured by cameras, LIDAR, RADAR, and other sensors, autonomous cars are expected to generate approximately 4 terabytes of data every 90 minutes of operation. Most of this data will be processed, filtered, and analyzed in the car, while the most valuable data will be moved to the data center to update maps, enhance data models and more. “Intel’s Autonomous Garage Labs work with customers and partners to come up with new ways of addressing the data challenge inside the vehicle, across the network and in the data center. Engineers at the labs use a variety of tools to advance and test in these areas, including vehicles equipped with Intel-based computing systems and different kinds of sensors that help gather data; autonomous test vehicles that practice real-world driving; partner vehicles and teams that are collaborating with Intel’s research efforts; and dedicated autonomous driving data centers.” The news follows earlier reports about Intel acquiring the Israel-based self-driving vehicle tech pioneer Mobileye for $15 billion, and it seemingly represents another sign of the company’s expectation that the self-driving vehicle sector is approaching a boom period.

Twitter Facebook Patch to fix Intel-based PCs with enterprise bug rolls out next week Intel is also offering a tool to help IT administrators discover machines built with the vulnerability IDG Michael Kan (IDG News Service) 06 May, 2017 06:46 - - - - print email Comments Next week, PC vendors will start rolling out patches that fix a severe vulnerability found in certain Intel-based business systems, including laptops, making them easier to hack. Intel on Friday released a new notice urging clients to take steps to secure their systems. The chipmaker has also released a downloadable tool that can help IT administrators and users discover whether a machine they own has the vulnerability. In addition, vendors including Fujitsu, HP, and Lenovo have released lists showing which products are affected and when the patches will roll out. The products include laptops from Lenovo's ThinkPad line and HP's EliteBook series, along with servers, and desktops. Some of the patches are slated to come in June. Computers running enterprise management features found in Intel-based firmware from the past eight years will have the bug. Specifically, the vulnerability resides in past versions of Intel Active Management Technology, Intel Small Business Technology, and Intel Standard Manageability. Fortunately, the vulnerability can only be exploited if these features have been enabled, according to security firm Embedi, which uncovered the bug. These enterprise features were designed to help businesses remotely manage, track and repair huge fleets of connected computers, including retail checkout systems, digital signs, and PCs. However, Intel’s firmware bug could allow a hacker to take over the PCs and devices that use these remote management technologies, the chipmaker said. In March, Intel learned about the vulnerability from a researcher at Embedi, a security product provider. On Friday, Embedi released more technical details about the Intel firmware bug, saying it could be exploited to remotely control a machine’s mouse and keyboard and even turn the computer on or off. “Which means, you can remotely load, execute any program to the target system,” Embedi said. The vulnerability also bypasses the machine’s authentication processes, so no knowledge of the password is needed, Embedi said. Until the patch becomes available, Intel is recommending users manually apply temporary fixes to address the threat. Users can also contact Intel’s customer support.

Some owners of Intel Core i7-7700 and i7-7700K chips have been complaining for months about mysterious temperature spikes, and now Intel has responded. However, that response was little more than canned PR nonsense, which has served only to further enrage affected users. The Core i7-7700 and 7700K are both quad-core chips with Hyper-Threading to bring the number of threads to eight. These are both designed to be enthusiast CPUs, but the K variant is particularly popular. The 7700K has a clock speed of 4.2GHz compared with 3.6GHz for the regular 7700, and you can push it far past the stock setting thanks to its unlocked multiplier. You always need to be aware of temperatures when overclocking a chip, and this is where some owners of the 7700s are running into issues. Multiple users have been noticing unusual temperature spikes as high as 90 degrees Celsius. In case you’re not familiar with CPU temperature ranges, that’s very high. The Core architecture has a maximum temperature threshold of 100 degrees, so owners have been understandably concerned. After 37 pages of complaints on Intel’s community forums, someone from the company finally issued a statement. It reads in part, “We do not recommend running outside the processor specifications, such as by exceeding processor frequency or voltage specifications, or removing of the integrated heat spreader (sometimes called “de-lidding”). These actions will void the processor warranty.” The spokesperson also said Intel has not identified any unexpected temperature variations in its testing. Basically, it thinks the temperature spikes are normal. This isn’t sitting well with users on the forum, who point out it makes no sense for Intel to sell a K-series CPU with an unlocked multiplier while telling people not to overclock. Even some chips that aren’t overclocked seem to be affected, making the response all the more aggravating. The only useful bit of advice from Intel is to alter the fan speed curve so it ramps up more gradually. That will at least lessen the frantic whirring as fans race to catch up with the temperature spikes. Several posters have pledged to ditch their Intel hardware and pick up an AMD CPU. That would have seemed like an idle threat in the recent past, but the new AMD Ryzen chips are getting high praise. This is not really the time for Intel to be upsetting its enthusiast base.

You read that right. When you're expected to send a password hash, you send zero bytes. Nothing. Nada. And you'll be rewarded with powerful low-level access to a vulnerable box's hardware from across the network – or across the internet if the management interface faces the public web. Remember that the next time Intel, a $180bn international semiconductor giant, talks about how important it treats security. To recap: Intel provides a remote management toolkit called AMT for its business and enterprise-friendly processors; this software is part of Chipzilla's vPro suite and runs at the firmware level, below and out of sight of Windows, Linux, or whatever operating system you're using. The code runs on Intel's Management Engine, a tiny secret computer within your computer that has full control of the hardware and talks directly to the network port, allowing a device to be remotely controlled regardless of whatever OS and applications are running, or not, above it. Thus, AMT is designed to allow IT admins to remotely log into the guts of computers so they can reboot a knackered machine, repair and tweak the operating system, install a new OS, access a virtual serial console, or gain full-blown remote desktop access via VNC. It is, essentially, god mode. Normally, AMT is password protected. This week it emerged this authentication can be bypassed, potentially allowing miscreants to take over systems from afar or once inside a corporate network. This critical security bug was designated CVE-2017-5689. While Intel has patched its code, people have to pester their hardware suppliers for the necessary updates before they can be installed. Today we've learned it is trivial to exploit this flaw, allowing anyone to gain control of vulnerable systems without a password. AMT is accessed over the network via a bog-standard web interface: the service listens on ports 16992 and 16993. Visiting this with a browser brings up a prompt for a password, and this passphrase is sent using standard HTTP Digest authentication: the username and password are hashed using a nonce from the AMT firmware plus a few other bits of metadata. This scrambled response is checked by the AMT software to be valid, and if so, access is granted to the management interface. But if you send an empty response, the firmware is fooled into thinking this is correct and lets you through. This means if you use a proxy to change the response to an empty string, or otherwise set up your browser to send empty HTTP Digest authentication responses, you can bypass the password checks. Essentially, behind the scenes, your browser would normally send something like this to the AMT service, which includes the hashed response string containing the username, password and server nonce:

 Well, screw that – using a proxy between you and the device, or a similar traffic-editing tool, just strip out the response hash to send instead:

 Notice how response is now empty. And yet Intel's bouncer lets you in, even though you flashed the doorman no password – no valid ID – at all:

 If you poke around inside Intel's firmware, you'll find this gem that lies at the heart of the matter – machine code that decompiles into C that looks pretty much like this: 
if(strncmp(computed_response, user_response, response_length))
   deny_access();
 As you may well know, this standard function compares no more than response_length bytes in the two supplied strings to check if they are identical or not. The two strings compared here are the authentication response sent by person trying to log in (user_response) and the response expected by the service (computed_response). If both strings match, the function returns zero, indicating the password is good and as expected, and the code continues on to grant access. If the strings differ, the function's return value is non-zero, meaning the password is wrong, so access is denied. So far so good. Unfortunately, response_length is calculated from user_response, so if an empty string is supplied, the length is zero, no bytes are checked, no bytes are therefore different, and – as expected – strncmp() returns zero, indicating success, and access is granted. Thus, an empty response string slips through as valid when it's actually invalid. Intel should really check the two strings are the same length, since valid responses are always 32-byte MD5 hashes. Thanks go to Embedi, which reverse engineered the code [PDF] and also reported the flaw to Intel back in March. Tenable also poked around in the binaries and came to the same conclusion earlier this week. Intel has published some more info on the vulnerability here, which includes links to a tool to check if your system is at-risk, support contact details, and a list of mitigations to reduce the threat. That tool is apparently Windows-only; there's info here for Linux peeps. There is also this third-party tool, here, for disabling AMT from Windows. We're told the programming blunder is present in various, but not all, Intel processor chipsets from today's Kaby Lake family back to silicon sold in 2010: it mainly affects business PCs, professional workstations and small servers, rather than devices aimed at normal folk. However, Chipzilla admitted today that "consumers and small businesses" may end up using processors with the vulnerable tech present. If you're using a vPro-enabled processor and have provisioned AMT versions 6 to 11.6 on your network, you are definitely at risk of the above vulnerability. This also affects Intel's Standard Manageability (ISM) and Small Business Technology (SBT) products. We recommend you use Intel's utility to double check whether or not you are being silently menaced by this bug.

The announcement was made in San Jose, California, during Intel’s “Innovation Campus.” The chip manufacturer has showcased a modified BMW 7 Series during the event, which will be the base of the fleet. In total, 40 cars will compose the roster of highly-automated prototypes that will be operated on American roads. Evidently, the fleet of forty vehicles is just a small part of the strategy between BMW, Intel, and Mobileye. The three allies will eventually deploy more units on the roads of other countries, but these should come at a later date. It is important to remark that the vehicles are not fully autonomous, but highly-automated, Engadget notes. The difference in terms means that the cars can operate without the need for a human behind the wheel in particular conditions, but are unable to drive from one point to another without assistance. Intel wants to develop a “base functionality platform” for automakers interested in building self-driving cars. The product would be licensed to various companies once it would be completed. Until that point, the chip maker will partner with BMW and Mobileye to develop those systems. In other words, Intel has developed the “brain” of the driverless car technology that will be ultimately exercised in production vehicles, but it is restricted to highly-automated operation at the moment. The restriction helps engineers gather data, learn from events the system records on the road, and advance the technology for the time when all of the components will be ready for testing. Competition is fierce in this industry, and NVIDIA, another company that builds computer chips, is already involved in the field of autonomous cars. Both Intel and NVIDIA are based in Santa Clara, but the latter sells processors to Tesla, which is already testing autonomous driving features in its products.

Reddit user Glumbot says a friend spotted the machine inside Intel’s Folsom, Calif. office — it is used to dispense computer parts and supplies without requiring employees to request them from their IT department and wait for items to arrive. The touchscreen machine, which runs on Intel’s Core i5 vPro processor and uses Intel’s AIM (Audience Impression Metric) suite, is also used to keep track of product inventory. Employees can use the self-service machine to “buy” parts by scanning their work ID and the cost is automatically charged to their department. Things you can buy include batteries, mice, flash drives, keyboards, cable locks, and laptop AC adaptors, according to a vending machine trade publication which covered its release in 2013. So it’s not a new machine by any means, but it’s a pretty fun look into office culture at tech companies and their unique ways to increase workflow efficiency. (Mozilla’s offices have one too, albeit not a touchscreen.) My favorite part of all this is the gigantic sign next to the machine that lists simple instructions for Intel employees on how to operate a vending machine.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Embedi: What You Need to Know About The Intel AMT Vulnerability BERKELEY, California, May 5, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Embedi (embedi.com) For the first time since Intel made the Intel ME vulnerability known to the public, Embedi has now been granted permission to reveal the technical details publicly. Embedi, which detected the Intel AMT vulnerability in mid-February of this year, feared releasing the details before it was fixed would spark attacks on Intel AMT business users. The Intel AMT vulnerability is the first of its kind. The exploitation allows an attacker to get full control over business computers, even if they are turned off (but still plugged into an outlet). We really hope by bringing this to light, it will raise awareness about security issues in firmware and avoid possible issues in the future. By nature, the Intel AMT exploitation bypasses authentication. In other words, an attacker may know credentials and still be able to use the Intel AMT functionality. Access to ports 16992/16993 are the only requirement to perform a successful attack. Among all of the functions of Intel AMT vulnerability, we can distinguish the most important: We hope that in the future no such vulnerabilities will emerge at the firmware level. There are several code execution levels in a computer system’s environment. The highest level being the user level where users interact with the applications, having minimal privileges. The lowest level being Intel ME, which has the highest amount of privileges and can cause the most amount of damage. The age of smart devices is advancing at a rapid pace, we hope that device and firmware developers understand the importance of security because shattering consumer’s confidence is a perilous endeavor.   The technical details provided in this press release have been approved by Intel embedi.com Contact us: Donald Anderson, d.anderson@embedi.com, +1-510-323-2636   SOURCE Embedi CategoriesUncategorized TagsSurveys, Polls and Research Post navigation Previous PostPrevious First Italian-Built F-35B ‘Rolls Out’ of Cameri Production Facility Next PostNext Stephen’s War – A tribute to 142 Squadron Royal Air Force Search Recent Posts Nicaragua: 2017 Article IV Consultation Concluding Statement QIWI to Announce First Quarter 2017 Financial Results on May 17, 2017 TEN Ltd.

Among all of the functions of Intel AMT vulnerability, we can distinguish the most important: a.  Remote control of mouse/keyboard/monitor b.  Remotely change the boot device c.  Power on and off as well as reboot and reset the computer. We hope that in the future no such vulnerabilities will emerge at the firmware level. There are several code execution levels in a computer system's environment. The highest level being the user level where users interact with the applications, having minimal privileges. The lowest level being Intel ME, which has the highest amount of privileges and can cause the most amount of damage. The age of smart devices is advancing at a rapid pace, we hope that device and firmware developers understand the importance of security because shattering consumer's confidence is a perilous endeavor.   The technical details provided in this press release have been approved by Intel embedi.com Contact us: Donald Anderson, d.anderson@embedi.com, +1-510-323-2636   To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/embedi-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-intel-amt-vulnerability-300452404.html SOURCE Embedi Copyright (C) 2017 PR Newswire.

View All Pages Intel’s Z270 platform reigns supreme for compact mini-ITX motherboard builds. This isn’t just because Intel is a clear leader in power efficiency terms, even after AMD’s significant leap forward with Ryzen, but also because there is considerably more choice for Intel’s mainstream platform. Motherboard vendors have been releasing mini-ITX motherboards for Intel’s Z-Series platforms for many years, enabling mini-ITX to achieve almost mainstream status. Gigabyte’s Z270N-Gaming 5 is another example of a motherboard championing the mini-ITX form-factor with a well-rounded combination of connectivity and features that consumers have come to demand from all mid-range and high-end motherboards. While considerably smaller in stature than ATX equivalents the Z270N-Gaming 5 still manages to pack away USB 3.1, M.2 NVMe, Intel Gigabit and AC Wireless Networking, Realtek ALC1220 audio and a high quality power delivery system. Gigabyte has shied away from bold colour schemes more recently but the Z270N-Gaming 5 brings back a bold orange and still offers end-user customisation with a fully configurable RGB LED lighting system. There are some other neat touches too like a shielded PCIe lane, up-rated power components, a heat pipe to cool the CPU VRM and a metal rear I/O shield. Build quality is comparable to high-end motherboards of higher price points. On test today the Gigabyte Z270N-Gaming 5 goes up against mini-ITX rivals such as the MSI Z270i Gaming Pro Carbon AC and ASUS ROG Strix Z270i Gaming.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: The 2 Best Dividend Stocks in the Semiconductor Industry Why Intel and NVIDIA are the best in this important industry. Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) May 5, 2017 at 11:13AM Rather than picking winning consumer tech stocks, investing in the companies that supply or power the technology sector has recently been a popular way to tap into the tech industry's growth. Many investors have turned to buying a broad basket of semiconductor companies -- or a semiconductor ETF, for that matter -- to do just this. However, as in all industries, the semiconductor market has its winners and losers. Keeping that in mind, let's review what makes Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) the best dividend-paying stocks to own in the semiconductor space. Intel The world's largest semiconductor company, Intel has established its business empire by building dominant franchises supplying processing power to the PC and server industries. The company controls an estimated 99% and 87% of the two multibillion-dollar hardware markets. This market dominance, in turn, affords Intel massive pricing power, as evidenced by its 60.9% gross margin during its fiscal 2016.  The past several years haven't been the best in Intel's vaunted corporate history. The company completely missed the smartphone revolution because of its longtime product-development strategy, which centered on maximizing processing power without regard for power usage. Rather than focus on breaking into the smartphone market, Intel has applied its hard-won lessons to make sure it doesn't miss out on coming future trends such as artificial intelligence (AI), self-driving cars, and the Internet of Things. Intel has implemented an aggressive acquisition approach when necessary -- its recent $15.3 billion Mobileye buyout is the most prominent example -- and the future is once more looking bright for the semiconductor giant. As a dividend stock, Intel sports an enviable track record. Over its past 10 fiscal years, the company has increased its annual dividend per share from $0.45 in 2007 to $1.04 in 2016. Intel stock current yields 3%, well above the market averages. All of this is to say that Intel is without question one of the top income investments among semiconductor companies today. Image source: Getty Images. NVIDIA One need only to look at graphics-chip pioneer NVIDIA's stock chart over the past five years to get a sense of the company's enviable prospects; its shares have risen over 700% during this time frame. NVIDIA designs and manufactures specialized semiconductors called graphics processing units (GPUs). For years, NVIDIA's high-performance GPUs, which rendered video playback much faster than the generic PC GPU, operated as a relative niche, largely catering to die-hard gamers and other power users to whom graphics processing horsepower was particularly important. All that changed in recently, as emerging technologies such as AI and deep learning began to gain commercial adoption. Training the neural networks that will power everything from cancer-detecting software to self-driving cars requires that they can distinguish a cancerous tumor from a vital organ or a pedestrian from a fire hydrant. Teaching neural networks is done by feeding them reams of images, which requires immense amounts of high-end graphics processing capabilities, which NVIDIA is perfectly suited to provide. And with the market for AI-powered technologies very much in its infancy, many investors feel the company's best growth years may lie ahead of it. As a dividend stock, NVIDIA is a little disappointing. Its shares currently yield only 0.4%. The company is also fairly new to paying a dividend, having only initiated its cash distributions in 2012. NVIDIA has done a nice job growing its dividends over this period, having increased them from $0.30 per share annually to $0.51, and it's increased its annual dividend payments every year since 2012. However, given the magnitude of its growth opportunity and the paucity of its payout, NVIDIA is probably best suited for investors seeking total return rather than meaningful income generation in the near term.

The Sooner Intel, created by Bob Przybylo in 2011, is an inside look into Oklahoma football and basketball recruiting and is solely for Sooners Illustrated subscribers. It is a sneak peek into what’s happening with OU recruiting and is not to be distributed anywhere else. Oklahoma recruiting took its first real shot in the face since #SoonerSquad17 during the month of April. A 30-day stretch that had high expectations nearly fell flat on its face for OU. The Sooners lost three commitments, saw three in-state targets commit elsewhere before salvaging something with the commitment of Deerfield Beach (Fla.) High defensive back Miguel Edwards last weekend. The loss of commitments will happen sometimes. It’s just a fact in recruiting. Even with SS17 being ranked No. 6 by Scout, it suffered the decommitments from guys like CeeDee Lamb, Trajan Bandy, Jalen Reagor and Jacob Phillips. The Sooners were able to lock down Lamb once again and the beat rolled on with OU finding other guys. Decommitments for the 2019 class just aren’t really going to get people riled up. There’s no doubt the talent of Allen (Texas) High’s Theo Wease and Richmond (Texas) Travis’ Arjei Henderson, but it’s OK and OU can/will recover. OU, and offensive coordinator Lincoln Riley in particular, took a calculated gamble by going after Newbury Park (Calif.) High quarterback Cameron Rising last summer instead of the local favorite, Moore (Okla.) Southmoore’s Casey Thompson. Both are committed to Texas and Riley is back to the grind. Hindsight says that was a bad move but not many people were complaining when Rising was a Scout 100 prospect committed to OU back in August. No, what April is really known for are missed opportunities to lock down the state. Sooners Illustrated sat here for months saying OU was going 7-for-7 with its in-state offers. There was just no way the Sooners were going to mess this up. http://www.scout.com/player/194203-brey-walker?s=73 http://www.scout.com/player/203260-josh-proctor?s=73 http://www.scout.com/player/212850-ron-tatum?s=73 http://www.scout.com/player/207850-jalen-redmond?s=73 http://www.scout.com/player/200616-bryce-bray?s=73 http://www.scout.com/player/209528-jordan-kelley?s=73 http://www.scout.com/player/209431-patrick-fields?s=73 It was there on a silver platter. Walker was first. Then Fields came along, followed by Kelley. The train was rolling before it hit an abrupt stop April with commitments of Josh Proctor to Ohio State and Bryce Bray to Oklahoma State. The biggest blow, maybe figuratively and literally, was Ron Tatum picking Texas instead of OU last week. So what happened? You wonder if OU didn’t read between the lines. Multiple in-state coaches have said a possibility of thinking everything would be as easy as 2017. Might be going too far to say arrogance but a belief that no matter what other schools did, OU would win out. Bryce Bray Bray grew up a huge OU fan, but the Sooners were pretty late to the party. He camped at OU, visited the campus a number of times but no offer. Oklahoma State didn’t waste much time, offering before Bray became a name to watch. It wasn’t until after winning the OL MVP at The Opening regional in March that OU fully took notice. Perhaps OU thought as soon as it did, Bray would come calling to come home because of how much he loved the Sooners. It didn’t happen. Josh Proctor This is a hard one to accept, especially from in-state recruits for the 2018 class. Defensive backs coach Kerry Cooks was the first coach to offer Proctor back in November 2015. When OU makes an in-state offer that far off, most assume it’s a wrap. D.J. Ward, Steven Parker, Will Sunderland, Levi Draper and Brey Walker are some of those examples. Sooners make their claim, everyone else backs off and OU locks them up. But here’s what happened with Proctor and Tatum – other schools didn’t flinch. For Proctor, it was Ohio State. Here’s the curious thing about Proctor. After visiting OU quite a bit through last year’s camp, he was unseen and unheard of in Norman during his junior season. Now that could have been Cooks believing he still had nothing to worry about so all would be well or maybe it should have been a red flag that things weren’t as easy as first thought. Ron Tatum But this? This is the one that’s borderline unexplainable. OU was the second Power 5 offer, only Kansas beating it to the punch. Defensive line coach Calvin Thibodeaux was there from the start, and Tatum was on campus at least six times from October through April’s spring game. Texas just didn’t back off. Where maybe other schools saw the writing on the wall, Oscar Giles wasn’t ready to quit. So OU ends up as the runner-up for Bray, Proctor and Tatum. It’s the art of closing the deal and knowing how with each kid because they’re all different. That’s why maybe Bray gets a pass because OU had a relationship from afar with him but not that close, connected one until recently. Nobody knew Proctor better than Cooks. Nobody knew Tatum better than Thibodeaux. Or at least nobody should have known those two guys better because of how early OU struck. Knowing that, you would figure OU would understand how to handle the situation, how to get the close. Some guys don’t mind being prodded a bit. You never flat out say commit or we’re moving on, but maybe you say something along the lines of reserve your spot. It can backfire and point to J.K. Dobbins last year, who was just plain sick and tired of being asked to commit to OU and ended up signing with Ohio State. That’s where the relationship should come in. Cooks with Proctor and Thibodeaux with Tatum, they should have known by April how those guys respond best. Did Proctor feel pressure to be an in-state kid committing to OU? Did Tatum want a better idea of what OU had in store for him as a commit? Not an enviable job, but the assistants do the brunt work to figure these things out. Were family members unsure of what’s going on? You make sure everybody is 100 percent clear about what’s being expected. No gray area, not in recruiting. Here’s the good news. You don’t always have to close the deal in April. You have to on signing day in February. If OU knows where it took some missteps in these recruitments and decides internally they’re still worth going after, the Sooners can turn the tide. SoonerSquad17 is going to be talked about as the standard for a while, but even think about that class. OU went 5-for-5 with OKPreps in the Scout 300 and landed six overall from the state. But it didn’t come easy. Levi Draper was committed to Oklahoma State. Creed Humphrey was committed to Texas A&M. Tyreece Lott was committed to TCU. None of those sat well with OU, just think about Cale Gundy’s subtweet to Humphrey about playing for a team that talks about winning championships compared to a team that does. Everything can be smoothed over when you figure out the missing ingredient, figure out how you can close the show. Draper’s father, Sean, said Cooks was instrumental in turning that around. The Humphrey family said Bedenbaugh double-downed his efforts after Humphrey went to the Aggies. Ardmore coaches said Thibodeaux realized he might actually be letting Lott get away if he didn’t step it up. There’s time to figure it out. Find the missing ingredient, close the deal. SoonerSquad17 did that, now we’ll see if #SavageTeam2K18 can follow that necessary trend. Trending on Scout Sooner Intel: OU & art of the deal Jerry's Cowboys Vs.

The ECS PB01CF ultra-compact PC is powered by Intel’s Apollo Lake platform and uses an enclosure the size smaller than most wallets. The computer is clearly not a powerhouse, but it supports all the multimedia capabilities that Intel’s latest low-power chips have to offer. The ECS PB01CF is based on Intel’s Celeron N3350 processor, a mobile SoC with two Goldmont cores clocked at 1.1-2.4 GHz, 2 MB cache and Intel’s HD Graphics 500 (Gen9) iGPU with 12 EUs. The SoC supports Intel's new multimedia playback engine that supports hardware-accelerated playback of 4K video from HEVC and VP9-based sources. The system comes equipped with 2 GB of LPDDR4 memory, 32 GB eMMC storage (not a lot, if you want to store UHD videos locally without using an external hard drive, but enough for streaming) and runs Windows 10 Home. As for connectivity, everything looks fairly standard here: a 802.11ac Wi-Fi module, a GbE controller, a microSD card reader, two USB Type-A headers, and one 4Kp30-capable HDMI output to connect to displays or TVs (note that the system does not have any analog connectors for monitors or audio). The PB01CF measures 7×7×3.1 cm and is powered by an external 24 W adapter. Brief Specifications of ECS 5-Ounce PC   PB01CF CPU Celeron N3350 2C/2T at 1.1 – 2.4 GHz frequency, 2 MB cache, iGPU PCH integrated Graphics Intel HD Graphics 500 (12 EUs) Gen9 Memory 2 GB LPDDR4 Storage 32 GB eMMC Wi-Fi Intel 802.11ac Ethernet Gigabit Ethernet with RJ45 connector Display Outputs 1 × HDMI (up to 4Kp30) Audio via HDMI USB 1 × USB 3.0 Type-A (5 Gbps) 1 × USB 2.0 Type-A (480 Mbps) Dimensions 70 mm × 70 mm × 31 mm (0.15 liters, 5 ounces) PSU External 24 W VESA Mounts 75 mm/100 mm OS Microsoft Windows 10 Home 64-bit From a performance and connectivity point of view, the ECS PB01CF is somewhat behind the company’s LIVA Z computers, which are positioned as universal systems for office and media-centric applications. By contrast, the PB01CF is considerably smaller while offering 4K hardware-accelerate video playback, which makes it a viable solution for content streaming or digital signage. In fact, the latter is one the primary applications that ECS positions the PB01CF for, apart from being a cheap office PC attached to the backside of the display, of course. Meanwhile, when compared to Compute Stick systems, the PB01CF has more USB ports, a card reader, GbE and active cooling. ECS has not publicly announced pricing of the PB01CF and large retailers as well as price search engines do not list the product in their databases. Moreover, at press time ECS’ web site did not host any manuals or BIOS updates for the PB01CF, which may indicate that the manufacturer has not launched the device yet. Given the fact that the PB01CF does not seem to be designed for general public, it is possible that the PC is only going to be available via special channels with ECS as an OEM - a common avenue for ECS' business.  Related Reading: ECS LIVA Z Fanless Dual-LAN Apollo Lake UCFF PC Review ECS Expands LIVA mini-PC Family with Z-Series at CES 2017 ECS Preps LIVA Z: Apollo Lake-Based Nettop with 4K and USB-C Support Gallery: ECS Quietly Adds PB01CF UCPC to Lineup: 5-Ounce Apollo Lake Desktop Source: ECS Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment.

Reply HideOut - Friday, May 05, 2017 - link Would be nice to have a bit more RAM, min 4gb with option of maybe 8. And 64gb of solid storage too. Reply close - Friday, May 05, 2017 - link I don't get the memory limitation either. The CPU supports it. I have Atom devices that are limited to 2GB by CPU support and they really feel gimped because of this and much of the usefulness is gone. An extra 2GB couldn't have increased the price by that much but then again maybe they actually researched the market before coming out with this. Reply p1esk - Friday, May 05, 2017 - link Windows. Reply neo_1221 - Friday, May 05, 2017 - link Those should all be upgradeable - I want more USB ports. Still, if it's cheap enough... Reply vladx - Friday, May 05, 2017 - link Still good enough for movies and streaming. Reply The_Assimilator - Friday, May 05, 2017 - link Yeah, 2GB RAM is a joke in 2017, 4GB is the absolute minimum and 8GB should be the standard. Considering the size, I'm guessing the RAM may very well be soldered onto the board - hopefully AT will get one of these in for review and teardown. Reply sc14s - Friday, May 05, 2017 - link I mean yeah its silly to have the ram limitation but when the hell would a HTPC need 8gb ram? I've never seen my traditional desktop pc go above ~7gb since I don't video edit or anything. Reply vladx - Friday, May 05, 2017 - link Exactly, even 2GB is plenty for some Plex/Kodi and Netflix. Reply takeshi7 - Friday, May 05, 2017 - link The fullscreen Best Buy ads that you're running on the site right now are really annoying because they load on every page and I have to scroll to the very top to get rid of them.

The president said he had evidence of this, and told Tucker Carlson days later that “you will see some interesting things going to the forefront over the next few weeks,” though nothing ever came to the forefront.

"This is the best time, I think, in history to go out and buy a PC or be in the PC business because the innovation is tremendous," Krzanich told " Mad Money " host Jim Cramer on Thursday. The CEO admitted that his bearishness on the PC business came about because customers are buying fewer PCs, but he remained enthusiastic about Intel's wide reach in the market. "There are other places that people are spending their dollars, so I can't come in to you and say, 'This is a revenue growth engine,'" Krzanich said. "But we've been able to grow profitability and we've been driving innovation with our partners, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), HP (NYSE: HPQ), Dell (NYSE: DVMT), Lenovo (Hong Kong Stock Exchange: 992-HK)." Watch the full segment here: As Intel has restructured its operations over the last several years, other areas have outshone the PC business, Krzanich added. What the CEO called Intel's "growth businesses," which include the Internet of Things and data centers, now make up nearly 50 percent of the company's revenue and over 50 percent of its profits, he said. "The products you're going to see over the next couple of years are going to just wow you," he told Cramer. Moreover, Krzanich said the company's recently announced purchase of the Israeli-based autonomous car company Mobileye (NYSE: MBLY) will give Intel a leg up in the fast-growing self-driving vehicle space. "Mobileye was a big stake around autonomous vehicles, and those are going to be cars, [and] within our lifetimes, it's going to be things that fly," the CEO said, adding that Intel would achieve those goals by making each vehicle a complete technological platform. As Intel continues to reinvent itself with initiatives like an ad campaign featuring basketball sensation LeBron James, Krzanich hopes that federal policy will support the profit-driving changes. With talk of repatriation measures and lower corporate tax rates growing louder in Washington, the CEO said the additional cash would be put to use for the benefit of the country, not just Intel. "We're going to go reinvest that money and it's going to be reinvested in factories like we just announced , it's going to be in stock buybacks, it's going to be in all kinds of applications," Krzanich told Cramer. "All of those will be job-creating and wealth-creating for the U.S." Questions for Cramer? Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC Want to take a deep dive into Cramer's world? Hit him up!

Image: Alexander Tolstykh/Shutterstock This week in IoT, Intel unveiled where it plans to develop the latest autonomous driving technology, and Ulster University signed a deal with IoT provider Sigfox. Earlier this week in the world of the internet of things (IoT), details emerged of Apple’s interest in taking on the smart home device market following the success of Amazon Echo and Google Home. It is predicted that Apple will announce a Siri Speaker product at WWDC in June and that the as-yet-unnamed device will be more powerful than its noted rivals, have better sound quality and, in general, be an improvement. In an industry report, KGI’s Ming-Chi Kuo predicts that sales of smart home devices are expected to grow to such a degree that Amazon’s Echo range could outsell the iPad next year. Intel opens new autonomous driving lab Intel hasn’t been shy about wanting to be in the driving seat when it comes to autonomous driving tech. In November of last year, it revealed that the tech giant was to spend $250m on the technology in the coming years. It was announced in January that the company had acquired a 15pc stake in Here to develop self-driving mapping technology. Now, Intel has unveiled its Advanced Vehicle Lab – a physical hub for much of its R&D activities in Silicon Valley, and an addition to its other labs in Arizona, Germany and Oregon. “[The labs] have been created specifically to explore and better understand the various requirements related to self-driving vehicles and the future of transportation, including sensing, in-vehicle computing, artificial intelligence, connectivity, and supporting cloud technologies and services,” Intel said. Intel also said its Autonomous Garage Labs will work with customers and partners to come up with new ways of addressing the data challenge inside the vehicle, across the network and in the data centre. Ulster University signs deal with IoT network, Sigfox Ulster University has become the first university in the UK, and the only commercial organisation in Northern Ireland, to install the low-power IoT technology, Sigfox. As part of the deal, Ulster University will receive a Sigfox base station for future research into wearable devices, remote data analysis, and connected health platforms to further improve patient outcomes within the global healthcare sector. This will entail receiving a wide range of remote healthcare data, from blood analysis, diabetes and heart rate results, to livestock tracking and chemical detection. “This emerging technology offers enormous opportunities for innovation and discovery at Ulster University,” said Dr Philip Catherwood of the university’s Engineering Research Institute. “Ulster University’s engineering students will benefit from the new base station as we plan to deliver dedicated modules on this emerging network.” Actility acquires Abeeway Actility, a major provider of low power wide area networks (LPWAN) announced that it has acquired Abeeway, a geolocation system specialist. The acquisition is Actility’s first following a $75m funding round – earmarked for the acceleration of international growth – backed by new and existing investors. With offices in 10 countries, Actility’s core product is ThingPark, an IoT platform that enables scalable LPWA networks and interoperable IoT applications and services. The acquisition of Abeeway, the company said, will allow it to add greater geolocation capabilities to the platform. “We’ve been rapidly developing our ThingPark location platform to deliver powerful tools to service providers and our customers in the tracking ecosystem,” said Actility CEO Mike Mulica. “We’re creating an IoT location platform that will enable a revolution in the logistics and supply chain sector. In fact, we think that geolocation and tracking are potentially the killer app for the whole of IoT.” Ordering Domino’s can now be an IoT delight Domino’s is one of the last companies you would ever think of when asked to name leaders in IoT innovation, but the past few years have shown the pizza company to be exactly that. You only have to look at some recent examples to see it: you can now order Domino’s through a Messenger chatbot and, in some countries, a drone will deliver your pie. Now, the company has revealed that it has teamed up with IFTTT, an organisation that offers people the ability to connect smart devices for free so that an event in one can trigger an event in another. For example, when using Domino’s tracker, your front porch light could be turned on when your pizza is about to be delivered, letting the driver know where your house is. So far, the service is only available to US residents over the age of 13, but it really is a sign of things to come. Want stories like this and more direct to your inbox?

Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) May 5, 2017 at 8:44AM The Internet of Things (or IoT) is a tech buzzword that many people have heard of but still don't quite understand. The first thing you should know about the IoT is that its definition can be simplified down to the connection of formerly unconnected things to the Internet. If you've ever seen a smartwatch then you've seen the IoT firsthand. But the IoT goes far beyond consumer devices and includes things like internet-connected manufacturing equipment and healthcare devices, all of which allow companies to create new automation processes and track data like never before. To understand the IoT's full impact and how it's changing our world, check out these amazing Internet of Things facts: Image source: Getty Images. 1. Soon there will be tens of billions of IoT devices. And I'm not talking about smartphones and tablets. Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) estimates that there will be 50 billion Internet of Things devices by 2020. And PWC predicts that the number will reach 100 billion by 2021. No matter which estimate is correct, it's very clear the amount of IoT devices is surging. 2. Companies are already earning billions from the IoT. Just last year, Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Internet of Things Group brought in $2.64 billion in revenue, up from $2.3 billion in 2015. Intel earned its IoT revenue from selling processors for automotive, manufacturing, retail and other IoT products and the company is further betting on this market with its recent $15 billion purchase of the advanced driver assistance system-maker Mobileye. 3. Wearable technology has already gone mainstream. Last year, about 102 million smartwatches and wearable devices were shipped, and shipments are expected to jump to nearly 214 million in just three years according to research firm IDC.. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the current leader in the smartwatch market, with an estimated 11.6 million units shipped last year, while Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) remains the overall wearable tech leader with an estimated 22.5 million units shipped in 2016. The consumer wearable tech market is expected to hit $34 billion by 2020. 4. This is much bigger than smartwatches, though. The 125-year-old conglomerate General Electric (NYSE:GE) was an early adopter of IoT technologies, and the company has created its own proprietary software to track data from its Internet-connected industrial equipment. The company already earned $6 billion from its Predix software for connected equipment last year, and GE expects that will reach $15 billion by 2020. GE is tapping into a large sub-sector of the IoT called the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) that's expected to be worth $195 billion by 2025. 5. The market size is staggering. There have been lots of varying estimates about the size of the IoT over the past few years, but the latest IDC data from earlier this year estimates that global IoT spending will reach $1.29 trillion in 2020. 6. Internet-connected devices could transform our health. The heart-rate sensors and step-counters you see now are just the first moves toward using wearable tech for better health. A spin-off of Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) former Life Sciences division, now called Verily, is conducting a years-long study with 10,000 volunteers to monitor health, sleep, activity, etc. using wearable technology and other sensors. Verily and others are hoping to not only track health using wearable tech, but also predict health problems before they become serious. This idea is fostering huge growth in the healthcare IoT segment, which is expected to grow into $158 billion market by 2022.  7. The IoT could help fix food shortages. The IoT is already changing how we grow our food by allowing farmers to use Internet-enabled tractors and equipment to track where seeds were planted, how many were planted, and even when some crops should be harvested. This tech agriculture business is still in it early stages, but IoT installations in the agricultural sector will grow from 30 million in 2015 to 75 million by 2020, according to BI Intelligence. The agricultural sector is ramping up its tech usage in part because the UN expects that the world will need to grow 70% more food in 2050 than it did in 2006, and IoT tech could help make that happen.   Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

With its focus on PC gaming hardware and games software it’s a natural attraction for industry players, where sponsorship will see them cast in a favourable public light. However this year AMD has been usurped as the main sponsor, instead Intel will take that role (AMD isn't even an exhibitor). Also supporting the event will be Bohemia Interactive, Tripwire Interactive, Cygames, and Nexon. Ex professional StarCraft player and eSports commentator Sean Plott will host the event. No information regarding the gazumping of AMD by Intel, to be the main sponsor for the PC Gaming Show, has arrived via official sources. Neither event organiser, PCGamer, nor AMD has mentioned whether AMD withdrew headline sponsorship of its own accord or was outbid, for example. However Intel has made a predictably gushing statement about its sponsorship: "The PC Gaming Show gives an incredible voice to the PC gaming community and Intel is excited to work alongside our industry partners to showcase the strength of the platform," said Gregory Bryant, CVP of the client computing group at Intel. "The state of innovation on the PC has never been stronger and we're thrilled to share what's next at E3." If you are interested in watching the PC Gaming Show live it's not necessary to book tickets for the event at The Theatre at the Ace Hotel in Los Angeles on Monday, 12th June at 10am PDT (6pm in the UK). The event, like so many tech events nowadays, will be live streamed via Twitch, and on platforms such as Facebook Live, YouTube Gaming, and Microsoft Beam. The E3 2017 main show will take place 13-15 June 2017, at the Los Angeles Convention Centre. Other big events at the show will be hosted by the likes of Microsoft, Sony, and Ubisoift.

Posted by afiretruck - Fri 05 May 2017 14:30 “The state of innovation on the PC has never been stronger… ” Yeah, no thanks to Intel, though. I have to wonder if this is a play by Intel to attempt to reduce AMD's gain in the CPU market share.

Junko Yoshida, EETimes 5/5/2017 00:01 AM EDT The semiconductor industry must, at last, outgrow its obsession with pitch shrinkage, and go creative with the "heterogeneous integration of different technologies" to push economic growth. The Intel people might as well keep insisting that Moore’s Law isn’t dead, and that their 14-nm chip can pack more transistors than their rivals. That’s Intel being Intel, with a narrative that serves its purpose. But this story doesn’t necessarily apply to other chip companies looking for a better valuation. Node names have become meaningless. The death of Moore’s Law has been greatly exaggerated, leaving no clear alternative law for chip designers to believe and blindly follow. The semiconductor industry must, at last, outgrow its obsession with pitch shrinkage, and go creative with the “heterogeneous integration of different technologies” to push economic growth, according to Nicky Lu, chairman, CEO and founder of Etron Technology. In short, it’s time to stop using Moore’s Law as a security blanket. Click here to read more ...

Surface Laptop vs Dell XPS 13: Should you wait for Microsoft's new notebook? by Michael Passingham 05 May 2017 0 shares Read Comments Should I buy a Dell XPS 13 or wait for the Surface Laptop? Microsoft’s new Surface Laptop is probably the biggest rival to the Dell XPS 13. With both devices sporting very similar internal specifications and super-attractive designs, the choice between Microsoft’s upstart laptop and what is arguably the best Ultrabook on the market is sure to be a tough one. First up, here are the key differences – and similarities – between the Dell XPS 13 and Surface Laptop. Surface Laptop Dell XPS 13 Processors Dual-core 7th-gen Core i5 or i7 Dual-core 7th-gen Core i5 or i7 Graphics Intel HD 620 or 640 Intel HD 620 Memory 4-16GB 8-16GB Storage 128-512GB SSD 256GB-1TB SSD Weight 1.25kg 1.2-1.29kg Thickness 14.5mm 15mm Screen 13.5-inch 2256x1504-pixel touch screen 13.3-inch Full HD display or 3200x1800-pixel touch screen Ports USB 3.0, 3.5mm audio, mini DisplayPort 2x USB 3.0, SD card, USB-C/ThunderBolt3, 3.mm audio Price £979-2149 £1149-£1799 Surface Laptop vs Dell XPS 13 – Design and features Microsoft has done something a little different with the Surface Laptop. It uses a completely screwless design and comes with an Alcantara fabric wristrest with an all-aluminium outer shell. That shell is offered in four different colours: Platinum, Burgundy, Cobalt Blue, and Graphite Gold. The XPS 13, for its part, uses its own unique take on the laptop design. Its aluminium lid comes in two colours – silver or Rose Gold – along with a carbon-fibre-composite wrist rest that looks superb. It also has the advantage of using an ultra-thin ‘InfinityEdge’ display, which means the bezel surrounding the screen is much smaller than any other laptop on the market. This means the device has a smaller overall footprint as well. The two devices are roughly the same weight, with the Surface laptop tipping the scales at 1.25kg, while the non-touchscreen Dell XPS 13 comes in 50g lighter and the touch model 40g heavier. Thickness is very similar as well, with the Surface laptop just 0.5mm thinner at its thickest point. In other words, both laptops are exceptionally light and very thin. However, the Surface Laptop is rather lacking in terms of wired connectivity. There’s just one USB 3 port on the Surface Laptop, while the Dell XPS 13 gets two, plus a third USB-C connector that also works as a high-speed ThunderBolt 3 adapter. It also gets an SD card reader, something the Surface Laptop lacks. Related: Best laptops Surface Laptop vs Dell XPS 13 – Specs and performance Both laptops are very similar here, coming with a choice of either dual-core Core i5 or i7 processors. They also get high-speed PCIe SSDs and up to 16GB of memory – though the base Surface Laptop model gets just 4GB of memory. We’d always recommend at least 8GB of RAM for such a high-end device. With regards to graphics, some Surface Laptop models get slightly faster Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, compared to the HD Graphics 620 found in the Dell XPS 13. The difference is very minor, however. Related: Best Intel processor Surface Laptop vs Dell XPS 13 – Screen The Dell XPS 13 comes with a choice of screens: a non-touch Full HD model or a touch-enabled 3200 x 1800 pixel panel. Both are excellent, and while we haven’t seen the Surface Laptop’s 2256 x 1504 display in the flesh, we’re optimistic it’ll be a quality piece of kit. Watch this space. Related: Best laptops for students Surface Laptop vs Dell XPS 13 – Software The key difference between the Surface Laptop and the XPS 13 is the version of Windows they’re running, with the Dell XPS 13 shipping with Windows 10 Home, and the Surface coming equipped with Windows 10 S. Windows 10 S is limited to installing apps from the Windows Store, which means you’ll only have access to more basic programs. It looks like you’ll be able to upgrade from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro for a fee, so that extra cost should be factored in if you know you’re going to want a less locked-down version of Windows 10. Related: Windows 10 S laptops Surface Laptop vs Dell XPS 13 – Price and release date The Surface Laptop has a lower starting price than the Dell XPS 13, but that’s largely because Dell doesn’t sell an XPS 13 model with just 128GB of storage and 4GB of memory. When the specs are equalised, at Dell’s base-tier and Microsoft’s second-tier, the Surface comes out cheaper by a small margin – a touchscreen XPS 13 with a Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD will set you back £1299, while a Surface with the same configuration will cost £1249. Don’t need or want a touchscreen? The Full HD model of the XPS 13 costs £1149 at the time of writing. Climb up to the beefier configurations, however, and the Surface Laptop gets very expensive, very fast. A Core i7, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD configuration will cost £2149, while the equivalent Dell model costs just £1549. At this end of the market, we reckon the Dell XPS 13 is much better value. Which laptop is right for you? It might just come down to pricing. The base Surface Laptop with a Core i5 processor looks like a very decent buy for the money, but jump to the Core i7 variant and we have to admit we baulked at the MacBook-esque price – and would opt for the Dell XPS 13 as a result.

Qudos Arena is the venue for Australia’s first Extreme Masters eGaming tournament. Brands such as Intel, St George, Budweiser, Telstra and Virgin, Velocity, Dolby and even sports car manufacturer McLaren are now looking to the world of eGaming as a path into a connected audience, passionate about games. The strength of the market is being tested in Sydney this weekend with the first ever eGaming stadium event expected to draw thousands of game lovers to Sydney’s Olympic park to watch professional gamers fight it out for a six figure prize package. Tim McGregor, managing director of promoter TEG Live, which has brought the Intel Extreme Masters to Australia for the first time – hoping to replicate the model that sees tens of thousands of fans attend events in the US, Asia Europe and Asia, while hundreds of thousands more tune into tournaments through broadcast platforms such as Twitch. “Our intent is to position it as a legitimate sport,” McGregor told Mumbrella “Once that happens in this country it transcends into something which is of mainstream interest because sport lovers in thins country, if they know that they are watching the world’s best, and even better if the world’s best happens to include some Australians, then they gravitate towards it.” Promoter Tim McGregor says Australian sponsors interested in eSports. McGregor said building on the existing audience would create opportunities for brands to get involved. “Pretty much everyone we have spoken to has a strong interest in getting involved and so what we are looking to do is to put together some long-term partnerships and how this might flesh out over the journey,” he said. “It’s going to be a really interesting process because they know there is a large audience of 18-24-year-old males – one of the hardest demographics to reach – they certainly are very interested to see how the event is delivered.” One of the earliest major sponsors to tap into eGaming was Intel, which uses the sport to drive sales of its processors to gamers who use high end computers. Intel marketing director says brand hopes to make games a permanent event in Australia. Marketing manager Anna Torres said on the back of the popularity of broadcasts of eGames – with more than 700,000 views from Australia of a major tournament in Europe last year – the local market was ready for investment from sponsors. “The Australian market is just massively growing in numbers,” Torres said. “It’s a very natural extension for Australia bringing  the Intel Extreme Masters. The event is a massive halo over the brand.” Jonathan Simpson-Bint, founder of IGN.com and now chief commercial officer for gaming streaming platform Twitch, said that streaming of live games and events was opening the door to a very hard to reach demographic. Twitch has evolved into a media platform where players can stream their games live, create content such as game guides, and where major tournaments are also broadcast. “We live in a world of human attention. Not just now people in the media, people in business, we are all competing for slices of an ever-more difficult, ever more rarified piece of human attention,” Simpson-Bint told Mumbrella. Twitch’s Jonathan Simpson-Bint sees huge Australian audiences on the platform. “Twitch has got 120m globals users, every month and the average Twitch user spends 106 minutes per day on Twitch. That is a huge slice out of that attention pool.” He said that the finite pie of attention was being sliced ever thinner. “When I was a kid back in the 80s the pizza pie of my attention was four slices – it was school, homework, soccer and TV and that was about it.” “But the teenagers living in my house today, their pizza pie is cut up into probably two dozen little slivers – TV, school, homework, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, Netflix, Hulu – you name it. I live in the same house as these kids and its virtually impossible to get their attention.” The platform has evolved as a conduit for millennials and Simpson-Bint said advertisers looking to connect were getting involved. “The biggest categories of advertisers we have had have been games companies, obviously, entertainment businesses such as movie studios, cable channels,” he said. Other categories include quick service restaurants. St George Bank represents a new partnership in the Australian market with the banks supporting a competitive gaming league. “One of the things that appeals to people about Twitch and appeals to big brands is they have this opportunity to do something for the community so a lot of big brands do cool things with us, they don’t just come along and whack people over the head with a message, they try and do things such as sponsor tournaments, sponsor streamers and sponsor influencers.” Mumbrella will be tackling a range of sports marketing issues including the future of sports broadcasting at the Mumbrella Sports Marketing Summit on July 21.

Junko Yoshida, Chief International Correspondent 5/5/2017 00:01 AM EDT  2 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet The semiconductor industry must, at last, outgrow its obsession with pitch shrinkage, and go creative with the "heterogeneous integration of different technologies" to push economic growth. The Intel people might as well keep insisting that Moore’s Law isn’t dead, and that their 14-nm chip can pack more transistors than their rivals.  That’s Intel being Intel, with a narrative that serves its purpose. But this story doesn’t necessarily apply to other chip companies looking for a better valuation. Node names have become meaningless. The death of Moore’s Law has been greatly exaggerated, leaving no clear alternative law for chip designers to believe and blindly follow. The semiconductor industry must, at last, outgrow its obsession with pitch shrinkage, and go creative with the “heterogeneous integration of different technologies” to push economic growth, according to Nicky Lu,  chairman, CEO and founder of Etron Technology. In short, it’s time to stop using Moore’s Law as a security blanket.   Late last month when I saw Lu in Taipei, he launched a long disquisition on how Moore’s Law “has already gone virtual,” with Intel’s introduction of a “non-planar” transistor structure for its 22nm technology. Niky Lu (Pohto: EE Times) Lu suspects that Intel wouldn’t appreciate him calling Moore’s Law “virtual.” But Moore’s Law, in his opinion, long ago stopped serving chip engineers as a technology guide. Instead, Moore’s Law has been serving the investment community as “an economic law that justifies return on investment,” he explained. As long as investors use it as a yardstick for the semiconductor industry’s growth, chip vendors feel they can’t afford to acknowledge the obsolescence of Moore’s Law. Even Lu doesn’t exactly declare Moore’s repeal. But it’s important for the semiconductor industry to acknowledge that the industry “changed the rules of the game” when Intel -- followed by TSMC and Samsung -- opted for a tri-gate structure [known as FinFET], Lu noted. “The semiconductor industry replaced line scaling (transistor size) with area scaling (miniaturizing the unit area),” thus fundamentally changing the very nature of Moore’s Law, Lu said.  In Lu’s view, it’s critical to recognize that the semiconductor industry is no longer following the original template. Moore’s Law survived not by the shrinkage of the traditional transistor, but by riding variety of techniques -- including advancements in packaging.

These are not in place of Moore's Law, they are in addition to it.   The industry is not obsessed with mindless shrinking, the industry is obsessed with persisting with the continued extraction of economic value from Moore's Law.  If and when such economic value ceases to be delivered, Moore's Law will be enshrined in our museum.  Until then, it is a good obsession to try and delay that point. I think the obsession that needs shedding is the one some of us have with the demise of Moore's Law.  We erroneously view Moore's Law as legacy waiting to yield to a new Era, a villain that will be vanquished by the next revolution worthy of labels such as silicon 4.0, an already dead tune of our industry that we can no longer sing to.  I think we should just let Moore's Law be. We should let the chasers of Moore's Law chase.  Ultimately, it is not our brilliant analysis, rather economics, which will determine when that chase ends.

Self-Driving Cars Feel Like Death Traps - Can We Be Convinced Otherwise? Kristen V. Brown May 5, 2017, 2:00pm ⋅ Filed to:  automotive autonomous cars intel self-driving cars technology Share Since we're all friends here on the internet, I'll let you in on a little secret: I hate driving. I drive too slowly, lurch violently when I change lanes, and the thought of having to merge onto a speeding California highway makes my heart speed up a little even as I write this. I'm no good at driving and never have been. Delphi's autonomous car outfitted with Intel technology. Image: Intel All of this should probably make me an enthusiastic supporter of emergent self-driving car technology. And yet, as I sat in the backseat of an autonomous Audi outfitted with the latest tech from Intel and Delphi for a test-drive, I was instead overwhelmed by mistrust and suspicion. Had my driver been a human, I probably would have marvelled jealously at the fact that the car maintained perfect speed and actually signalled before every turn. Instead, when it changed lanes too abruptly before a right turn once, I remarked to my tour guide that the ride was just a tad too bumpy. The car was definitely a much better driver than I will ever be. But for the price of putting my trust in a machine, that still didn't seem quite good enough. On Wednesday, at Intel's San Jose headquarters, the company opened the doors to its new research centre for autonomous vehicles to the press, and showed off the first of 40 BMW 7 Series self-driving cars that any day now will join the fleets of autonomous vehicles on the Bay Area's roads. Intel is building the computing platforms for cars in partnership with the car technology company Delphi and Mobileye, which makes vision systems for self-driving cars. Intel wants to be the brains inside every single autonomous vehicle out there. At the event, it showcased its latest attempts to overcome the many technical hurdles to getting autonomous vehicles on the road, including efforts to develop a bonafide 5G wireless network that moves massive amounts of car sensor data between cars and the cloud, to make a power-efficient deep learning system and maps that change in real time to give cars the ability to see more than just its sensors allow. As complicated as all that sounds though, people like me may present an even bigger hurdle to the widespread adoption of the technology. I'm a technology reporter, I know the numbers. More than 30,000 people die on the road every year in the US, and a majority of those deaths are attributed to human error. Unlike a computer, we can't help but fiddle with the radio or sneak a peek at a text. And yet, when I realised that the driver who had piloted that autonomous Audi out of the parking lot had taken her hands off the wheel, I freaked out. Every jerk of the car was a surefire signal that I was on my way to meet an untimely death at the hands of an invisible operator. Most of those 30,000 some-odd roadside deaths don't make the papers. But every one of the handful of incidents involving autonomous vehicles has — even when the self-driving car was not at fault. "The industry has a lot of technological problems to solve," Matt Yurdana, the creative director for Intel's Internet of Things Experiences Group, told me. "But just as important are the interactions with people. How do people feel comfortable, psychologically, in one of these cars?" In other words, if you're going to get into a car, you're going to have to trust it first. Like so many fears, our fears of self-driving cars are probably illogical. They're still there. You may have seen a self-driving car from Google or Uber before. They look weird, with all kinds of protruding sensors and often more junk taking up a whole lot of space in the trunk. The autonomous Audi I rode in had none of that. Its 26 sensors were all fashioned so that you probably wouldn't notice them unless you were looking for them. Its trunk was free of computational junk. And, most importantly, in place of your everyday GPS display was a screen that showed you exactly what the car was seeing. Outlined was its trajectory, so you could see where it planned to go on the road. If the car planned to turn right, a blinker appeared on the screen's right-hand side. If it was stopped at a light, the traffic light appeared on screen, along with others in its field of vision in a more transparent relief behind it, so that you could have confidence it was reading the right light. The Delphi Autonomous Audi. Image: Intel The idea here was to make the car's actions more transparent — turning it from a mysterious, opaque machine into something consumers understand. Uber's pilot project has taken a similar approach, testing how much information about the car consumers need to feel safe. Other self-driving cars, instead, seem to hope that the magic of the technology will dazzle you enough to win you over. The minimalist interior of Google's prototype car doesn't even have a steering wheel, let alone a neat user interface to let you in on what the computer is up to. Unsurprisingly, Google has since abandoned that vision and is instead now piloting more normal-looking vehicles, because getting its vision of weird toy cars out of the workshop and onto the road was just too difficult. Intel isn't actually interested in designing consumer-facing user interfaces for vehicles. But, Yurdana told me, it does want to understand how to make the best human-machine interfaces so that it can build the technologies to support it. Yurdana's group is focused on researching and prototyping different human-machine interfaces to help its partners address issues of consumer trust. I told him about my experience in the autonomous Audi, where I felt less safe than I had when I'm driving, even though the car was certainly a more skilled driver. "That's because you didn't have control," he said. Making consumers feel comfortable, he said, will be in part rooted in giving them some control. He demonstrated for me a prototype of a hypothetical app for hailing an autonomous Uber or Lyft. From the app, the car allowed me to select if I wanted it to do things like flash its headlights so I could see it better on a crowded street. When it pulled up, it flashed my name on the window and prompted me to unlock the door from a phone. Once I was in, I had to enter a pin code and then hold down a button that said "Go" for four seconds. Once the ride started, the car kept me abreast of the route and any changes to it not just on the phone screen, but also on two other screens within the car. It was all about communication — allowing the car to communicate its actions to me, and then giving me options for communicating back to it. The interface for a hypothetical autonomous ride-hailing app. Image: Intel Yurdana said that redundant communication systems will be vital for getting people on board. The car should let the passenger know everything that its doing in multiple ways across multiple screens. The company plans to test the system soon on people to gather feedback on what made them feel most comfortable. Image: Intel Given all the thought that seemed to have been put into making these autonomous cars people-friendly, I asked Delphi CEO Glen De Vos about my bumpy ride. The aggressiveness of the car, he said, was all part of the car's personality. "Two years ago, it drove like my grandma, and that was even more aggravating," he said. "The ride quality has to feel natural, and like we expect." In different places, he said, cars might be "tuned" to drive differently or consumers might even be able to change their driving behaviour themselves. In California, our reputation for aggressive on-road behaviour seems to have made its way into our self-driving cars. In the end, De Vos said nothing will probably do more to create consumer confidence in cars than exposure. By way of explanation, he pointed to the example of the elevator. Initially, elevators were considered such complicated pieces of technology that they required operators. In 1900, a company created the first-ever driverless elevator. But for decades after, they never caught on. "People had visions of things like the driverless elevators chopping them in half," said De Vos. It took an elevator operator strike that nearly shut down New York City in 1945 before people were willing to fully embrace the driverless lift. By that example, it may be an awfully long time before we're willing to turn over the wheel to a computer. I had taken an Uber from Oakland to Intel's San Jose headquarters, in part because of my aforementioned hatred of the road. On the way back, my driver was awful. He got lost en route to the freeway, despite the fact that his phone had turn-by-turn navigation. He merged onto the highway at a horrifying 65km/h, inviting a chorus of angry honks. He was a worse driver than me. Had I instead hailed one of Uber's pilot autonomous vehicles, I'm certain it would have been a smoother, faster ride. And yet, as he swerved across two lanes of traffic as he tried to answer a call, I was still more relaxed than I had been in the back of the autonomous Audi a few hours earlier.

It's also not looking like an all-in, or all-out decision. If I want a self-driving vehicle and my neighbour doesn't, so be it! Considering Waymo have an almost commercial operation going in Phoenix, it doesn't matter what any of us think anymore, it's here. Reply 0 lee978 @978lee May 5, 2017, 3:30pm I think it's going to take time to adapt but we will. Reply 1 skrybe @skrybe May 6, 2017, 1:34pm Interesting article. One thing; Most of those 30,000 some-odd roadside deaths don't make the papers. But every one of the handful of incidents involving autonomous vehicles has — even when the self-driving car was not at fault. This is perfectly understandable. The technology is still new and not really widely adopted yet. So it makes sense that every incident (or accident) would be rigorously scrutinized not just by the manufacturers but by the media and the general population. As for accidents when it's not the driverless car's fault - they're still things to learn from. Was there a way the car could have avoided the accident if something was done differently? Take a tail-end accident as an example. If the car was capturing data about the vehicle behind it that hit it that could be analyzed. Maybe a pattern of bad driving on the part of the other vehicle could be determined so in future the AI car could detect and proactively deal with other bad drivers. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Why the Bears Might Be Right About Intel Corporation Stock Intel faces tough questions about its long-term growth. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) May 4, 2017 at 7:03PM Shares of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) fell more than 3% on April 28 after the chipmaker posted a mixed first quarter earnings report. Revenue rose 7% annually to $14.79 billion, narrowly missing expectations by about $20 million. Earnings grew 22% to $0.66 per share, beating estimates by a penny. Those headline numbers weren't terrible, but several troubling headwinds likely gave the bears enough reasons to bet against the stock, which has stayed flat since the beginning of the year. Let's examine four reasons why the bears could be right about Intel's future. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. Image source: Intel. 1. AMD strikes back Intel's Client Computing revenue rose 6% annually to $8 billion thanks to rebounding sales of PCs. However, the arrival of AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD) next-gen Ryzen chip in early March represents a dangerous new threat to Intel's current-gen Kaby Lake processors. AMD's benchmarks claim that the top-tier Ryzen 7 1800X matches the 8-core Intel Core i7-6900K in terms of single-threaded performance and beats it by 9% in terms of multi-threaded performance -- for half the price. Since the Ryzen is arriving at a time when PC sales are gradually recovering, many desktop owners might upgrade to systems powered by AMD's processors instead of Intel's. Intel plans to launch its new Coffee Lake processors later this year, but it's unclear if those chips -- built with the same 14nm manufacturing process as Kaby Lake and Ryzen -- can effectively compete against AMD's chips. Intel's next-gen 10nm Cannonlake chips are expected to arrive by the end of 2017, but their actual specs remain sketchy. To top it all off, AMD will soon launch its Naples server processor -- which has more cores and memory channels than Intel's Purley CPU -- to challenge Intel's dominance of the data center market. 2. Qualcomm's big moves AMD isn't the only chipmaker causing headaches for Intel. Mobile chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) also recently collaborated with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to make Windows 10 compatible with its top-tier Snapdragon processors, which indicates that more Snapdragon-powered PCs and 2-in-1s could hit the market soon. Qualcomm also recently launched Centriq 2400, a 64-bit ARM-based processor for servers. Once again, Microsoft lent a helping hand by porting Windows Server to the chip. This development is significant, since the Centriq is a 10nm chip. Intel's 10nm Xeon server chips aren't expected to arrive until next year. Unlike older ARM-based server chips, which specialized in niche tasks instead of directly competing against Intel's powerhouse Xeons, Qualcomm believes that the Centriq can go toe-to-toe with Intel's flagship server chips. 3. Data center blues The fresh competition from AMD and Qualcomm cast a spotlight on the worst figure from Intel's first quarter report -- its Data Center revenues rose just 6% annually to $4.2 billion, missing analyst expectations of $4.35 billion. That's also well below the double-digit annual sales growth which the company claimed that it could achieve back in late 2015. To make matters worse, the Data Center Group's operating margin fell about nine percentage points annually to 35.1% for the quarter, due to increased investments in developing new 10nm manufacturing processes. Intel expects that dip to be temporary, and it expects operating margin for the group to remain between 40%-45% for the year, but that still represents a reduction from its previous forecast of 45%-50%. Those slumping revenues and declining margins could put Intel in a tough spot as AMD, Qualcomm, and others smell blood. 4. Overpaying for Mobileye Intel recently agreed to buy Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY), the world's leading maker of ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems), for over $15 billion. That price was painfully steep, since the company generated just $358 million in sales last year. Intel bought Mobileye because it was clearly falling behind in the connected car market. NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Tegra had established a first-mover's advantage in connected cars, which served as a foundation for launching its Drive PX driverless platform. Qualcomm, meanwhile, will soon become the world's biggest maker of automotive chips after its acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) closes. Intel previously launched Atom Automotive chips for cars, but those chips never gained as much traction as NVIDIA's  or NXP's chips. While it can be argued that Intel needed to buy Mobileye, the all-cash deal will drain its overseas cash (nearly $14 billion at the end of 2016) and greatly reduce its free cash flow ($11.3 billion over the past 12 months). Furthermore, there's no guarantee that buying Mobileye will help Intel counter NVIDIA, which gained Tesla as a Drive PX 2 customer after a fatal crash involving a Mobileye-powered Autopilot platform. The key takeaways Intel probably won't nosedive in the near future, but it probably also won't rally. The company is seemingly slipping behind the tech curve with the ongoing delays of its "tick tock" launch schedule, and it seems ill-prepared to fend off ambitious challengers like AMD and Qualcomm. Therefore, Intel might look like a safe mature tech play with a decent 3% yield, but investors should be wary of the tough headwinds it faces.

AUTOMATION DATA INFRASTRUCTURE INTERNET TRANSPORTATION PERSPECTIVES INSIGHTS GOVTECH.COM FutureStructure_Grey FutureStructure Intel Partners With BMW on Self-Driving Car System The company expects this foray into autonomous driving to leverage and bolster Intel’s strengths. by Ethan Baron, The Mercury News / May 4, 2017 Shutterstock (TNS) -- SAN JOSE — Semiconductor titan Intel has officially jumped into the self-driving car frenzy, throwing itself into battle with Google spinoff Waymo, Apple and a host of other firms. “That is an arms race going on,” said Raj Rajkumar, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University focused on autonomous driving. “I don’t think they are late, but they have to execute, of course.” In an event for press and analysts Wednesday at its “Innovation Campus” in San Jose, Intel unveiled a sleek silver BMW sedan showcasing Intel’s partnership with the German automaker and the computer vision company Mobileye that Intel is buying. RELATEDIntel to Break into Virtual Reality, Autonomous VehiclesIntel Acquires Mobileye, Makes $15 Billion Bet on Self-Driving VehiclesColorado Taps Intel Exec to Lead State Broadband Office The partnership is intended to let Intel develop a “base functionality platform” for self-driving cars that it would license to car makers, said Intel spokeswoman Marcie Miller. The Santa Clara firm’s move comes as its business has been on the upswing after it missed the mobile-computing revolution and saw PC sales falter before it pivoted toward cloud computing and development of 5G wireless networks. Autonomous cars represent another new frontier in technology markets. “It’s very wise for them to diversify,” Rajkumar said. Intel’s semiconductor chips would act as the “brains” for an autonomous-driving system, Miller said. The chips would process data from vehicles’ sensors within the vehicle, as well as in Intel’s self-driving system, and for processing autonomous-vehicle data in the cloud, Miller said. The foray into autonomous driving will leverage and bolster Intel’s strengths, including its data centers, its work on 5G networks, and its processors, said Kathy Winter, vice-president of the firm’s Automated Driving Group. “It plays well to all of the things that we are already doing, and it’s another way to extend those businesses,” Winter said. Or, as AutoPacific analyst George Peterson said, “it’s a way to sell chips.” Intel’s gambit puts it up against companies from a variety of technology sector, analysts said. “One of their primary competitors is going to be Waymo, of course, they’re well ahead,” Peterson said. Another rival will be Apple, which probably won’t build a car but instead produce autonomous-driving software and possibly some hardware modules, Peterson said. In an additional arena of competition, Intel will do battle with companies like Bosch making components for self-driving systems, and in yet another competitive realm, Intel will strive against companies with expertise in mapping — including Google, Magellan and TomTom — that’s crucial to autonomous driving systems, Peterson said. Car makers like Ford and GM also represent competition for Intel’s self-driving efforts, along with Uber, which is testing autonomous vehicles, and smaller firms such as Aurora Innovation, co-founded by Google’s former self-driving project head Chris Urmson, Rajkumar said. Another chipmaker, Santa Clara’s NVIDIA, will put additional competitive pressure on Intel, via NVIDIA processors used within autonomous cars — including all Teslas sold in the last six months — and for processing self-driving vehicle data in the cloud, said Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead. Whether a dominant autonomous-driving player will emerge with a widely used platform, or whether car makers will pull technology from a variety of sources remains to be seen, Peterson said. The BMW 740i showcased Wednesday is a prototype for the “iNext” electric car that BMW plans to put on the market in 2021, with self-driving capabilities falling somewhere between mostly driving itself but needing human backup, and full autonomy, said BMW advanced technology engineer Kyle Moy. Intel in November announced a partnership with Israeli self-driving technology company Mobileye, and in March, it announced it was buying the company for about $15 billion. It is Mobileye’s machine-vision technology that will act as the “eyes” of the BMW prototype. Intel, by its own admission, missed the mobile revolution. And with the company netting more than half its sales from shipment of PCs as of 2016, five straight years of falling PC sales led Intel last year to announce it would cut 12,000 jobs and focus on chips for the cloud and Internet-connected devices. However, Intel’s fortunes have swung upward of late, with CEO Brian Krzanich in the company’s latest earnings report highlighting record first-quarter revenue of $14.8 billion, and looking toward self-driving car technology. ©2017 the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)

According to Google security developer Matthew Garrett, vulnerable systems that are set up to use AMT and have the feature provisioned by an organization could give an attacker serial console access, allow for arbitrary code execution in the operating system's kernel, or provide a way to boot a hostile operating system over a network. One of the headaches with this vulnerability is figuring out which systems are actually affected. According to Intel, only systems with support for its Active Management Technology, Intel Standard Manageability, and the now-defunct Intel Small Business Technology features have the prerequisites to get owned by the bug. Those technologies are a part of the vPro technology suite for businesses. Intel AMT bug is bad, but your consumer PC probably doesn't even have this option in the firmware, much less the necessary AMT provisioning pic.twitter.com/MTh4MEjQUN — Jeff Kampman (@jkampman_tr) May 5, 2017 Furthermore, those systems would have to be provisioned by a system administrator (i.e. set up) to use AMT, ISM, or SBT for the vulnerability to be exploited remotely. A separate but related vulnerability would allow an attacker to provision an affected system locally and gain privileges on that system, but rule of thumb: once an attacker has local access to your PC, all bets are off anyway. If you're a regular Joe or Jane, there's probably little reason to worry about this exploit on your home PC. Intel's P-series, B-series, H-series, and Z-series consumer chipsets aren't compatible with these remote management features, so they could never be provisioned for remote management in the first place. As far as we're aware, one would need a Q-series motherboard (or other business-friendly chipsets) to be vulnerable to the local provisioning exploit to begin with, and only business PCs that are already provisioned for Intel AMT can be taken advantage of over the network. If you're in a large corporation's IT department, however, we feel for you. With that baseline established, we can look at what is vulnerable. Intel says versions of its manageability firmware ranging back to version 6.0.x are affected. That firmware is associated with AMT-ready versions of Intel's 5-series motherboards, which hosted Lynnfield and Clarkdale Core CPUs back in 2009. The vulnerability is present in all management firmware ranging up to that of the Q270 chipset that can underpin Skylake and Kaby Lake chips. Here's a listing of the vulnerable firmware versions and the updated version that removes the vulnerability for each chipset: PC and component manufacturers are responsible for making these firmware updates available, however, so if a particular OEM is slow to act (or never acts, as the case may be for some older systems), Intel has released a guide users can follow to mitigate the vulnerability on their own. Intel has also released a detection guide and software tool to help IT pros determine whether their systems are vulnerable. The vulnerability was discovered by embedded device security company Embedi. The researchers there have published a whitepaper detailing the exact cause of the bug for those who want the nitty-gritty. If you're a system administrator who uses Intel's AMT or similar technologies with your PCs, we'd be auditing those systems ASAP.

Advantech’s AIMB-242 is not a thin Mini-ITX board like the similarly 6th Gen Skylake-based AIMB-285, but it is billed as “industrial.” Advantech has already released a full-height Skylake Mini-ITX called the AIMB-275. AIMB-242 (left) and block diagram (click images to enlarge) Unlike those models, the AIMB-242 supports quad-core Skylake EQ series with Intel QM170 chipset and a Xeon E3 model with a CM236 chipset. The EQ models include the 2.0GHz, 25W TDP Core i7-6822EQ, as well as the 2.8GHz i7-6820EQ and 2.7GHz i5-6440EQ, both with 45W TDPs. The 2.8GHz, server-class Xeon E3-1515M v5 also has a 45W TDP. The only difference among the different models is that the Xeon supports 0 to 50°C operation while the others top out at 0 to 40°C. In all cases, 0.7m/s air flow is required. (CPU coolers are optional.) The boards also promise ESD level 4 protection. Linux and Windows Embedded Standard 7 are supported, as well as Advantech software APIs and the WISE PaaS/RMM device remote monitoring and management software. Advantech has been claiming WISE PaaS/RMM compatibility with its products for some time now, but only this week did it formally announce availability. AIMB-242 rear I/O view (click image to enlarge) The 170 x 170mm AIMB-242 supports up to 32GB DDR4 2133 via dual sockets, and provides dual SATA 3.0 connectors, as well as an M.2 B-key expansion interface for SSD and 3G. There are also dual mini-PCIe slots, one of which offers mSATA support, and a PCIe x16 interface. Triple display support is provided with dual DisplayPort++ 1.2 ports and an HDMI 2.0 port, all with 4K resolution. You also get dual-channel LVDS, which can be swapped out for eDP. Dual GbE ports are provided, as well as 8x USB 3.0 ports and an internal USB 2.0 connector. The AIMB-242 is further equipped with a coastline RS-232 port and audio jacks, plus an RS-232/422/485 interface, 8-bit GPIO, and a watchdog. Options include various cables and a Mini-ITX chassis with 150W ATX power supply.   Further information The AIMB-242 is available now at an undisclosed price. More information may be found in Advantech’s AIMB-242 announcement and product page.   Related posts: "Thin Mini-ITX" Skylake board has 20mm profile First embedded-focused Skylake Mini-ITX SBCs arrive Kaby Lake board lineup includes a Mini-ITX SBC and two COMs Fanless Mini-ITX SBC packs high-end Intel Skylake SoCs Stainless steel industrial PC has a Skylake Mini-ITX core Advantech’s first five Apollo Lake SBCs include Mini-ITX,… Industrial focused Mini-ITX board packs Skylake punch Compact fanless SBC runs Linux on Skylake, features 4K video Industrial thin Mini-ITX runs on 7th Gen Intel CPUs Mini-ITX triplets run Fedora on Skylake (advertise here) PLEASE COMMENT BELOW Please comment here...

Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) announced Friday that he asked the White House and intelligence services to learn if he had been spied on by U.S. officials. I have formally requested from the WH and the Intel Committees info on whether I was surveilled by Obama admin and or the Intel community! — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) May 5, 2017 He previously asked on Twitter if the Obama administration spied on other Americans, including politicians, reporters, or judges. Did the Obama admin go after presidential candidates, members of Congress, journalists, clergy, lawyers, fed judges? https://t.co/h7rsjvNLHM — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) May 5, 2017 Did the Obama admin use warrantless “wiretapping” on other candidates besides @realDonaldTrump? https://t.co/h7rsjvNLHM — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) May 5, 2017 He linked to a media story in which Circa sent a letter to the White House and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, asking them to provide the number of Americans gathered in foreign intelligence who identifies were later revealed. Paul later explained the Tweets in an interview with Breitbart. “We’ve had several people come to us and say that it happened,” he said. “I don’t have access to that information, but I’ve been very concerned that too many Americans’ information is being culled through without a warrant.” Paul already sent Trump a letter on April 10 asking if his name or the names of other lawmakers had been unmasked or queried or both in intelligence reports of intercepts during the Obama administration. We reached out to the White House for comment. President Donald Trump has accused his predecessor Barack Obama of running a surveillance program on him. FBI Director James Comey told the House Intelligence Committee in March that no evidence existed supporting the claim. However, Trump associates were reportedly incidentally observed as part of spying programs against Russia. A Bloomberg News report said former White House National Security Advisor Susan Rice gave the order to unmask Trump campaign team members in intel reports. Note: This article has been updated to include Senator Paul’s comments to Breitbart, as well as background regarding the report of Rice unmasking Trump campaign team members.

Rand Paul wants to know if he was under surveillance. (George LeVines/CQ Roll Call file photo) Niels Lesniewski @Niels Lesniewski Posted May 5, 2017 2:28 PM Save for later Sen. Rand Paul is renewing a request to know if he was subject to surveillance by the intelligence community during the Obama administration. “This inquiry goes beyond just myself and my office,” the Kentucky Republican said in a statement Friday. “The American people need to know if their elected representatives in the Legislative branch have been swept up in Executive branch surveillance.” In a tweet sent Friday, Paul asked if warrantless wiretaps were obtained for any presidential campaigns, including his own. I have formally requested from the WH and the Intel Committees info on whether I was surveilled by Obama admin and or the Intel community! — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) May 5, 2017 The Kentucky Republican actually sent a letter in April to President Donald Trump saying that he had an anonymous source alleging that the senator and other members of Congress were unmasked or queried during the Obama administration. Paul renewed that request Friday, circulating the letter publicly. “In light of the revelations that the names of persons associated with the Trump campaign were unmasked, I believe the allegations that myself and other elected members of the legislative branch may have also been unmasked or caught in intelligence gathering warrants investigation,” Paul wrote in the original April 10 letter to Trump. The move to go public follows a report from the website Circa requesting Trump use his presidential authority to declassify information on surveillance of Americans under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The legal authorities for such searches and queries under FISA are due for reauthorization, as the current authority is set to lapse at the end of 2017. When not answering questions about the 2016 presidential election, FBI Director James B. Comey spent much of an appearance Wednesday at the Senate Judiciary Committee touting the importance of the powers and pushing for renewal. Judiciary Chairman Charles E. Grassley of Iowa said that his panel will not take up reauthorization of Section 702 surveillance program before at least July, and it would likely not occur until after the August recess.

Rand Paul is asking the White House and government intelligence agencies to hand over any evidence it has that he was spied on by former President Barack Obama.

Last month, Paul said on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" that it would be a "big deal" if Obama ordered such a wiretap of or knew about names of Trump's transition staff that were unmasked during surveillance activities. "If the outgoing administration was actually, literally sifting through things, and if part of the administration said [it was] going to scatter and get as much information, scatter it out there publicly to try to harm the Trump administration, this was a witch hunt," he said. His comments came after Bloomberg's Eli Lake reported White House lawyers discovered in March that former National Security Adviser Susan Rice had asked for the names of people captured during surveillance in connection with Trump's transition and campaign.

"Mr. Page must supply the requested documents to the Committee. As our letter indicated, the requested documents must be provided in advance of any interviews the Committee may conduct," they said.  Stone separately told The New York Times that he would follow the committee's request: I am "eager, indeed anxious, to testify in full public session, have requested no immunity and am ready to go," he said.   The Senate Intelligence Committee is currently probing Russia's interference in the presidential election and any ties between the Trump campaign and Moscow. All four men have denied helping Russia influence the election. Tags Richard Burr Mark Warner   View the discussion thread.

There have been reports of them hitting 90C (194°F), which is uncomfortably close to the 100C (212°F) threshold. TechSpot's features editor Steve Walton touched on this in a video for Hardware Unboxed back in February. Following three months of complaints, Intel has finally issued a response on the company’s community forums: it says there is no problem with the CPUs. “The reported behavior of the 7th Generation Intel Core i7-7700K Processor, showing momentary temperature changes from the idle temperature, is normal while completing a task (like opening a browser or an application or a program),” writes the chipmaker. “In our internal investigation, we did not observe temperature variation outside of the expected behavior and recommended specifications. For processor specifications, please refer to the Intel Core i7-7700K Processor Product Specifications.” Despite everything being "normal," Intel is advising owners not to overclock their i7-7700K processors. Yes, the ones with unlocked multipliers that are meant to be overclocked. "We do not recommend running outside the processor specifications, such as by exceeding processor frequency or voltage specifications." For those who are mostly concerned about the noise of the cooling fans whirring up and down as the temperatures spike, Intel says: “Most motherboard manufacturers offer customizable fan speed control settings that may allow for smoother transition of fan revolutions per minute (rpm). Please consult your motherboard manufacturer’s manual or website for instructions on how to change default fan speed control settings.” Unsurprisingly, users aren’t happy with Intel’s findings. “3 months waiting for Intel to come out with a solution , and now this ?! This is all you can say ?! We know already what you've just said .. You know what never mind this would be my last product from Intel,” wrote forum member Meedy. Overclocking a chip does void Intel’s warranty (unless you take out its Performance Tuning Protection Plan), and some affected users did say they de-lidded the affected processors, which can cause problems. But Intel’s line that there’s nothing at all wrong with the chips and that people really shouldn’t overclock them is making for some very unhappy customers.

Rand Paul announced Friday that he has sent a formal request to the White House and the House and Senate intelligence committees for information about whether he had ever been surveliled by the Obama administration — apparently in response to a report this week on National Security Agency policies under the former administration. “I have formally requested from the WH and the Intel Committees info on whether I was surveilled by the Obama admin and or the Intel Community!” Paul wrote on Twitter, the third in a series of tweets Friday morning that linked to a report from Circa on NSA surveillance during the Obama administration. Paul did not provide any evidence to show he was a target of surveillance, and nothing in the article he shared directly suggested that he was. CNN has reached out to President Barack Obama’s representatives and have not yet received a response. The report from Circa detailed the Obama administration “expanded efforts” to search NSA intercepts of Americans’ foreign communications and to loosen the rules on sharing that information — the sort of “unmasking” that led to former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s ouster. The report examined the changes, which were instituted in 2011, within the context of the 2016 election. The report also alleged that members of Congress and their staff were “among those whose names were unmasked” in 2016 and 2017, which is likely what prompted Paul’s announcement. President Donald Trump accused the Obama administration in March of wiretapping Trump Tower last year, a charge Obama and intelligence leaders in his administration consistently denied. Congressional leaders investigating the claim have repeatedly said they’ve seen no evidence that Trump or Trump Tower was wiretapped. CNN reported last month that the FBI did gather intelligence last summer suggesting that Russian operatives tried to use Trump advisers, including former foreign policy adviser Carter Page, to infiltrate the Trump campaign, according to US officials. As part of that process, the FBI sought and received a warrant from a secret court that oversees the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to monitor Page’s communications.

Scott Applewhite, file By Alex Pappas, The Washington Examiner Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said Friday he has formally requested information on whether he was ever under surveillance by the Obama administration or the intelligence community. In a Friday morning tweet, the former Republican presidential candidate said: "I have formally requested from the WH and the Intel Committees info on whether I was surveilled by Obama admin and or the Intel community!" The former Republican presidential candidate also asked in a tweet: "Did the Obama admin go after presidential candidates, members of Congress, journalists, clergy, lawyers, fed judges?" President Trump has accused former President Barack Obama of surveilling him during an election, a claim the former president has disputed. It's been revealed that intelligence officials did pick up conversations of some people involved in the Trump's campaign, though by legal incidental collection. Paul also tweeted: "Did the Obama admin use warrantless "wiretapping" on other candidates besides @realDonaldTrump?"

It can be tough to admit you need some junior college help because it’s basically admitting that somewhere along the way, you missed. If you were doing well at all phases of recruiting, a juco player is never needed. But Oklahoma hasn’t always struck it big, especially when it comes to defensive line. http://www.scout.com/player/184159-emmit-gooden?s=73 Defensive line coach Calvin Thibodeaux appears to be in agreement with that and is now attacking the junior college circuit, namely Independence (Kan.) CC defensive tackle Emmitt Gooden, who is 6-foot-4 and 305 pounds. Gooden, originally from Tennessee, said he is going to make his first trip to Norman this weekend, arriving Saturday and spending the entire day at OU. He will be in his sophomore season this fall, meaning he will have three years to play two seasons’ worth of eligibility, and though not from the area, seems like the OU offer meant something. “OU surprised me,” said Gooden about what offer was shocking. “With that fan base and that tradition, that means a lot. And hearing from Gerald McCoy.” https://twitter.com/Geraldini93/status/856985063476654082 That’s not Gooden misspeaking. Former OU star and current Tampa Bay Bucs star defensive tackle Gerald McCoy tweeted to Gooden a day following his offer. Gooden thought it was a joke at first until he saw it was the real deal. He saw all the Twitter notifications and had no clue until he checked it out. Gooden isn’t quite sure yet who will see the campus with him, either a teammate or his father, but he’s definitely ready to see what OU has to offer. “I want to see the facility and get a feel of Norman,” Gooden said. Thibodeaux hasn’t been in the picture long, but he’s making it up with how frequently he’s there now. It was two weeks ago when Thibodeaux got in touch with Gooden and said he would be visiting the school the following week. Last Monday, Thibodeaux arrived at Independence and officially made the offer. “I kind of knew it was coming, but it still meant a lot,” Gooden said. “We talk every day now. Every day. Text. FaceTime. I know they’re lacking defensive tackles, and Coach Thibs said I’m a top guy and one of their big targets.” Gooden doesn’t have a timetable in his head right now. He’s coming off a trip to Arkansas and will see OU this weekend before closing up shop. He said he wants to make all five of his official visits before making the choice with no plans of making any in the summer. But there’s a qualifier in there. Gooden said the last time he felt everything fell perfectly into place was when he was a sophomore in high school at junior day for Tennessee. He committed to the Vols. If the OU visit goes well, then what? “I don’t know,” Gooden said. “I’m looking for fit and family. Last time around I think I got caught up in the hype. This time around I’m going to be picking the right school to me.”   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout Jalen Redmond getting full-court press by OU OU 'wish list' - Offensive tackle OU's 'wish list' - Interior OL OU making its push for DaShaun White Emmit Gooden ready to see OU Share & Embed 4-Star Tavion Thomas To Take All 5 Officials Full Story Sooners Illustrated Top Stories Sooner Intel: OU & art of the deal Intel returns talking about OU and its ability to close the deal for #ST2K18. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedYesterday at 6:05 AM Jalen Redmond getting full-court press by OU Intel returns with an update on OU defensive target Jalen Redmond. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedYesterday at 6:02 AM OU making its push for DaShaun White Intel returns with an update on OU linebacker target DaShaun White. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedYesterday at 5:55 AM OU 'wish list' - Offensive tackle OU's 'wish list' continues on, looking at offensive tackle where Bill Bedenbaugh is ready to reload. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedThursday at 9:48 AM OU's 'wish list' - Wide receiver The OU 'wish list' rolls on at wide receiver where there are zero commits but plenty of targets. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedWednesday at 9:46 AM OU spring questions revisited: Defense Did OU answer the defensive questioned asked by Sooners Illustrated during the spring? by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedWednesday at 8:03 AM OU offers QB Adrian MartinezOU has made its first move in the 2018 quarterback search, offering Adrian Martinez. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedTuesday at 1:12 PM OU's 'wish list' - Running back OU's offensive 'wish list' continues, taking a look at running back for #ST2K18. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedTuesday at 10:03 AM OU's 'wish list' - Interior OL OU's offensive 'wish list' comes to a close with a look at the interior guys. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedYesterday at 5:51 AM OU spring questions revisited: General wrapup Conclude our look back at OU's spring questions with some general inquiries and whether Sooners answered them during practice. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedThursday at 8:10 AM Przybylo podcast: OU recruiting roundupThe BoneMan Show returns recapping the latest recruiting news for OU in Miguel Edwards and Adrian Martinez. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedWednesday at 10:35 AMLoad More NCAA Teams Forums Basketball BB Recruiting Football FB Recruiting JC Football NFL Teams Forums Fantasy News Free Agents Draft MLB Teams Forums News Top Prospects Scouting Home Handy Cooking Gardening Tailgater More Hunting Fishing Warrior Golf NBA High School Other App Membership Tickets CBS Sports Sign In Sign Up 247 SportsCBS Sports Digital Back To Top Twitter Facebook Instagram RSS Feed About Advertisers Press Help Contact Privacy Policy Terms of Service Careers © 2017 Scout.com All rights reserved Javascript must be enabled to view this page.

Read the original article. The first Thursday in May is World Password Day, but don’t buy a cake or send cards. Computer chip maker Intel created the event as an annual reminder that, for most of us, our password habits are nothing to celebrate. Instead, they – and computer professionals like me – hope we will use this day to say our final goodbyes to “qwerty” and “123456,” which are still the most popular passwords. Quotes in the article Intel Corp INTC ▼ 36.82 -0.03 -0.08% Yahoo! Inc YHOO ▲ 48.49 +0.04 +0.08% Adobe Systems Inc ADBE ▲ 134.84 +0.23 +0.17% The problem with short, predictable passwords The purpose of a password is to limit access to information. Having a very common or simple one like “abcdef” or “letmein,” or even normal words like “password” or “dragon,” is barely any security at all, like closing a door but not actually locking it. Hackers’ password cracking tools take advantage of this lack of creativity. When hackers find – or buy – stolen credentials, they will likely find that the passwords have been stored not as the text of the passwords themselves but as unique fingerprints, called “hashes,” of the actual passwords. A hash function mathematically transforms each password into an encoded, fixed-size version of itself. Hashing the same original password will give the same result every time, but it’s computationally nearly impossible to reverse the process, to derive a plaintext password from a specific hash. Instead, the cracking software computes the hash values for large numbers of possible passwords and compares the results to the hashed passwords in the stolen file. If any match, the hacker’s in. The first place these programs start is with known hash values for popular passwords. More savvy users who choose a less common password might still fall prey to what is called a “dictionary attack.” The cracking software tries each of the 171,000 words in the English dictionary. Then the program tries combined words (such as “qwertypassword”), doubled sequences (“qwertyqwerty”), and words followed by numbers (“qwerty123”). Moving on to blind guessing Only if the dictionary attack fails will the attacker reluctantly move to what is called a “brute-force attack,” guessing arbitrary sequences of numbers, letters and characters over and over until one matches. Mathematics tells us that a longer password is less guessable than a shorter password. That’s true even if the shorter password is made from a larger set of possible characters. For example, a six-character password made up of the 95 different symbols on a standard American keyboard yields 956, or 735 billion, possible combinations. That sounds like a lot, but a 10-character password made from only lowercase English characters yields 2610, 141 trillion, options. Of course, a 10-character password from the 95 symbols gives 9510, or 59 quintillion, possibilities. That’s why some websites require passwords of certain lengths and with certain numbers of digits and special characters—they’re designed to thwart the most common dictionary and brute-force attacks. Given enough time and computing power, though, any password is crackable. And in any case, humans are terrible at memorizing long, unpredictable sequences. We sometimes use mnemonics to help, like the way “Every Good Boy Does Fine” reminds us of the notes indicated by the lines on sheet music. They can also help us remember a password like “freQ!9tY!juNC,” which at first appears very mixed up. Splitting the password into three chunks, “freQ!,” “9tY!” and “juNC,” reveals what might be remembered as three short, pronounceable words: “freak,” “ninety” and “junk.” People are better at memorizing passwords that can be chunked, either because they find meaning in the chunks or because they can more easily add their own meaning through mnemonics. Don’t reuse passwords Suppose we take all this advice to heart and resolve to make all our passwords at least 15 characters long and full of random numbers and letters. We invent clever mnemonic devices, commit a few of our favorites to memory, and start using those same passwords over and over on every website and application. At first, this might seem harmless enough. But password-thieving hackers are everywhere. Recently, big companies including Yahoo, Adobe and LinkedIn have all been breached. Each of these breaches revealed the usernames and passwords for hundreds of millions of accounts. Hackers know that people commonly reuse passwords, so a cracked password on one site could make the same person vulnerable on a different site. Beyond the password Not only do we need long, unpredictable passwords, but we need different passwords for every site and program we use. The average internet user has 19 different passwords. It’s easy to see why people write them down on sticky notes or just click the “I forgot my password” link. Software can help! The job of password management software is to take care of generating and remembering unique, hard-to-crack passwords for each website and application. Sometimes these programs themselves have vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. And some websites block password managers from functioning. And of course, an attacker could peek at the keyboard as we type in our passwords. Multi-factor authentication was invented to solve these problems. This involves a code sent to a mobile phone, a fingerprint scan or a special USB hardware token. However, even though users know the multi-factor authentication is probably safer, they worry it might be more inconvenient or difficult. To make it easier, sites like Authy.com provide straightforward guides for enabling multi-factor authentication on popular websites. So no more excuses. Let’s put on our party hats and start changing those passwords. World Password Day would be a great time to ditch “qwerty” for good, try out a password manager and turn on multi-factor authentication. Once you’re done, go ahead and have that cake, because you’ll deserve it. Megan Squire is professor of computing sciences at Elon University.

After a rough month of in-state recruiting, the stakes just feel higher for Oklahoma with Midwest City (Okla.) High defensive end/outside linebacker Jalen Redmond. The Sooners were hoping to go 7-for-7 with in-state offers for the 2018 class but right now have three commits with three pledged elsewhere. Getting Redmond could put OU over .500 in that regard. http://www.scout.com/player/207850-jalen-redmond?s=73 And OU is doing whatever it can to make sure Redmond’s ultimate choice is indeed the crimson and cream. Defensive coaches Mike Stoops and Calvin Thibodeaux were back at Midwest City on Thursday to check in on the Scout 300 prospect. Redmond, who had zero varsity experience before last season, became a name to watch with his speed and his explosiveness. A winter and spring full of offers led Redmond to be comfortable enough to release a top six Sunday evening. OU, TCU, Arizona State, Nebraska, Memphis and Kansas State have made the initial cut. “My top six could change, but I wanted to narrow it down,” Redmond said. “Those are the schools that are talking to me the most.” Redmond has to play it by ear as a week like this continues to show him he has no clue what sort of interest is on the horizon. Georgia became the first SEC school to offer Redmond earlier this week, but Redmond said the top six hasn’t changed yet. It’s a top six for a reason because Redmond has developed a bond with those schools and saw four of them in the last month. He made trips to TCU, OU, Nebraska and Kansas State. “Of course, Nebraska stood out the most to me,” said Redmond about which visit made the biggest impression. “They say there’s no place like Nebraska, and now I know why. I really enjoyed it.” Included in that was like an umpteenth trip to Norman as the Sooners have been recruiting Redmond basically as long as any other school outside of Memphis. Whenever Redmond is seen, it’s usually wearing OU apparel. Even if it can make for an awkward moment and photograph. Redmond was on hand last week for Ron Tatum’s announcement last week at Putnam City. Tatum, of course, picked Texas, which was a bit odd for Redmond who was sporting OU colors. And an ensuing picture of Tatum and Redmond together, doing the #HookEm sign. “I had a feeling it was going to be Texas,” Redmond said. “Patrick (Fields) thought it was going to be Texas. It did get kind of awkward, though. I got a lot of stuff on Twitter about that picture. “I told Ron I’d put the Horns up for him, but I wasn’t taking the OU shirt off. He said that was OK so we did it. I’m happy for him. He made the best decision for him and his family.” Now Redmond is trying to do the same. A top six can sometimes imply a decision could be right around the corner, but Redmond is in no rush. He said the plan remains to commit in early December right after his senior season so then he can focus on his senior year of basketball. Redmond, at one time, was considered a dual-sport threat, but he said the last year has absolutely taught him football is the way to go. He loves basketball, but he’s 100 percent dedicated toward football although he will play for the Bombers basketball team one more year. No varsity experience at this time last year, Redmond is in a much different state of mind now. Not hesitating, fully confident in what he’s doing. He said all schools, including OU, see him as an outside linebacker in a 4-3 defensive front where he’s rushing off the edge and playing in coverage. Though no plans to commit anytime soon, Redmond said the Sooners aren’t slowing down. “They let me know a lot how much they want me,” he said. “Patrick (Fields) is always telling me to stay home. It’s still there, that connection. “The spring game trip was a lot like the others, but it was different. I was around Mike Stoops more than usual, and I was really watching the players and seeing where I would fit in.” Redmond and Midwest City begin spring practice May 15.   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout Sooner Intel: OU & art of the deal Jerry's Cowboys Vs.

(YouTube screen grab/CNN)    Here’s What The Senate Intel Committee Wants From Former Trump Adviser Carter Page Chuck Ross Reporter 9:10 AM 05/05/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP The Senate Intelligence Committee has formally requested a private meeting with Carter Page and is asking the former Trump campaign adviser to turn over a slew of documents about any contacts he may have had with Russian government operatives, according to a letter provided to The Daily Caller. “The Committee asks that you make yourself available for a closed interview with designated Committee staff to be scheduled for a mutually agreeable time,” reads the letter, sent last Friday by North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr and Virginia Sen. Mark Warner. The senators also ask Page to provide documents pertaining to his contacts with any Russian businessmen and Trump campaign members — in addition to correspondence with Russian agents. Page volunteered in March to testify publicly before the committee. The request is being made as part of the committee’s probe of Russia’s meddling in the election, including whether any Trump associates were involved. Page, an energy consultant, responded in a letter on Thursday, saying that the committee’s list of demands — five in total — are “cumbersome chores.” By May 9, Burr and Warner want Page to provide a list of all meetings he had with any Russian officials or Russian businessmen from the beginning of the Trump campaign, June 16, 2015, and the Republican’s inauguration, Jan. 20, 2017. (RELATED: Here’s Who Introduced Carter Page To The Trump Campaign) Page was not a member of the campaign for that entire span of time. He was brought on as a foreign policy adviser in March and was kicked off the campaign in September. “For each meeting listed, please include the date, location, all individuals present, and complete copies of any notes taken by you or on your behalf,” the letter states. By May 19, the committee wants Page to provide a list of any meetings of which he is aware between Trump campaign officials and Russian officials or businessmen. The senators also seek all communications between Page and Russians for the same period as well as his communications with any Trump campaign members. (RELATED: FBI Obtained Surveillance Warrant Against Trump Adviser) Lastly, the committee wants records of any financial and real estate investments Page may hold in Russia. The committee has already conducted more than two dozen interviews as part of its investigation, CNN reported last Monday. Democrats on the committee have said that they want the pace of the probe to increase. Page, who worked as a Merrill Lynch banker in Moscow for several years in the 2000s, is a key figure in the committee’s investigation, as well as one being conducted by the FBI. The bureau reportedly obtained a federal surveillance warrant against Page in September, just after he left the Trump campaign. In the application to obtain the surveillance warrant on Page, the FBI reportedly cited the now-infamous dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele. That document alleges Page, acting on the direction of Trump’s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, met secretly with Russian government officials and the president of Russian oil giant, Rosneft, during a trip to Moscow in July. Page was in the Russian capital city to give a speech at the New Economic School. That speech drew attention from American media and the FBI because of Page’s strong criticism of U.S. foreign policy. The FBI opened its investigation weeks after Page’s Moscow trip. Page denies the claims laid out Steele’s report, which he calls the “Dodgy Dossier.” He says he did not collude with Russians to meddle in the election and denies having ever met Rosneft’s president or Manafort. Page has acknowledged meeting some Russian government officials while he was a member of the campaign. He has said he spoke briefly with Russia’s ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, at an event for the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July.

White House officials have said that Page had a negligible role on the campaign. He also never met Trump, they say. (RELATED: Trump Team Asked Carter Page To ‘Cease’ Calling Himself An Adviser) In his response to Burr and Warner, Page did not address the lawmakers’ specific requests. Instead, he railed against President Obama and Hillary Clinton, accusing them of running a smear campaign against him and illegally spying on him by obtaining the surveillance warrant. Page writes of “hate crimes committed against me by the Clinton/Obama regime which were in some part pursued due to my Roman Catholic faith.” He also says he is “committed to helping the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in any way that I can,” but then states that any records he has in his possession are “minuscule in comparison” to the amount of information the Obama administration collected on him with the surveillance warrant. Update: Asked by TheDC if he plans to provide the Intelligence Committee with the documents it is requesting, Page responded: “Let’s see what happens.” Senate Intelligence Committee Letter to Carter Page by Chuck Ross on Scribd Follow Chuck on Twitter Tags: Carter Page, Donald Trump, Russia Hide Comments   Show comments Free News Alerts Privacy: We never share your email Trending Popular Emailed Milo Sues Simon And Schuster For $10 Million, Announces Independent Book Publication Scientists ‘More Confident Than Ever’ In Global Warming After Studying The Lack Of It For 15 Years Washington Post Reporter Warns Journalists To Avoid Tucker Carlson’s ‘Dunk Tank’ Face It, Gays: Trump Is Our Friend Power Move: Gorsuch Opts Out Of High Court Labor Pool MSNBC Guest Curses Live On Air [VIDEO] Macron Campaign Leak Hits Internet How The Alt-Left Promotes Rape And Pedophilia White House Fires Chief Usher Who Was Hired Under Obama In 2011 CONFIRMED: FBI Is Conducting Even More Interviews Over Alleged Jane Sanders Bank Fraud CNN President Complains: ‘Journalism Is Threatened’ By Trump Administration Sections Politics US Opinion Entertainment World Business Sports Tech Featured Partners Columns Ann Coulter Ask Matt Labash Matt Lewis The Mirror DC Trawler Ginni Thomas Corporate About Us Advertise With Us Employment Terms Of Use Privacy Policy Contact Us Follow Facebook Twitter Google+ © Copyright 2010 - 2017 | The Daily Caller

Three models will be on offer, powered by Intel’s Kaby Lake-U SoCs and they come equipped with up to 16 GB of memory, up to 512 GB of SSD storage, Thunderbolt 3, WiGig connectivity (optional), harman/kardon speakers, and security features such as an IR camera, a fingerprint reader, and a TPM 2.0 module. The weight of the clamshell is just around 2.3 pounds (or about 1.05 kilograms), among the lowest in the industry. Now focused primarily on business notebooks rather than laptops for consumers, Toshiba does not make many PC-related announcements these days. Nonetheless, the company continues to develop ultra-portable laptops to compete against rivals. In this space, models such as Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 or Dell’s XPS 13 reign supreme. So this week, Toshiba launched its new Portégé X30 13.3” notebook that combines high performance, connectivity, and security with a low weight that is among the lowest in the class. To reduce the weight of the notebook to around a kilogram, Toshiba used a magnesium alloy for the chassis. This increased the thickness of the laptop to 15.9 mm, but it looks like Toshiba decided that weight reduction and durability is more important than ultimate portability at any cost. The Toshiba Portégé X30 is based on Intel’s Core i5/i7 processor with built-in HD Graphics 620 and Microsoft’s Windows 10 Pro operating system. Depending on the version of the PC, the Portégé X30 can be equipped with 8 or 16 GB of DDR4-2133 memory, and a 256 GB or a 512 GB PCIe SSD. When it comes to connectivity, the new notebook is equipped with an 802.11ac Wi-Fi + BT 4.1 wireless module, optional WiGig (select built-to-order models only), one HDMI output, a microSD card reader, two Thunderbolt 3 ports that can work in DisplayPort 1.2 and USB 3.1 Gen 2 modes, and one USB Type-A header.

For added comfort, the notebook comes with a backlit, spill-resistant keyboard with a trackpoint nub. As for multimedia capabilities, the system has a stereo sub-system featuring speakers co-designed with Harman Kardon that also carry a DTS label. Toshiba’s Portégé X30 laptops are available directly from the company in the U.S. for $1450, $1600 or $1900, depending on configurations. Toshiba sells its Portégé notebooks in other regions as well, albeit in different configs (e.g., machines with a 1366×768 resolution and lower-end CPUs) and at different price points.

So what Toshiba was really saying when they said they were getting out of the consumer notebook market was that they were discontinuing the garbage low-end line and are only building machines worth buying?

Most notably, of course, is the fact that this bundle includes a tier which will get you a copy of Stephen’s Sausage Roll. Enough said, really. Pay what you want Super Mega Baseball: Extra Innings Deadly Tower of Monsters They Bleed Pixels Pay more than the average Hacknet Crashlands UnderRail Pay $10 (around £7.74) or more Stephen’s Sausage Roll Curious Expedition Pay what you want for Humble ‘Very Positive’ Bundle Games that cost less than cup of coffee can’t be bad, right? See for yourself, since GAME is selling digital PC copies of platforming classic Rayman Origins (via Uplay) for 99p. The code will work in any territory but your mileage may vary on price, however. Rayman Origins on PC (Uplay) for 99p from GAME Green Man Gaming is hosting a cross-promotion style sale in conjunction with Intel. The general premise of the sale is to promote games that work at their best when played on an Intel i7 processor. But hey, a sale is a sale and this one has Resident Evil 7 with 36% off.

As you can probably expect, a detective thriller coming from the creator of Lollipop Chainsaw, Let It Die, Killer 7 and No More Heroes, all is not what it seems at first and The Silver Case is quite the ride, to say the least. The Silver Case on PC (Steam) for £9.29 / $11.99 / €11.09 from Humble Store I’m not ashamed to say that Shovel Knight is one of my favourite titles to have seen release in the last few years so, with that in mind, the fact that the little indie game that could is getting its own Official Design Works book release this year, is quite exciting. The book, which covers the making of the game and the history of the company, is up for pre-order at Amazon UK and US right now. Shovel Knight: Official Design Works for £35.99 from Amazon UK Shovel Knight: Official Design Works for $29.78 From Amazon US UK Deals Not satisfied with releasing a brand new console in March (and a miniature console back in November), Nintendo is set to release yet another console this July. The New Nintendo 2DS XL is seemingly a hybrid of the best bits of the 2DS and the New 3DS, with more processing power and a folding, clamshell design. It also looks really slick. Pre-orders are live now and if you put an order down before the end of Sunday 7th May, you can take an extra £10 off by using the code VG10OFF75 during checkout. New Nintendo 2DS XL (Black & Turquoise) for £119.99 using code VG10OFF75 from Amazon UK New Nintendo 2DS XL (White & Orange) for £119.99 using code VG10OFF75 from Amazon UK I suppose it shouldn’t come as any shock that the instant a brand new Call of Duty game gets announced, last year’s model drops to its lowest ever price point. Over at Amazon UK, you can pick up Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare on Xbox One or PS4 (along with some Amazon exclusive pin badges and DLC) for £12.99 while stock lasts. Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare on Xbox One for £12.99 from Amazon UK Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare on PS4 for £12.99 from Amazon UK For one reason or another, Amazon UK is offering up this Turtle Beach Impact 100 gaming keyboard for the slightly ridiculous price of £12.99. It’s not a mechanical keyboard, though it claims to ‘emulate the feel of a mechanical keyboard’ but hey, it’s £13. Turtle Beach Impact 100 Gaming Keyboard for £12.99 from Amazon UK We’re just about two months removed from the actual launch of the Nintendo Switch but the system has gotten no less in demand in that time. Both the Neon and Grey versions tend to sell out within hours when they do crop up which is why Tesco Direct has decided to start taking pre-orders again. Stock is due back in on May 25th but you can get an extra £20 off that pre-order by entering the code TDX-KPYK at checkout.

Sanjay Gupta A file photo of Chinese supercomputer Sunway TaihuLight. Li Xiang/Xinhua via AP You may wonder why a company would want to use supercomputers, or high-performance computing (HPC), to make shampoos. But that’s exactly what a European cosmetics company did to get the right mix of materials that would make the shampoo smooth. “Nobody wants to buy shampoo that is not stable—one in which ingredients get segregated like in a salad dressing so you have to shake it before you can use it,” said Dave Turek, who leads HPC (high performance computing) strategy at International Business Machines (IBM) Corp., which worked with the shampoo maker on devising a cost-efficient HPC solution. According to Turek, ordinarily, one would start the shampoo-making process by getting a laboratory to mix the ingredients (water, detergent, thickeners, etc.), testing them and checking the mixture’s properties like how it “behaves, sitting on the shelf” of a bathroom. “This will teach you something about the ratio of materials, and then you do another set of experiments with another ratio and so on.” But doing these iterative processes in a physical lab was proving to be time consuming and expensive for the cosmetics company, which selected IBM to simulate them on a computer. Further, said Turek, “We decided to use cognitive methods to orchestrate the way simulations are run” which involved using machine learning algorithms to train the HPC system as more data was being fed into it and interpret the output in a constantly improving way. “The results were quite astounding: we solved the problem with one-third the compute power estimated to be required and ten thousand times the fidelity or precision of what the result was—in this case, the texture of the shampoo,” he said. HPC, more popularly known as supercomputing, has come a long way since the Cray supercomputers—named after the late American engineer Seymour Roger Cray—were introduced in the 1960s. Initially built as monolithic machines for highly niche applications such as weather forecasting, new drug discovery and academic research, HPC systems are now being routinely used in industries ranging from manufacturing and retailing to financial services and e-commerce. Also, HPC systems are no longer single, large bulky machines. They now comprise multiple computers put together to act as a single unit in what is called a “computer cluster” (bit.ly/2oTRLtE). “A couple of changes have occurred in the past several years that have changed how HPC is used,” said S. Sadagopan, director of the International Institute of Information Technology, Bengaluru. One, he said, is that data is now available everywhere instantly and in “machine-readable form”. For instance, you can get all the purchasing history and browsing data from Flipkart or Amazon, and the traffic patterns at different times of the day for cell towers in specific areas. “So, data has become more ‘interesting’ than it ever was. Not only that, all this data is now available on all kinds of mobile devices, including cellphones and iPads,” he said. What this data availability is doing is providing solution providers “a wider swathe of opportunities” in HPC usage. Click here for enlarge Experts say that big data (that includes structured data from company databases and unstructured text, voice and video and social media conversations) and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) are shaping up HPC and extending its use in everyday applications in a phenomenon termed ‘democratization of HPC’. “Earlier, the emphasis was on peak power or sheer computer power and the applications were mainly restricted to areas such as forecasting for earthquakes and high-resolution computation for drug discovery,” said Sadagopan. Now, the expanded scope of applications is fuelling growth of the HPC market. Market intelligence firm Intersect360 Research projects that the total HPC revenue worldwide, including sales of servers, storage systems and software, will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.2% over 2015-2020—reaching $36.9 billion in 2020 from $28.6 billion. The growth rate may appear slight at first glance, but becomes significant if one considers the fact that the overall server revenue has been declining globally: it declined 1.9% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 5.8% in the third quarter of the same year, according to research firm Gartner Inc. Prakash Mallya, managing director, South Asia, Intel Corp., says that Intel has “a strong play in democratizing HPC”. He said that HPC, big data, and AI are “all interlinked” and the advances made in HPC and big data will “help propel the AI space in India and the world.” According to information available on its website, Intel collaborates with the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), a research and development organization of the ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY), as well as with the Indian Institute of Science-Bangalore, on several HPC-related initiatives. Graphics processing unit (GPU) maker Nvidia Corp., which competes with Intel on supplying processors used to build HPC systems, is of the view that the Indian government’s National Supercomputing Mission (NSM) will have “a transformative impact” on research quality and quantity. It will facilitate the training of Indian scientists and the development of “home-grown applications” in medicine, agriculture and technology, according to Vishal Dhupar, managing director of South Asia at Nvidia Corp. Under NSM, the government had announced a fund of Rs4,500 crore in March 2015 to install 73 supercomputers in different parts of the country over a seven-year period (bit.ly/2pF80bI). “For 50 years HPC infrastructure has been used to forecast climate changes, understand natural resources in the sea, build large flyovers, and for bioinformatics, etc., and today we rely on HPC systems for our daily use—to search (on the web), to find an old friend (on social media) and to create special effects in movies, among other applications,” said Dhupar. He added that the need for HPC is “directly affected” by the accessibility factor. “When we talk about democratizing HPC, we are really talking about the increasing availability of the HPC infrastructure and its usage to fuel innovations in numerous research areas,” he said. IBM’s Turek said that “the lines between HPC, big data and AI are certainly blurring” and everything you could do in the real world can now be done “digitally through HPC simulation”. The rapid pace at which AI is growing is expected to accelerate demand for HPC systems to handle the machine learning and deep learning algorithms used in AI. Machine learning algorithms are software programs that allow a computer to learn from data without the need for further programming. Deep learning is a sub-domain in machine learning that is inspired by the structure and inter-connectivity of neurons in the brain. Research firm International Data Corporation’s estimates show worldwide spending on AI is expected to grow to $47 billion in 2020, up from $8 billion in 2016. In a March, 2016 interview to Fortune, Jen-Hsun Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, said, “Two years ago we were talking to 100 companies interested in using deep learning. This year we’re supporting 3,500. We’re talking about medical imaging, financial services, advertising, energy discovery, automotive applications. In two years’ time there has been 35x growth.” (for.tn/1VzYK3Y) All these developments indicate the future applications of HPC. “... you will see a chair designed specifically to suit your back or a cycle that is custom-built for you (using HPC and big data analytics). So even ordinary folks will be able to enjoy the benefits of great design,” said Sadagopan. Sanjay Gupta Topics: Supercomputers high performance computing Sunway TaihuLight Intel Corp.

Many also re-use those passwords across websites. Both are serious problems that can be relatively easily fixed. By Megan Squire. Added by The Conversation on 5 May 2017. Saved under In-depth, Top Tweet The first Thursday in May is World Password Day, but don’t buy a cake or send cards. Computer chip maker Intel created the event as an annual reminder that, for most of us, our password habits are nothing to celebrate. Instead, they hope we will use this day to say our final goodbyes to “qwerty” and “123456”, which are still the most popular passwords. The purpose of a password is to limit access to information. Having a very common or simple one like “abcdef” or “letmein”, or even normal words like “password” or “dragon”, is barely any security at all, like closing a door but not actually locking it. Hackers’ password cracking tools take advantage of this lack of creativity. When hackers find — or buy — stolen credentials, they will likely find that the passwords have been stored not as the text of the passwords themselves but as unique fingerprints, called “hashes”, of the actual passwords. A hash function mathematically transforms each password into an encoded, fixed-size version of itself. Hashing the same original password will give the same result every time, but it’s computationally nearly impossible to reverse the process, to derive a plaintext password from a specific hash. Instead, the cracking software computes the hash values for large numbers of possible passwords and compares the results to the hashed passwords in the stolen file. If any match, the hacker’s in. The first place these programs start is with known hash values for popular passwords. More savvy users who choose a less common password might still fall prey to what is called a “dictionary attack”. The cracking software tries each of the 171 000 words in the English dictionary. Then the program tries combined words (such as “qwertypassword”), doubled sequences (“qwertyqwerty”), and words followed by numbers (“qwerty123”). Only if the dictionary attack fails will the attacker move reluctantly to what is called a “brute-force attack”, guessing arbitrary sequences of numbers, letters and characters over and over until one matches. Mathematics tells us that a longer password is less guessable than a shorter password. That’s true even if the shorter password is made from a larger set of possible characters. For example, a six-character password made up of the 95 different symbols on a standard American keyboard yields 956, or 735bn, possible combinations. That sounds like a lot, but a 10-character password made from only lowercase English characters yields 2610, or 141 trillion, options. Of course, a 10-character password from the 95 symbols gives 9510, or 59 quintillion, possibilities. That’s why some websites require passwords of certain lengths and with certain numbers of digits and special characters — they’re designed to thwart the most common dictionary and brute-force attacks. Given enough time and computing power, though, any password can be cracked. And in any case, humans are terrible at memorising long, unpredictable sequences. We sometimes use mnemonics to help, like the way “every good boy does fine” reminds us of the notes indicated by the lines on sheet music. They can also help us remember a password like “freQ!9tY!juNC,” which at first appears very mixed up. Splitting the password into three chunks, “freQ!”, “9tY!” and “juNC”, reveals what might be remembered as three short, pronounceable words: “freak”, “ninety”, and “junk”. People are better at memorising passwords that can be chunked, either because they find meaning in the chunks or because they can more easily add their own meaning through mnemonics. Don’t reuse passwords Suppose we take all this advice to heart and resolve to make all our passwords at least 15 characters long and full of random numbers and letters. We invent clever mnemonic devices, commit a few of our favourites to memory, and start using those same passwords over and over on every website and application. At first, this might seem harmless enough. But password-thieving hackers are everywhere. Recently, big companies including Yahoo, Adobe and LinkedIn have all been breached. Each of these breaches revealed the usernames and passwords for hundreds of millions of accounts. Hackers know that people commonly reuse passwords, so a cracked password on one site could make the same person vulnerable on a different site. So, not only do we need long, unpredictable passwords, but we need different passwords for every site and program we use. The average Internet user has 19 different passwords. It’s easy to see why people write them down on sticky notes or just click the “I forgot my password” link. Software can help! The job of password management software is to take care of generating and remembering unique, hard-to-crack passwords for each website and application. Sometimes these programs themselves have vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. And some websites block password managers from functioning. And of course, an attacker could peek at the keyboard as we type in our passwords. Multi-factor authentication was invented to solve these problems. This involves a code sent to a mobile phone, a fingerprint scan or a special USB hardware token. However, even though users know the multi-factor authentication is probably safer, they worry it might be more inconvenient or difficult. To make it easier, sites like Authy.com provide straightforward guides for enabling multi-factor authentication on popular websites. So, no more excuses. Let’s put on our party hats and start changing those passwords. World Password Day would be a great time to ditch “qwerty” for good, try out a password manager and turn on multi-factor authentication. Once you’re done, go ahead and have that cake, because you’ll deserve it.

Adam SchiffAdam SchiffSchiff: Yates testimony could come within 'weeks' Overnight Cyber: FBI, NSA chiefs brief House Intel behind closed doors | DHS warns Congress on phone security Comey, NSA chief brief House panel amid Russia probe MORE (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said Thursday that former acting Attorney General Sally Yates could testify before the panel within "weeks." “We're in consultation with the counsel for Sally Yates, Directors Clapper and Brennan — we're trying to see if we can get that on calendar in the couple weeks following this recess, and I'm confident that we will,” Schiff said on MSNBC's “Rachel Maddow Show," referring to James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, and John Brennan, the former CIA director, respectively. Schiff referred to next week's upcoming recess when House lawmakers are set to return to their home districts to get face time with constituents. They will resume work in Washington on May 16, according to the House calendar. ADVERTISEMENT FBI Director James Comey and National Security Agency head Adm. Michael Rogers briefed the House Intelligence Committee in a closed-door session earlier Thursday. The panel is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. While details of Thursday's session are classified, Schiff signaled the investigation is advancing under the leadership of Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas), who took over the probe amid a deteriorating relationship between Schiff and committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.). “I think today it went very well. And we are making progress,” he said. “Mike Conaway and I have worked together in the last several weeks that we've been tasked with doing this jointly in a very nonpartisan, very matter-of-fact way. We're back to scheduling our witnesses. We're back to getting our hearing on track,” Schiff told MSNBC. Conaway replaced Nunes, who recused himself from the investigation in March shortly before the House Ethics Committee announced its own investigation into Nunes over possible "unauthorized disclosures of classified information." Much of the acrimony on the House panel stemmed from an appearance by Yates that was scheduled in March but canceled at the last minute by Nunes. Reports have indicated Yates was likely to offer testimony contradicting that of Trump administration officials. Tags Adam Schiff   View the discussion thread.

(Photo: Justin Sullivan / Getty Images) 6 CONNECTTWEET 24 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE San Jose, Calif. — The numbers didn’t add up for Intel Corp. to stay heavily involved in the auto industry in the 1990s. But nearly two decades later, billions in potential revenues add up just fine and have the chipmaking giant back in the auto game in a big way. Driving the company’s return in recent years is the lure of Big Data — the information that connected vehicles can sense, collect, sort, package and send to the Cloud, and eventually sell to all kinds of customers. One estimate puts the value of data collected by cars at $750 billion by 2030. That’s too much money for any tech company to ignore. And it’s why the leading seller of computer chips over the past 20 years, once a supplier of micro-controllers in selected cars and trucks, has aligned itself with several partners to offer a turnkey driverless car system, capable of harnessing the data and monetizing it. “Hopefully at the end of the day, you’ll believe... in this partner and collaboration strategy,” said Kathy Winter, vice president of Intel’s Automated Driving Group, welcoming press to the company’s new San Jose Innovation Center this week. “And that you’ll believe that Intel is well-positioned to build on not only the in-car compute, but also this connectivity and network experience, and then finally thinking about the data center... when you put all of that together into a single solution.” The highlight so far of Intel’s bid to get into the autonomous game was its March announcement the company would shell out $15.3 billion for Israel-based Mobileye NV, maker of on-board cameras and sensors for autonomous driving. “At 4 terabytes of data per day, the average autonomous car will put out the data equivalent of approximately 3,000 people,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich wrote employees in an e-mail explaining the acquisition. “Put just 1 million autonomous vehicles on the road and you have the data equivalent of half the world’s population.” That move has been bolstered by partnerships with others like Delphi Automotive PLC, BMW AG and Ericsson AB, each emerging as key players in the push to help automakers develop cars that drive themselves and on-board tools that capture data. “The only way we’re going to solve this problem across the industry is not by ourselves but through working and picking the right players and partners,” Winter said. Even Intel’s Innovation Center, based here in San Jose, was planned with an eye toward luring in more collaborators. Winter described it as “a place where “we can be close to potential partners, potential start-ups (and) close to OEM partners that have a presence out here in (Silicon Valley).” In the 1990s, Intel officials were less optimistic about their place in the industry. For a company on the cutting edge of computer chip technology, it was all about new developments and constantly increasing processing speeds. Automakers, however, needed technology that would be in their vehicles for a decade or more. Intel was faced with having to continue providing outdated technology over the lifetime of those vehicles and, ultimately, decided that was not going to be profitable. Today, the prospect of improving vehicle technology is far simpler with the development of over-the-air software updating. And Intel isn’t the only chipmaker to notice. Samsung, which is now challenging Intel as the global leader in chip sales, received approval this week to begin testing its own self-driving car in South Korea. Nvidia’s technology is currently being utilized by the likes of Tesla Inc. and Volvo Cars Ltd. And Qualcomm, already working with Volkswagen AG and Panasonic, awaits finalization of its $47 billion acquisition of semiconductor maker NXP. “That acquisition is still in progress, but we expect to close in the second half of this year, likely in the fourth quarter of this year,” said Nakul Duggal, Qualcomm’s vice president of product management. “NXP is the number one automotive semiconductor (manufacturer).” A March headline at Forbes.com had Intel “playing catchup with Nvidia and Qualcomm...” But it’s hardly playtime for the chip industry these days. Two years of declining global PC sales have companies looking for new revenue streams. And the urge to wind up on top of the autonomous-and-connected vehicle game has forced many tech and auto companies to crack open their wallets. A year ago, General Motors Co. ponied up $1 billion for San Francisco-based Cruise Automation. And last month the automaker announced it would invest another $14 million in the start-up’s operations there. Not to be outdone, Ford Motor Co. announced in February it would invest $1 billion in Argo AI over the next half-decade. The Pittsburgh company will help develop the brains of Ford’s self-driving cars. Richard Wallace, director of the transportation systems analysis group at Ann Arbor’s Center for Automotive Research, described the positioning among companies as “interesting to watch.” “Certainly, Intel paying 60 times earnings for Mobileye just strikes some as ridiculous,” he said. “And a billion dollars for Cruise Automation — a company that had no customers yet? “We can’t even judge which one is worth it or not yet. The market is not even responding to objective fact. It’s responding to these gut instincts in some ways and peoples’ feelings about technology versus their feelings about more tangible items, about brakes and steering wheels.” JLynch@detroitnews.com 6 CONNECTTWEET 24 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2pbTwi3 TOP VIDEOS Patterson concerned about job skills gap 2:51 Mayor Mike Duggan on the new Flex-N-Gate facility 0:47 Ken Lingenfelter on his astounding car collection 2:30 IRS agent warns of tax scams 3:28 GM cars hoisted up to the Comerica Park fountain 0:50 Sen.

Join For Free Discover how to protect your applications from known and unknown vulnerabilities. Whether you work for a bank, healthcare provider, insurance company or other large organization, your company’s risk management team likely uses a system security product to protect its mainframe and prevent unauthorized access of its applications and data. A common method relies on gathering various available records, such as from SMF, where activities like logging on and off are tracked, along with attempts to access systems, applications and data for which an ID is not authorized. These SMF records are then processed to produce audit reports. However, these types of audit reports—produced by data contained in SMF records, database log files, and other locations—offer limited visibility and exclude critical information about users. Audit reports can’t answer questions about who a user is, what they were doing, when they were doing it, or how they found access to sensitive data in the first place. Without a good view of mainframe activity, what happens when an unauthorized user gets their hands on an authorized user’s credentials and gains unapproved access to sensitive mainframe applications or data? The Threat of Insider Data Breaches In a data breach at Sage, a U.K. provider of business software, an employee gained unauthorized access to internal login data and committed a data breach affecting 200-300 U.K. customers. London police arrested the employee, but the breach and its impacts are virtually indelible from a customer experience standpoint. Insider security breaches like this have escalated to levels that critically damage businesses’ financial outcomes and reputations and now account for 43% of data loss, according to a report from Intel. One study put the worldwide average cost of a data breach at $4 million, an increase from $3.79 million in 2015, with the highest average cost per breach in the U.S. and Germany ($7.01 million and $5 million, respectively). According to IBS Intelligence, data from public databases and government-mandated disclosures indicates data leakage almost doubled between 2014 and 2015. And data from the cloud security software company Bitglass indicates five of the top 20 U.S. banks have experienced a data breach in 2016. “Financial institutions are prime targets for hackers and are rightfully concerned about the threat of cyberattacks, device theft, and malicious insiders,” Bitglass CEO Nat Kausik said. Despite an obvious increase, the threat from insiders is seldom discussed publicly. The media highlights external data breaches but rarely mentions internal risks. Yet, according to a 2016 Cisco study, 47% of respondents say preventing breaches by employees is their top internal security challenge. Is your company prepared to face this challenge? Gain Visibility, Improve Security, Reduce Threats Under the growing risk of insider data breaches, simply collecting and analyzing mainframe log data is not enough. By merely scratching the surface of user activity, you’re letting critical knowledge about mainframe applications and data access fall between the cracks. Rather than relying on security violations and SMF records, which primarily notify you of issues after someone did something they weren’t supposed to, why not collect deeper information on the activities of users and push that information to a reliable SIEM tool like Splunk? Unfortunately, having limited visibility is the reality for many companies. As one large financial institution stated, “We do not have a good view of mainframe activity. This is a huge blind-spot for us. Pushing mainframe info into Splunk would be incredibly valuable.” Monitoring users and capturing their activities can provide visibility into: Who saw the data. What sensitive data a user accessed and what they did with the data. When the data was found. How they gained access to the data. Without this in-depth level of visibility, security teams are left with significant blind spots, forcing them to sift through volumes of false positives looking for actual threats. Deeper insights into mainframe user activity can illuminate other areas that should be of concern as well, such as: Why is a user’s behavior veering toward suspicious? Why is an authorized user looking at masses of particularly sensitive data so often and for so long? Many assume that because the mainframe was built with security in mind, the information residing on it reflects the same level of protection. However, your company’s authorized users can access applications and data that a typical hacker would have trouble getting into. This opens the door for unauthorized users obtaining credentials to access sensitive information without you knowing. By limiting risk management capabilities and only tracking user flows in your mainframe environment, your company could face major consequences. Be it a damaged reputation with customers, or penalties incurred by a failure to comply with tightening government regulations or company security policies. Only with the proper application auditing tool can your company keep a closer eye on what’s going on in its mainframe environment and prevent these detriments.

The weekend has arrived once more, and that means it’s time to pause and catch our breaths, as we look back on another exciting week across the tech world. There were some major announcements, a few juicy rumors, and one or two surprises – and as ever, 7 Days is here to make sure you know exactly what’s been happening. Our journey begins this week in China, where authorities are apparently preparing to launch an alternative to Wikipedia, bringing together "the biggest, most high-quality author team" in the world. Underneath the obnoxiously large watermark in the image above, you'll see Fitbit's new smartwatch, which was revealed in leaked pictures alongside a new set of Bluetooth earbuds. Qualcomm is reportedly preparing to ask the International Trade Commission to enforce an import ban on iPhones entering the United States. Apple recently stopped paying royalties to some of Qualcomm's partners in China, amid a bitter dispute between the two companies over Qualcomm's licensing fees. Next week, Qualcomm will announce details of its new Snapdragon 660 processor chipset Mobile Platform for upper-mid-range devices. Rival chipmaker Intel finally patched a security vulnerability that has existed in some of its products for almost a decade. An email phishing scam attempted to ensnare users by linking to a shared Google Docs file, which routed users through a legitimate Google sign-in page, before a fake app requested authorization to access their emails. Meanwhile, Google made changes to Gmail's security warnings to offer greater protection against phishing attempts. O2, part of Spanish telecommunications giant Telefónica, revealed that some of its customers had had their bank accounts accessed by unknown third parties, as the result of a phishing attack combined with a known flaw in the SS7 protocol. A hacker, going by the name 'The Dark Overlord', leaked episodes of the upcoming season of hit Netflix show Orange Is The New Black, after the company ignored demands for a ransom payment. The same hacker claims to have possession of a further 36 unreleased movies and TV shows, and has again threatened to release them online unless a payment is made. Netflix content can now be viewed in 4K via the Microsoft Edge browser or the official Netflix app on Windows 10, thanks to a new preview driver from Nvidia for its GeForce GTX 10xx-series graphics cards. Samsung is hoping to attract more buyers to its Galaxy S8 flagships by offering them a free six-month Netflix subscription, 64GB microSD EVO+ card, and a Clear View Standing Cover. Samsung began rolling out a software fix for red-tinted displays on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ in Europe, and on T-Mobile in the US, but another issue popped up this week, causing some of those devices to randomly reboot. Buyers of LG's new G6 on T-Mobile can now get the device with $150 off, along with a free Google Home speaker and an LG G Pad X 8.0 tablet. LG is reportedly working on a 'G6 mini', which could prove popular among those who prefer a more compact flagship. HTC won't officially unveil its new U 11 flagship until later this month - but thanks to a leak, it seems we now know all of its key specs. OnePlus confirmed that its new Android flagship (gosh, there sure are a lot of flagships these days...) will be called the OnePlus 5, and will launch this summer. The company is skipping over the 'OnePlus 4' moniker as that number is considered unlucky in Chinese culture. Google published its latest breakdown of Android usage, revealing that just 0.5% of active devices are running the latest Android release, version 7.1. Android 7.0 is now up to just 6.6%, almost nine months after its rollout began. That long, slow rollout continues, reaching more devices this week: Samsung Galaxy S6, S6 edge and S6 active on AT&T Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ on T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) Honor 6X Google released its latest monthly Android security update, and published new factory and OTA images for its supported Nexus and Pixel devices. Details emerged of a new Android tablet in development by Motorola, with a 'premium look and feel', cellular connectivity, and a 'productivity mode', enabling users to pin apps to the nav bar. With Google's latest update to Chrome on Windows, version 58.0.3029.96, users with a 64-bit version of the OS running a 32-bit version of the browser will be automatically migrated to the 64-bit browser, if they have auto-update enabled. Google is getting ready to launch a major redesign of YouTube, including support for a dark theme - and it's got some big names onboard to support its stylish new look. Google and The Raspberry Pi Foundation teamed up to offer a low-cost cardboard kit that makers can use to build their own version of Google Home, including voice control support through the Google Assistant SDK. We've known since November that Amazon is working on a new Echo device, powered by its Alexa digital assistant, featuring a touchscreen and improved speakers - and the first images of that device appeared on Friday. Apple will reportedly unveil its own high-end rival to the Amazon Echo at its Worldwide Developer Conference next month. The new voice-controlled speaker is said to have a cylindrical design, similar to that of the Mac Pro, and - unsurprisingly - will support Apple's Siri digital assistant. Apple published its latest earnings report, revealing details of a very strong quarter for its services business, but a slight decline in iPhone sales, and a big drop in iPad sales. Apple promised to invest $1 billion in US manufacturing, and claimed that it's responsible for creating two million jobs across the country, despite only employing 80,000 people. Kensington released a new fingerprint scanner for PCs, priced at $50. The VeriMark sensor connects to a device via a USB port, and supports Windows Hello and FIDO. Toshiba's new Portégé X30 is a Windows 10 notebook that also supports Windows Hello biometric authentication, and promises enterprise-class security through a range of features, including TPM 2.0, BitLocker Drive Encryption, a Smart Card reader, and more, priced from $1,449. You don't need to spend a fortune to get Windows Hello support, though. The ASUS Transformer Mini is a 10.1-inch Windows 10 tablet that weighs just 790g with the keyboard attached, and has 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, and a kickstand similar to Microsoft's Surface tablets. The best bit is the price: it's now available in the US for just $249, including the keyboard and pen. Microsoft is offering some big discounts on its Surface products in the UK. All Surface Pro 4 models are now available with up to 19% off, while Surface Book i7 models (excluding those with the new Performance Base) can now be purchased with up to £665 off, along with free Bowers & Wilkins headphones worth £119.99. Microsoft also introduced its new Surface Arc Mouse, priced at $79.99, and available in three colors. Two of the Arc Mouse colors match those of the new Surface Laptop, which Microsoft unveiled on Tuesday at an education-focused event in New York City. Unlike previous Surface devices, the Laptop isn't attempting to define a new product category - beneath its (very!) pretty design, it's a surprisingly ordinary notebook, with its only truly distinguishing feature being the Alcantara fabric trim applied to its keyboard area. And while it has a touchscreen, and supports the Surface Pen, the display can't even be pushed back 180-degrees, so if you want to write on its screen, you'll have to do something like this: Here it is. RT @SurfaceProArt @thurrott From a reader at TabletPCReview forums. pic.twitter.com/1f8a71oNth — Paul Thurrott (@thurrott) May 4, 2017 The Surface Laptop certainly has premium pricing to match its premium styling - the entry-level model, which has just 4GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSD, costs $999, or £979 in the UK. For unexplained reasons, the four color options are only available on one model - the Core i5 version with 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD; but in the UK, and other markets, only the silver ("Platinum") color is offered across the entire range. And even though you could be paying up to $2,199 for the range-topping model, you'll still have limited connectivity options: you'll only get one USB 3.0 Type-A port, a Mini DisplayPort, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. There's no microSD slot, and no USB-C support either, even though one of Microsoft's own promotional videos showed a Surface Laptop prototype with two USB Type-C ports. Check out our hands-on first impressions of the Surface Laptop to find out more. The Surface Laptop is also the first device to come with the new Windows 10 S edition, previously known as 'Windows 10 Cloud'. Windows 10 S only allows apps to be installed from the Windows Store, offering more security on devices, and limiting the impact of malware and viruses. It should also deliver better battery performance, thanks to restrictions on background tasks and services for apps installed from the Store. It will also prevent users from changing the default browser (Edge) and search engine (Bing). Windows 10 S is primarily intended for the education market, but it still comes pre-installed on the Surface Laptop for consumers, although Microsoft is offering a free upgrade to Windows 10 Pro for those who buy the device until the end of the year. Anyone else who wants to upgrade a device that comes with Windows 10 S to the Pro edition will have to pay around $49 to do so. Since Windows 10 S devices can only run apps from the Windows Store, Microsoft also announced that its Office 365 desktop applications are also "coming soon" to the Store. Spotify is coming to the Windows Store as well - but as it will be a simple Desktop Bridge 'conversion' of its existing desktop app, it will only be available for Windows 10 PCs, and not for other devices like phones or the Xbox One. Cloud storage service MEGA will soon launch an app in the Windows Store too, built on Microsoft's Universal Windows Platform, and available on PCs and phones. By the way, Microsoft has another launch event coming up later this month. The company revealed on Thursday that it "will show the world what's next" at an event in Shanghai on May 23, where it's likely to unveil its new Surface Pro 5. Last weekend, Neowin exclusively revealed that Microsoft is planning to separate development of its Edge web browser from Windows 10 when it releases its next major update to the OS in September. The Windows 10 Creators Update, which is currently rolling out to consumers, is the most recent such update for the OS. This week, Microsoft detailed some of the improvements to Edge that that update includes for IT pros and enterprise admins. Meanwhile, Edge's share of the desktop browser market remains stagnant, while Chrome has increased its share to 63.45% since last month. Microsoft brought its Focused Inbox feature to Outlook 2016, making it available to all users in the Office 365 First Release program - a big step towards rolling it out for everyone. The company also released a new Outlook for Mac Insider Preview to the Fast ring, and finally added Outlook to its Office Insider Program on iOS. Microsoft Teams - the firm's "chat-based workspace" app for Office 365 - got a big update with some handy new features on iOS and Windows 10 Mobile. Last week, when Microsoft published its quarterly earnings report, I pointed out that its phone hardware business is now dead, with negligible revenue, and no new devices coming anytime soon. But Microsoft Technical Fellow Alex Kipman went even further this week, effectively declaring that the era of the smartphone is over: "The phone is already dead," he said. "People just haven't realized." Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella had a slightly different take on things, saying: "I'm sure we will make more phones, but they will not look like phones that are there today." Could he be referring to Westworld-style foldable phones? Well... we can dream - but it's probably best not to get your hopes up. Microsoft is continuing to work on Windows 10 Mobile in a separate 'feature2' branch, having split its development from the main Redstone 3 (RS3) branch a few weeks ago. It released a new Windows 10 Mobile Insider Preview, build 15210, to the Fast ring on Wednesday. On the same day, Windows 10 build 16188 rolled out to PCs in the Fast ring from the RS3 branch, bringing a range of additions and improvements, including a new Cortana section in the Settings app, new Edge PDF Reader functionality, a better update experience, and more. The fixes and known issues for that build can be found here. It seems clear that Windows 10 development for PCs is currently proceeding at a far greater pace than for phones. Windows 10 has apparently reached a plateau on Valve's Steam gaming platform, after hitting an all-time high of 51.2% of gamers there last month. Valve announced an overhaul of its gifting system, and revealed a range of improvements to its customer support system. Xbox chief Phil Spencer said he believes that Microsoft's first-party studios should be "a beacon of innovation for how our platform is being used". He cited Gears of War 4 as an example of this, with its introduction of cross-play between Xbox One consoles and Windows 10 PCs. Gears of War 4 got its latest update this week, with two new maps, multi-GPU support on Windows 10 PCs, and more. Microsoft added five more Xbox 360 games to its list of those playable on the Xbox One through its Backward Compatibility program. That list has been growing fast lately, and it won't be long before it reaches the next milestone of 400 titles. Nearly 11 years after the original game was released, the new Prey made its official debut on the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC. Nvidia's latest GeForce driver update includes optimizations for the game. Sony revealed that it will hold its media briefing at the E3 gaming expo on June 12. Expect to see plenty of exciting announcements there, including a ton of awesome new games. However, Oculus confirmed that it's giving E3 a miss this year - the first time the virtual reality firm will be absent from the show since 2014. But our odyssey across the tech world ends this week with the beginning of a new journey across all of time and space. BBC iPlayer - which is exclusively available in the UK - will be streaming a special edition of this week's episode of Doctor Who, featuring immersive 3D binaural audio. But if you're not in the UK (or even if you are), you can enjoy a new Skype game bot developed by BBC Worldwide and Microsoft, in which you can help the Doctor to discover the pieces of the Key of Time, "an ancient and powerful artifact than could decide the fate of the universe". I've suddenly got a craving for some fish fingers and custard... Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a couple of extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. Microsoft's spotlight was shining on its Surface Laptop this week, but the company also showcased a range of much more affordable PCs, some of which were priced as low as $229. Rich Woods took a closer look at some of those devices, which run Microsoft's new Windows 10 S edition. And Rich also got his paws on LeEco's new Le Pro 3, a flagship-class handset with a Snapdragon 821 processor, at a mid-range price point. Check out his unboxing video, including first impressions of the new device. Stay tuned to Neowin in the days ahead for what’s sure to be another exciting week, filled with official news, lots of updates, and plenty of insights from around the world of technology. For now, though, there’s lots more to read across the site – including all sorts of interesting discussions over on our forums.

image/svg+xml MAGAZINE EVENTS PAPERS TOPICS GOVTECH 100 NAVIGATOR SEARCH Transportation Zero Accidents with AVs Isn't Realistic, Mobileye Chairman Says The chairman says that instead of total eradication of traffic-related fatalities, a drastic decline is all that should be expected. by Globes, Tel Aviv, Israel / May 5, 2017 mobileye/blogs (TNS) -- Israeli collision avoidance sensor developer Mobileye (NYSE: MBLY) founder and chairman Prof. Amnon Shahua has told "Reuters" that people should not expect autonomous cars to completely eliminate accidents and fatalities. He said, "If the expectation is for zero accidents that isn't realistic." "Reuters" added that Shashua believes society would accept fatalities that are 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller than with people-driven cars, meaning a decline to as few as 35 fatalities annually in the US from around 35,000 today. Once autonomous driving cars are ready, there will be a period of several years where drivers will still be needed for monitoring purposes, Shashua added. RELATEDSelf-Driving Production to Begin by 2019, Say Delphi, Mobileye How is Volkswagen crowdsourcing road data?Intel Acquires Mobileye, Makes $15 Billion Bet on Self-Driving Vehicles In March, Intel Corp. announced that it is acquiring Mobileye for $15.3 billion and that Shashua would head its newly formed global autonomous driving organization based in Jerusalem. Shashua told "Reuters" that fully automated cars are not expected until at least 2021 but he sees income being generated in the immediate future from semi-autonomous driving features, which will nevertheless require drivers to remain alert. "We can enable hands-free driving to levels that are much higher than with any sensor," he said. Current systems will be enhanced by Mobileye's mapping technology. The Israeli company's "Roadbook" high-definition maps will be built into cars and will crowdsource data, presumably like Waze, in order to provide real-time traffic updates. Mobileye has already agreed mapping technology deals with Nissan, Volkswagen and BMW and Shashua told "Reuters" that four more manufacturers were in talks about joining the program. "We hope to have the majority of these four signed by the end of 2017," he said. "Only car manufacturers can contribute ... because they have the cars. This is something that truly separates the car industry from the tech players." Shashua expects "meaningful" revenue from "Roadbook" although he declined to speculate on numbers. ©2017 the Globes (Tel Aviv, Israel) Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

Rand Paul (R-Ky.) demanded more information about allegations that former President Obama might have surveilled other Republican campaigns during the 2016 election. Paul was a presidential candidate in that year. (Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images) 53 Follow Share Tweet Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is demanded to know Friday if the Obama administration had surveillance ordered on his campaign not for legal reasons, but out of political motivations. He made the demands after reports that the Obama administration might have surveilled other campaigns in the 2016 presidential election. Paul tweeted, “We need to know was there a political motivation!” with a link to an interview he had with Breitbart News. We need to know was there a political motivation! https://t.co/9qjDzrdUKq — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) May 5, 2017 “We’ve had several people come to us and say that it happened,” he told Breitbart News. “I don’t have access to that information, but I’ve been very concerned that too many Americans’ information is being culled through without a warrant.” “I don’t have any facts to say it happened. But numerous sources are coming to us saying it did happen so I want to search through, find out why I wasn’t notified,” he added. “Was it on purpose?” Earlier Friday Paul said that he had requested from the White House and the Senate and House Intelligence Committees information on whether he had been surveilled by the Obama administration. I have formally requested from the WH and the Intel Committees info on whether I was surveilled by Obama admin and or the Intel community! — Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) May 5, 2017 He also posted the original story from Circa outlining the claim that thousands of Americans had been surveilled in 2016. “Did the Obama admin use warrantless ‘wiretapping’ on other candidates” besides Donald Trump, he asked. During his final year in office, President Obama’s team significantly expanded efforts to search National Security Agency intercepts for information about Americans, distributing thousands of intelligence reports across government with the unredacted names of U.S. residents during the midst of a divisive 2016 presidential election. Circa is requesting the Trump administration release information that relates to the spike in surveillance during 2016. Circa has formally requested that the Trump administration declassify records showing how often government officials have searched National Security Agency intercepts for intelligence on U.S. presidential candidates, members of Congress, journalists, clergy, lawyers, federal judges and doctors and how often such Americans had their identities unmasked by the intelligence community after Barack Obama made it easier to do so in 2011. President Trump had made the claim that his campaign was surveilled by former President Obama during the 2016 election at Trump Tower. Detractors said that if members of his team were surveilled under FISA regulations (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act), then that would have meant there was credible evidence of collusion with Russia in order to obtain warrants. Both accusations are currently being investigated by intelligence committees in the House and in the Senate.

Image via Arielinson (some rights reserved) In an interview with Reuters, Shashua noted that this is because the mapping tech can be used in conjunction with a large variety of different semi-autonomous driving and convenience features. In relation to these comments, the Mobileye head revealed that the company expects to begin announcing new deals with various auto manufacturers by the end of the year relating to its high-definition (HD) maps. As a note here, it should probably be remembered that Mobileye is currently in the process of being acquired by Intel, for around $15.3 billion (a record deal on a couple of fronts). Commenting on the value of the company’s high-definition maps, Shashua stated: “We can enable hands-free driving to levels that are much higher than with any sensor (alone).” Reuters provides more: “The Israeli company also believes its mapping technology will be cheaper and more comprehensive than rival systems because of the way it is created. “Whereas traditional HD mapping requires dedicated vehicles with specialized equipment and hired drivers, Mobileye’s RoadBook uses hardware in vehicles to ‘crowdsource’ data. “Nissan, Volkswagen, and BMW have already signed up to share data from Mobileye’s camera-equipped advanced driver assistance systems to generate HD maps for self-driving cars, and Shashua said four more manufacturers were in talks about joining the program.” In addition to the comments about the company’s mapping technology, Shashua also made interesting comments about near-term prospects for fully autonomous cars: “If the expectation is for zero accidents, that isn’t realistic.” He then went on to note that he believed that “society would accept fatalities that are 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller than with people-driven cars, meaning a decline to as few as 35 fatalities annually in the United States from around 35,000 today,” as paraphrased by Reuters.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware New AMD Ryzen Microcode Update Will Expand Memory Support By Khalid Moammer 10 hours ago 102Shares Share Tweet Submit A new microcode update is on its way to expand Ryzen memory support and enable automated compatibility with 20+ new RAM kits.  We initially heard that this microcode update was in the works late last month directly from AMD. Earlier today a Gigabyte spokesperson confirmed via a forum post that the new AGESA 1006 microcode update will add more than 20 new memory registers to enable direct plug and play compatibility with existing Intel compatible DDR4 memory modules. Early reports from Ryzen users indicated that the best performing DDR4 memory with Ryzen processors feature Samsung’s B die memory chips. G.Skill and GeIL are the biggest suppliers of memory modules featuring these chips. AMD’s technical marketing lead Robert Hallock later confirmed Samsung B die DDR4 memory indeed offers the best out-of-box compatibility with Ryzen processors and the highest overclocking results. He also confirmed that a BIOS update will be rolled out this month to enable out-of-box compatibility with a large collection of Hynix based memory modules. Related Intel Says i7 7700K CPUs Shouldn’t Be Overclocked In Response To Countless Overheating Complaints Ryzen DDR4 Memory Compatibility Guide Currently your best bet in terms of DDR4 memory is to look for modules with the Samsung B die chips. Reddit user Wiidesire compiled a terrific list which includes all available models that have these memory chips. Another sure bet is to make sure you purchase a memory kit that’s listed in your motherboard’s memory compatibility list otherwise you may need to input the memory timings yourself for the RAM to run at its advertised speed. Remember, the advertised speeds of almost all DDR4 memory kits out there are based on the proprietary Intel XMP — Extreme Memory Profile — standard, which is why running your DDR4 memory at its advertised speed can be tricky on Ryzen, especially DDR4 RAM with Hynix memory. In some cases you may need to increase the voltage to 1.5v, which is completely safe, for it to run at its advertised speed. Another easy knob to turn is to slightly up the SOC/unCore voltage to 1.1.

The update will also include support for manually disabling LAN, audio and specific PCIe slots. There’s no set date for the update but you can expect it to come out some time later this month.

While Panay did not divulge any other info regarding the event, it is being speculated that Microsoft could announce the Surface Pro 5 at the event. There is also a possibility of the Surface Book 2 showing up at the event, along with the fabled Surface Phone that we have been hearing about for close to two years now. Latest rumors suggest the Surface Pro 5 will not include many major changes under the hood, except for the processor. The 2-in-1 device will be powered by 7th Gen Intel Kaby Lake processors, which are manufactured on a 14nm process. That means you can expect improved performance as well as battery life from the new model.  The proprietary Surface Connect Power connector will apparently be retained as well. See you in Shanghai. May 23. #MicrosoftEvent #Surface https://t.co/aMgvkkqE52 pic.twitter.com/vzcK9MqIpf — Panos Panay (@panos_panay) May 5, 2017 The Surface Book 2 on the other hand is expected to feature a clamshell design this time, featuring a 13.5-inch display. It too will be powered by Intel’s latest 7th Gen Kaby Lake processors under the hood, so there is definitely a high possibility of battery life going up by a decent margin. Along with a new design and updated internals, rumors suggest the Surface Book 2 will also be more affordable than its predecessor with a US$1,000 starting price.

Join IEEE | IEEE.org | IEEE Xplore Digital Library | IEEE Standards | IEEE Spectrum | More Sites Follow on: Advertisement Engineering Topics  Special Reports  Blogs  Multimedia  The Magazine  Professional Resources  Search  Article Transportation Advanced Cars Witricity Leverages Magnetic Resonance for Flexible Wireless Charging Engineers at WiTricity are developing wireless power transfer technology that extends efficiency and charging ranges beyond the reach of existing methods Sponsored by Advertisement Imagine coming home and dropping your phone, laptop, and Bluetooth® headset on your kitchen table so that they all recharge, simultaneously. Or driving your electric car into a garage, parking above a mat, and knowing it will be charged in the morning. Or being told by your doctor that there is a new medical implant to replace the one you wear—and the new version does not include power cords or the need to replace batteries. Wireless power transfer is making these scenarios and other applications a reality by delivering a cordless way to charge electronic devices. WiTricity, a Watertown, MA-based company that develops wireless charging technology based on magnetic resonance, has launched the most consumer-friendly method available for the wireless transfer of electrical power. Invented at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) by Professor Marin Soljacic and a team of researchers, WiTricity’s technology has the ability to charge multiple devices at once, over distances and through materials like wood, plastic, granite, and glass. Companies such as Toyota, Intel, and Thoratec have already licensed the technology for use in hybrid-electric vehicles, smartphones, wearable electronics, and heart pumps. MAGNETIC RESONANCE WIDENS THE TRANSMISSION GAP Other options for wireless energy transfer require precise device positioning on a pad or holder, very close proximity to (often resting directly on) the charging source, and the source can only charge a single device with a single coil. Now, the engineers at WiTricity have leveraged the power of magnetic resonance to rethink these limitations. Their system, dubbed “highly resonant wireless power transfer”, relies on oscillating time-varying magnetic fields generated by alternating current passing through a coil that functions as a power source. A power amplifier connected to this source coil controls the power levels and operating frequency, driving the magnetic field levels. A capture device, which acts as a receiver and captures the magnetic field, contains another coil tuned to the same frequency as the source. The field converts the magnetic energy back to radiofrequency alternating current in the receiver, which can then be used as a new local power source after being rectified and regulated by power electronics. The notable difference between WiTricity’s technology and other approaches is the use of magnetic resonance. With both coils tuned to the same resonant frequency, the receiving coil is able to capture maximum power through the magnetic field with very low losses, and power can be transmitted without the source and capture device sitting next to each other or being perfectly aligned. “One major advantage is the flexibility of motion and positioning. The receiving coil doesn’t have to be in direct contact with the device; for instance, while driving your car you could drop your phone into a cup holder positioned near the capture device, rather than arranging it on a charging pad,” explained Andre Kurs, cofounder of WiTricity. “And you can charge everything together, including electronics that have different power requirements.” Extending the wireless range is also easy enough: resonant repeaters that each contain another circuit and coil may be placed between the source and receiver, allowing power to ‘hop’ over greater distances. Transfer occurs effectively even with barriers (such as people and concrete walls) between the power source and the receiver. MODELING THE ELECTROMAGNETICS OF WIRELESS POWER TRANSFER In designing for maximum efficiency using coils with the same resonant frequency, Kurs and his team had to account for variables such as number of coil turns, diameter, and necessary power input. From the early stages of development, they relied on computer simulation to test key details, verify designs, and optimize the system. Using a COMSOL Multiphysics® software model, Kurs analyzed the electromagnetic and thermal behavior of different coil configurations, and was able to quickly validate new designs. One challenge lay in making the technology scalable for a wide range of devices: a car, for instance, needs a different charging configuration than a smartphone. “We have such a wide range of applications, prototyping and testing is time-consuming and expensive, and design mistakes can set you back a lot—in such a competitive market, we can’t afford that,” he said. “Design validation in COMSOL® was cost-effective and time-saving and allowed us to virtually test our concepts before building the real device.” He created simulations with different setups for each application, and included electromagnetically relevant components such as coil windings, specially shaped ferrites and metal surfaces used to guide the electromagnetic field, plates for shielding sensitive electronics, and large objects that might perturb the field, such as a car chassis. Then he ran a multiphysics study to analyze the resulting electromagnetic and thermal performance as a function of power drawn by the devices, coil displacements, and the effects of perturbing objects. He extracted circuit parameters from the results to guide the design of the electronics, as well as predictions of power dissipation and thermal loading on different components. The team adjusted their designs accordingly, determining the viable range of coil displacements and power levels as a function of size, weight, and thermal constraints. “The simulation allowed us to disentangle various effects that we couldn’t isolate just by testing, like power dissipation and heat transfer,” Kurs remarked. “The flexibility of COMSOL® was particularly useful; we built a suite of simulation apps around it that would allow any of our engineers—whether they knew how to use COMSOL® or not—to quickly test and validate designs even if they didn’t understand the entire model.” KEEPING A SAFE DISTANCE, RIGHT UP CLOSE Since such devices are near to or in contact with people’s bodies, electronics manufacturers must adhere to safety limits on the electromagnetic fields emitted by their products. The magnetic fields needed for WiTricity’s wireless transfer are usually fairly weak, but each new application needs be checked for compliance. To make sure that the field levels and resulting body temperatures would meet regulations, the team ran several more COMSOL® simulations to study different body tissues in close proximity to the device. Their models calculated the electric field based on the operating frequency of the charging system, and confirmed that the results were well within FCC safety guidelines. RETHINKING A GROWING INDUSTRY FOR WIRELESS CHARGING Witricity’s designs based on magnetic resonance are a major improvement over other wireless charging methods, allowing reliable wireless power transfer in a flexible, consumer-friendly product. Thanks to their simulation work in COMSOL Multiphysics®, the WiTricity team optimized their designs for better efficiency and longer ranges before building costly prototypes. In addition to being frontrunners in game-changing wireless power transfer technology, WiTricity is on the board of the Alliance for Wireless Power (A4WP), an organization dedicated to building a “global wireless ecosystem” and creating standards for wireless charging. Another board member, Intel, has licensed WiTricity’s technology to develop a wireless desktop system. The A4WP is an innovative group comprising leading companies that are ushering in a new way of thinking about wireless power: they are imagining a future where every day surfaces—desks, cup holders, and even your kitchen countertop— become zones for charging the electronic devices we depend on so much.

Image: A screen shot of a mobile running Indus OS. NEW DELHI: Picture this. You want to open a bank account. So, you reach the website or physical bank of your choice, key in details into your phone and when prompted to submit documents, you simply bring the phone to eye level and a scan of your iris finishes off the process. The next step, your scan is authenticated by Aadhaar and you have a valid bank account. This is one of many scenarios that Rakesh Deshmukh, CEO of Indus OS, predicts, once smartphones with this capability — a global first — reach consumers. Deshmukh wants Indus OS to be the bedrock of this transformation as the world’s first regional OS — and India's second largest — becomes the first of its kind Aadhaar-authenticated OS. "Indus OS will use iris biometric technology for the most secure identification and authentication modality and it supports 12 Indian languages," Deshmukh told ET, adding that the company tied up with California-based and Intel-backed Delta ID, global leaders in iris-based authentication technology, to create capability. "We expect to launch the platform this quarter and empower over 1billion Indians enrolled for Aadhaar," he added. The Aadhaar-authenticated OS will be released across the company's smartphone brand partners, including Micromax, Intex, Karbonn, Celkon and Swipe, Deshmukh said. Deshmukh expects 100 million to be using it by 2020. The way the technology works is that the software-hardware combination captures the IRIS ID information through an iris scanning camera built into the smartphone. The OS then encodes this information and then encrypts it, sends it to the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) server for a match. Once the UIDAI server confirms the Aadhaar number, the consumer is authorised to utilise it for a whole suit of activities. The technology' is best suited for India, which is the fastest growing smartphone market in the world and one that is increasingly striving towards a less cash economy. The Indian government wants to grow this user base and enable people to have access to financial services and other benefits by using low-cost or entry-level smartphones. The challenge could be cost associated with putting technology and OS into smartphones, which handset manufacturers would have to bear. But Deshmukh claims manufacturers would see advantage in adopting this technology. "They may see cost of making go up by only $2-$3 apiece and high volumes would bring this down to one tenth to one twentieth."

North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr and Virginia Sen. Mark Warren said in a joint statement that they had learned that Page may not cooperate with a request for a variety of communications and financial records that they want to look at as part of the committee’s probe of Russian meddling in the election. In March, Page offered to testify publicly before the committee. But on Thursday, the energy consultant suggested that he may not be willing to cooperate fully with the intelligence committee’s records request. “Three days ago, Carter Page told Fox News he was cooperating with the Committee’s investigation into Russian activities surrounding the 2016 Election,” Burr and Warner said in a statement. “Today we have learned that may not be the case.” (RELATED: Here’s What The Senate Intel Committee Wants From Carter Page) In their letter to Page last Friday, Burr and Warren invited him to a closed meeting. But first, they wanted Page to provide any records of correspondence he had with Russian government officials, Russian businessmen and the Trump campaign between June 15, 2015 and Jan. 20, 2017, the date of Trump’s inauguration. In his response Thursday, Page called the committee’s request “cumbersome chores.” He also pointed to the reports that the FBI obtained a surveillance warrant against him last September to argue that the federal government already has the information being sought by the committee. Asked by The Daily Caller on Friday whether he plans to release the requested records, he said: “Let’s see what happens.” Burr and Warren indicated that they will seek other means to obtain the information, a not-so-subtle hint that a subpoena is in the offing. “Should Mr. Page choose to not provide the material requested by those dates, the Committee will consider its next steps at that time,” they said.

The list includes Roger Stone, Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn. The committee has already started conducting interviews as part of its investigation. CNN reported last week that 27 interviews have been conducted so far.

It is going to be the most-powerful Surface Pro device yet. It will come with some heavy-duty hardware, a well-detailed screen and the latest Windows 10 feature. Facebook/Surface Microsoft recently unveiled a new batch of Surface laptops though most were low-end and meant to target the education sector and give the Google Chromebook some competition. But with another event happening on May 23 in Shanghai, these may be nothing more than preliminary machines for a possible Microsoft Surface Pro 5 release.  Microsoft Surface Head Panos Panay sent out a cryptic tweet using a couple of hashtags. These were #MicrosoftEvent and #Surface. From that alone, it seems obvious that the Redmond company will be revealing another mobile device. With the low-key laptops out, the only logical one that most can expect may be the successor to the Microsoft Surface Pro 4. The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 has been around since 2015 and is due to get a successor. But even if a Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is coming out, it is not expected to come with big changes. Most of the iterations are expected to be done from within such as an Intel Kaby Lake processor, tweaks in RAM count and new ports or biometric security.  Aesthetically, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 may not offer something different from before. That includes the same power connector and a similar mold according to journalist Paul Thurrott. Regardless, the meager changes are unlikely to disappoint most since they would be getting a device with ramped up power specs. For now, it would be best to wait and see what the Microsoft Shanghai event on May 23 would be all about. The Redmond company does have a wide array of Surface series variants – meaning the tweet by Panay could be addressing a different kind of machine in the clan.  Microsoft has benefitted from the Microsoft Surface series and the attention right now is the new breed of Surface laptops running on Windows 10 S. These budget-friendly devices are Microsoft’s ticket to try and solve the Chrome OS dominance and in preparation for an expected surge in Chromebook demands this year.  According to PC World, Microsoft plans to follow the same Chrome OS formula. This would include seeing the Windows 10 S-powered devices accessing the Windows App Store and downloading only the necessary apps secured and verified by Microsoft. While that makes sense, Microsoft could face new issues pertaining to the available apps at their store. Unlike the Google PlayStore, the Windows App Store leaves a lot to be desired in terms of needed apps. It seems like a long climb but the Redmond hopes to do better than their 2015 attempt – something that bombed with the Windows 8.1 with Bing OS.

Blog :  Looming Massive Job Losses Demand New ‘Human’ Approach to Work, Professor Says Article :  Cybersecurity Ventures Top 50 Security Companies to Watch Why Google, Uber and Amazon Will Obsolesce Car Companies Rob Enderle |   Unfiltered Opinion   |   Posted 05 May, 2017          |         |     Share It’s fascinating that as the car companies become technology companies and turn cars into rolling, increasingly intelligent computers, they are making many of the same mistakes that wiped out companies like Sun and DEC and crippled firms like HP and IBM. I find this annoying because I believe executives who are paid millions should spend some time learning from prior mistakes rather than costing their firms billions, and even make the difference between whether those firms survive or not. Let me explain what is going on in this transition, realizing this is as much therapy for me as it is informative for you. Mainframe to Client Server Computing A little history: We started with the mainframe. IBM got to critical mass first and then brilliantly used a leasing model to turn into a service so you didn’t buy an incredibly expensive computing experience; you made monthly payments, which included the hardware, software and services. This created a strategic problem on two levels. IBM became a monopoly, which got regulators focused on it, and the market saturated so it started to think tactically. The firm then broke out software and sold it separately, and at an additional cost, sold the hardware, and then started to mine the buyers for money. Over a decade, it went from dominant in the industry to almost out of business. Let me stop there. The lesson people should have taken was that technology as a service, when done right, can lead to a level of dominance where one vendor can effectively control an entire world market. While you can, for a short time, make more money by selling products rather than service subscriptions, it is a far weaker model for dominance. With IBM’s fall, we had client/server computing, an initiative largely led by Sun Microsystems, but a market that was largely divided initially among DEC, HP, IBM and Sun. This had lower hardware cost but each vendor was highly proprietary and many thought they could license out their hardware or software to competitors because it was so much superior. Microsoft and Intel entered the segment with their own standard offerings championed by a different class of vendors (Compaq and Dell, etc.) and the shared standard offerings began to collapse the market around the more standard, and thus lower-cost, alternatives. Microsoft made a pricing change, which resulted in massive unplanned charges to buyers. This drove people to Linux as an almost religious alternative that was even more vendor independent. When the dust settled, DEC and Sun were gone, HP was substantially weakened, and only IBM, with OpenPower and Linux used strategically, could create and sustain an offering. This showcases that standardized cross-OEM offerings are more powerful than their proprietary alternatives and that, in competition, this cross-vendor model can wipe out the vendors that are attempting to compete with a more proprietary solution at scale. Currently, the biggest threats to the market are Azure from Microsoft and AWS from Amazon. IBM has also moved to having a similar offering in an acquisition called SoftLayer. So, over a period of around half a century, the technology industry finally realized that the first model that surrounded the mainframe. technology as a service, was the more sustainable one and that a market defined by common standards was far stronger than one defined by independent proprietary offerings. The Car Industry When it comes to autonomous driving, the car industry, with the noted exception of BMW, which I think gets this, falls into two camps: the folks who have the technology and don’t want to share it, and those who don’t have it and want a free ride. The ones developing the technology believe, like the client server folks did, that their unique technology is so good that their competitors will license it at a huge premium. In short, the folks who are driving the change (spending on R&D) are mostly all trying to be the automobile equivalent of Sun Microsystems or DEC. Now there is one big difference between the technology industry and the automotive industry. The tech industry is based on moving, storing and analyzing data that isn’t very portable and slows dramatically the ability to move between vendors. This slows the market’s ability to move from model to model. For instance, if a firm wants to move from a mainframe to UNIX or from UNIX to Windows or Linux, it’ll take years, which does give the related vendors time to respond. Therefore, HP and IBM are still around. If the transition had been faster, both firms would have likely failed, along with DEC and Sun. The car industry is based on people. How hard is it for you to move from buying from Ford to buying from Jaguar, or from buying a car or using a service like Uber? The speed could suggest that the car companies won’t get the time they need to convert. (It does explain why Ford is looking at creating an Uber-like service.) Let’s end this with the closest thing to a real mainframe model right now, Uber/Lyft. Google and Amazon are likely both coming into this area and both of those firms potentially could out-execute Uber. So, if the model holds, unless the car companies start collaborating and sharing the load, the future of the car industry will belong to firms like Amazon, Google and Uber, and most of the existing car companies will be referred to in past tense. Wrapping Up: Obsolescence for Car Companies One of the fascinating things we hope that artificial intelligence will help fix is the inability of executives to want to understand why the path they seem to prefer is suicidal. With confirmation bias, we all have a tendency to filter information so that it supports positions we’ve already taken. In this case, the major car vendors all suffer from this, except for BMW, which seems to get the Linux lesson, and possibly Ford, which sees the danger of cars as a service and seems to be positioning against it. But unless something changes, the car industry is about to see the same thing the tech industry has experienced, that cross-vendor standards and sharing tends to drive those out of the market that don’t participate, and that the service model can trump the sales model. In short, right now, the car companies should be far more focused on stopping Amazon, Google and Uber than they are on stopping each other. Let’s mention Tesla on close; it basically sells a car as a service now and has designed the car to function as a service. Google did try to buy it, and if it had, we might already be talking about the end game for traditional car companies. That should have been a huge warning sign. The industry missed a bullet, but I don’t even think most realize they were being shot at. Right now, unless something massive changes, most of the car companies will fail in the next five to 10 years, and we’ll be getting our cars from a service like Uber, though it could be Amazon or Google.

After the Tesla takeover last November, CEO Elon Musk indicated to Grohmann’s management team that the brunt of its efforts should be diverted away from former customers in order to focus primarily on production facilities related to the Model 3. The move placed Musk at odds with company founder Klaus Grohmann, eventually resulting in his abrupt departure, and was a major source of tension among the German workforce — which, backed by IG Metall, has threatened to strike. Negotiations have already yielded improved worker pay and hiring promises, but Tesla now appears to be tackling the issue of how to handle the numerous clients who have been hung out to dry. Tesla is counting heavily on Grohmann’s automation and engineering prowess to ramp up vehicle production. Initially, the U.S. EV manufacturer said it could manage without the German workforce, but that doesn’t seem to be the case — considering how well its collective bargaining tactics seem to have worked. However, it’s unclear the exact lengths Tesla will go to make amends with Grohmann’s legacy clientele. “We have been in contact with every client for weeks on this issue and are on the way to finding individual solutions with each of them,” Tesla said in a Thursday statement to Reuters. However, any additional efforts to compensate former customers doesn’t serve the automaker beyond maintaining peace with Grohmann Engineering, and is counter to Musk’s initial plan to cut them lose. “We believe that Grohmann will honor its contractual obligations toward us in future,” BMW said in a statement, before adding that it had not been “formally notified” about any changes to the contractual arrangements one-way-or-another.

If I was the former CEO of that business, I’d quit too; it’s no fun to watch your new corporate overlords take a cr4p all over the relationships you’ve spent years building with your customers, who might have make very expensive plans around their work being performed as agreed.

(about 12 employees, few million in annual sales). We have had this happen to us and yeah it sucks. A company that made the cable harnesses for our machines got a HUGE contract with a major client. Overnight they had more work than they knew what to do with. The end result was that they decided to drop us to make room in production. It wasn’t an outright breach, they did complete the work that we had contracted with them. They just didn’t accept any more requests for quotes from us. Different situation here of course. The clients are much bigger. I just understand what it’s like to be on that end of things. Login to reply nguyenvuminh May 5th, 2017 at 12:58 pm “make nice” ….. Or “to Avoid lawsuits” ? Login to reply zerofoo May 5th, 2017 at 2:35 pm Sounds like this guy sold the company, got a payday, and is upset that he’s not the boss any longer. Did he really expect to sell his company, then tell the new parent company how to run its business? Sorry pal, life doesn’t work that way. As for the clients – tough cookies. If you outsource components of your business, you accept the risk that comes with that outsourcing – up to and including the sale or closure of the company providing those services. A whole bunch of businesses here made assumptions about each other that didn’t pan out. Login to reply tresmonos May 5th, 2017 at 3:07 pm Yeah except Elon is doing this out of desperation. It is well known his plant has been running like dog sh1t for almost a year now. Automation engineers that we contract out have all been on site and claim its a sh1t show. No one internally at Tesla knows what the f*ck to do to get out of the hole. Tesla is desperately trying to insource expertise when it doesn’t know how to apply said expertise. They’re essentially buying a company for their know-how, then upsetting said know-how so they might as well have just poached engineers one by one and set up a shadow company in Germany. So yeah… Life doesn’t work that way or whatever you’re saying because in the life of Elon, he still doesn’t know how to build a f*cking car. Most of my automation guys used to work with the vendors and vice versa. In robotics, the line between OEM and application engineering is very blurred. Tesla’s problems are more systemic than what everyone would like to think.

The briefing will "show the world what's next" and includes an appearance by Surface's creator. See you in Shanghai. May 23. #MicrosoftEvent #Surface https://t.co/aMgvkkqE52 pic.twitter.com/vzcK9MqIpf— Panos Panay (@panos_panay) May 5, 2017 Microsoft has scheduled the event to take place in Shanghai on May 23rd. The company's invites don't reveal much of what to expect but Microsoft has reportedly confirmed there'll be new hardware taking to the stage. If this doesn’t already hint at the presence of Surface, Microsoft's vice president of devices and Surface creator Panos Panay tweeted out the announcement with the hashtag "#Surface" as the event was made public. Although Microsoft has only just released a Surface product, it looks like the next is already on the way. Surface Pro 4 image from Microsoft's October 2015 Live Event Microsoft The company is widely expected to launch the Surface Pro 5, the next version of the brand's signature product. Microsoft's flagship convertible has been a key driver of its stock market growth in recent years. Favoured by professionals who need to work on the go, anticipation is running high for the new device. The current Surface Pro 4 was launched over 18 months ago. Not a lot is known about Microsoft's plans for the Pro 5. It's expected to retain its current form factor and selection of accessories. Most of the major changes are likely to take place internally with the most significant the inclusion of Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors. According to noted Microsoft journalist Paul Thurrott, the refresh will be "nothing dramatic." Surface Laptop Microsoft If this is the case, Microsoft's intentions in hosting another hardware event so soon after its last are called into question. Even if the Surface Pro 5 does make an appearance, the company is likely to debut additional products simultaneously. Evidence for the event being more than just a Surface launch can be found in its location: Microsoft normally heads to New York when it's debuting a new device. The invitations claim Microsoft will "show the world what's next," a message which initially points to Surface's evolution but could also have a deeper meaning. Microsoft has been working to make emerging technologies more widely accessible, particularly around mixed reality. Windows 10 Creators Update Microsoft The recent Windows 10 Creators Update has enabled support for mixed reality on millions of PCs worldwide. Microsoft is preparing to launch a range of comparatively low-cost headsets from partner companies to take advantage of the technology. It also already has its HoloLens headset in use with developers and companies worldwide. It's probable Microsoft will make more announcements about its mixed reality technology during the Shanghai event. This may include additional information about its plans to bring mixed reality to consumer devices, potentially signalling the inclusion of the tech in the Surface Pro 5. As part of its education event this week, Microsoft introduced a new Windows 10 app that lets you overlay 3D objects on the real world using a regular webcam. Although nothing has been confirmed, it's likely the new event will look towards the future of technology and demonstrate Microsoft's latest research systems. With consumer hardware also set to be a focus, fans of Surface could be in an for unprecedented double billing this month.

The gains were driven by energy, technology and industrial companies. The Labor Department told investors what they had hoped to hear: employers added more workers last month after a sluggish beginning to the year. Energy companies rose as the price of oil recovered from losses earlier in the week. Media companies like CBS and Charter Communications recovered from their losses earlier in the week. Technology companies rose, but IBM missed out after billionaire investor Warren Buffett said he sold a large part of his stake in the company. After a quiet morning, stocks rose in the afternoon and the S&P 500 finished above the all-time high close it set March 1. Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo’s Investment Institute, said stocks benefited from the combination of greater hiring and slower wage growth because if wages rise too quickly it will affect corporate profits. “The market is likely to be concerned about wage gains and the impact on corporate margins as we move into 2018,” he said. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index climbed 9.77 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,399.29. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 55.47 points, or 0.3 percent, to 21,006.94. The Nasdaq composite jumped 25.42 points, or 0.4 percent, to 6,100.76, which beat a record it set earlier this week. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks added 8.15 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,397. Employers in the United States added 211,000 jobs in April, according to the Labor Department. That comes after slow hiring over the first three months of the year and sluggish economic growth. Energy companies bounced back as the price of oil steadied. After two steep losses in three days, benchmark U.S. crude oil jumped 70 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $46.22 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, added 72 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $49.10 barrel in London. Oil prices had fallen earlier this week as investors wonder if OPEC will extend a deal that trimmed oil production. Occidental Petroleum rose $2.38, or 4.1 percent, to $60.40 and Transocean jumped 84 cents, or 8.1 percent, to $11.18. Baker Hughes gained $1.92, or 3.3 percent, to $59.33. Apple jumped $2.43, or 1.7 percent, to $148.96, another record for the world’s most valuable publicly-traded company. That helped tech stocks move higher. Basic materials makers advanced. Dow Chemical gained $1.67, or 2.7 percent, to $63.09 and gas supplier Praxair rose $3.16, or 2.5 percent, to $129.48. Fertilizer maker CF Industries climbed $1.35, or 5 percent, to $28.42. CBS announced a bigger profit and more revenue than analysts expected, and its stock gained $1.35, or 2.1 percent, to $65.20. Media companies have struggled the last few days as investors worried about declining cable ad revenue. Charter Communications, Scripps Networks and Tegna all traded higher. IBM fell after Warren Buffett said he’s sold about 25 million shares of the technology and consulting company, about a third of the stake that his Berkshire Hathaway company had owned. Buffett started buying IBM stock in 2011. IBM faces stiff competition from companies including Microsoft and Amazon, which have focused on cloud computing services. IBM reached an all-time high of $215 in early 2013 and closed at $155.05 Friday, down $4, or 2.5 percent. Cosmetics maker Revlon plunged after its sales in North America fell during the first quarter. That affected all parts of its business, as its consumer and professional divisions both reported smaller profits and lower sales than they did a year ago. Revlon bought Elizabeth Arden in September, and sales for that business were about the same as they had been a year ago. The stock had its worst day since 2008 as it gave up $5.95, or 23.6 percent, to $19.30. Biotech drug companies slipped. Biogen dropped $6.45, or 2.4 percent, to $262.15 and Incyte sank $2.69, or 2.1 percent, to $122.41. Celgene fell $2.05, or 1.6 percent, also closing at $122.41. Bond prices held steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained 2.35 percent. High-dividend stocks did fairly well. Telecommunications companies recovered from a hard loss the day before, and utility companies also rose. Banks traded lower. Gold dipped $1.70 to $1,226.90 an ounce. The precious metal fell more than 3 percent this week for its biggest decline since right after the presidential election. Silver lost 3 cents to $16.27 an ounce. Copper rose 2 cents to $2.53 a pound. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $1.50 a gallon. Heating oil added 2 cents to $1.44 a gallon. Natural gas jumped 8 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $3.27 per 1,000 cubic feet. The dollar rose to 112.61 yen from 112.42 yen. The euro climbed $1.0990 from $1.0981. France’s CAC 40 jumped another 1.1 percent as investors hoped centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron will be elected president over the weekend. The CAC 40 is at its highest level since early 2008. Britain’s FTSE 100 was up 0.7 percent and Germany’s DAX added 0.5 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 0.8 percent. Markets in Japan and South Korea were closed for holidays.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) AP US stock indexes dip following solid April jobs report By MARLEY JAY AP Markets Writer 13 hrs ago (…) Richard Drew FILE - This Oct. 4, 2014, file photo, shows the facade of the New York Stock Exchange. Stocks are modestly higher in early trading on Wall Street, Friday, May 5, 2017, after the government reported a pickup in hiring in April. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. government said hiring bounced back in April, something investors had wanted to see, but stocks aren't reacting much Friday morning. Biotech drug companies and banks are slightly lower. IBM is slumping after billionaire investor Warren Buffett said he sold a large part of his stake in the company. KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 2 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,391 as of 10:50 a.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average slumped 27 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,924 because of IBM's loss. The Nasdaq composite held steady at 6,074. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks remained at 1,388. Most of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange were a bit higher. JOBS: Employers in the United States added 211,000 jobs in April, according to the Labor Department. That was a relief to investors who were concerned about slower hiring and economic growth over the first three months of the year because. Wages grew at a slower pace, however. The VIX, an index that is interpreted as a measure of how nervous investors are, slipped further. On Monday the index hit a decade low and it's only a bit higher than that Friday. IBM GETS BUFFET-TED: IBM fell after Warren Buffett said he's sold about 25 million shares of the technology and consulting company, about a third of the stake that his Berkshire Hathaway company had owned. Buffett started buying IBM stock in 2011. IBM faces stiff competition from companies including Microsoft and Amazon, which have focused on cloud computing services. IBM reached an all-time high of $215 in early 2013. It fell $4.10, or 2.6 percent, to $154.96 Friday. About a year ago the stock was worth less than $120 a share. IBM's decline helped pull technology companies lower. Chipmakers like Intel, Lam Research and Qorvo also skidded about 1 percent. CRUDE CONCERNS: Energy companies bounced back as the price of oil steadied. After steep losses the last two days, benchmark U.S. crude oil jumped 96 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $46.48 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, added $1.08, or 2.2 percent, to $49.46 a barrel in London. Oil prices have fallen hard as investors wonder if OPEC will extend a deal that trimmed oil production. Occidental Petroleum rose $1.61, or 2.8 percent, to $19.50 and ConocoPhillips gained 82 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $46.74. BLEMISHED: Cosmetics maker Revlon plunged after its sales in North America fell during the first quarter. That affected all parts of its business, as its consumer and professional divisions both reported smaller profits and lower sales than they did a year ago.

Radeon RX 550 Linux Benchmarks: $89 Polaris GPU On Open-Source Written by Michael Larabel in Graphics Cards on 5 May 2017. Page 1 of 8. 49 Comments For those curious how AMD's sub-$100 "Polaris 12" graphics processors perform in the context of the recently-launched Radeon RX 550, here are some benchmarks of this low-end graphics card. The Radeon RX 550 is advertised as up to five times greater performance than an Intel IGP (Skylake HD Graphics 530). The RX 550 has 1.2 TFLOPS of compute power, 128-bit video memory bandwidth, and graphics cards come in 2GB and 4GB options. Radeon RX 550 boards have a 50 Watt TDP and thus do not need any external PCI-E power connection. For my testing I had purchased the Gigabyte Radeon RX 550 Gaming OC 2GB (RX550GAMINGOC-2GD), which retails for $90 USD. This card has an HDMI, DisplayPort, and dual-link DVI connections. The RX 550 supports 4K displays, but I wouldn't recommend it, especially for the 2GB vRAM models.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) AP US stock indexes edge higher after solid April jobs report By MARLEY JAY AP Markets Writer May 5, 2017 Updated 2 min ago 0 Richard Drew FILE - This Oct. 4, 2014, file photo, shows the facade of the New York Stock Exchange. Stocks are modestly higher in early trading on Wall Street, Friday, May 5, 2017, after the government reported a pickup in hiring in April. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. government said hiring bounced back in April, something investors had wanted to see, and stocks are slightly higher Friday afternoon. Energy companies are bouncing back along with oil prices. IBM is slumping after billionaire investor Warren Buffett said he sold a large part of his stake in the company. KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 2 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,392 as of 12:20 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average slumped 11 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,940 because of IBM's loss. The Nasdaq composite rose 6 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,081. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks added 1 point, or 0.1 percent, to 1,389. JOBS: Employers in the United States added 211,000 jobs in April, according to the Labor Department. That was a relief to investors who were concerned about slower hiring and economic growth over the first three months of the year because. The VIX, an index that is interpreted as a measure of how nervous investors are, slipped. On Monday the index hit a 10-year low. THE QUOTE: Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo's Investment Institute, said the April report was the latest in a long run of solid but mostly unexciting jobs reports. While many investors want to see stronger wage growth along with continued hiring, Wren said rising wages may cause trouble for the stock market if economic growth remains slow: higher pay and limited growth could squeeze company profits. "The market is likely to be concerned about wage gains and the impact on corporate margins as we move into 2018," he said. CRUDE CONCERNS: Energy companies bounced back as the price of oil steadied. After steep losses the last two days, benchmark U.S. crude oil jumped 74 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $46.26 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, added 60 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $48.98 barrel in London. Oil prices have fallen hard as investors wonder if OPEC will extend a deal that trimmed oil production. Occidental Petroleum rose $1.59, or 2.6 percent, to $59.61 and ConocoPhillips gained 48 cents, or 1 percent, to $46.40. IBM GETS BUFFET-TED: IBM fell after Warren Buffett said he's sold about 25 million shares of the technology and consulting company, about a third of the stake that his Berkshire Hathaway company had owned. Buffett started buying IBM stock in 2011. IBM faces stiff competition from companies including Microsoft and Amazon, which have focused on cloud computing services. IBM reached an all-time high of $215 in early 2013. It fell $3,94, or 2.5 percent, to $155.11 Friday. About a year ago the stock was worth less than $120 a share. BLEMISHED: Cosmetics maker Revlon plunged after its sales in North America fell during the first quarter. That affected all parts of its business, as its consumer and professional divisions both reported smaller profits and lower sales than they did a year ago. Revlon bought Elizabeth Arden in September and its sales were about the same as they had been a year ago. The stock gave up $5.25, or 20.8 percent, to $20. MATERIAL MOVEMENT: Basic materials makers advanced. Dow Chemical gained $1.48, or 2.4 percent, to $62.90 and Praxair rose $2.84, or 2.2 percent, to $129.16. Fertilizer maker CF Industries climbed $1.19, or 4.4 percent, to $28.26. HEALTH CARE SLUMP: Biotech drug companies slipped. Incyte sank $3.70, or 3 percent, to $121.30 and Biogen and $6.41, or 2.4 percent, to $262.19. Amgen fell $1.63, or 1 percent, to $162.66. BONDS: Bond prices edged lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.36 percent from 2.35 percent. High-dividend stocks did fairly well Friday morning as telecommunications company's recovered from a hard loss the day before, and utility companies also rose. Banks traded lower. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 112.64 yen from 112.42 yen. The euro climbed $1.0997 from $1.0981. OVERSEAS: France's CAC 40 jumped another 1.1 percent as investors hoped centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron will be elected president over the weekend. The CAC 40 is at its highest level since early 2008. Britain's FTSE 100 was up 0.7 percent and Germany's DAX added 0.5 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 0.8 percent. Markets in Japan and South Korea were closed for holidays. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at https://apnews.com/search/marley%20jay Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady Qualcomm could consider “nuclear option” in ongoing royalty dispute with Apple Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Friday, May 5th, 2017, 05:46 Category: Hardware, iPhone, News Things are getting ugly between Apple and Qualcomm. Qualcomm, which has been in a heated dispute with Apple over patent royalty payment, may exercise the nuclear option by asking the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) to block iPhone imports. At the root of the dispute between Apple and Qualcomm are cellular communication technology patents that Apple and others license from Qualcomm for a hefty fee. The tensions, which have been brewing for months, finally hit a new peak in January when the Federal Trade Commission accused Qualcomm of anti-trust practices. Essentially the deals it was making with companies like Apple were considered unfair. Part of the issue was that Qualcomm was charging Apple a licensing fee for every single iPhone, whether or not every device used Qualcomm’s cellular technologies. As of the iPhone 7, Apple started mixing in Intel baseband processors to the iPhone mix. A few days later, Apple filed suit against Qualcomm for $1 billion. Qualcomm eventually filed its own countersuit. The subject of the royalty suits surfaced during Apple’s Q2 2017 financial report call on Tuesday when an investor asked Apple CEO Tim Cook why Apple was still withholding royalty payments from Qualcomm, thereby risking Qualcomm withholding future cellular modem sales to Apple or Qualcomm “potentially even getting an injunction on iPhones in select geographies around the world.” Cook stated that Qualcomm and companies like it must offer licenses to partners at fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms. Qualcomm, according to Cook, has not done that. Cook also made it clear that Apple believes it owes Qualcomm something, just not the amount Qualcomm is charging. It’s hard to say where this will go, but some industry watchers feel Qualcomm is dead serious in its threat. “I firmly believe that Qualcomm will pursue an iPhone import block and they are doing it to get paid for the IP Apple is consuming for free,” said Moor Insights & Strategy President and Principal Analyst Patrick Moorhead. “Apple isn’t going to come back to the table and Qualcomm isn’t going to change their 3gpp ETSI-agreed licensing process unless a court requires it.” Still, Qualcomm has yet to make such a move “No complaint has been filed with the Commission at this time,” U.S. International Trade Commission Public Affairs Officer Peg O’Laughlin said via email. The lack of paperwork doesn’t mean Qualcomm, which would not comment on this story, isn’t considering the move, but it makes it seem less like a dangerous action and more like something else. “Yes, it is a negotiating tactic,” said Analyst and Creative Strategies President Tim Bajarin, adding, “[Qualcomm] would probably not be able to get an injunction but could use this move to force Apple to be more proactive in dealing with this problem.” Should Qualcomm’s threats lead to a delay in the next-gen iPhone, this would be bad for both Apple and Qualcomm, but also lead to the vilification of Qualcomm among users and the media alike. This, in turn, would make it that much harder for Qualcomm to land deals with other device makers looking to incorporate their technology. Qualcomm will also get paid nothing. In effect, Qualcomm’s nuclear option could mortally wound Qualcomm. And when the dust clears, Apple would pick itself up, brush itself off, and eventually ship the next-gen iPhone with Intel’s cellular technology. Someone else would end up owning Qualcomm’s patents, probably a patent troll, but Apple would still have an easier time dealing with them. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

The gains were driven by energy, technology and industrial companies. The Labor Department told investors what they had hoped to hear: employers added more workers last month after a sluggish beginning to the year. Energy companies rose as the price of oil recovered from losses earlier in the week. Media companies like CBS and Charter Communications recovered from their losses earlier in the week. Technology companies rose, but IBM missed out after billionaire investor Warren Buffett said he sold a large part of his stake in the company. Latest news videos After a quiet morning, stocks rose in the afternoon and the S&P 500 finished above the all-time high close it set March 1. Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo's Investment Institute, said stocks benefited from the combination of greater hiring and slower wage growth because if wages rise too quickly it will affect corporate profits. "The market is likely to be concerned about wage gains and the impact on corporate margins as we move into 2018," he said. The Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 9.77 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,399.29. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 55.47 points, or 0.3 percent, to 21,006.94. The Nasdaq composite jumped 25.42 points, or 0.4 percent, to 6,100.76, which beat a record it set earlier this week. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks added 8.15 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,397. Employers in the United States added 211,000 jobs in April, according to the Labor Department. That comes after slow hiring over the first three months of the year and sluggish economic growth. Energy companies bounced back as the price of oil steadied. After two steep losses in three days, benchmark U.S. crude oil jumped 70 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $46.22 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, added 72 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $49.10 barrel in London. Oil prices had fallen earlier this week as investors wonder if OPEC will extend a deal that trimmed oil production. Occidental Petroleum rose $2.38, or 4.1 percent, to $60.40 and Transocean jumped 84 cents, or 8.1 percent, to $11.18. Baker Hughes gained $1.92, or 3.3 percent, to $59.33. Apple jumped $2.43, or 1.7 percent, to $148.96, another record for the world's most valuable publicly-traded company. That helped tech stocks move higher. Basic materials makers advanced. Dow Chemical gained $1.67, or 2.7 percent, to $63.09 and gas supplier Praxair rose $3.16, or 2.5 percent, to $129.48. Fertilizer maker CF Industries climbed $1.35, or 5 percent, to $28.42. CBS announced a bigger profit and more revenue than analysts expected, and its stock gained $1.35, or 2.1 percent, to $65.20. Media companies have struggled the last few days as investors worried about declining cable ad revenue. Charter Communications, Scripps Networks and Tegna all traded higher. IBM fell after Warren Buffett said he's sold about 25 million shares of the technology and consulting company, about a third of the stake that his Berkshire Hathaway company had owned. Buffett started buying IBM stock in 2011. IBM faces stiff competition from companies including Microsoft and Amazon, which have focused on cloud computing services. IBM reached an all-time high of $215 in early 2013 and closed at $155.05 Friday, down $4, or 2.5 percent. Cosmetics maker Revlon plunged after its sales in North America fell during the first quarter. That affected all parts of its business, as its consumer and professional divisions both reported smaller profits and lower sales than they did a year ago. Revlon bought Elizabeth Arden in September, and sales for that business were about the same as they had been a year ago. The stock had its worst day since 2008 as it gave up $5.95, or 23.6 percent, to $19.30. Biotech drug companies slipped. Biogen dropped $6.45, or 2.4 percent, to $262.15 and Incyte sank $2.69, or 2.1 percent, to $122.41. Celgene fell $2.05, or 1.6 percent, also closing at $122.41. Bond prices held steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained 2.35 percent. High-dividend stocks did fairly well. Telecommunications companies recovered from a hard loss the day before, and utility companies also rose. Banks traded lower. Gold dipped $1.70 to $1,226.90 an ounce. The precious metal fell more than 3 percent this week for its biggest decline since right after the presidential election. Silver lost 3 cents to $16.27 an ounce. Copper rose 2 cents to $2.53 a pound. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $1.50 a gallon. Heating oil added 2 cents to $1.44 a gallon. Natural gas jumped 8 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $3.27 per 1,000 cubic feet. The dollar rose to 112.61 yen from 112.42 yen. The euro climbed $1.0990 from $1.0981. France's CAC 40 jumped another 1.1 percent as investors hoped centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron will be elected president over the weekend. The CAC 40 is at its highest level since early 2008. Britain's FTSE 100 was up 0.7 percent and Germany's DAX added 0.5 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 0.8 percent. Markets in Japan and South Korea were closed for holidays. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at https://apnews.com/search/marley%20jay Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

Stocks are modestly higher in early trading on Wall Street, Friday, May 5, 2017, after the government reported a pickup in hiring in April. Richard Drew, File AP Photo National May 05, 2017 4:59 PM After jobs report, a late push takes stocks to new records By MARLEY JAY AP Markets Writer LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story NEW YORK A solid pickup in hiring last month helped push the stock market to record highs Friday. The gains were driven by energy, technology and industrial companies. The Labor Department told investors what they had hoped to hear: employers added more workers last month after a sluggish beginning to the year. Energy companies rose as the price of oil recovered from losses earlier in the week. Media companies like CBS and Charter Communications recovered from their losses earlier in the week. Technology companies rose, but IBM missed out after billionaire investor Warren Buffett said he sold a large part of his stake in the company. After a quiet morning, stocks rose in the afternoon and the S&P 500 finished above the all-time high close it set March 1. Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo's Investment Institute, said stocks benefited from the combination of greater hiring and slower wage growth because if wages rise too quickly it will affect corporate profits. "The market is likely to be concerned about wage gains and the impact on corporate margins as we move into 2018," he said. The Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 9.77 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,399.29. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 55.47 points, or 0.3 percent, to 21,006.94. The Nasdaq composite jumped 25.42 points, or 0.4 percent, to 6,100.76, which beat a record it set earlier this week. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks added 8.15 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,397. Employers in the United States added 211,000 jobs in April, according to the Labor Department. That comes after slow hiring over the first three months of the year and sluggish economic growth. Energy companies bounced back as the price of oil steadied. After two steep losses in three days, benchmark U.S. crude oil jumped 70 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $46.22 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, added 72 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $49.10 barrel in London. Oil prices had fallen earlier this week as investors wonder if OPEC will extend a deal that trimmed oil production. Occidental Petroleum rose $2.38, or 4.1 percent, to $60.40 and Transocean jumped 84 cents, or 8.1 percent, to $11.18. Baker Hughes gained $1.92, or 3.3 percent, to $59.33. Apple jumped $2.43, or 1.7 percent, to $148.96, another record for the world's most valuable publicly-traded company. That helped tech stocks move higher. Basic materials makers advanced. Dow Chemical gained $1.67, or 2.7 percent, to $63.09 and gas supplier Praxair rose $3.16, or 2.5 percent, to $129.48. Fertilizer maker CF Industries climbed $1.35, or 5 percent, to $28.42. CBS announced a bigger profit and more revenue than analysts expected, and its stock gained $1.35, or 2.1 percent, to $65.20. Media companies have struggled the last few days as investors worried about declining cable ad revenue. Charter Communications, Scripps Networks and Tegna all traded higher. IBM fell after Warren Buffett said he's sold about 25 million shares of the technology and consulting company, about a third of the stake that his Berkshire Hathaway company had owned. Buffett started buying IBM stock in 2011. IBM faces stiff competition from companies including Microsoft and Amazon, which have focused on cloud computing services. IBM reached an all-time high of $215 in early 2013 and closed at $155.05 Friday, down $4, or 2.5 percent. Cosmetics maker Revlon plunged after its sales in North America fell during the first quarter. That affected all parts of its business, as its consumer and professional divisions both reported smaller profits and lower sales than they did a year ago. Revlon bought Elizabeth Arden in September, and sales for that business were about the same as they had been a year ago. The stock had its worst day since 2008 as it gave up $5.95, or 23.6 percent, to $19.30. Biotech drug companies slipped. Biogen dropped $6.45, or 2.4 percent, to $262.15 and Incyte sank $2.69, or 2.1 percent, to $122.41. Celgene fell $2.05, or 1.6 percent, also closing at $122.41. Bond prices held steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained 2.35 percent. High-dividend stocks did fairly well. Telecommunications companies recovered from a hard loss the day before, and utility companies also rose. Banks traded lower. Gold dipped $1.70 to $1,226.90 an ounce. The precious metal fell more than 3 percent this week for its biggest decline since right after the presidential election. Silver lost 3 cents to $16.27 an ounce. Copper rose 2 cents to $2.53 a pound. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $1.50 a gallon. Heating oil added 2 cents to $1.44 a gallon. Natural gas jumped 8 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $3.27 per 1,000 cubic feet. The dollar rose to 112.61 yen from 112.42 yen. The euro climbed $1.0990 from $1.0981. France's CAC 40 jumped another 1.1 percent as investors hoped centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron will be elected president over the weekend. The CAC 40 is at its highest level since early 2008. Britain's FTSE 100 was up 0.7 percent and Germany's DAX added 0.5 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 0.8 percent. Markets in Japan and South Korea were closed for holidays. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at https://apnews.com/search/marley%20jay LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Suggested for you   Comments   Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 2 months ago Surveillance video shows woman jumping out of trunk after kidnapping 1:20 2 months ago Surveillance video shows woman jumping out of trunk after kidnapping 1:26 2 months ago Witnesses describe deadly bus-train collision in Biloxi, Miss. 1:42 2 months ago Caught on camera: Vandals toss tar on home View More Video National Jury: Man convicted of 6 killings should get death penalty Prosecutors dropping 2 teens' charges in school rape case AP News in Brief at 12:03 a.m. EDT Today in History Texas police officer faces murder charge in teen's death National Nation & World Videos Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions e-Edition Home Delivery Vacation Hold Report a Delivery Error Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us FAQ RSS Social, Mobile & More Facebook Twitter YouTube Mobile Apps & E Reader Text Alerts Newsletters Advertising Place a Classified Advertise Rates Contests & Promotions Shopping Local Deals More Copyright Privacy Policy Terms of Service

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman HRG to Organize Golden Partner Forum to Enhance Global Cooperation in Robotics COLLEGE PARK, Maryland, May 5, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — HIT Robot Group (HRG), one of China’s top robot manufacturing companies, will host HRG Golden Partner Forum (the Forum) at the University of Maryland’s Riggs Center on May 14, 2017. The event, which aims to further exchanges and resource-sharing in the areas of robotic technology and technological innovation between China and the U.S., is expected to play a part in beefing up cooperation among academic institutions, peer companies and governments on a global scale. The event, which is conveniently located for the myriad academic, government, and industry professionals in the Washington D.C. area, will feature discussions with senior experts from advanced research institutes including University of Maryland, Cornell, John Hopkins, and Harvard’s Wyss Institute, and representatives from companies such as Ramana Rachakonda, principal engineer of Joule at Intel and Karen Lu, regional general manager of Alibaba Cloud International. „We would like to create more resources and insight-sharing opportunities for manufacturers of and investors in robotics from China and the U.S. Through this Forum, HRG is doing our part to bolster international cooperation in smart manufacturing and research and development,” said Lei Zhu, Vice President of HRG. Following the morning forum, a Roadshow Competition on robotics innovation will be held, where ten teams, selected previously in smaller competitions, will compete for cash awards, investment opportunities and strategic guidance and support from HRG and potential investors. HRG is using this competition as a way to encourage start-ups’ incubation and growth, talent development and support. The event will be concluded with a VIP dinner. Themed, „China-U.S. Cross-border Cooperation and Investment”, the reception, co-hosted by HRG and the China General Chamber of Commerce-USA (CGCC), will include government officials and businesspeople who are leaders in the field of China-U.S. cooperation. The Forum is a further step in support of the Chinese government’s „Made in China 2025″ initiative.

By Mark Hachman Senior Editor, PCWorld | May 5, 2017 11:24 AM PT Credit: Microsoft More like this Microsoft's next Surface may be a Chromebook competitor for schools Missing pieces: What Microsoft failed to deliver in the Windows 10 Creators... Microsoft's budget Windows VR headsets roll out to developers soon Video Windows 10 Privacy: How to disable the Location features Microsoft said Thursday night that it will host another mysterious event for reporters, to “show the world what’s next” in Shanghai, China. So far, the invitation has come somewhat out of left field. Microsoft representatives were unavailable for comment at press time, and Microsoft executives haven’t previously indicated that such an event was planned. It likely involves new hardware, though, since Microsoft’s device chief, Panos Panay, has tweeted that he will be at the May 23 event, using the #Surface hashtag. What Microsoft may announce at the event is unknown, but we can make some guesses. Chief among them is a further development in Microsoft’s "mixed reality" aspirations, as well as closing the loop on some of the other hardware announcements, like Windows 10 running on top of ARM chips. And maybe the Surface Pro 5? [ Further reading: Our best Windows 10 tricks, tips and tweaks ] Last December, Microsoft teamed up with Intel on new specs for PCs designed to drive VR experiences. As part of that announcement, Microsoft revealed plans to bring the HoloLens to China in the first part of 2017. It also announced a partnership with Chinese head-mounted display developer 3Glasses, as noted by IDG News Service reporter and colleague Blair Hanley Frank. Why this matters: Microsoft previously said that mixed reality would be part and parcel of the Windows 10 Creators Update, though the feature never really appeared—one of many that was either delayed or deliberately held for the next big Windows release, known as Redstone 3. While Microsoft has embraced the concept of “mixed reality,” or mixing virtual and augmented reality within the same headset, it also has tried to position Windows 10 as the OS for the future of pure VR devices like the Oculus Rift. Successfully showing off mixed reality—and maybe answering questions on the role of Hololens—would certainly help its cause. 3Glasses The 3Glasses Blubur S1 mixed-reality headset. Who is Microsoft’s mixed-reality favorite? 3Glasses said then that it would ship its first Windows 10-compatible head-mounted display, the S1, to Chinese customers in the first part of 2017. The company actually announced the device, formally known as the Blubur S1, the month before.  According to 3Glasses, here are the Blubur S1’s specifications: Display resolution: 2,880 x 1,440 at 120 Hz (704 PPI) Panel response time: <10ms Optical Lens: 110° Field of View Display Port 1.2 / USB 2.0 or above Integrated audio Operating system: Windows 7, 8, 10 (64-bit) Dimensions: 7.4 inches x 3.2 inches x 2.0 inches Weight: 0.79 pounds Microsoft also announced plans to work with more established partners—such as Acer, Asus, HP, and Dell—in developing low-cost mixed-reality headsets. Acer has already shown off the Developer Edition of its headset, though the other partners have lagged behind. A key feature is “inside-out tracking,” which allow the headset to track the user without an external sensor. But all of those headsets are expected to be launched during the fourth quarter of 2017, in time for the holiday season. A formal launch at the Shanghai event would be much earlier than expected, though it’s possible that HP and Dell, for example, could unveil their hardware there.  In this IDGNS photo from June 2012, a Qualcomm chip powers a tablet running Windows RT. What will Windows 10 on ARM look like? Windows on ARM...or the Surface phone? If hardware that’s expected to ship in the fourth quarter is on the table, though, that might include a first look at ARM PCs based on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835. Windows 10 running on ARM has been the subject of much speculation: will those devices have the power that users demand, as well as the required compatibility? Qualcomm chief executive Steve Mollenkopf told analysts that the first fruits of its partnership with Microsoft would be seen in the fourth quarter. The company has also referred to the Windows on ARM devices as “cellular PCs.” That, of course, has led to speculation that the so-called “Surface phone” will in fact be nothing more than a small portable device that’s also capable of placing calls. “I’m sure we’ll make more phones, but they will not look like phones that are there today,” chief executive Satya Nadella recently told the Marketplace “Make Me Smart” podcast. Mentioned in this article Surface Book i7  PCWorld rating MSRP $3,299.00View on Amazon The new Surface Book i7 sticks with the original's one-of-a-kindness, and ups the graphics power gloriously. Microsoft could also announce refreshes of the Surface Book, the Surface Pro 4, and the Surface 3, all devices that haven’t seen a true update since 2015. Microsoft did provide an update of sorts to the Surface Book with the 2016 Performance Base, though, which it launched last fall alongside the Surface Studio. The Base merely upgraded the Surface Book’s discrete GPU, however. Both the Surface Pro 4 and Book are based on Intel “Skylake” chips, rather than the recent “Kaby Lake” generation. Those chips are found within the new Surface Laptop, scheduled to ship in June. Furthermore, Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president of the Windows and Devices group at Microsoft, told Bloomberg TV this week that an updated Surface Pro 4 was due in the near future. It looks like Microsoft may have some new hardware for you to buy rather soon, after all. This story was updated at 11:24 AM on May 5 with additional details.

(MRVL) Stock Rating Lowered by Zacks Investment Research May 5th, 2017 - 0 comments - Filed Under - by Jeff Wilder Filed Under: Analyst Articles - US - Finance Tweet Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (NASDAQ:MRVL) was downgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “buy” rating to a “hold” rating in a research note issued on Wednesday. According to Zacks, “Marvell Technology is a fabless designer, developer and marketer of analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits. The stock has outperformed the broader industry over the last one-year. Though the macro headwinds and stringent regulations might put the company's financials under pressure in the near term, we believe that the strong demand for Marvell’s 4G LTE products could be a growth driver. This will be supported by growth from the company’s wide range of newly-launched IoT solutions. Also, the company’s recent restructuring initiative will help Marvell improve cloud infrastructure and applications, which are expected to drive the company’s top line. The latest buyback scheme also reflects the company’s sound financial position. However, competition in the semiconductor market from major players such as Intel and Texas Instruments is a headwind.” Other research analysts have also issued research reports about the stock. B.

GORKI (Russia), (Sputnik) — His comments follow the reported passage on Thursday of a US House of Representatives bill enhancing sanctions against North Korea, outlining "inspection authorities" over Chinese, Iranian, Syrian and Russian ports. The latter include the ports of Nakhodka, Vanino and Vladivostok. "The United States of America should deal with the affairs of the United States of America. As for our ports, we have quite enough government agencies and supervisory bodies that are able to control the fulfillment of all international obligations that Russia has assumed," Trutnev told reporters. The chairman of the Russian upper house of parliament's international committee said the bill amounted to a declaration of war. The situation on the Korean peninsula aggravated in recent months as North Korea carried out a number of missile launches and nuclear tests , which are considered to be in violation of the UN Security Council resolutions. The most recent missile test allegedly took place on April 29 from a site north of Pyongyang. Japan, South Korea and the United States said the test appeared to have failed as the missile broke-up within North Korean territory. © AP Photo/ Wong Maye-E US, S Korean Intel Try to Assassinate Kim Jong-un With Biochemical Weapon - PyongyangOn May 3, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the United States is preparing to impose additional sanctions on North Korea if Pyongyang continues to pursue ballistic and nuclear weapons. As a response to the potential use of nuclear weapons, the United States sent a strike group led by US aircraft carrier Carl Vinson to the Korean Peninsula in early April, where it began exercises with the South Korean navy. US media reported on mid-April that US President Donald Trump might order a strike against North Korea in light of its military activities. The North Korean top officials said the country was ready for nuclear attacks in case of possible US military aggression. The crisis is aggravated by the deployment of the US THAAD air defense system in South Korea. © Sputnik/ Iliya Pitalev Vintage Volvo: Sweden Still Hopes to Reclaim North Korea's 70s DebtThe THAAD agreement was reached by Seoul and Washington in July 2016. The move came amid growing tensions spurred by North Korea's recurring ballistic and nuclear missile tests. The THAAD system has a range of some 200 kilometers (125 miles) and is designed to intercept short, medium and intermediate ballistic missiles at the terminal incoming stage. The move to deploy it in South Korea has been criticized by neighboring China and Russia as inappropriate, possibly disproportionate, and affecting other countries' interests. ...

Meet the Contributors → If Budget Holds, NIH Precision Study Could Be Flush As Volunteers Arrive Alex Lash May 4th, 2017 @alexlash @xconomy Like Us Xconomy National —  Until this week, many U.S. government science agencies and programs seemed destined for a big haircut, plus the loss of a limb or two. That included the Precision Medicine Initiative, an ambitious long-term study with the goal of recruiting 1 million Americans to volunteer health data. But in staving off a government shutdown, Congress pushed back hard against the White House’s funding proposal to cover the rest of the current fiscal year, which runs through September. Nothing’s a done deal until it has President Trump’s signature. But as things stand, the Precision Medicine Initiative, or PMI, could get as much as $230 million for the year, which would be nearly double the initiative’s 2016 budget. Some of that money comes from the 21st Century Cures Act, a wide-ranging law that aims to speed the review of new drugs and devices that President Obama signed just before he left office. The timing is critical. The initiative is weeks away from recruiting its first volunteer. The goal is to sign up as many as 35,000 people through the fall before pausing to take stock. The NIH’s Eric Dishman, who runs the main part of the PMI, calls it a “beta phase” of recruitment. (Dishman spent 15 years at tech giant Intel before coming to the NIH.) “If we don’t get above $130 million,” said Dishman, referring to the current budget negotiations, “it would delay significant elements of the program.” Dishman’s group has lined up major health centers such as Massachusetts General Hospital and the University of Pittsburgh (PA) as well as smaller community centers around the country to help recruit a diverse range of Americans. Diversity, in fact, is paramount. “I’d rather they miss their overall numbers” than fail to recruit a diverse population, said Dishman. The long term goal is to have 75 percent of the volunteers from groups traditionally underrepresented in biomedical research. Extrapolating results from white European men and applying them to women or non-white groups “can cause harm,” said Dishman. At first, volunteers will answer personal health and history surveys and submit blood and urine samples. Later, perhaps by the end of 2018, said Dishman, could come whole genome sequencing and daily data from participants’ wearable devices. Both those elements will face cost and technology hurdles, however. The PMI has promised that all participants will have full access to their own data. The infrastructure to share vast amounts of personal information must be secure, and people receiving their own data must have the resources to interpret it. “There currently aren’t enough genetic counselors in the country to support what’s out there,” said Dishman. The kickoff comes soon after the official launch of a long-term health study run by Verily, formerly known as Google Life Sciences. Verily’s Baseline study is aiming for 10,000 participants who would undergo a much deeper battery of tests that would require a couple days’ visit to a clinic. “They’re very different strategies,” said Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Translational Science Institute in San Diego, which is building key pieces of the PMI—and who raised questions last year in a Nature paper about tech giants like Apple and Verily’s parent Alphabet gathering health data. (Verily is helping Vanderbilt University and the Broad Institute build the PMI data center, but its Baseline study is completely separate.) “So much data about any given human has particular value for certain things. Like blood pressure data around the clock for 10,000 people, that’s far more than we have today.” But understanding disease states across diverse groups, such as different ages, or urban versus rural, “you can’t do it with just 10,000 people,” Topol said. Verily unveiled a wrist-worn “Study Watch” that will record participants’ daily activities and vital signs. Unlike the PMI, Verily is not going to share all the data collects with the participants. NIH director Francis Collins said last year recruitment for the PMI study, now renamed All of Us, would start in November 2016. That didn’t happen, says Dishman, because the NIH wanted to include urine and blood sample collection right out of the gate. The upcoming beta phase will ensure that the health centers are collecting and shipping samples properly to the study’s biobank run by the Mayo Clinic, he says. All of Us recruiters, sensitive to people’s attitudes about giving the government personal data, will also report on the outreach methods that work during the beta, and those that don’t, according to Dishman. Funding for 2018 and beyond is still up in the air. The White House has proposed a “skinny budget” for 2018 that slashes NIH funding 19 percent. With the pushback this week, future drastic cuts seem less likely. Dishman said that for All of Us to expand to 1 million participants in coming years and provide valuable data to researchers, the average budget beyond 2018 should be north of $400 million.

Inexpensive Laptops Aren't the Only Thing Teachers Need in the Classroom "Sometimes the traditional paper and pencil methods are better." In the battle for children's tech souls, where do primary and secondary school teachers fall in the great Google vs. Apple vs. Microsoft debate? Now that that Microsoft's unveiled its new Surface laptop in a bid to compete with MacBooks and Chromebooks—both of which have dominated the education market—we asked K-12 educators whether they thought the new arrival deserved all the hype it's received. The lightweight device—it's under three pounds—will debut on June 15 at $999 for its base model, which includes Intel's latest Core i5 processor, 4GB of RAM and 128GB SSD. It comes equipped with Microsoft's new OS Windows 10 S, deemed "education friendly" because it requires minimum maintenance and because apps and programs can only be obtained via the Windows Store. Samantha New, a 7th grade public school math teacher in New Jersey, was categorical: regardless of the brand or model, "In my opinion, laptops are overrated," she told Motherboard. "My students use Chromebooks and although they're helpful in some ways, I feel like they are forced on us," she said. New's district's one-to-one initiative ensures her students are equipped with the devices—which are paid for by district—and teachers are encouraged to use them as much as possible. But that's not always convenient. "Sometimes the traditional paper and pencil methods are better," New said. "Many of the programs we have don't have equation editor which makes teaching math on the computers nearly impossible," she added. "I'm sure cost is a priority in deciding Chromebooks over MacBooks because I know our tech coordinator would prefer MacBooks." Chromebooks for education can cost as low as $191 a pop, while the cheapest MacBook Airs and iPads ring in at $849 and $299, respectively, according to Apple's US Education Price List. Melody Feo, a middle school math and science teacher in New York until this year, told Motherboard she was pleased with the MacBooks her classroom used, which she primarily used "to scaffold for different learners" (meaning that while some students worked on assignments online, others worked directly with her). However, she conceded that, "the downside is that Smartboard technologies wasn't Mac-friendly, so there were a few bugs using the software." And—the oft-repeated complaint among teachers we spoke with—"kids inevitably get distracted." "It's hard to monitor what the student are doing," Cecily Jurlano, a 4th and 5th grade combo teacher in Maryland whose classroom uses Chromebooks, told Motherboard. But to Jurlano, Google's advantage is its surveillance possibility. "A plus about Google classroom is that with their documents we can see the students working on it just by opening their doc on our computer," she said. Richard Burns, a high school social studies teacher in Maryland whose students are required to use iPads, told Motherboard, "The iPads are often a distraction in class as a number of students use them for social rather than academic purposes and it is difficult to monitor would students are accessing." Burn's school is private, meaning students are expected to shell out for their devices. This is problematic for "a few students from lower middle class backgrounds who do have trouble covering expenses," he said.

With $124 billion, Microsoft hoarded the most money offshore among America's biggest 500 companies. Apple was second in the UBS ranking with nearly $110 billion kept abroad. Read more Veteran money manager sees risks for US stocks beyond Trump politics According to UBS, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has the third-biggest cash pile at $86 billion, while General Electric amassed $82 billion outside the US, but $22 billion less than during a previous check. IBM rounded up the top five with over $71 offshore billions. The UBS ranking also includes other big corporations like Johnson & Johnson, Alphabet, Exxon Mobil, Intel, PepsiCo, and Oracle. US companies avoid repatriating their profits mainly because of the current domestic corporate tax rate of about 35 percent - the highest in the world. Last month, the White House proposed lowering the corporate tax rate to 15 percent to motivate companies to bring back massive overseas cash piles. The Trump Administration pledged to listen to interested parties, and work with the House and Senate to develop the details of a plan during May. Some experts are skeptical of corporate tax reform, saying that Senate rules could become the main barrier. Reconciliation bills must get only a majority in the Senate, but they cannot increase the deficit beyond a 10-year horizon, which the tax plan is estimated to do. $UBS: $2.4 trillion in corporate earnings parked overseas. But only five companies $AAPL$MSFT$PFE$GE$IBM account for 20% of that total.— Bob Pisani (@BobPisani) May 4, 2017 To win 60 votes in the Senate and then to be signed into permanent law could become the alternative, but chances of that are slim, according to analysts. The plan may also face resistance from fiscal hawks among the Republicans.

Home News Companies Mobile Gadgets Opinion Cyber Security Multimedia Fin24 TechNews Group of Google veterans starts self-driving tech firm 2017-05-05 07:32 - Alex Webb, Bloomberg News Post a comment 0 share: An Uber self-driving car drives down 5th Street in San Francisco, California. Cars in Uber's self-driving cars are back on the roads after the program was temporarily halted following a crash in Tempe, Arizona in March. (Pic: Justin Sullivan, AFP) RELATED ARTICLES Uber fires back at Google spinoff in self-driving car case Driverless cars finally steer near showrooms Honda in talks with Google on self-drive tech Washington - A mile away from where Google builds the maps used by people around the world, a 25-person startup is trying to do something similar for robots. DeepMap, which was founded by mapping veterans of Alphabet, is building systems enabling self-driving cars to steer through complex cityscapes. DeepMap plans to license its map-building software to automakers and technology companies looking to teach cars how to drive. The company recently raised a $25m funding round led by Accel, adding to the $7m it raised last year. In the chase to secure the investment, the firm penned an 80-page white paper on DeepMap's technology. Investors are eager to grab a piece of self-driving cars after big startup deals, such as General Motors' acquisition of Cruise Automation and Uber Technologies' purchase of Otto. But new entrants face sizable competition, whether in autonomous technology or mapping. In addition to Silicon Valley juggernauts Alphabet, Apple and Uber, Amsterdam's TomTom is building its own 3-D maps, as is HERE, a project jointly owned by several automotive giants and Intel. Andreessen Horowitz and GSR Ventures also invested in DeepMap. Martin Casado, the lead Andreessen partner on DeepMap, said startups can compete with much larger companies because their businesses have fewer conflicts. This enables them to work with just about anybody and focus on the software, which typically has higher profit margins. "DeepMap isn't bound to a particular application like ride-sharing, and they're not bound to a particular company," Casado said. DeepMap fuses images from digital cameras with data collected using a laser device known as lidar to build detailed 3-D maps. It can identify street signs, billboards and the height of a curb. The 3-D maps complement the sensors by giving the cars a detailed awareness of the environment outside the car's view. James Wu, who started the company with his former Google Maps colleague Mark Wheeler, said he hopes to have three customers by the end of the year, while generating as much as $10m in revenue. "Having the map lets us define for the robot the rules of the world," said Wu, who has also worked on mapping projects at Apple and Baidu. "It's very easy to make a prototype car that can make a few decisions around a few blocks, but it's harder when you get out into the world." A diaspora of autonomous driving entrepreneurs from Google has spread throughout Silicon Valley. Google X founder Sebastian Thrun just spun an autonomous car startup out of his online learning company Udacity. Top engineers Chris Urmson and Bryan Salesky have set up companies called Aurora Innovation and Argo AI, respectively. Another engineer, Anthony Levandowski, is the focus of an embittered legal battle between his former employer Alphabet and Uber over allegations that he stole intellectual property from the search giant when he left to form his startup, Otto.Read Fin24's top stories trending on Twitter: Fin24’s top stories Read more about: self-driving cars  |  mapping share: More In This Category Buffett cuts stake in IBM and shares slide US opens criminal investigation into Uber Local start-up gets boost from Silicon Valley and DJ Black Coffee Tracking innovation helps community combat crime Most Popular Read Local start-up gets boost from Silicon Valley and DJ Black Coffee New smartphone player quietly enters SA with cheap devices Tracking innovation helps community combat crime New TV service launched to rival Netflix, Showmax Apple's dilemma: what to do with $256bn cash pile Contact us   |   About Us   |   Terms & Conditions NEWS24  |   OLX  |   PROPERTY24  |   CAREERS24  |   SPREE  |

Join For Free One great thing with Eclipse compared to proprietary IDEs are the thousands of available plugins. Yes, not every plugin is probably on the ‘must have’ list, though I have listed some in a series starting with 5 Best Eclipse Plugins: #1 (Eclox with Doxygen, Graphviz, and Mscgen). The ‘traditional’ approach to installing Eclipse plugins is using the menu Help > Install New Software. Using that approach, I have to use or enter an Eclipse update site. An easier way is to use the Eclipse Marketplace plugin, which allows me to search and browse for plugins and simplifies installation of it. But as this one does not come installed by default with MCUXpresso. Still, it is my preferred way to browse and install plugins into Eclipse: Eclipse Marketplace under Eclipse Neon and MCUXpresso IDE This article is part of a series to get up to speed using the new NXP MCUXpresso IDE. Published so far are: MCUXpresso IDE: Unified Eclipse IDE for NXPs ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers MCUXpresso IDE: S-Record, Intel Hex, and Binary Files MCUXpresso IDE: Importing Kinetis Design Studio Projects MCUXpresso IDE: Installing Processor Expert into Eclipse Neon Outline This article is part of a series of articles about the MCUXpresso IDE. The NXP MCUXpresso IDE v10.0 is Eclipse Neon (4.6)-based, but does not come with the Marketplace plugin installed. In this article, I’m showing how to install the Eclipse Marketplace into Eclipse Neon. The Eclipse Marketplace is a plugin inside Eclipse which I can use to search, browse and install extra Eclipse plugins. To install the client, use the menu Help > Install new Software and use the update site.  If using a different Eclipse version (e.g. kepler or mars), make sure use the corresponding update site. Filter for ‘market’ and you should see the Marketplace Client: Installing Eclipse Marketplace Client into Eclipse Neon Select it and go through the installation process, with a restart of Eclipse at the end. Using the Market Place After installation, I have a new menu item: Eclipse Marketplace menu Using it, I can browse and install the plugins which are listed on the marketplace. For example, I can search for a plugin like added color themes: Eclipse Marketplace under Eclipse Neon and MCUXpresso IDE For example, I can select and install the above plugin (Darkest Dark theme), which gives Eclipse a new look: Darkest theme If an Eclipse distribution does not include the Eclipse Marketplace client, it is easy to install it. After installation, I have a convenient way to get access to all the plugins available on the marketplace. Another usage of the Eclipse Market Place plugin is to install additional software that helps to use legacy Kinetis Design Studio projects in MCUXpresso IDE, which is the subject of the next article.

Right on the heels of my last review covering the newest iterations of the LIVA series, comes the Z Plus model which packs a punch for a device no wider than a Compact-Disc. The LIVA Z Plus comes in a variety of configurations that either comes with Windows 10 pre-installed or as a barebones unit giving the buyer the option to install any OS they choose. With everything all said and done, ECS has provided me with the i5 7300U version for review, so let's get to it.   ECS LIVA Z Plus (7300U) Video Review: Below is a direct video link to our Overclockersclub YouTube Channel. If you are like me and don't always have time to read on the go, I have you covered. The video review talks about everything in this article. If you still need a refresher on the topic in more detail you can always read the full review at a later time. As always, video reviews are still fairly new and we are always trying to improve, so please leave a comment to help us make our videos better and help the community grow!   ECS LIVA Z Plus (7300U) Closer Look: So here it is, back to the ECS LIVA Z, specifically the Plus model as indicated in the bottom left. The box itself is what you come to expect from any company; a picture and a bit of information on the side. Once the slip cover is removed and the box is opened it is apparent how small the actual device is. That is considering the rest of the box houses the power brick and wires. Not much more to talk about, ECS did its job of keeping the device secure to avoid damages in shipping. Not that much could happen, but it still nice to see they put the effort into it.     Moving on to the exterior you can see from the pictures that ECS has included the major types of ports found on computers today. Similar to the LIVA Z, the Plus has the same layout externally, and subsequently internally (mostly). It saves time and money to only have to drop in a different PCB board or SoC CPU, memory, and SSD. That being said, if you do not like the layout or see a potential problem for your particular setup, then move on to a different brand. ECS may be the first to the market using the newest Intel technology, but will not be the only ones by the end of this year. Once past this discrepancy I can talk about the many connections themselves. The front consists of three USB 3.0 Gen1 Type-A Ports and a USB-C port with transfer rates up to 5 Gbit/s. Similar to the LIVA Z, these are not USB 3.1 Gen2. It gets even more complicated by the fact that USB names have changed over time. Whereas it used to be called USB 3.0 with SuperSpeed USB transfer rate, now it is named USB 3.1 Gen 1. It is important to understand the difference, because Gen 2 supports 10 Gbit/s which is known for USB-C, Thunderbolt 3, and USB 3.1 (Gen 2). This unit only has a standard USB port in C-Port form, not the ultra highspeed 10 Gbit/s ports. Whether it is named USB 3.0 or 3.1, if it claims to have transfer speeds of 5 Gbit/s then it falls under the 3.1 Gen1 category. This isn't a bad thing and I don't blame ECS for this, but it is getting harder to distinguish between names that do in fact use the same underlying data protocols.   Flipping the unit around to the backside it gets less complicated, but stranger at the same time. The Plus model shares many of the same issues I identified in the review of the LIVA Z. I'm still not sure why ECS included two Gigabit Ethernet ports on the back without having any USB ports. I believe the intent of the ECS R&D team was for the user to take of advantage of the built-in Bluetooth support for Mouse and Keyboard. At the same time, it would have been really nice to include at least one USB port on the back for those that don't have that kind of setup.   For size comparison I put a Blu-Ray on top of the unit to showcase the sheer technological marvel of being able to cram an entire computer into a small form factor like this. The LIVA Z Plus is 2" tall (33mm) and roughly 4" wide (117mm) for those who like raw numbers more than pictures. The specifications page covers everything in detail, but I'll cover the basics. ECS made opening and upgrading it as easy as possible. It just takes four Philips head screws to remove the bottom cover. Once inside, you can see the WiFi 802.11ac & Bluetooth 4.0 card which is hidden below a M.2 2242 slot. On the other side are two slots for laptop memory. This particular model uses DDR4 memory. Finally, below the memory slots are mini SATA and Comms ports, neither of which is used on this unit. Unlike the LIVA Z base model, the Plus does not include any eMMC memory, but instead populates the M.2 slot with multiple configurations. The unit I received came with a 128GB M.2 SSD. CystalMarks speed test provided insight into the type of performance to expect. Speeds were very reasonable, topping out around 500MB/s for sequential read and 200MB/s for write. It closely resembles most modern SSD with ACHI in M.2 or 2.5" form factor. Having an NVME M.2 drive would be impractical for this type of device.     Last up is the VESA mounting plate, which is a nice bonus ECS has included with its' LIVA Z Plus. For those who are new to mounting TVs, VESA mounts are essential for any display if you want it off the stand. It has four screws that go through the mounting plate and into the monitor. I don't have much more to say about this because it's straight forward. However, the wire situation I talked about earlier becomes a factor here. It will become an ugly mess unless you have an attack plan ahead of time. I suggest Bluetooth Keyboard / Mouse and Wi-Fi to avoid filling up all the ports with unnecessarily long wires hanging off the back.   --- Article Quick Nav ---1 » ECS LIVA Z Plus (7300U): Introduction & Closer Look2 » ECS LIVA Z Plus (7300U): Specifications3 » ECS LIVA Z Plus (7300U): Testing & Conclusion Next page » Article Index Email Link Print Article ECS LIVA Z Plus (7300U): Introduction & Closer Look ECS LIVA Z Plus (7300U): Specifications ECS LIVA Z Plus (7300U): Testing & Conclusion Related Products ECS LIVA Z Plus Review Recent Articles ECS LIVA Z Plus Review Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion - Producer Interview XFX Radeon RX 580 8GB GTS Black Edition Review MSI GTX 1080 Ti Armor 11G Review XFX RX 460 4GB Slim Single Review PowerColor Radeon Red Devil RX 580 8GB Golden Sample Review AMD Ryzen 5 1600X & 1500X Processor Review NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Founders Edition Review RAIDMAX Monster II Review Intel 7th Generation Core i3 7350K Processor Review » all reviews Forum Posts The Official 'i Just Bought...'

The US-based chipmaker seeks to cash in on a segment that is still seeing high growth, especially the high-end gaming computer market, which has defied the overall continuous drop of the PC market. "After years in development to enhance performance and reduce power consumption, we came up with our new central processing unit (CPU) called Ryzen," said Ryan Sim, channel sales director for Asia and India of AMD Far East. AMD is ready to compete in the market, especially challenging Intel, he said. Despite the flat or negative growth of the local desktop computer market, the gaming desktop market has continued its high growth. Custom-made gaming desktops accounted for half of total desktops sales, said Mr Sim. Mr Sim said computers sales in Thailand will stay at 2 million units in 2017, the same as last year. Jirawat Nuntapramote, channel sales manager of AMD Far East's Thailand branch office, said the company aims to increase its share in the local processor market to 28% this year, up from 20% in 2016. AMD has also widened its server processor products for data centres and cloud computing platform, which are also high-growth areas. "We aim to regain our market share in chips for the server processor field, where the company has enjoyed up to a 20% market share in the past," said Mr Jirawat. Sasiprapa Sutheerapat, business development manager of AMD's Thailand branch office, said at least five major international notebook makers are scheduled to roll out their notebooks equipped with AMD Ryzen notebook processors in the second half of this year. AMD earlier focused on making processors for traditional notebooks priced below 15,000 baht. "The new generation of high performance Ryzen processor enables us to tap into gaming notebooks priced over 22,000 baht," she said. "We aim for our market share for notebook processors in Thailand to reach 15% in 2017, up from 11% last year," said Ms Sasiprapa.

Sunday Chronicle Hyderabad Chronicle Chennai Chronicle Bengaluru Chronicle Kerala Chronicle Science Editors' Picks Entertainment, Bollywood One can do anything, just delve deeper into it: AR Rahman on turning director ANI Published May 6, 2017, 10:55 am IST Updated May 6, 2017, 11:10 am IST The India prelude of 'Le Musk' comes after being showcased at the 'NAB', Las Vegas, as part of the Intel-Keynote on April 24.  AR Rahman. Mumbai: Actors turning singers; directors turning composers; composers turning actors- this has been the latest trend in the film industry. Music maestro A.R. Rahman is the latest addition to the list! Speaking on the same, Rahman, who has recently donned the director's hat for world's first Virtual Reality (VR) Multisensory episodic feature film 'Le Musk,' said, "I just feel that you can do anything. You just have to delve into it; you just have to lean into it. It's not that anything belongs to anyone. Anyone can become anything." "You can see directors becoming composers and composers becoming directors. It's just how sincere I am. I should not cheat. I should be honest to my job. I should excel in it. It goes for everyone," the composer added, while addressing the media here yesterday, at the launch of an exclusive India prelude of his directorial debut. The India prelude of 'Le Musk' comes after being showcased at the 'NAB', Las Vegas, as part of the Intel-Keynote on April 24. The experience of scent, motion, spacial sound and visuals amalgamated together to give the viewer a stereosmokic effect on the Voyager chair, specially designed by Postiron. Gautam Dutta, the CEO of PVR Ltd, which have collaborated with YM Movies to bring 'Le Musk,' while speaking about the VR effect on viewers, said, "I feel VR will bring a new window for the viewers. It's unique and can't be compared to the big screens. In a VR film, you become a part of the scenes. This attracts the consumers." As the title suggests, the film is based on smell and the protagonist is lost in the aroma that has engulfed her. Shot in picturesque Rome, the film follows the journey of an orphaned heiress and part-time musician, Juliet, who grows up to be a diva on a mission. Her life takes a dramatic turn when she receives an anonymous message, which brings back her mysterious past. Written, directed and scored by Rahman, the film stars Nora Arnezeder, Guy Burnet, Munirih Jahanpour and Mariam Zohrabyan in lead roles.

The Redmond giant is preparing for a hardware launch event later this month. Despite not giving out details on what products it will launch, there are already speculations that the Surface Pro 4 successor could be one of them.  According to a recent Business Insider report, Microsoft has already issued invitations for an event it is planning to hold in Shanghai on May 23. The news site then took Microsoft hardware chief Panos Panay’s recent Instagram post as a hint to what the company will be showcasing at the event. Panay posted a picture of Shanghai and used the hashtag #Surface to tease fans on why they should watch out for the launch event. Microsoft has previously confirmed to the Verge that it will be introducing new hardware at the upcoming event. Given Panay’s post, it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that a new Surface device will be the highlight of the public gathering. There are already speculations that Microsoft is revealing the Surface Pro 5 soon, so Business Insider is betting that the big reveal would be that of the highly anticipated tablet hybrid.  READ: Microsoft testing application that will defend Edge browser from malware Although it’s very likely that the Surface Pro 5 would be unveiled at the Shanghai event, there is still a possibility that the mystery hardware could be something else. On Panay’s post, fans are sharing their thoughts on what could Microsoft be launching at this time of the year. Many are guessing that the tech giant could be finally introducing the long-rumored Surface Phone. There are also fans asking for Surface Book 2, a new Surface Pro tablet and even an 8-inch Surface tablet.  Should Microsoft push through with launching the Surface Pro 5,  the tech industry already has an idea on what to expect from the new tablet-laptop hybrid. In early April, award-winning tech journalist Paul Thurrott said that there’s “nothing dramatic” about the upcoming Surface Pro device. This was then taken by the Verge as a clue to the upgraded components of the device instead of a refreshed design. One change that Thurrott confirmed was the switch to Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processors. He also mentioned that the Surface power connector will be retained.  Interestingly, it’s a bit odd that Microsoft would launch another computer-like device so soon. Just early this week, the company introduced to the world the Surface Laptop, the Redmond giant’s rival product for Apple’s MacBook. The device is also seen as a Chromebook killer because of its Windows 10 S OS. However, the expensive price tag of the laptop is obviously no match for the Chromebooks in terms of practicality.  READ: Where to buy Microsoft Surface Arc Mouse Nevertheless, a Surface Pro upgrade is also very much needed at this point considering that the Surface Pro 4 is already showing its age. If Microsoft wants to remain competitive this year, it needs to step up its game because Windows PC manufacturers are also releasing their Surface clones. It’s also about time for Microsoft to update its non-Pro Surface tablet line. Now that it has a new lightweight version of Windows 10, it’s definitely a good idea to introduce a Surface 3 successor.  Microsoft is prepping for a hardware launch event wherein the tech giant is very likely to unveil the Surface Pro 5.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 6 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman ZEISS and ASML Strengthen Partnership for Next Generation of EUV Lithography Due in Early 2020s ASML buys 24.9% of ZEISS subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT for EUR 1 billion in cash Start of development of entirely new High NA optical system for the future generation of EUV ASML supports Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capex for approximately EUR 760 million over the next 6 years VELDHOVEN, the Netherlands/OBERKOCHEN, Germany – 3 November 2016 – Netherlands-based ASML Holding NV, one of the world’s leading chip industry equipment providers, and Germany-based Carl Zeiss SMT, a business group of Carl Zeiss AG (ZEISS), have agreed to strengthen their long-standing and successful partnership in the semiconductor lithography business. The main objective of this agreement is to facilitate the development of the future generation of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems due in the first few years of the next decade. This technology will enable the semiconductor industry to produce much higher performance microchips at lower costs. ZEISS and ASML jointly announce today, that they have agreed on a 24.9% minority stake of ASML in ZEISS’s subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT, for which ASML will pay ZEISS EUR 1 billion in cash. The companies stated that no further exchange of shares is planned or agreed. ASML is a key supplier of semiconductor patterning products and services used by the world`s top producers of microchips. With its high-performance optics Carl Zeiss SMT supplies an essential subsystem of ASML´s semiconductor lithography scanners and is ASML`s most important strategic partner. ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT have been in close partnership for more than 30 years. Both firms have grown strongly over the last decades benefiting from each other`s strengths. A new cycle of investments required for the development of an entirely new optical system for the future generation of EUV, expected to be provided to the chip making industry in the first few years of the next decade, has triggered the partners to take a further step in the collaboration. “In 2018 the first chips made on current technology EUV scanners are expected to roll off the production lines of our customers. A lot of work is still being done to ensure the introduction of EUV in volume manufacturing, in tight conjunction with our highly successful immersion scanners which we continue to improve. Yet ASML and ZEISS are looking beyond this important milestone. We see a long and successful future for EUV lithography in advanced chip manufacturing and with this agreement we set the right conditions for development of the next generation of EUV by ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT, so that our customers can reap the rewards of their EUV investments up to the end of the next decade,” said Peter Wennink, President and Chief Executive Officer of ASML. “With this agreement we clear the road for advanced lithography to support the new concepts and designs for future generations of advanced chips. After the many years of fruitful partnership, we see this agreement as a further strong endorsement of our long term cooperation which allows us to further expand our joint leadership that we have already accomplished together”, says Michael Kaschke, President and CEO of ZEISS. The next generation of EUV optics will offer a higher numerical aperture (NA), making it possible to further reduce critical dimensions in the lithography process. The current EUV systems have an optical system with NA of 0.33 whereas the new optics will have NA larger than 0.5, enabling several generations of geometric chip scaling. In addition to the agreement of the minority interest, the two companies have also agreed that ASML will support Carl Zeiss SMT`s research and development (R&D) for approximately EUR 220 million as well as capital expenditures and other supply chain investments for approximately EUR 540 million over the next 6 years. These investments will predominantly be allocated at Carl Zeiss SMT’s main location in Oberkochen, Germany, and will primarily be used for capacity and resource expansions, with positive effects on long-term employment at this location. Carl Zeiss SMT will remain fully integrated into the structure of the ZEISS Group as one of the major and important business groups. “High-NA is the logical next step for EUV, as it circumvents complex and expensive 0.33 NA EUV multiple patterning. High-NA EUV is a robust way for chips to scale all the way down to the sub-3 nanometer logic node in a single exposure with high productivity and reduced cost per feature. That is several generations from where we are today and underlines our commitment to propel Moore’s law,” said Martin van den Brink, President and Chief Technology Officer at ASML. Carl Zeiss SMT will pay an annual dividend to its shareholders Carl Zeiss AG and ASML. ASML expects that the minority share transaction will be accretive to its earnings before adjustments related to purchase price accounting and differences in accounting standards. Furthermore, ASML`s contribution to Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capital expenditures will be taken into account in the future pricing of SMT`s next generation EUV optics to ASML. The transaction has been approved by both companies’ supervisory boards. ASML will fund the transaction from available cash, potentially supplemented by new debt. The transaction is subject to regulatory clearance and is expected to be closed in the second quarter of 2017. Update ASML Share Buyback Program In light of the investments by ASML announced today, ASML will prolong the pause of its share buy back program for the time being. As a result, the 2016-2017 program may not be completed for the full amount. Otherwise, the current program will remain in place, yet it may be further suspended, modified or discontinued at any time. As part of ASML’s financial policy to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and regularly timed share buyback programs, ASML in January 2016 announced its intention to purchase up to EUR 1.5 billion of shares to be executed within the 2016-2017 time frame. About Moore`s law The phenomenal growth of the semiconductor industry has been driven by Moore’s Law, named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore. In 1965, Moore observed that the number of components on a chip that could be manufactured at optimum cost had doubled every year. He predicted that this trend would continue. It was an empirical observation, not a law of nature. In the five decades that followed, the “law” has been rewritten several times, but the principle continues: chip makers cram more transistors on ICs with every new generation, making computing power and storage capacity cheaper year after year. Today’s consumers carry more computing power in their pockets than a multi-million-dollar supercomputer could deliver in the 1970s. Moore’s Law has inspired generations of engineers to push technology forward. About ASML ASML is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of chip-making equipment. Our vision is to enable affordable microelectronics that improve the quality of life. To achieve this, our mission is to invent, develop, manufacture and service advanced technology for high-tech lithography, metrology and software solutions for the semiconductor industry.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page has dismissed a request from the Senate Intelligence Committee seeking information on his Russian contacts, leading the panel's co-chairs to hint Friday that they may subpoena the data. In a scathing three-page response to the committee's request, dated April 28 and reported by CNN on Friday, Page suggested that senators would have easier access to any information because of alleged surveillance by the Obama White House. "I suspect the physical reaction of the Clinton/Obama regime perpetrators will be more along the lines of severe vomiting when all the facts are eventually exposed regarding the steps taken by the U.S. government to influence the 2016 election," Page wrote. "But please note that any records I may have saved as a private citizen with limited technology capabilities will be miniscule in comparison to the full database of information which has already been collected under the direction of the Obama administration during last year's completely unjustified FISA warrant that targeted me for exercising my First Amendment rights, both in 2016 as well as in years prior," he said. However, Intelligence Committee co-chairs Sens. Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Mark Warner, D-Va., hinted that Page's letter might lead them to subpoena the information. "Three days ago, Carter Page told Fox News that he was cooperating with the Committee’s investigation into Russian activities surrounding the 2016 election," the senators said in a statement. "Today, we have learned that may not be the case." They noted that their letter, also dated April 28, asked Page to "provide requested materials to the committee by certain dates. "Should Mr. Page choose to not provide the material requested by those dates, the committee will consider its next steps at that time." FBI Director James Comey told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday that an investigation into whether Trump associates colluded with the Russian government during the election was continuing. He declined to say whether President Donald Trump or anyone else was being investigated. Page has also denied that he had discussed the U.S. lifting economic sanctions against Russia during a speaking trip to Moscow last year. The Intelligence Committee, which is conducting its own probe into Russian meddling during the election, sent similar letters requesting information to other former Trump advisers, The New York Times reports. They are campaign manager Paul Manafort and adviser Roger Stone, as well as former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Intel committee officials declined to confirm or deny the Times report, but Manafort's spokesman would not comment on the matter to NBC News. Representatives for Stone and Flynn did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In their statement Friday, Burr and Warner said that "Mr. Page has indicated in correspondence to the committee that he looks forward to working with us on this matter, and that our cooperation will help resolve what he claims are false allegations. "For that to happen, Mr. Page must supply the requested documents to the committee. "As our letter indicated, the requested documents must be provided in advance of any interviews the committee may conduct. "The committee will continue to pursue its inquiry into issues surrounding Russia’s involvement in the 2016 Presidential election," the senators said. "It is our expectation that Mr. Page will live up to his publicly-expressed cooperation with our effort."

The Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design has a long history of connecting art students with industry. MIAD's signature program is the industrial design major, whose students have gone on to work for everyplace from GE Healthcare to Johnson Controls and companies around the world. Christine Carr is about to graduate with a degree in industrial design, and her senior thesis features two projects that have one key inspiration in common: Carr’s six-year-old daughter, Lilly who has autism and is nonverbal. Christine Carr with her daughter, Lilly. Credit Courtesy of Christine Carr "There are certain things that she is very uncomfortable about, for one reason or another. Of course, I don't know because she can't tell me," Carr explains. "So that really drove my curiosity to not only understand what she's going through, but I feel like us as a society need to understand what [people with autism are] going through a little more." The first is a 3-D movie, which allows people who don’t have autism to understand what it’s like to be bombarded with stimuli. It utilizes 360 video, and it's Carr's first time creating a film using this type of camera. She hopes to fine-tune the film, but "I do see it as being something that could go into schools and be an educational tool," she adds.  The second project is a unique way to track an autistic child who might wander off, called Nonni. "[It's] a drone device that would work as a home security system, basically," Carr explains. "We'd have to build it into your house and customize it to what the child needs, the house needs." Nonni uses current technology, specifically the ZR300 Intel Real Sense camera, which Carr says is the "best facial recognition available right now." The camera allows a caregiver to visually assess basic, vital health and monitor a child to see if they've moved beyond the perimeter of the house.  Credit Courtesy of MIAD "It just sends an alert to the caregiver and if emergency is needed, it'll send a message to police or to ambulance, whatever the need is, but it's immediately,"she says. "It's not when the caregiver notices or all of a sudden realizes that they're missing. It's going to send an alert right away because the ZR300 camera actually now is devised for a smartphone, it's so small it can fit inside of a smartphone."  Carr was inspired to create the project after reading a study by Autism Speaks, which found that 49% of autistic children wander away from home at least once, after the age of four. "That statistic just scared, scared me so much," she admits.  "We don't have any technology right now to help families that are going through this, or have this worry in their mind," she explains.  Christine working with her professor, John Caruso. Credit Courtesy of MIAD The conceptual technology involves a bladeless drone, which would house the Nonni camera and would perch on the house until a child or autistic person wanders into a restricted area. Nonni would utilize facial recognition to keep sight of the person in need, something Carr specifically designed for autistic children like her daughter, Lily.  "One thing I do notice about my daughter and a lot of autistic children, people: they don't like to wear new things," says Carr. "They have their socks that they like to wear, they don't want to wear a bracelet, they don't want to wear a GPS tracker... And so I really feel like facial recognition is the way we have to go, especially with having such great technology right now. It's something that is definitely feasible."  Tags:  Lake Effect health technology TweetShareGoogle+Email Related Content UW-Milwaukee Clinic Helps Patients With Autism Overcome Physical Challenges By Audrey Nowakowski • Apr 25, 2017 Photographee.eu / Fotolia Despite the increased attention autism has received, gaps in therapy remain.

Functionally, a source is similar to a central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. The differentiating points of a SoC from a CPU are that all the features of the source are embedded on a single chip and is also much smaller in size. Additionally a SoC also may contain a graphic processing unit (GPU), memory and power management circuits among others. The smaller form factor combined with computing power of SoCs has led to its integration into various devices such as mobile phones, smart washing machines, tablets, smart air-conditioners, smart television and set-top boxes among others. Upgraded SoCs are being designed to smaller size, but has doubled the computing speed than its predecessors. Also, the newer SoCs are more energy efficient and generates much less heat when compared to their predecessors. The global source market is primarily driven by an increase in the demand for smarter and power efficient electronic devices across all sectors. Recent years have seen a huge increase in demand for connecting devices such as smart phones and tablets among others. Also, the advent of smart gadgets, such as smart television and smart air conditioners among others, has also been highly influential in the growth of the demand for SoCs. The global increase in internet users has been significantly boosting the demand for ‘connected’ devices which are again mostly powered by SoCs having internet centric applications. Thus, it also boosted the global market for SoCs. The dimensional scaling of integrated circuits (IC), leading to declining cost per function and increased manifestation of Moore’s law have also been playing a significant role in positively driving this market. Development of newer generations of SoCs having multi-core technologies and embedded graphics systems has been another factor which also played a huge role in the growth of this market. With the rising demand of compact and scalable ICs in global electronic industry, the SoC market can be expected to be impacted positively.

After working for seven years at Tier 1 automotive suppliers that were members of the GENIVI project, Walt Miner, the Community Manager for the Linux Foundation’s Automotive Grade Linux (AGL) project understands the challenges of herding the car industry toward a common, open source computing standard. At the recent Embedded Linux Conference, Miner provided an AGL update, and summarized AGL’s Yocto Project based Unified Code Base (UCB) for automotive infotainment, including the recent UCB 3.0 “Charming Chinook” release. Walt Miner shows AGL’s UCB release schedule at ELC 2017 (click image to enlarge) Recent membership wins for the project include Suzuki and Daimler AG (Mercedes-Benz). And, at the end of April, AGL announced six more new members, bringing the total to 96: ARCCORE, BayLibre, IoT.bzh, Nexius, SELTECH, and Voicebox. In addition to Suzuki and Daimler AG, other automotive manufacturer members include Ford, Honda, Jaguar Land Rover, Mazda, Mitsubishi Motors, Nissan, Subaru, and Toyota. Joining AGL doesn’t necessarily mean these companies will release cars with UCB-compliant in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) systems. However, Miner says at least one UCB-enabled model is expected to hit the streets in 2018. “Our goal is to build a single platform for the entire automotive industry that benefit Tier 1s, OEMs, and service providers so everyone has a strong base to start writing applications,” said Miner. “We want to reduce fragmentation both in open source and proprietary automotive solutions.” Miner said that AGL has several advantages over the GENIVI Alliance spec, parts of which have been rolled into UCB along with a much larger chunk of Tizen’s automotive code. Miner previously worked for two Tier 1s, but despite being GENIVI members, “they never collaborated” with other Tier 1s, he said. “By contrast, at AGL, we have Tier 1s collaborating in real time on the same software. We have had hackathons and integration sessions where we had 35 to 40 people from 20 to 25 companies working on the same code. In 2016, we had a totally 1,795 commits just on the master branch from 45 committers and 24 companies.” AGL is a “code first” organization, said Miner. Instead of writing specs and hoping vendors stick to them, AGL has developed an actual Linux distribution that can bring Tier 1s and auto manufacturers “70 to 80 percent toward developing a product that ends up in a vehicle,” he added. By comparison, “GENIVI provided function catalogs that were supposed to be common across the industry, but the catalogs were incomplete, so all the manufacturers went off and specified their own proprietary extensions,” said Miner. “We found we were constantly reimplementing these ‘standard’ function catalogs, and we could not reuse them going from manufacturer to manufacturer.” Miner went on to describe the development cadence for the AGL project, which follows its Yocto Project base by about nine months. He also discussed new features in UCB 3.0 Charming Chinook, including application packaging and widget installation, as well as a switch to systemd for application control. There’s a new template for an application framework service binder APIs, as well as an SDK for app developers. Reference apps are available for home screen, media player, settings, AM/FM, and HVAC. Official reference platforms now include the Renesas R-Car 2 Porter board, Minnowboard Turbot, Intel Joule, TI Jacinto 6 Vayu board, and QEMU. There are also emerging community BSP “best effort” projects from third parties, including the Raspberry Pi 2/3, NXP i.MX6 SABRE board, and a DragonBoard. Two UCB 3.0 interface screens from AGL’s CES 2017 demo Miner played a video of AGL director Dan Cauchy demonstrating UCB 3.0 at January’s CES show. The demo revealed new functionality such as displaying navigation turn-by-turn instructions on the instrument cluster for reduced distraction, as well as multimedia playing over the MOST ring using “the first open source MOST device driver in history,” according to Cauchy. Finally, Miner described some of the activities in AGL’s six expert groups: application framework and security, connectivity, UI and graphics, CI and automated test (CIAT), navigation, and virtualization. He also surveyed some new features coming out in the Yocto 2.2 Daring Dab release in July. These include secure signaling and notifications, smart device link, and application framework improvements such as service binders for navigation, speech, browser, and CAN. In December, AGL hopes to release Electric Eel, a release that will add back ends for AGL reference apps working in both Qt 5 and HTML5. Other planned improvements include APIs available as application framework service binders, IC and telematics profiles, more complete documentation, and an expanded binder API capability for RTOS interoperability. Future UCB versions will move beyond the IVI screen and instrument cluster. “AGL is the only organization planning to address all the software in the vehicle, including HUD, telematics/connected car, ADAS, functional safety, and autonomous driving,” said Miner. As AGL moves into telematics, there are complications due to the need to interface with legacy, often proprietary technologies. “The vehicle signal architecture we’re working on will abstract the CAN or MOST layers in a secure manner so applications don’t need to know anything about the native CAN,” said Miner. “Microchip has been working on native CAN drivers for AGL, but the messaging and vehicle topology is proprietary, so we’ve asked OEMs to provide typical and worst-case network topologies in terms of things like message rates. We can then build a simulator based on that topology.” More on these future directions should be on tap at the Automotive Linux Summit held May 31 to June 2 in Tokyo.

Recent Posts: 3 Tech Stocks With Earnings That Changed Everything Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Stock Is Too Dicey Ahead of Earnings Missed Amazon.com? Try Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) Stock View All Posts When the market closes on Tuesday, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) will report its first-quarter results and many investors will likely be nervous. For the year so far, NVDA stock has not had much traction. Consider that the return is -2%. Source: Shutterstock This is certainly in stark contrast to last year’s performance, where NVDA stock racked up an impressive 224% gain. So in light of this, it should be no surprise that things have cooled down. There has also been growing skepticism from Wall Street analysts. The consensus price target is roughly $110, which implies a mere 4% potential return. So why the bearishness? Well, for the most part, the main concern is that the growth engine will not be able to maintain its hyper-speed. Let’s face it, the chip industry is prone to periodic swings in demand, say from lower economic growth, rising competitive forces and disruptive changes in technologies. Something else: cutting-edge technologies can take time to get traction. Hey, just take a look at virtual reality. A couple years ago, the market was forecasted to generate substantial revenues. But so far, the results have been lackluster. The technology from operators like Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) have been bulky and unwieldy. There have also been no must-have applications. Graphics Business to Hurt Nvidia Stock OK, so what are the parts of the NVDA business that are in jeopardy? One is the market for self-driving cars. Granted, there are few signs that the demand is lagging. But then again, this has attracted some of the world’s largest chipmakers. Back in early March, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) agreed to pay $15 billion for Mobileye NV (NYSE:MBLY). And of course, Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) has also jumped into the fray with a $39 billion bid for NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI). Although, perhaps the biggest risk factor for Nvidia stock is its core gaming business, which accounts for 62% of revenues. Keep in mind that there are already signs that the momentum is decelerating. According to a report from DigiTimes, the two largest PC motherboard firms are reporting lower volumes for shipments of GPUs. In fact, NVDA has been substantially reducing the pricing on its chipsets.

All this and more on Green Car Reports. Our writer David Noland has covered his ownership of a Tesla Model S (and many other topics too) in great detail, and his articles are among our most popular. Now, he's concluded it's time to replace his trusty 2013 Model S with a newer, more powerful, longer-range version with all-wheel drive. Meanwhile, the first TV ad for the 2017 Karma Revero—a very different plug-in luxury sedan—has appeared, just prior to the car going on sale. The chances of the smaller, more fuel-efficient Acura CDX mini-crossover utility vehicle landing on U.S. shores seem pretty high. We got a short first drive in the 2017 Volkswagen e-Golf, though we couldn't test out the electric car's much higher 125-mile range rating. And because it's Friday, it's time to bust another alt-fuel myth: no, John D. Rockefeller didn't promote Prohibition so he could ban ethanol. BMW and Intel have joined together in a pilot program to develop autonomous vehicle technology that both will use. Finally, Colorado has banned the practice of "rolling coal," joining New Jersey in penalizing a particularly odious ritual among deranged diesel owners who relish polluting. _______________________________________ Follow GreenCarReports on Facebook and Twitter Prev Post Next Post Tags: Today in Car News Posted in: Green News Recommended Galleries Volkswagen T-Roc video teases new small SUV five months early (updated) All-electric Fisker EMotion luxury sedan to debut in August Future Volvo electric car to be built in China 2017 Volkswagen e-Golf: first drive of updated 125-mile electric car   Contribute Send us a tip Comment Contact the editor Follow Us Get daily e-mail updates GO I agree to receive emails from the site.

Twitter Facebook PC makers will ship Windows 10 mixed reality headsets in Q4 Microsoft says Windows Mixed Reality headsets will start at $299, and PCs at $499 Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 06 May, 2017 02:28 - - - - print email Comments Microsoft's hardware partners will flood the market with Windows Mixed Reality headsets by the holiday season this year, offering up a new way to enjoy Windows 10. A Windows Mixed Reality headset from Acer is already being seeded to select developers by Microsoft, but isn't available to consumers yet. So far three PC makers -- Lenovo and HP as well as Acer -- said they would ship headsets later this year. Dell is still mulling a release date. The headsets will start at $299, the rough minimum price suggested by Microsoft. The headsets need to be wired to Windows 10 PCs. Once on, they will transport you to a virtual world where you can, for example, roam, Skype-chat and play Xbox games. It's like computing in a 3D world, without the use of a mouse or keyboard. Acer will ship its Windows Mixed Reality headset to consumers for $299 in the fourth quarter, said Gregg Prendergrast, president of Acer Pan America. The Acer Mixed Reality headset has a liquid crystal display with a 1440 x 1440 pixel resolution per eye. The display's refresh rate is 90Hz. It also has audio out and microphone support and inside-out tracking. HDMI 2.0 and USB 3.0 connectors are bundled in one cable, needed to hook the headset up to PCs. On its part, HP will also ship its version of the headset in the fourth quarter, said Ron Coughlin, president for personal systems at the company. He could not provide price guidance, but the company is making a major VR push later this year. It's already working to connect Oculus Rift and HTC Vive headsets to its PCs. Lenovo has already shown off its Windows Mixed Reality headset, coming later this year, a company spokeswoman said. That points to late third or fourth quarter. Meanwhile, a Dell spokesman said the company doesn't want to share its schedule publicly. "We can confirm we’re developing a headset, like many other OEMs, based on the Microsoft spec. Right now we’re busy hammering away at the overall experience to ensure the device aligns to Dell expectations," the spokesman wrote in an e-mail. 3Glasses and Asus are also developing Windows Mixed Reality headsets, though shipment dates for their products weren't immediately available. 3Glasses is a lead partner for Microsoft, and its headset could be shown off at a Microsoft hardware event to be held later this month in Beijing. The Windows headsets won't work with just any PC. At a minimum, the PC will need Intel's Core i5 Kaby Lake chip, and it will later support Intel's integrated graphics. Good PC performance is important for a smooth experience, said Greg Sullivan, a Microsoft spokesman. A discrete GPU will provide a better experience. That's a minimum requirement for the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive headsets, which don't work on integrated graphics. The headsets will support PCs based on the x86 instruction set, Sullivan said. He couldn't provide specifics on support for AMD's Ryzen chips. Microsoft has previously said that headsets will support AMD's next-generation chips, which are Ryzen. Microsoft's specifications for the headsets do not include Windows 10 2-in-1s and laptops based on ARM-based Snapdragon chips from Qualcomm, which are expected later this year. However, Qualcomm has said that all Windows 10 applications will work with ARM PCs, so in theory, headsets could work when plugged into the ARM PCs. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Zacks Equity Research Zacks May 5, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share NVIDIA Corporation NVDA is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 9. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 19.3%. Additionally, NVIDIA surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 27.4%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Factors to Consider Widely known for its video gaming chips, NVIDIA has pioneered the art and science of visual computing. With singular focus on this field, the company offers specialized platforms for the gaming, automotive, data center and professional visualization markets. Its products, services and software deliver amazing experiences in virtual reality, artificial intelligence and autonomous cars. We believe that NVIDIA’s innovative product pipeline and strength in gaming and high-end notebook GPUs keep it well positioned. We also feel that the higher adoption of NVIDIA’s Tegra processors could act as a catalyst, going forward. On the flip side, the secular decline in the PC market has affected many chip makers. NVIDIA’s dependence on the PC market continues, and therefore is being hurt by adverse conditions. The preliminary data released by Gartner showed that PC shipments in the quarter were down 2.4% year over year to 62.2 million units. The decline marked the 10th straight quarter of year-over-year fall, which is the longest duration of decline in the history of the PC industry. Also, Gartner’s forward-looking statements make us a shade cautious about the prospects of the PC industry. The research firm agreed that the recent surge in DRAM prices and short supply of SSD will lead to an increase in PC prices. Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner said, "The price hike will suppress PC demand even further in the consumer market, discouraging buyers away from PC purchases unless it is absolutely necessary. The price hike started affecting the market in 1Q17. This issue will grow into a bigger problem in 2Q17, and we expect it to continue throughout 2017." IDC also predicted that consumer demand will remain under pressure. This makes us slightly cautious about NVIDIA’s near-term performance. Additionally, competition from the likes of Intel INTC and QUALCOMM Inc. remains a near-term headwind. NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | NVIDIA Corporation Quote Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that NVIDIA is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below. Negative Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate (63 cents) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (66 cents), stands at -4.55%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions. Stocks to Consider Read More Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: Tyson Foods, Inc. TSN, with an Earnings ESP of +3.77% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. DHT Holdings, Inc. DHT, with an Earnings ESP of +0.22% and a Zacks Rank #3 More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like Run                                                              Did you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007? Now 2017 looks to be a pivotal year to get in on another emerging technology expected to rock the market. Demand could soar from almost nothing to $42 billion by 2025. Reports suggest it could save 10 million lives per decade which could in turn save $200 billion in U.S. healthcare costs.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said in a court filing this week that it would defer enforcement of all future compliance deadlines under the new rules for e-cigarette products for three months, as it asked a federal district court judge in Alabama to delay the case that Cyclops Vapor 2 LLC brought against the agency challenging the rules. Judge Charles Coody granted the e-liquids distributor and FDA's joint request to delay the lawsuit by three months to give the new administration time to look at the Obama-era rule.  ADVERTISEMENT Cyclops is challenging the rule the FDA finalized last May, which requires companies to go through a costly approval process for products that hit store shelves after Feb. 15, 2007, get FDA approval before making advertising or labeling claims, register manufacturing facilities with the agency and open facilities for biannual inspections. The rule also gave the FDA the authority to require warning labels on products, restrict sales, mandate new product safety standards and create requirements for product testing. Manufactures were given 12 months after the rules took effect in August to request an exemption from product approval requirements, 18 months to submit an application proving the product has a substantial equivalent already on the market and 24 months to submit an application for pre-market approval. Cyclops claims the rules will keep the company from being able to introduce new e-liquids and force it to discontinue existing product. Sen.

In the 1950s and 1960s, computers were housed in centralized rooms. Desktops distributed computing power across organizations in the 1980s. Then, ten years ago, the cloud began to gain momentum and you saw companies shut down their own data centers and migrate applications to data centers that rivaled the Pentagon in size. But guess what: the next counter reaction is already underway. Companies are discovering that trying to migrate all of your applications to the cloud generates bandwidth congestion, latency and cost. The recent attacks on some large data centers have also pointed up the risks of centralization. Edge data centers—i.e. modular pods containing half rack to four racks of computing equipment along with the necessary power and cooling systems–won’t replace clouds. Instead, they will supplement them, particularly when it comes to the Internet of Things. An edge data center could be installed at an offshore wind farm to conduct predictive analytics or manage equipment. Intel, among others, estimates that 40 percent of IoT data will never make it to a centralized data center: it will be consumed, analyzed and stored where it was generated with only necessary snapshots of performance or critical data streams being sent to headquarters.

Energy companies are recovering along with oil prices. IBM is slumping after billionaire investor Warren Buffett said he sold a large part of his stake in the company. KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 6 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,395 as of 2:50 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 29 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,980. The Nasdaq composite rose 13 points, or 0.2 percent, to 6,088. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks added 4 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,393. Stocks have moved gradually higher Friday afternoon. Major indexes have been very quiet over the last two weeks. FILE - This Oct. 4, 2014, file photo, shows the facade of the New York Stock Exchange. Stocks are modestly higher in early trading on Wall Street, Friday, May 5, 2017, after the government reported a pickup in hiring in April. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) JOBS: Employers in the United States added 211,000 jobs in April, according to the Labor Department. That comes after slow hiring and economic growth over the first three months of the year. Investors may have been relieved but didn't appear surprised by the development. The VIX, an index that is interpreted as a measure of how nervous investors are, remained near the 10-year lows it hit earlier this week. THE QUOTE: Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo's Investment Institute, said the April report was the latest in a long run of solid but mostly unexciting jobs reports. While many investors want to see stronger wage growth along with continued hiring, Wren said rising wages may cause trouble for the stock market if economic growth remains slow: the combination could squeeze company profits. "The market is likely to be concerned about wage gains and the impact on corporate margins as we move into 2018," he said. CRUDE CONCERNS: Energy companies bounced back as the price of oil steadied. After steep losses the last two days, benchmark U.S. crude oil jumped 70 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $46.22 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, added 72 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $49.10 barrel in London. Oil prices have fallen hard as investors wonder if OPEC will extend a deal that trimmed oil production. Occidental Petroleum rose $2.37, or 4.1 percent, to $60.39 and Baker Hughes gained $1.75, or 3 percent, to $59.16. IBM GETS BUFFET-TED: IBM fell after Warren Buffett said he's sold about 25 million shares of the technology and consulting company, about a third of the stake that his Berkshire Hathaway company had owned. Buffett started buying IBM stock in 2011. IBM faces stiff competition from companies including Microsoft and Amazon, which have focused on cloud computing services. IBM reached an all-time high of $215 in early 2013. It fell $4.22, or 2.7 percent, to $154.83 Friday. About a year ago the stock was worth less than $120 a share. MATERIAL MOVEMENT: Basic materials makers advanced. Dow Chemical gained $1.52, or 2.5 percent, to $62.94 and Praxair rose $2.63, or 2.1 percent, to $125.85. Fertilizer maker CF Industries climbed $1.59, or 5.9 percent, to $28.66. BLEMISHED: Cosmetics maker Revlon plunged after its sales in North America fell during the first quarter. That affected all parts of its business, as its consumer and professional divisions both reported smaller profits and lower sales than they did a year ago. Revlon bought Elizabeth Arden in September and its sales were about the same as they had been a year ago. The stock gave up $5.70, or 22.6 percent, to $19.55. HEALTH CARE SLUMP: Biotech drug companies slipped. Incyte sank $2.68, or 2.1 percent, to $122.32 and Biogen dropped $7.41, or 2.8 percent, to $261.19. Amgen fell $1.41 to $162.88. BONDS: Bond prices held steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained 2.35 percent. High-dividend stocks did fairly well Friday as telecommunications companies recovered from a hard loss the day before, and utility companies also rose. Banks traded lower. METALS: Gold dipped $1.70 to $1,226.90 an ounce. The precious metal fell more than 3 percent this week for its biggest decline since right after the presidential election. Silver lost 3 cents to $16.27 an ounce. Copper rose 2 cents to $2.53 a pound. OTHER ENERGY TRADING: Wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $1.50 a gallon. Heating oil added 2 cents to $1.44 a gallon. Natural gas jumped 8 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $3.27 per 1,000 cubic feet. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 112.64 yen from 112.42 yen. The euro climbed $1.0997 from $1.0981. OVERSEAS: France's CAC 40 jumped another 1.1 percent as investors hoped centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron will be elected president over the weekend. The CAC 40 is at its highest level since early 2008. Britain's FTSE 100 was up 0.7 percent and Germany's DAX added 0.5 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 0.8 percent. Markets in Japan and South Korea were closed for holidays. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at https://apnews.com/search/marley%20jay Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

NVIDIA has crushed Qualcomm over the past few years, but will that trend reverse in the near future? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) May 5, 2017 at 10:00AM NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) have been on very different paths over the past five years. During that period, shares of NVIDIA rallied more than 700%, but shares of Qualcomm fell 15%. NVIDIA's growth was attributed to robust sales of its gaming GPUs, the introduction of new high-end GPUs for data centers, and the popularity of its ARM-based Tegra chips in connected cars. Qualcomm's decline was caused by new competitors entering the mobile application processor market, smartphone makers pumping out their own chips, and defiant companies and governments protesting its 3G/4G licensing fees. Image source: Getty Images. But past performance never guarantees future returns. Let's take a fresh look at both chipmakers to see which stock is a better buy at current prices. How fast are NVIDIA and Qualcomm growing? NVIDIA's sales rose 38% to $6.91 billion in fiscal 2017, and Wall Street expects another 16% growth this year. Most of NVIDIA's revenue still comes from its flagship GeForce gaming GPUs. Demand from high-end gamers has stayed resilient despite sluggish PC sales worldwide, and recovering PC sales and next-gen games are now fueling a fresh cycle of upgrades. Sales of NVIDIA's GPUs rose 66% annually and accounted for almost 62% of its top line last quarter. Data center revenues soared more than 200% and accounted for 14% of NVIDIA's revenues, thanks to the growing use of its high-end GPUs for machine learning purposes. Automotive revenues climbed 38% and accounted for 6% of its revenues. The Professional Visualization unit, which accounted for 10% of its sales, grew 18%. NVIDIA's Roborace car. Image source: NVIDIA. Qualcomm's revenue dropped 7% to $23.6 billion in fiscal 2016, and analysts anticipate a 3% decline this year. That's because competition from cheaper chipmakers like MediaTek and first-party chips from OEMs like Huawei are throttling the growth of its chipmaking business, which generates most of its revenues. The licensing business, which generates less revenue but accounts for most of Qualcomm's profits, has also struggled with numerous fines, lawsuits, and probes by companies and regulators demanding lower fees. An ongoing legal clash with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) over licensing fees also recently forced Qualcomm to reduce its third quarter sales forecast by $500 million. On the bright side, Qualcomm's chipmaking revenues rose 10% annually to $3.7 billion last quarter on healthy demand for its high-end Snapdragon chips and new chip designs for Internet of Things devices, drones, and connected cars. Licensing revenue improved 5% after Qualcomm renegotiated licensing terms with individual OEMs across China. Lastly, Qualcomm's planned buyout of NXP Semiconductors will boost its projected revenues by nearly 40% and make it the largest automotive chipmaker in the world. Profit growth, buybacks, and dividends NVIDIA's earnings rose 138% in 2017, but analysts expect that growth to slow to 11% this year. That slowdown is attributed to the expiration of a graphics licensing deal with Intel, which was providing it with $66 million in "free" revenues per quarter; increased price competition in GPUs from AMD's new Radeon cards; and tougher competition in the automotive market from expanding players like Qualcomm. Image source: Qualcomm. Qualcomm's earnings dipped 5% in 2016, and analysts anticipate another 1% drop this year. That's mainly due to the ongoing challenges at its high-margin licensing business -- which was fined in China and South Korea, probed in the U.S. over antitrust allegations, and sued by Apple over lopsided licensing deals. If Qualcomm is forced to reduce its licensing fees (up to 5% of the wholesale price of a device), its bottom line growth could take a big hit. Both chipmakers use buybacks to boost their earnings and offset stock-based compensation. NVIDIA spent $739 million -- nearly half its free cash flow -- over the past 12 months on buybacks. Qualcomm spent $1.6 billion, or 29% of its FCF, on buybacks during that period. As for dividends, NVIDIA pays a paltry forward yield of 0.5%, but its payout ratio of 19% indicates that it has plenty of room to hike that payout. Qualcomm pays a much higher forward yield of 4.3%, which is supported by a payout ratio of 71%. The valuations and verdict NVIDIA trades at 40 times earnings, which is much higher than its industry average of 28. Its P/S ratio of 10 is also much higher than the industry average of 4. The bulls might argue that premium is justified by its growth, while the bears will claim that those valuations are too high for a company with slowing growth. Qualcomm trades at 18 times earnings, which is much lower than its industry average of 27. Its P/S ratio of 3 is also lower than the industry average of 4. Those lower valuations reflect the stock's depressed state after being hammered by the aforementioned competition, probes, fines, and lawsuits. I personally like NVIDIA more as a company than Qualcomm, but its valuations are simply too high. I'm concerned about Qualcomm's long-term future, but its expansion into adjacent markets, higher dividend, and lower valuations all make it a smarter buy at current prices.

(OTC: MGTI) announced today that it has entered into a joint venture partnership with Nordic IT Sourcing Association Venture Partners to develop and market the world’s most secure mobile phone. The partnership agreement specifies an initial 50-50 equity split, prior to expected third party investment (however, there can be no assurance of such investment). The joint venture is called JMPP Oy and will be domiciled in Helsinki, Finland. MGT is responsible for designing, engineering and testing a state of the art cell phone with privacy features that stay one step ahead of hackers and eavesdroppers. Nordic IT is responsible for sourcing strategic partners to manufacture and assemble the phone, as well as responsibility for sales and marketing. Alexander Reay, President of Nordic IT, will be Chief Executive Officer of the venture, with John McAfee appointed Board Chairman. JMPP expects to release a prototype by the end of 2017, with commercial availability at the Mobile World Congress conference in Barcelona in February 2018. The phone will feature hardware „kill switching” for various functions to empower the user to protect his privacy. For example, a bank of switches will allow physical disconnection of the battery, WiFi, Bluetooth, geolocation, and the camera and microphone. Other enhancements to traditional cell phone offerings will include anonymous web browsing and more secure email and text functionality. John McAfee stated, „The phone will not be hack proof but it does give the user enormous power over his or her privacy and it will be light years ahead of the many other phones on the market claiming to be secure. Over time, future versions will be as hack proof as humanly possible.” JMPP Oy began offering pre-order vouchers on the MGT website several days ago to allow prospective purchasers to reserve earliest delivery positions for the privacy phone when released. The first 100 purchasers are also entitled to a device hand-signed by John McAfee. While the company will honor and fulfill all vouchers purchased to date, it has decided to discontinue presales due to overwhelming demand. Mr. McAfee added, „While I am flattered at the outpouring of support, the truth of the matter is we are a small company and cannot devote our limited human resources to this marketing task. Those who pre-ordered the phone expected information and support that is frankly beyond our current capabilities. This phone will be the product of thoughtful and leading edge engineering, not hype. As design and production advance, we can reconsider a pre-sale reservation method.”  About MGT Capital Investments, Inc.  MGT Capital Investments, Inc.

QUIZ Are You Saving Enough for Your Retirement? SLIDE SHOW 13 Ways to Simplify Your Finances SLIDE SHOW Best Stocks Under $20 to Buy Now Advertisement Slide Show 1 of 5 4 Good Tech Stocks Under $20     iStock Technology stocks can be notoriously expensive. A single share of Amazon.com (AMZN) is approaching $1,000. Ditto for Google's stock (GOOGL). Apple's (AAPL) share price would be above $1,000 had the company not split its stock 7-for-1 in 2014. So how do you add technology stocks to your portfolio if you only have a small amount to invest? One cost-effective way is to focus on promising tech stocks priced under $20 a share. We found four names worthy of your consideration. SEE ALSO: 25 Great Dividend Stocks Raising Dividends for 25 Years But before you place a buy order, don't neglect to weigh the impact of trading commissions. Let's say you want to invest $100 in each of the four stocks we recommend. Even at just $4.95 per online trade, the going rate at brokerages such as Fidelity and Schwab, your investment is already down 5%. For small trades, consider opening a free Robinhood account instead. You can use the brokerage's smartphone app to make no-commission stock trades. Data is as of May 2, 2017, unless otherwise indicated. Click on ticker-symbol links for current share prices and more. By Dan Burrows, Contributing Writer | May 2017 (Stocks are listed in alphabetical order. Analyst ratings are per Zacks and Thomson Reuters.) 1 2 3 4 5 Slide Show 2 of 5 4 Good Tech Stocks Under $20 Advanced Micro Devices Symbol: AMD Share price: $10.32 52-week range: $3.45 - $15.55 Shares in semiconductor manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices tumbled on May 2, a day after earnings for the first quarter failed to exceed analysts' expectations. That disappointed momentum traders who had bid up AMD nearly fourfold over the past year. But for long-term investors willing to take a risk, this setback affords a chance to bet on AMD's prospects at a considerably lower price level. "Overall, though the stock will likely be weak in overreaction to the results, we believe a host of positive catalysts are still to come during the remainder of 2017 and our buy thesis remains very much intact,” said analysts at Canaccord Genuity. AMD is concentrating on the market for graphics processing units (GPUs) -- the brains that allow computers to render images -- because of the growth prospects. GPUs are in heavy demand by rapidly expanding industries such as data centers, gaming and virtual reality. At the same time, AMD continues to compete with Intel (INTC) in the traditional business of making central processing units for computers The company is a leader in the gaming market, being the sole supplier of certain custom chips for both Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4. As such, AMD is set to benefit from Microsoft's launch of its new Scorpio gaming console later this year. Don't be surprised is a successful debut of the console system gives AMD stock a boost. Analysts at Stifel, who rate shares at hold, say the company is on track for market-share gains and forecast a return to profitability on an adjusted basis this year. (AMD lost 4 cents a share on an adjusted basis in the first quarter.) More broadly, analysts who track AMD are split between high optimism and caution. Of the 18 analysts surveyed by Zacks, nine call it a strong buy, eight say it's a hold and one has it at strong sell.  SEE ALSO: 12 Dividend Aristocrats for Every Month of the Year 1 2 3 4 5 Slide Show 3 of 5 4 Good Tech Stocks Under $20 CalAmp Symbol: CAMP Share price: $18.08 52-week range: $12.13 - $18.49 CalAmp is a small technology company with big aspirations. It specializes in wireless communications products that allows machines to talk to each other, as well as collect, monitor and report data to their human operators. It acquired vehicle tracking company LoJack in 2016. Since the Internet of Things -- the movement to connect everyday devices from appliances to automobiles -- is growing at a brisk pace, CalAmp looks to be in the right place at the right time. Equity research firm William Blair expects to see more cost savings from the LoJack deal. And further investments in the business should shift LoJack's "trajectory back to growth." Turning LoJack around won't be easy, analysts say, but William Blair applauds CalAmp's progress thus far, and believes the company can wring profits out of the technology. Shares are up 25% year-to-date and could have more upside ahead, analysts say. Of the eight analysts surveyed by Zacks who cover the stock, four say it's a strong buy and four say it's a hold. Their average price target of $20 suggests the stock can rise 11% in a year's time.

The world's second-largest maker or PCs enjoyed year-over-year shipment growth of nearly 7% in the final quarter of 2016, IDC says. It was the third consecutive quarter of increased shipments, which topped 15 million units for the first time since the end of 2014. IDC further notes that HP added to its share of the U.S. market. It now accounts for 31% of domestic PC sales. HP is in about as mature an industry as you can get, but that doesn't mean value can't be found in its stock. Indeed, the market appears to have figured this out. Shares in HP are up 27% year-to-date versus a 7% gain for the S&P 500. And yet they remain reasonably priced. The stock trades at 12 times future earnings, according to a survey by Zacks. That's cheaper than the S&P 500, which goes for 17.6 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, according to FactSet. HP stock has appreciated so much this year that some analysts are becoming more cautious. According to Zacks, five say it's a strong buy and one rates it at buy, but five call it a hold. Shares are currently trading near the top of the 52-week price range, but keep in mind that at a yield of 2.7% HP does offer a decent dividend based on the last four quarters of payments.

Like AMD, Vishay manufactures semiconductors and is at the mercy of the cyclical market for computer chips. Fortunately, the market appears to be in an upswing, Stifel notes. In light of solid demand, especially in Asia, Vishay's profit margins should rise off depressed levels as the market for semiconductors improves. And market researcher International Data Corporation notes that global shipments of personal computers are stabilizing after five years of declines. Despite rising on strong quarterly earnings, it's not a sure thing that this brighter outlook is fully reflected in the share price yet. Vishay’s stock trades at 15 times expected earnings for next year, according to Thomson Reuters, or less than half the forward price-earnings ratio of AMD. That's an attractive valuation for a company forecast to increase its per-share earnings by 22% this year. It's also attractive given that analysts think earnings can deliver annualized gains of 17% over the next half-decade.

Samsung revealed that it had shipped over 70 thousand wafers processed using its first-generation 10 nm FinFET fabrication process (10LPE) and also announced major additions to its upcoming manufacturing technology roadmap. In particular, the company plans to introduce three processes it has not talked about thus far. TSMC said that it is about to start mass production of ICs (integrated circuits) using its first-gen 10 nm technology and also announced several new processes that will be launched in the coming years, including its first 7 nm EUV process due in 2019. 10 nm: Samsung Is Shipping Samsung said it had started to make SoCs using its 10LPE fabrication technology last October, which is something we already knew. This manufacturing process allowed the company to make its chips 30% smaller compared to ICs made using its 14LPP process as well as reducing power consumption by 40% (at the same frequency and complexity) or increase their frequency by 27% (at the same power and complexity). So far, Samsung has processed over 70 thousand wafers using its 10LPE technology, which can give an idea about Samsung’s 10 nm production capacities (considering that the whole 10 nm production cycle is greater than the 90 days we saw with previous-gen FinFET processes). At the same time, keep in mind that Samsung does not have many 10 nm designs to manufacture right now: we know only of the company’s own Exynos 9 Octa 8895 as well as Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 seen in the Samsung Galaxy S8. Advertised PPA Improvements of New Process Technologies Data announced by companies during conference calls, press briefings and in press releases   GF Samsung 7nm DUV vs 14LPP 14LPP vs 28LPP 10LPE vs 14LPP 10LPP vs 10LPE 10LPU vs 10LPE Power >60% 60% 40% ~15% ? Performance >30% 40% 27% ~10% ? Area Reduction >50% 50% 30% none ? In addition to its production milestone, Samsung also confirmed plans to start mass production of chips using its second-generation 10 nm manufacturing process called 10LPP (10 nm low-power plus) by the end of 2017 as well as its third-generation 10 nm technology called 10LPU by the end of 2018. Samsung said last year that the 10LPP is going to enable a ~10% performance increase (at the same power and at the same complexity) versus the 10LPE, but we know absolutely nothing about the 10LPU. It is logical to assume that the 10LPU will bring certain PPA-related (performance, power, area) improvements, but it is not clear how Samsung plans to achieve them and which one of the three will be the focus for improvements. As it appears, just like Intel, Samsung has ended up with three generations of 14 nm fabrication processes and is going to end up with three generations of 10 nm manufacturing technologies. It is noteworthy that Samsung itself does not use its 14LPC (low-power compact) for its leading edge SoCs, which may suggest that the 10LPU is also not aimed at this segment of the market. In fact, it is highly likely that the 10LPU will target ultra-small and ultra-low-power ICs for various emerging devices, but Samsung yet has to confirm that. 10nm: TSMC Is Steady As for TSMC, its 10 nm process technology (CLN10FF) is now qualified for production at the company’s GigaFabs 12 and 15, where high-volume ramp is expected to start in H2 2017. Production capacity of these two fabs is hundreds of thousands wafer starts per quarter and TSMC plans to ship 400 thousand wafers processed using its 10 nm manufacturing tech this year. Considering the long production cycles for FinFET-based technologies, it is about time for TSMC to start ramping up 10 nm so to be able to supply enough chips to its main customer in time. Apple is expected to launch its new iPhone products in September or October and needs to get SoCs couple of months before the launch. Advertised PPA Improvements of New Process Technologies Data announced by companies during conference calls, press briefings and in press releases   TSMC 16FF+ vs 28HPM 16FF+ vs 20SOC 10FF vs 16FF+ 7FF vs 16FF+ 7FF vs 10FF Power 70% 60% 40% 60% <40% Performance 65% 40% 20% 30% ? Area Reduction ~50% none >50% 70% >37% PPA advantages of TSMC’s CLN10FF over its CLN16FF+ (second-gen 16 nm) have been discussed already and they are significant for developers of mobile SoCs (but not that significant for makers of other ICs): a ~50% higher transistor density, a 20% performance improvement at the same power and complexity or a 40% lower power consumption at the same frequency and complexity. Unlike Samsung, TSMC does not seem to plan multiple generations of 10 nm and will go straight to 7 nm next year. 7nm is currently very popular among chip designers, indicating a future major milestone. However, in addition to the CLN7FF, the company will also offer several other manufacturing technologies for ultra-small and ultra-low-power applications.

Reply MananDedhia - Friday, May 05, 2017 - link Processes that deposit single atomic layers are already used commonly in processes - even in 28nm.....For some layers, atomic layer deposition is the only way to go. The complexity increased here because we are now increasing the number of layers and devices that need to be defined at those scales. Reply bug77 - Friday, May 05, 2017 - link Yes, but you can't take 3 atoms, call then source, drain and gate and assemble them into a transistor. Reply ddriver - Friday, May 05, 2017 - link Why not? IBM have already demoed atomic assembly. The downside - it is very slow, it is one atom at a time VS etching septillions of atoms with acid at the same time. BTW I finally get how they will get to 5 nm - by lying about it. How much of a 10nm chip's features are at 10nm resolution? Not many. Area decrease is already falling behind the process scale number and it is only going to get worse. On the upside - no biggie - we already have enough performance to run terminators. So our extinction is well assured. Reply philehidiot - Friday, May 05, 2017 - link Don't you go worrying about terminators. I've already started work on the first of many. I was just so sick of not being able to get a seat on the bus. Was thinking no one wants to sit next to a cybernetic killing machine so I can send that to the earliest bus stop, get it to reserve a seat and I can ride to work without the smell of unwashed, practically rotting human being next to me. Far safer than one of those self driving car things. Bloody death traps. Reply mdriftmeyer - Friday, May 05, 2017 - link Being 63.63 times smaller in diameter for an atom compared to the fab process is quite a large span in scale. Reply boeush - Saturday, May 06, 2017 - link One thing to consider, though, is that when atoms are bound into molecules via covalent bonds, the distances between their nuclei shrink below the sum of the adjacent atoms' stand-alone radii: in other words, chemically bound atoms pack together much more tightly than one might naively expect by conceptualizing each atom as a solid sphere... Reply Jon Tseng - Friday, May 05, 2017 - link PSA: NODES WITH THE SAME (NUMERICAL) NAME FROM DIFFERENT VENDORS ARE NOT EQUIVALENT. Just wanted to get that out of the way early! :-p Reply Meteor2 - Friday, May 05, 2017 - link Indeed. The x nm labels are meaningless now; they may as well call them Bob and Joan. The only way to compare them is via the inter-node PPA change metrics. Anyone have numbers for 22->14 and 14->10 from Intel to hand? Even then I know Intel's 14 nm is better on at least power and performance than others' 14/16 nm, as the latter are actually 20 nm with FinFET added, but I'm not aware of any meaningful way of comparing them. Reply lefty2 - Friday, May 05, 2017 - link That's not totally true. The first iteration of Intel's 14nm performed worse than TSMC's 16nm. 14nm+ is much better though Reply 1 2 3 4 5 ▶ PIPELINE STORIES + Submit News ECS Quietly Adds PB01CF Ultra Compact PC to Lineup: a 5 Oz Apollo Lake Desktop AT20 Giveaway Day 8: OnePlus Adds In Some 3T Phones Toshiba Announces Portégé X30: 13.3” FHD, Core i7, 16 GB DDR4, Thunderbolt 3 NVIDIA Releases 382.05 WHQL Game Ready Driver AMD Releases Radeon Software ReLive Crimson Edition 17.5.1: Prey Release Driver Deepcool Launches Captain EX RGB CPU Coolers with LED Lighting AT20 Giveaway Day 7.5: ASUS Motherboards, Video Cards, & Networking Gear ASUS Maximus IX Extreme Z270 Motherboard Now Available: $629 with Water Block Palit GeForce GTX 1080 Ti HOF Limited Edition Announced: 1.75 GHz and Onboard LCD AT20 Giveaway Day 7: Crucial Helps You Remember DDR4 RAM & SSDs Intel Unveils the Xeon Scalable Processor Family: Skylake-SP in Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum AT20 Giveaway Day 6.5: Thermaltake View 31 Case & Smart Pro Power Supply TWEETS RyanSmithAT: @maryjofoley @markhachman In our experience you need about a month's notice to get the required visas sorted out.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Notebooks “Microsoft Will Show the World What’s Next” on May 23 – Surface Pro 5 Expected By Rafia Shaikh 18 hours ago 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Microsoft appears to be on a roll having released its “potential” Chromebook-killer Windows 10 S and Surface Laptop earlier in the week. The Redmond software maker is now preparing for yet another event. After New York City, it’s time for Shanghai to get some love from Microsoft. #MicrosoftEvent to take place in Shanghai – time for Surface Pro 5? Following its education-themed event on May 2nd and Build Developer Conference scheduled for next week, Microsoft is planning a third event this month which will take place in China on May 23. The company has already set up an event page, with the hashtag #MicrosoftEvent. The landing page only talks about Microsoft showing the world what’s next: Related Microsoft Introduces New Surface Arc Mouse with Surface Laptop, Priced at $79.9 On May 23 in Shanghai, Microsoft will show the world what’s next. Check this site for updates and more information. It is expected that the company will unveil the new Surface hardware, with Microsoft’s corporate vice president of Devices, Panos Panay, tweeting with the hashtag #Surface when announcing the event. In an interview with Bloomberg, Microsoft’s vice president Yusuf Mehdi also said yesterday to “expect to see an update to Surface Pro 4 coming soon.” See you in Shanghai. May 23. #MicrosoftEvent #Surface https://t.co/aMgvkkqE52 pic.twitter.com/vzcK9MqIpf Advertisement — Panos Panay (@panos_panay) May 5, 2017 A Surface Pro 5 is highly likely to be the star of the event, but all is speculation at this point even with at least two hints from Microsoft directly. Paul Thurrot had recently tweeted that the new Surface Pro 5 will not change the Surface Connect power connector, will feature Intel’s Kaby Lake processor, and there will be “nothing dramatic.” Related Microsoft’s Surface Laptop Going Up for Preorders Today Starting at $999, Ships June 15 Why the company has selected Shanghai despite having the preference for New York in the past is unclear. Almost all the previous Surface devices were launched in the NYC. However, this change in venue might be to please the authorities in China who have time and again put restrictions on foreign tech companies. Microsoft will also announce some global and regional news at the event. Microsoft is on a high right now after a successful Surface Laptop launch earlier this week. The Windows 10 S powered and upgradable to Windows 10 Pro laptop might not be cutting edge or innovative, the $999 laptop certainly packs strong hardware specs, looks polished and is nothing short of luxurious with that Alcantara wrap. What’s next coming from Microsoft? It may not be Windows 10 Mobile but we are certainly excited.

Max Langridge5 May 2017Laptops Microsoft Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Microsoft recently held an event in New York City where it revealed products aimed at the education sector. They included Windows 10 S, a new operating system that only has access to apps from the Windows Store, which has been done to make sure everything runs quickly and smoothly, and the Surface Laptop, a rather eye-catching laptop that will go head-to-head with the Apple MacBook Air when it launches on 15 June.  You can watch Microsoft's 2 May education event here, Surface Laptop and Windows 10 S revealed But education isn't all Microsoft is focusing on this year it seems, as the company has released a teaser to say there will be another event on 23 May in Shanghai to show off what's next for Microsoft. But what exactly is next? Microsoft isn't giving anything away, but we take a few educated guesses as to what the computing giant has up its sleeve. Microsoft unveils the Surface Laptop, a Windows 10 S device looking to take down the MacBook Surface Pro 5 Microsoft's VP of Devices, Panos Panay tweeted the teaser from his account and included the hashtag #Surface. Panay credits himself as being the creator of the Surface series of devices, so it would be fair to assume there will be another new Surface device on the way.  Considering we've just been given the Surface Laptop, it's unlikely to be another computer, but could instead be the Surface Pro 5 2-in-1. A search around the web for leaks and rumours surrounding the new device all tend to suggest that any updates will be minor. The Surface Pro 4 already has a very competitive spec list, and any major changes, such as upgrading to a 4K display will make it too expensive and sacrifice battery life. The most likely upgrade will be to Intel's Kaby Lake processors for greater efficiency and the Surface Pro 5 should also have a USB Type-C input for charging and connecting accessories.  There will more than likely be several different variations of the Surface Pro 5 available when it does launch, with different processor speeds and storage. As for price, we can't be sure, but the starting price will be somewhere between £700 and £1000. Surface Phone Talks of a Surface Phone have been on and off in recent months and years. At one point there were strong rumours to suggest Microsoft would channel its Surface laptop 2-in-1 technology into a powerful phone. But since then the company has sold off its phone patents, implying it won't be working on a phone itself. But we've then seen images of a possible Surface Phone, although some media outlets thought it was a Windows Phone made by Dell. We haven't heard much more on the subject since those images surfaced.  However, Alcatel manufactures Microsoft branded phones, and Alcatel is headquartered in Shanghai, the same city where Microsoft's event is taking place. It could therefore be possible that we'll either see a new Microsoft phone unveiled, or at the very least get an update on the current state of play.  Of course, until Microsoft officially reveal whatever it's planning on 23 May, we can only speculate. We'll be sure to bring you the very latest news and product announcements as and when we hear them.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) — On Thursday, the US House of Representatives passed a bill boosting sanctions against North Korea, outlining "inspection authorities" over Chinese, Iranian, Syrian and Russian ports. The ports of Nakhodka, Vanino and Vladivostok are mentioned among those in Russia. "We strictly comply with all the decisions of the UN Security Council relating to the DPRK, there is no talk of any arms supplies, there is an appropriate decree of the Russian president. So all suspicions in the reverse are baseless," Ozerov said, commenting on the bill. He called the bill "delusional fantasies" and "absurdity" that the realization of which was hard to imagine. © Sputnik/ Vitaliy Ankov US Bill Establishing Control of Russia's Ports Amounts to Declaration of War - Russian SenatorThe situation on the Korean peninsula aggravated in recent months as North Korea carried out a number of missile launches and nuclear tests , which are considered to be in violation of the UN Security Council resolutions. The most recent missile test allegedly took place on April 29 from a site north of Pyongyang. Japan, South Korea and the United States said the test appeared to have failed as the missile broke-up within North Korean territory. On May 3, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the United States is preparing to impose additional sanctions on North Korea if Pyongyang continues to pursue ballistic and nuclear weapons. As a response to the potential use of nuclear weapons, the United States sent a strike group led by US aircraft carrier Carl Vinson to the Korean Peninsula in early April, where it began exercises with the South Korean navy. © AP Photo/ Wong Maye-E US, S Korean Intel Try to Assassinate Kim Jong-un With Biochemical Weapon - PyongyangUS media reported on mid-April that US President Donald Trump might order a strike against North Korea in light of its military activities. The North Korean top officials said the country was ready for nuclear attacks in case of possible US military aggression. The crisis is aggravated by the deployment of the US THAAD air defense system in South Korea. The THAAD agreement was reached by Seoul and Washington in July 2016. The move came amid growing tensions spurred by North Korea's recurring ballistic and nuclear missile tests. The THAAD system has a range of some 200 kilometers (125 miles) and is designed to intercept short, medium and intermediate ballistic missiles at the terminal incoming stage. The move to deploy it in South Korea has been criticized by neighboring China and Russia as inappropriate, possibly disproportionate, and affecting other countries' interests. ...

Microsoft 'will show the world what's next' on May 23 Microsoft is betting its next piece of Surface hardware will have the tech industry following its lead. By Liam Tung | May 5, 2017 -- 10:07 GMT (03:07 PDT) | Topic: Hardware Apart from a promise to "show the world what's next", this image of Shanghai and the May 23 event date are all Microsoft has explicitly revealed so far, but it's been dropping some heavy hints. Image: Microsoft Microsoft has teased a new event on May 23 in Shanghai where it promises to "show the world what's next". Microsoft's newly launched event page doesn't reveal anything more than the date, location and its bet that the tech industry will be following its lead. However, it seems likely that Microsoft will unveil new Surface hardware, possibly a new Surface, presumed to be called the Surface Pro 5. Windows Central confirmed that Microsoft's corporate vice president of Devices, Panos Panay, who heads up Redmond's expanding Surface lineup, will unveil new hardware at the event. Exactly what hardware remains a mystery, but Panay tweeted the hashtag #Surface announcing the event. Microsoft will also announce global and regional news at the event. In an interview with Bloomberg today, Microsoft vice president Yusuf Mehdi said, "You might expect to see an update to Surface Pro 4 coming soon." Windows watcher Paul Thurrott recently revealed the Surface Pro 5 will have Intel's Kaby Lake processor, but noted that was "nothing dramatic". There will also be no change to the Surface Connector power connector. The choice of Shanghai is curious given Microsoft's historical preference for New York where it launched the Surface Pro 4 in October 2015, Surface Laptop and Surface Studio all-in-one. Despite Microsoft's larger than expected 26 percent decline in Surface revenue revealed last week, Microsoft is on somewhat of a roll with its Surface hardware, which comes amid perceived missteps by Apple, such as the MacBook Pro, and a perception it's abandoned creatives by not updating the Mac Pro. Meanwhile, the new Windows 10 S-powered Surface Laptop, though lacking major innovation, looks every bit as polished as a notebook that Apple might make, and its high-end Surface Studio is sufficiently differentiated from Apple's iMac via a touchscreen, stylus input, and the new Surface Dial. Both showcase unique Windows 10 capabilities and push Microsoft's ambition to expand offerings by Windows hardware makers. As Mehdi pointed out, Microsoft's aim with Surface is to "grow the overall Windows ecosystem with HP, Dell, Lenovo", and in that sense the decline in revenues is a sign that it's achieving that goal in the form of increased price competition from Windows OEMs. Read more on Microsoft Surface The new Surface Laptop is no Chromebook Microsoft Surface Laptop: Price, specs, availability Windows 10 S: Chromebook killer or the second coming of Windows RT?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 May 2017 by Abhishek Budholiya Cloud-RAN (Radio Access Network) Market Expected to Expand at a Steady CAGR through 2020 By FMI Study Cloud-RAN,orCentralized-RAN (C-RAN) is an advanced cellular network architecture for mobile network infrastructure that can support 2G, 3G and 4G system and meet wireless communication benchmarks. Cloud-RAN is outpacing traditional cellular network system as it doesn’t require RF (radio frequency) equipment, antenna, BTS (baseband unit) and digital processor to be deployed in the cell site. Traditional cellular network architecture demands more power, space, additional big cell towers and directional antennae to support new air interface technologies such as LTE (Long-Term Evolution) and multi-frequency bands. Moreover, enhancement of traditional cellular network in a wireless network to support data traffic demand becomes economically unsustainable. In contrast, Cloud-RAN enhances mobile communications and helps cellular network operators in delivering qualitative and effective mobile communication services at a reasonable cost. Cloud-RAN ensures centralization of baseband processing in one location. To connect to RRH (remote radio heads), fibre optical cables are required.Cloud-RAN is based on new technologies,viz. cloud computing thatcan take advantage of advanced remote antennae or radio head techniques and SDN (software-defined network) approaches. Request Report Sample@ http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-52 Cloud-RAN offers various benefits like reduction in cost of network operations. The three types of cost reductions are energy consumption, site rental expenses and operational & maintenance cost of network. These savings can be balanced against cost incurred on fibre optical cables required to meet fronthaul capacity and latency requirements. Cloud-RAN also enhances capacity due to coordinated multipoint and ensures speedy performance. Aforementioned benefits of Cloud-RAN architecture automatically increase the value of service to end-users. However, initial high investment required to deploy Cloud-RAN architecture acts as one of the major challengesfor the growth of Cloud-RAN market. The Cloud-RAN market can be categorizedinto component, services and geography.The market is segmented on the basis of thenatureof its components, which includes six major categories -BBU (Baseband Units), RRU (Remote Radio Units), optical transport network, servers, processors and measurement device. On the basis of services segment, the Cloud-RAN market can be categorized into network services, custom services and system integration services. The market can also be segmented on the basis of major geographies, into North America, Latin America, Western Europe, Asia-Pacific, Japan, Eastern Europe and Middle East & Africa. Cloud-RAN is a global multi-billion dollar market which is expected to exhibit a considerable growth in CAGR, from 2014 to 2020. The key drivers include need to reduce increasing data traffic and Capex&Opexexpenditure, which are the biggest revenue generators for the Cloud-RANmarket. The key restraint to this market is high initial cost of deployment and dependency on availability of fibre. Major players in Cloud-RAN market focuses on partnerships, joint ventures, and acquisition &merger strategies in order to outperform their competitors. For instance, in 2013 Intel Corp. acquired Mindspeed Technologies and extended its offerings with new mobile system services i.e. Cloud-RAN. Request For TOC@ http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/toc/rep-gb-52 Some of the key players identified in the Cloud-RAN market are Ceragon Networks Ltd.,Actix Ltd., Aricent Technologies, JDSU, 6WIND, MTI Radiocomp, Altera Corp., Mindspeed Technologies, Inc., Intel Corporation, VitesseSemiconductor, Telco Systems, VPI Systems, Telco Systems and TEOCO among others.
