What a week! The annual Mobile World Congress (MWC) took place in Barcelona from Monday to Thursday, and there was no shortage of big announcements at that event – but there was plenty of exciting news and developments across the rest of the tech world too. If (somehow!) you’re not familiar with MWC, this quick video intro from the beginning of the week should give you some idea of what it’s all about: If you struggled to keep up with everything that’s been happening this week, don’t worry – 7 Days is here again to walk you through the week’s top tech news. There’s a lot to get through this week, so let’s waste no more time! The new BlackBerry KEYone was among the many new devices unveiled at (or immediately before) MWC. The $549 upper-mid-range Android 7.0 handset was designed and built by TCL, which referred to it as a 'flagship', although it doesn't have the specs to match rival flagship-class handsets from other manufacturers. There's plenty to like about the new device, though - and you can get a first look at it in my hands-on video from the launch event (I hope you like videos, because there's lot more of them coming up!). Reports have since emerged of up to three more BlackBerry-branded devices on the way this year, including photos of one with a very different design to the KEYone. In off-camera conversations at the KEYone launch event, several BlackBerry staff hinted to me that a 'true' flagship is in development, possibly with a Snapdragon 835 processor. The stunning new LG G6 also made its debut at MWC, featuring an unusually wide 5.7-inch Quad HD+ display with an 18:9 aspect ratio. Along with a stylish metallic body, it also features a Snapdragon 821 processor, 4GB RAM and up to 64GB storage, along with IP68 dust- and water-resistance and a fingerprint sensor. I'm already a fan of this device, especially its dual 13MP rear cameras which are capable of snapping some great shots. Check out my hands-on video with the LG G6 here. Huawei introduced its new P10 and P10 Plus flagships just before MWC at a rather poorly organized event which left hundreds of journalists standing outside the venue for hours, long after the event had already begun. During the announcement itself, Huawei spent around half an hour talking about the many colors of the new handsets, so perhaps those of us left outside were the lucky ones. Nonetheless, the new P10 family are beautiful handsets with plenty of high-end specs, and a new version of Huawei's dual-camera technology co-engineered with imaging specialists Leica. You can find my hands-on video for the P10 here. Alongside the P10, Huawei also announced the Watch 2 and Watch 2 Classic, its new Android Wear 2.0 smartwatches, which include IP68 protection, a dazzling array of color options and all sorts of premium specs and features. The Watch 2 also includes integrated 4G LTE connectivity. Nokia was one of the biggest stars of MWC this year - quite a turnaround from what appeared to be the end of its mobile ambitions following the sale of its devices business to Microsoft in 2014. Among its many announcements in Barcelona, Nokia revealed that it's killing off the Withings brand for its wearable devices, in favor of its own brand. The Nokia 6 Android smartphone - designed and developed by HMD Global, built by Foxconn, and sold under the Nokia brand - launched in China in December. At MWC, HMD announced that it will soon be launching the 6 internationally, priced around €229 EUR. HMD also unveiled the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5, its new entry-level and mid-range handsets, respectively. You can view the full specs for both devices here, and as I discussed in my hands-on video with the two new Android smartphones, they appear hugely impressive - especially considering their relatively low prices. But the biggest attraction at Nokia's MWC stand was a blast from the past. HMD announced a new version of its much-loved classic phone, the Nokia 3310, updated with a range of more modern features. Every time I visited or walked past the Nokia stand, it was packed with people of all ages - including those too young to remember the original - wanting to get their hands on the new 3310. As you'll see in my hands-on video with the device, it's far from perfect - but there's a lot to like about it. It even includes a new version of the old-school Snake game, which is also coming to Facebook. Archos showed off its new low-cost Android 7.0 tablet. Despite being aimed at budget-conscious buyers, the 101 Saphir offers some rather nice features, including dust- and water-resistance, and a rugged design offering some protection against drops. Samsung had already confirmed that its new Galaxy S8 flagship wouldn't appear at MWC, but the company did announce the launch date for the new handset. And the leaks about the Galaxy S8 just keep coming - new images have emerged twice in the last few days. Samsung revealed its new rugged Galaxy XCover 4 smartphone with a 5-inch 720p display, IP68 rating, and MIL-STD-810G impact protection. It will ship in Europe with Android 7.0 onboard from April, priced around €259. Samsung also introduced a new version of its Gear VR headset, co-developed with Oculus, featuring a new controller with improved navigation. Samsung's new Galaxy Tab S3 made its first official appearance at MWC too. The high-end Android tablet has a Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB RAM and 32GB storage, along with a keyboard cover and S Pen stylus support. And Samsung showed off its new Windows 10 2-in-1, the Galaxy Book, which comes in two configurations: a Windows 10 Home model with 10.6-inch LCD and 7th-gen Intel Core m3 processor; and a Windows 10 Pro version with a 12-inch Super AMOLED display and 7th-gen Core i5. Both models support 4G LTE and come with a keyboard and S Pen stylus. You can get more info on both variants in my hands-on video here. Porsche Design revealed its new premium Windows 10 laptop. Unlike Samsung's Galaxy Book - which is a tablet with detachable keyboard cover - Porsche Design's new Book One is an actual notebook (albeit with a detachable display!). It's conceptually similar to Microsoft's Surface Book, and features Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors, 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD. Panasonic showed off its latest Toughbook, an ultra-rugged Windows 10 detachable that's waterproof and has a briefcase-style carrying handle. It's packed full of the latest high-end specs - but it will come at quite a high price. Alcatel introduced its Plus12 Windows 10 2-in-1 aimed primarily at business buyers on a budget. It features some pretty modest specs, but - as you'll see in my hands-on video - it also has one of the worst keyboards I've encountered for some time. Alcatel's Idol 4S with Windows 10 has been available in the US for months, but the company finally announced its European launch this week, priced at €599. For some reason, the device has been rebranded as the 'Idol 4 Pro' for Europe, but the Windows 10 Mobile flagship's features are identical to those of its US counterpart. Image via PC World Our friends over at PC World spotted a refreshed version of HP's Elite x3 Windows 10 Mobile flagship that had accidentally appeared on its stand at MWC. However, when I went down there to check it out, the company had removed it from view, and its staff rather joylessly refused to say anything about it, brusquely parroting the phrase "we haven't announced anything". Still, HP did announce new accessories for the Elite x3, as well as revealing the Pro x2 612 G2, a premium 12-inch 2-in-1 targeting enterprise customers. The Elite x3 also received a firmware update this week, bringing performance improvements and camera optimizations. Lenovo unveiled a range of new Android devices aimed at families, including some features designed with kids in mind... ...as well as a selection of new Windows 10 devices covering a wide range of price points. The Miix 320 - which is priced as low as $199.99 USD - was my personal favorite, offering some very nice features, along with rock-solid build quality. But the new additions to the Lenovo range include a 14-inch Yoga 520 notebook, and two flagship-class Yoga 720 convertibles with stylus support, stylish design, and beautiful displays. You can get an overview of all four of those new Lenovo Windows 10 devices in my hands-on video. Lenovo's rather lovely new G5 and G5 Plus mid-range smartphones were revealed at MWC too. They offer a decent set of specs combined with some thoughtful design features, along with stylish looks. The G5 was one of my personal favorites at MWC - you can see my impressions of both handsets in my hands-on video. Sony revealed four new Xperia devices in Barcelona, including two high-end handsets, the Xperia XZ Premium and Xperia XZs. The Premium features Sony's Motion Eye camera technology which offers slow motion video capture at up to 960fps. But perhaps the most exciting device on Sony's stand was the Xperia Touch, a €1,500 EUR device running Android 7.0 that projects its user interface onto a flat surface, turning it into a 23-inch touch display. The projector is portable too, but it currently offers just one hour of battery life. Find out more about that device in my hands-on video here. Jolla announced that it has added support for its Sailfish OS on some of Sony's Xperia devices. The company also revealed plans to build a local mobile OS aimed specifically at China. Chinese manufacturer ZTE revealed its new Blade V8 Lite and Mini handsets, offering lesser specs in a more affordable package than the Blade V8 Pro that it announced at CES in January. Xiaomi showed off its new Mi 5c featuring the company's own Surge S1 processor, along with 3GB RAM, 64GB storage and a 5.5-inch display. Xiaomi also introduced its new Redmi 4X, a low-cost smartphone with Qualcomm's latest mid-range Snapdragon 435 chipset, and a very spacious 4100mAh battery, priced from as little as $102. Meanwhile, General Mobile debuted the GM6, the latest handset to launch under Google's Android One initiative. While the new devices were the major focus of attention at MWC, they weren't the only big announcements at the show. Meizu, for example, revealed its new Super mCharge battery technology with a live demo in which it charged a flagship phone with a 3000mAh battery from 0% to 100% in just 18 minutes. And in a year when 'the next big thing' was the subject of endless discussion at MWC, the International Telecommunication Union released a draft report detailing the specifications of the next-generation 5G mobile standard, promising 20Gbps download speeds and latency as low as 1ms. Image via Shutterstock The GSM Association, which hosts the Mobile World Congress expo each year, published its annual Mobile Economy report, in which it estimated that there will be five billion mobile users by mid-2017. Moving on from MWC, fresh details emerged this week of Apple's plans for its 'Anniversary iPhone', which is due to arrive later this year. The Wall Street Journal reported that the new handset will include a curved AMOLED screen along with USB Type-C support, while a separate report suggested that Apple is investing heavily in augmented reality technology for the device. Nvidia announced details of its new GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU, with a whopping 11GB of GDDR5X memory. Pre-orders opened on Thursday, and deliveries will begin on March 10. The Raspberry Pi Foundation marked the fifth anniversary of its original maker board by announcing a new variant of the ultra-low-cost Raspberry Pi Zero, which now features 802.11n Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 for just $10. Elsewhere, an intrepid developer built a Raspberry Pi wearable device running Windows 98 (!!). Developer Michael Darby said: "I thought, wouldn’t it be ridiculous and awesome to have Windows 98 on my wrist?" Yes, Michael - "ridiculous and awesome" is the exact phrase I would have chosen. Love it! <3 "Hello, computer" There was much rejoicing among Star Trek fans in January when Amazon added 'Computer' as a wake-word for its Alexa digital assistant. Now, the company is apparently preparing to add new capabilities to Alexa, including voice calling functionality. Google has started to bring its digital Assistant to millions more Android devices, after initially limiting it to its Pixel phones, Android Wear devices, and its Home speaker hub. And the long wait for Google Home to launch in the UK will soon be over. The company announced that it will launch there in June, although pricing hasn't yet been revealed. There's been some confusion surrounding the future of Google's Pixel laptops running Chrome OS. At a roundtable with reporters at MWC, Google gave the clear impression that it would not launch any more of its own-branded Chromebooks - but a few days later, it stated that its Pixel laptops aren't dead after all. However, Google did confirm that it will definitely be launching new Pixel smartphones later this year. Google's Nougat update continued to slowly make its way to more devices around the world in recent days: Droid Turbo 2 on Verizon gets Android 7.0 update Android 7.0 begins rolling out to the Moto G4 and G4 Plus in the US You can now sign up for the Honor 6X beta program to get Android 7.0 Android 7.1.2 Nougat beta finally heads to the Nexus 6P OnePlus 3 and 3T get Android 7.1.1 beta in China (HydrogenOS) and other markets (OxygenOS) Microsoft updated its Arrow Launcher for Android to version 3.0, calling it the "biggest release yet", bringing new features and major performance enhancements. A couple of days later, it rolled out beta version 3.1, bringing support for Android tablets. We got a small taste of what might have been for Microsoft's Windows 10 Mobile flagships, as a series of screenshots revealed support for unique gestures originally intended for inclusion on the Lumia 950 and 950 XL - some of which may have been developed as part of the stillborn Lumia McLaren project. Skype for Linux emerged from the alpha phase of its development with the release of a new beta that included all sorts of improvements and new features. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced that it is discontinuing its Skype WiFi service at the end of this month - and it's not yet clear what the future holds for the separate Microsoft WiFi offering. Microsoft Edge's share of the desktop browser market remains more or less stagnant, while Chrome has extended its lead from 57.94% to 58.53%, according to the latest data from NetMarketShare. NetMarketShare data also showed zero growth (in fact, a very slight decline) for Windows 10, while Windows 7's share of the desktop market grew from 47.20% last month to 48.41% this month. A similar picture was painted by the latest usage stats from gaming platform Steam, where Windows 10 usage declined by almost 1% in the last month, while Windows 7 increased. A new version of Windows 10's iconic 'hero' desktop wallpaper was spotted in the latest build of Windows 10 Cloud - and there's some speculation that the updated version may be unique to the Cloud SKU of the OS. A Windows 10 Cloud build that leaked earlier this week included the ability for users to download and install Win32 apps from the Windows Store. The upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update will include the option to prevent users from installing any apps except those downloaded from the Windows Store, in an effort to improve on-device security. Microsoft outlined details of new controls over Windows Update that will be introduced with the Creators Update in the next few weeks. These will include more granular controls for when to schedule updates and associated reboots. Thanks to Microsoft's new Unified Update Platform, or UUP, future updates for Windows Insiders could see download sizes reduced by up to 65%. It's been a busy week for Windows Insiders, with numerous new builds being released. After Windows 10 build 15046 brought new features to PCs in the Fast ring on Tuesday, Microsoft rolled out build 15048 to Fast ring PCs on Friday, along with build 15047 to Windows 10 Mobile devices. Build 15043 also made its way to Windows 10 Mobile handsets in the Slow ring on Thursday - the first Slow ring build for those devices since December. On top of that, Windows 10 SDK Preview build 15042 was released on Wednesday... ...along with ISOs for Windows 10 build 15042 for PCs. Microsoft introduced Wake-on-LAN support for its Surface devices when used in conjunction with a Surface Ethernet adapter or dock - a very welcome addition, and rather a long time coming! Microsoft also announced general availability of Visio Online on Wednesday, following several months in public preview. Coinciding with that announcement, it also added a couple of new features. The Movies & TV app on Windows 10 (known as Films & TV in the United Kingdom) was updated for Windows Insiders to include support for 360-degree video, along with some other improvements. However, in less welcome news, Microsoft slashed its OneDrive storage allowances on Wednesday. The company had previously announced plans to remove its 'unlimited' storage plan, blaming customers for using too much of their unlimited allowance. All customers who previously had an unlimited or 10TB allowance will now see their storage reduced to just 1TB. Here's everything you need to know about the implications of those changes. And Microsoft announced a further change on Wednesday, ditching its Windows Holographic brand in favor of 'Windows Mixed Reality'. The new name sounds rather bland in comparison to the old one, but it was a necessary change, given that the virtual reality headsets that run the OS offer none of the 'holographic' elements available on augmented reality devices like HoloLens. Microsoft confirmed to Neowin on Wednesday that it will be bringing mixed reality experiences to both its current Xbox One consoles, and to its new Project Scorpio console, in 2018. It will begin shipping mixed reality dev kits this month, including a headset manufactured by Acer. On Tuesday, Microsoft announced its new Xbox Game Pass, a $10 monthly subscription offering unlimited access to over 100 games for Xbox owners. The new service will be launching this Spring, and you can check out all the games that will be available on day one here. Xbox One Insider Preview build 15039 was released to the Beta ring last weekend, while build 15045 made its way to the Alpha ring on Tuesday with several new features. Build 15046 was pushed to the Alpha ring on Thursday with various fixes for a range of issues. Over 1,000 games are currently being created by developers under the ID@Xbox program; on Wednesday, Microsoft announced details of 22 of those games that are coming to both the Xbox One and Windows 10. Battlefield 1 is free to play this weekend for Xbox Live Gold subscribers, and will also be available to buy with a hefty discount. But after a wonderful and exciting week, our odyssey across the tech world ends this week on a truly sad note. Last weekend, gamer Brian Vigneault died in the final hours of a 24-hour gaming marathon. He was live-streaming his gaming session on Twitch in an effort to raise money for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, which arranges memorable and happy experiences for terminally ill children. 22 hours into his marathon, the 35-year-old took a break from the stream, but never returned. Brian had previously raised over $11,000 for non-profits during the course of five years as a charity live-streamer. The thoughts of the whole Neowin team are with his family and friends. Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a few extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. Timi Cantisano reviewed the unusual GPD WIN, a handheld computer with a built-in QWERTY keyboard, and gaming controls, including a direction pad, thumbsticks and ABXY buttons. That's definitely worth a read! Byron Hinson published his review of Sniper Elite 4, which is available on the Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC. The game isn't for the squeamish as it can get a bit gory at times, but Byron found it to be a lot of fun, although it can become a bit repetitive. Check out his full review here. And after an action-packed week at Mobile World Congress, crammed full of big announcements, we're eager to hear your thoughts on what was revealed at the event. Was there a particular device that you're looking forward to buying? A new technology that you're keen to try out? A new machine that you're determined to save up for and treat yourself to? Or just something that you really like the look of?

HARRISBURG, Pa. — For some residents of this small city, there was something familiar about Foxconn’s recently announced plan to hire up to 50,000 U.S. workers, one of the many hiring pledges from companies rounded up by President Trump in the first weeks of his administration. Quotes in the article Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd HNHPF ▼ 5.81 -0.01 -0.09% Intel Corp INTC ▼ 35.57 -0.33 -0.92% SoftBank Group Corp SFTBF ▼ 73.82 -0.30 -0.40% Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 139.34 -0.44 -0.31% The only difference was the scale. In 2013, Foxconn’s chairman sent a jolt through this state capital when he said his company — best known for making Apple iPhones in China — would invest $30 million and hire 500 workers for a new high-tech factory in central Pennsylvania. Locals were giddy. Foxconn had a small office here, but this seemed like the start of an entire new industry. Pennsylvania’s governor boasted about the deal. The Brookings Institution think tank hailed Foxconn’s decision as a sign of U.S. manufacturing’s strength. But the factory was never built. The jobs never came. “It just seemed to fade to black” after the announcement, recalled a local official. It was the start of a mystery, created by a chief executive known to promise projects all over the world that never quite pan out. Yet few people seem to notice. Foxconn and others continue to get credit for deals that never take place. In December, Pennsylvania’s economic development staff was still touting the $30 million factory that never was. What happened in Harrisburg provides a skeptical lens for viewing the waves of corporate investment promises being used by Trump as evidence that he is following through on his campaign pledge to reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing. “I’m delivering on everything we promised,” Trump said last month during a meeting with manufacturing executives at the White House, noting how firms have announced new hiring and factories. “People are saying they’ve never seen so much happen in 30 days of a presidency.” Foxconn, for example, announced shortly after Trump’s election that it plans to invest $7 billion and hire up to 50,000 workers in the United States. Such a hiring spree would catapult Foxconn from a couple thousand U.S. workers to a major employer on par with Chrysler. Other companies, too, including SoftBank, Alibaba, Intel and IBM, have made an unusual display of loudly announcing their intentions to invest in the United States — all with price tags in the billions of dollars and the promise of tens of thousands of jobs — much to Trump’s delight.

It didn’t happen, but more promises have returned. “Foxconn is going to spend a tremendous amount of money on building a massive plant,” Trump said, “and probably more than one.” 2/3 SLIDES © Mark Makela/For The Washington Post David Black, head of the Harrisburg Regional Chamber of Commerce said FoxConn’s earlier promise to build a plant created “intense buzz” in the town. 3/3 SLIDES © Mark Makela/For The Washington Post In 2013, Foxconn’s chairman sent a jolt through this state capital when he said his company — best known for making Apple iPhones in China — would invest $30 million and hire 500 workers for a new high-tech factory in central Pennsylvania. 3/3 SLIDES “Foxconn is going to spend a tremendous amount of money on building a massive plant,” Trump said the day after the investment was revealed, “and probably more than one.” But, as Harrisburg learned, the gulf between these eye-popping announcements and what takes place on the ground can be huge — and frequently overlooked. “They are scrambling to look good,” Mark Selden, senior research associate at Cornell University’s East Asian program, said. “It’s a sign of the pressure that Trump is placing on everyone in the world to deliver on his agenda.” Companies tend to view these announcements as an opening bid in a negotiation, said Alberto Moel, a senior analyst with Bernstein Research in Hong Kong. Firms know politicians like the splashy headlines. And if everything falls into place — the business climate improves, they extract enough concessions such as tax breaks and free land — they might be able to make it happen. “It actually puts the onus on the U.S. in a way,” Moel said. “They are saying: ‘I’m along for the ride. Here’s my proposal.’ ” If the deal falls apart, as it often does, no one is going to talk about it. “The government themselves aren’t going to remind you of that, Trump has no intention of helping you remember that,” Moel said. “What’s the downside?” Trump is far from alone in using corporate announcements as political backdrops. It’s why ribbon-cuttings and ceremonial shovels exist. In 2012, President Barack Obama visited a new $5 billion Intel computer chip plant in Chandler, Ariz., citing it as “an example of an America that is within our reach.” But the facility, known as Fab 42, was never completed. Last week, Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich stood in the Oval Office with Trump to announce a $7 billion investment — essentially, Fab 42 was back on track, with a new price tag and a new president. Trump tweeted his praise. Even before he was sworn in, it was clear Trump placed greater importance on these job announcements than past administrations. Among the first signs came in December when Tokyo-based SoftBank’s chief executive, Masayoshi Son, stood with the president-elect to announce a plan to invest $50 billion and create 50,000 new U.S. jobs. Two days after Trump’s inauguration, Foxconn chief executive Terry Gou told reporters in Taiwan that his company planned to spend $7 billion on a U.S. factory to make computer displays. It wasn’t iPhones — which Trump has said he wants to be “Made in the USA” — but Gou said the factory could create 30,000 to 50,000 U.S. jobs. Details were few, but one clue seized on was the presence of a Pennsylvania state trade representative at Gou’s talk. Foxconn said in a statement that it is “exploring a potential investment that would represent an expansion of our current U.S. operations.” But the company could not confirm “the number of jobs that might be created.” Foxconn is a coveted hardware manufacturer because of its size. Last year, it reported $136 billion in revenue. It has more than 1 million employees, mostly in China. A single factory making iPhones or LCD screens can employ tens of thousands of workers. When Foxconn says it will invest in a new plant, the decision can transform a region. That’s why countries all over the world are eager to lure Foxconn to their shores. Gou, Foxconn’s founder, for years has described the United States as a “must-go market.” In 2014, as the Pennsylvania deal was quietly dying, Gou teased the opening of a LCD display factory in the states. His company talked with officials in Colorado and Arizona. Nothing happened. That same year, the company signed a letter of intent to invest up to $1 billion in Indonesia. That investment still has not occurred. Foxconn said it would invest $5 billion over five years in India as part of an ambitious expansion in 2014. The deal would create up to 50,000 jobs, Gou said. But Foxconn’s investment in India has amounted to only a small fraction of what it originally promised. Similar results were seen in Vietnam, where Foxconn committed to a $5 billion investment in 2007, and in Brazil, where Foxconn spoke of a $10 billion plan in 2011. The company made its first major foray in Vietnam only last year. In Brazil, Foxconn has an iPhone factory, but its investment has fallen far short of expectations. “There’s a pattern here,” said Moel, the analyst. Gou’s plans for Harrisburg were revealed in 2013 while he was in the United States on a tour with other Taiwanese business officials to, in part, drum up support for Taiwan’s bid to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership, known as TPP. (Coincidentally, Trump pulled the United States out of the trade treaty in his first days in office.) It was a surprise when Gou said Foxconn planned to invest $30 million over two years in a factory to make technology equipment and servers. Gou noted his company’s history in Harrisburg. He said the goal was to create “high-precision, high-tech, high value-added manufacturing in the U.S.” Gou also said Foxconn would donate $10 million to Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh for robotics research. “IPhone maker Foxconn to invest $40 million in the US,” wrote the China Post. “Foxconn to build plant in Pennsylvania,” CNN said. Local media quoted state officials as saying Gou would sign a memorandum of understanding and the company was busy scouting sites. “There was this intense buzz,” recalled David Black, president of the Harrisburg Regional Chamber. “Lots of us were excited by the opportunity,” said Bub Manning, who at the time co-owned a local construction firm. “Anytime something of that size comes along in central Pennsylvania, that’s a big deal.” For years, Foxconn has maintained an office with about 50 workers in Harrisburg, a hub of the computer connector industry. The office is in an old brick warehouse. On a recent visit, the building was filled by a half-empty warren of cubicles. A worker declined to comment to a reporter with The Washington Post. According to local government officials, Foxconn has not done any permitted alterations to the building in 15 years. Manning recalled how his firm tried to chase down information about the planned $30 million factory. “It felt like I was grabbing Jell-O. It never got any traction,” Manning said. The $30 million factory faded from view. Foxconn said its $10 million donation to Carnegie Mellon was “moving forward very successfully,” with half of the funds having been spent four years later. The school declined to comment. None of this has stopped the praise for Foxconn’s investment in Pennsylvania. Recent stories have referred to the phantom factory as a sign of Foxconn’s U.S. beachhead. A state economic development official wrote about Foxconn’s $30 million factory as evidence of foreign companies that operate in the Keystone State. (The piece was fixed after The Washington Post inquired about it.) State officials toured potential sites with Foxconn representatives, the state Department of Community and Economic Development said in a statement. “Unfortunately, a project did not come to fruition.” Foxconn attributed the failure to “material changes to the business and operating climate at that time.” “The proof is always in the pudding,” said Scott Andes, a senior policy analyst at Brookings. The assumption is that companies follow through on major announcements. “But it is important to be skeptical,” Andes said. “I would hope it’s not just smoke and mirrors with Foxconn or any other of these companies.” Feeling burned by the fate of the $30 million factory, some in Harrisburg are cautious about getting their hopes up again. “We learned something from that,” said Black of the Harrisburg chamber. But, Manning said, it would be hard to not be seduced by the size of Foxconn’s ambition, real or not. “If you smelled a project like that,” he said, “you’d get excited even though you know better.” Todd C.

Day One is just another day for military operations, a budget that is still in place from the old crowd and a vast array of economic, social and law enforcement initiatives left over by the last president. You would not know this from President Donald Trump. READ MORE: Donald Trump takes credit for jobs that predated his presidency He loudly and proudly takes credit for any positive development that has bloomed since he took office Jan. 20, even when the roots and buds of it were from President Barack Obama’s time. In his speech to Congress and other remarks in recent days, Trump has claimed credit for: big savings in an F-35 fighter jet contract that were in motion well before he became president. corporate job announcements that also had been months or longer in the making. an infusion of money from NATO partners that has not materialized at all, but reflects a long-standing intent by some members to increase their military capabilities. a tough-on-criminals approach to immigration enforcement that was planned and put into place during Obama’s presidency. a $12 billion drop in the U.S. debt, a routine blip traced to the regular timing of tax payments and other fiscal factors unconnected to any president. his plan to restore military supremacy, though he inherited military capabilities that are already second to none. WATCH: Trump alleges wiretapping by Obama; gives no evidence Trump does, though, seek to shift some responsibility to the last administration for an operation he authorized that did not go smoothly — the covert mission in Yemen in which a Navy SEAL and civilians were killed. That mission “was started before I got here,” Trump said. It can take months for a new president to pile up achievements or failures that are truly his own. A look at a selection of his statements from the past week: Story continues below WATCH ABOVE: Trump says he strongly supports NATO TRUMP: Speaking of the NATO alliance, “Our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice. Very nice.” THE FACTS: No new money has come pouring in from NATO allies. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made a strong case when he met with allied defense ministers at a NATO gathering last month, pressing them to meet their 2014 commitment to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024. Mattis and other leaders said the allies understood the message and there was some discussion about working out plans to meet the goal. Only five of the 28 member countries currently meet the 2 percent level, and no new commitments have been made since the NATO meeting. Others in the alliance have routinely said they will work toward the increase. In any event, the commitment is for these nations to spend more on their own military capabilities, which would strengthen the alliance, not to hand over money. READ MORE: Who in Trump’s inner circle doesn’t have ties to Russia? TRUMP: “According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America’s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.” THE FACTS: That’s not exactly what that report says. It says immigrants “contribute to government finances by paying taxes and add expenditures by consuming public services.” The report found that while first-generation immigrants are more expensive to governments than their native-born counterparts, primarily at the state and local level, immigrants’ children “are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population.” This second generation contributed more in taxes on a per capita basis, for example, than did the rest of the population in the period studied, 1994-2013. The report found that the “long-run fiscal impact” of immigrants and their children would probably be seen as more positive “if their role in sustaining labor force growth and contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial activity were taken into account.” WATCH: Trump discusses money saved on Air Force One and for allies on F-35s TRUMP: “We’ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price” of the F-35 jet fighter. THE FACTS: The cost savings he persists in bragging about were secured in full or in large part before he became president. The head of the Air Force program announced significant price reductions in the contract for the Lockheed F-35 fighter jet Dec. 19 — after Trump had tweeted about the cost but weeks before Trump met the company’s CEO about it. Pentagon managers took action even before the election to save money on the contract. Todd Harrison, a defense analyst and aerospace specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, “I don’t see any evidence to suggest that President Trump had anything to do with this.” WATCH: President Trump says he will bring manufacturing jobs back to America TRUMP: “Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Wal-Mart and many others have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.” THE FACTS: Trump is taking credit for corporate jobs decisions that largely predate his election. In the case of Intel, construction of the factory in Chandler, Arizona, that Trump referred to actually began during Obama’s presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel’s high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. READ MORE: Donald Trump saves jobs in Indiana: good PR, bad economics or something else? Some of the job announcements have come after companies, such as the wireless carrier Sprint, reduced their numbers of workers. More important, even as some companies create jobs, others are laying off workers. The best measure of whether more jobs are actually being created is the monthly employment report issued by the Labor Department, which nets out those gains and losses. The department will issue its report for February, the first full month of Trump’s term, on March 10. WATCH: Trump vows to lift defense sequester TRUMP: His budget plan will offer “one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.” THE FACTS: Three times in recent years, Congress raised defense budgets by larger percentages than the $54 billion, or 10 percent, increase that Trump proposes. The base defense budget grew by $41 billion, or 14.3 percent, in 2002; by $37 billion, or 11.3 percent, in 2003, and by $47 billion, or 10.9 percent, in 2008, according to Defense Department figures. And going back farther, his increase doesn’t come close to ones in the defense budget seen in the early 1980s, when they hit 20 percent or more, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. WATCH: Trump wants to restore U.S. auto industry jobs TRUMP: “Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labour force.” THE FACTS: That’s true, but for the vast majority of them, it’s because they choose to be. That 94 million figure includes everyone age 16 and older who doesn’t have a job and isn’t looking for one. It also includes retirees, parents who are staying home to raise children, and high school and college students who are studying rather than working. They are unlikely to work regardless of the state of the economy. With the huge baby boomer generation reaching retirement age and many of them retiring, the population of those out of the labor force is increasing and will continue to do so, economists forecast. It’s true that some of those out of the workforce are of working age and have given up looking for work. But that number is probably a small fraction of the 94 million Trump cited. The nation’s unemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent, near the lowest in a decade. WATCH: President Trump to speak about military spending as new scandal looms TRUMP: “Our Navy is now the smallest it’s been since, believe or not, World War I. Don’t worry. It’s going to soon be the largest it’s been.” THE FACTS: No, the fleet is not growing to the largest it’s been, or anything close. The fleet indeed shrank to its smallest size since the decade after World War I — bottoming out at 271 in 2015 before rising to 274 this year, compared with 139 in 1930. But that number alone is not that meaningful. The nature of warfare has changed since the naval battles of the world wars; the rise of air power is just one significant factor. As well, for the past few decades the Navy has dramatically increased the warfighting effectiveness of its ships, meaning it can do more with far fewer vessels than it could during the Cold War, for example. The fleet stood at a record high of 6,768 fighting ships during World War II, declined gradually in the 1950s and 1960s and dropped significantly after the Vietnam War. During the 1990s the number fell from the high 500s to the mid-300s as the Navy decommissioned many older ships and the U.S. reaped a “peace dividend” from the end of the Cold War. The count includes aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, amphibious assault ships and other large combat ships. The fleet may grow more than planned if Trump’s military expansion is approved by Congress. But no one is talking about matching — much less exceeding — the enormous armada of another age. The number of Navy personnel has fallen over time, too, from more than 725,000 in 1954 to about 323,000 now. It’s unlikely to grow anywhere near that higher level. WATCH: President Trump calls illegal immigrant removal a ‘military operation’ TRUMP: “According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home — from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center.” THE FACTS: It’s unclear what Justice Department data he’s citing, but the most recent government information doesn’t back up his claim. Just over half the people Trump talks about were born in the United States, according to Homeland Security Department research. That report said of 82 people the government determined were inspired by a foreign terrorist group to attempt or carry out an attack in the U.S., just over half were native-born citizens. Even the attacks Trump singled out weren’t entirely the work of foreigners. Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his Pakistani wife killed 14 people in the 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, was born in Chicago. READ MORE: Donald Trump missed some key facts about immigrants It’s true that in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, the FBI’s primary concern was with terrorists from overseas feared to be plotting attacks in the United States. But that’s no longer the case. The FBI and the Justice Department have been preoccupied with violent extremists from inside the U.S. who are inspired by the calls to violence and mayhem of the Islamic State group. The Justice Department has prosecuted scores of IS-related cases since 2014, and many of the defendants are U.S. citizens. WATCH: President Trump said he will send a budget to Congress that’s “one of the largest increases in national defence spending” TRUMP on military capability: “We are going to have very soon the finest equipment in the world.” THE FACTS: Pentagon leaders have said for years that the U.S. already has the world’s best weaponry and military equipment. They sometimes claim the U.S. is in danger of losing its advantage unless the Congress continues to spend heavily to develop and build new generations of weapons. The Navy’s top officer, Adm. John Richardson, has said repeatedly that the Navy is the world’s finest. He also has said the Navy must adapt to a world of changing security threats. Richardson’s main focus has been on sharpening and changing the way sailors think about the nature of war, rather than relying on bigger budgets. “We will not be able to ‘buy’ our way out of the challenges that we face,” he wrote in a January 2016 plan for maintaining U.S. naval superiority.   © 2017 The Canadian Press Report an error Defense Secretary Jim Mattis Donald Trump donald trump fact check Donald Trump immigrant comments Donald Trump immigration Donald Trump jobs Donald trump NATO Donald Trump Russia F-35 Fighter Jet NATO President Donald Trump Editor's Picks Health Why are colon cancer rates in Gen Xers and millennials in Canada rising?

It says immigrants “contribute to government finances by paying taxes and add expenditures by consuming public services.” The report found that while first-generation immigrants are more expensive to governments than their native-born counterparts, primarily at the state and local level, immigrants’ children “are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population.” This second generation contributed more in taxes on a per capita basis, for example, than did the rest of the population in the period studied, 1994-2013. The report found that the “long-run fiscal impact” of immigrants and their children would probably be seen as more positive “if their role in sustaining labor force growth and contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial activity were taken into account.” ___ TRUMP: “We’ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price” of the F-35 jet fighter. THE FACTS: The cost savings he persists in bragging about were secured in full or in large part before he became president. The head of the Air Force program announced significant price reductions in the contract for the Lockheed F-35 fighter jet Dec. 19 — after Trump had tweeted about the cost but weeks before Trump met the company’s CEO about it. Pentagon managers took action even before the election to save money on the contract. Todd Harrison, a defense analyst and aerospace specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, “I don’t see any evidence to suggest that President Trump had anything to do with this.” ___ TRUMP: “Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Wal-Mart and many others have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.” THE FACTS: Trump is taking credit for corporate jobs decisions that largely predate his election. In the case of Intel, construction of the factory in Chandler, Arizona, that Trump referred to actually began during Obama’s presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel’s high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Some of the job announcements have come after companies, such as the wireless carrier Sprint, reduced their numbers of workers. More important, even as some companies create jobs, others are laying off workers. The best measure of whether more jobs are actually being created is the monthly employment report issued by the Labor Department, which nets out those gains and losses. The department will issue its report for February, the first full month of Trump’s term, on March 10. ___ TRUMP: His budget plan will offer “one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.” THE FACTS: Three times in recent years, Congress raised defense budgets by larger percentages than the $54 billion, or 10 percent, increase that Trump proposes. The base defense budget grew by $41 billion, or 14.3 percent, in 2002; by $37 billion, or 11.3 percent, in 2003, and by $47 billion, or 10.9 percent, in 2008, according to Defense Department figures. And going back farther, his increase doesn’t come close to ones in the defense budget seen in the early 1980s, when they hit 20 percent or more, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ___ TRUMP: “Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.” THE FACTS: That’s true, but for the vast majority of them, it’s because they choose to be. That 94 million figure includes everyone age 16 and older who doesn’t have a job and isn’t looking for one. It also includes retirees, parents who are staying home to raise children, and high school and college students who are studying rather than working. They are unlikely to work regardless of the state of the economy. With the huge baby boomer generation reaching retirement age and many of them retiring, the population of those out of the labor force is increasing and will continue to do so, economists forecast. It’s true that some of those out of the workforce are of working age and have given up looking for work. But that number is probably a small fraction of the 94 million Trump cited. The nation’s unemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent, near the lowest in a decade. ___ TRUMP: “Our Navy is now the smallest it’s been since, believe or not, World War I. Don’t worry. It’s going to soon be the largest it’s been.” THE FACTS: No, the fleet is not growing to the largest it’s been, or anything close. The fleet indeed shrank to its smallest size since the decade after World War I — bottoming out at 271 in 2015 before rising to 274 this year, compared with 139 in 1930. But that number alone is not that meaningful. The nature of warfare has changed since the naval battles of the world wars; the rise of air power is just one significant factor. As well, for the past few decades the Navy has dramatically increased the warfighting effectiveness of its ships, meaning it can do more with far fewer vessels than it could during the Cold War, for example. The fleet stood at a record high of 6,768 fighting ships during World War II, declined gradually in the 1950s and 1960s and dropped significantly after the Vietnam War. During the 1990s the number fell from the high 500s to the mid-300s as the Navy decommissioned many older ships and the U.S. reaped a “peace dividend” from the end of the Cold War. The count includes aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, amphibious assault ships and other large combat ships. The fleet may grow more than planned if Trump’s military expansion is approved by Congress. But no one is talking about matching — much less exceeding — the enormous armada of another age. The number of Navy personnel has fallen over time, too, from more than 725,000 in 1954 to about 323,000 now. It’s unlikely to grow anywhere near that higher level. ___ TRUMP: “According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home — from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center.” THE FACTS: It’s unclear what Justice Department data he’s citing, but the most recent government information doesn’t back up his claim. Just over half the people Trump talks about were born in the United States, according to Homeland Security Department research. That report said of 82 people the government determined were inspired by a foreign terrorist group to attempt or carry out an attack in the U.S., just over half were native-born citizens. Even the attacks Trump singled out weren’t entirely the work of foreigners. Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his Pakistani wife killed 14 people in the 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, was born in Chicago. It’s true that in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, the FBI’s primary concern was with terrorists from overseas feared to be plotting attacks in the United States. But that’s no longer the case. The FBI and the Justice Department have been preoccupied with violent extremists from inside the U.S. who are inspired by the calls to violence and mayhem of the Islamic State group. The Justice Department has prosecuted scores of IS-related cases since 2014, and many of the defendants are U.S. citizens. ___ TRUMP on military capability: “We are going to have very soon the finest equipment in the world.” THE FACTS: Pentagon leaders have said for years that the U.S. already has the world’s best weaponry and military equipment. They sometimes claim the U.S. is in danger of losing its advantage unless the Congress continues to spend heavily to develop and build new generations of weapons. The Navy’s top officer, Adm. John Richardson, has said repeatedly that the Navy is the world’s finest. He also has said the Navy must adapt to a world of changing security threats. Richardson’s main focus has been on sharpening and changing the way sailors think about the nature of war, rather than relying on bigger budgets. “We will not be able to ‘buy’ our way out of the challenges that we face,” he wrote in a January 2016 plan for maintaining U.S. naval superiority. ___ Find all AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd ___ Associated Press writers Robert Burns, Alicia A.

Day One is just another day for military operations, a budget that is still in place from the old crowd and a vast array of economic, social and law enforcement initiatives left over by the last president. You would not know this from President Donald Trump. He loudly and proudly takes credit for any positive development that has bloomed since he took office Jan. 20, even when the roots and buds of it were from President Barack Obama's time. In his speech to Congress and other remarks in recent days, Trump has claimed credit for: FILE - In this March 2, 2017 file photo, President Donald Trump gestures as he speaks to Navy and shipyard personnel aboard nuclear aircraft carrier Gerald R. Ford at Newport News Shipbuilding in Newport News, Va. (AP Photo/Steve Helber, File) -big savings in an F-35 fighter jet contract that were in motion well before he became president. -corporate job announcements that also had been months or longer in the making. -an infusion of money from NATO partners that has not materialized at all, but reflects a long-standing intent by some members to increase their military capabilities. -a tough-on-criminals approach to immigration enforcement that was planned and put into place during Obama's presidency. -a $12 billion drop in the U.S. debt, a routine blip traced to the regular timing of tax payments and other fiscal factors unconnected to any president. -his plan to restore military supremacy, though he inherited military capabilities that are already second to none. Trump does, though, seek to shift some responsibility to the last administration for an operation he authorized that did not go smoothly - the covert mission in Yemen in which a Navy SEAL and civilians were killed. That mission "was started before I got here," Trump said. It can take months for a new president to pile up achievements or failures that are truly his own. A look at a selection of his statements from the past week: TRUMP: Speaking of the NATO alliance, "Our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice. Very nice." THE FACTS: No new money has come pouring in from NATO allies. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made a strong case when he met with allied defense ministers at a NATO gathering last month, pressing them to meet their 2014 commitment to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024. Mattis and other leaders said the allies understood the message and there was some discussion about working out plans to meet the goal. Only five of the 28 member countries currently meet the 2 percent level, and no new commitments have been made since the NATO meeting. Others in the alliance have routinely said they will work toward the increase. In any event, the commitment is for these nations to spend more on their own military capabilities, which would strengthen the alliance, not to hand over money. ___ TRUMP: "According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America's taxpayers many billions of dollars a year." THE FACTS: That's not exactly what that report says. It says immigrants "contribute to government finances by paying taxes and add expenditures by consuming public services."

Day One is just another day for military operations, a budget that is still in place from the old crowd and a vast array of economic, social and law enforcement initiatives left over by the last president. You would not know this from President Donald Trump. He loudly and proudly takes credit for any positive development that has bloomed since he took office Jan. 20, even when the roots and buds of it were from President Barack Obama’s time. In his speech to Congress and other remarks in recent days, Trump has claimed credit for: What impact will the Trump administration have on feds? Read the latest in our First 100 Days section. —big savings in an F-35 fighter jet contract that were in motion well before he became president. Advertisement —corporate job announcements that also had been months or longer in the making. —an infusion of money from NATO partners that has not materialized at all, but reflects a long-standing intent by some members to increase their military capabilities. —a tough-on-criminals approach to immigration enforcement that was planned and put into place during Obama’s presidency. —a $12 billion drop in the U.S. debt, a routine blip traced to the regular timing of tax payments and other fiscal factors unconnected to any president. —his plan to restore military supremacy, though he inherited military capabilities that are already second to none. Trump does, though, seek to shift some responsibility to the last administration for an operation he authorized that did not go smoothly — the covert mission in Yemen in which a Navy SEAL and civilians were killed. That mission “was started before I got here,” Trump said. It can take months for a new president to pile up achievements or failures that are truly his own. A look at a selection of his statements from the past week: TRUMP: Speaking of the NATO alliance, “Our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice. Very nice.” THE FACTS: No new money has come pouring in from NATO allies. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made a strong case when he met with allied defense ministers at a NATO gathering last month, pressing them to meet their 2014 commitment to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024. Mattis and other leaders said the allies understood the message and there was some discussion about working out plans to meet the goal. Only five of the 28 member countries currently meet the 2 percent level, and no new commitments have been made since the NATO meeting. Others in the alliance have routinely said they will work toward the increase. In any event, the commitment is for these nations to spend more on their own military capabilities, which would strengthen the alliance, not to hand over money. ___ TRUMP: “According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America’s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.” THE FACTS: That’s not exactly what that report says. It says immigrants “contribute to government finances by paying taxes and add expenditures by consuming public services.” The report found that while first-generation immigrants are more expensive to governments than their native-born counterparts, primarily at the state and local level, immigrants’ children “are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population.” This second generation contributed more in taxes on a per capita basis, for example, than did the rest of the population in the period studied, 1994-2013. The report found that the “long-run fiscal impact” of immigrants and their children would probably be seen as more positive “if their role in sustaining labor force growth and contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial activity were taken into account.” ___ TRUMP: “We’ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price” of the F-35 jet fighter. THE FACTS: The cost savings he persists in bragging about were secured in full or in large part before he became president. The head of the Air Force program announced significant price reductions in the contract for the Lockheed F-35 fighter jet Dec. 19 — after Trump had tweeted about the cost but weeks before Trump met the company’s CEO about it. Pentagon managers took action even before the election to save money on the contract. Todd Harrison, a defense analyst and aerospace specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, “I don’t see any evidence to suggest that President Trump had anything to do with this.” ___ TRUMP: “Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Wal-Mart and many others have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.” THE FACTS: Trump is taking credit for corporate jobs decisions that largely predate his election. In the case of Intel, construction of the factory in Chandler, Arizona, that Trump referred to actually began during Obama’s presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel’s high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Some of the job announcements have come after companies, such as the wireless carrier Sprint, reduced their numbers of workers. More important, even as some companies create jobs, others are laying off workers. The best measure of whether more jobs are actually being created is the monthly employment report issued by the Labor Department, which nets out those gains and losses. The department will issue its report for February, the first full month of Trump’s term, on March 10. ___ TRUMP: His budget plan will offer “one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.” THE FACTS: Three times in recent years, Congress raised defense budgets by larger percentages than the $54 billion, or 10 percent, increase that Trump proposes. The base defense budget grew by $41 billion, or 14.3 percent, in 2002; by $37 billion, or 11.3 percent, in 2003, and by $47 billion, or 10.9 percent, in 2008, according to Defense Department figures. And going back farther, his increase doesn’t come close to ones in the defense budget seen in the early 1980s, when they hit 20 percent or more, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ___ TRUMP: “Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.” THE FACTS: That’s true, but for the vast majority of them, it’s because they choose to be. That 94 million figure includes everyone age 16 and older who doesn’t have a job and isn’t looking for one. It also includes retirees, parents who are staying home to raise children, and high school and college students who are studying rather than working. They are unlikely to work regardless of the state of the economy. With the huge baby boomer generation reaching retirement age and many of them retiring, the population of those out of the labor force is increasing and will continue to do so, economists forecast. It’s true that some of those out of the workforce are of working age and have given up looking for work. But that number is probably a small fraction of the 94 million Trump cited. The nation’s unemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent, near the lowest in a decade. ___ TRUMP: “Our Navy is now the smallest it’s been since, believe or not, World War I. Don’t worry. It’s going to soon be the largest it’s been.” THE FACTS: No, the fleet is not growing to the largest it’s been, or anything close. The fleet indeed shrank to its smallest size since the decade after World War I — bottoming out at 271 in 2015 before rising to 274 this year, compared with 139 in 1930. But that number alone is not that meaningful. The nature of warfare has changed since the naval battles of the world wars; the rise of air power is just one significant factor. As well, for the past few decades the Navy has dramatically increased the warfighting effectiveness of its ships, meaning it can do more with far fewer vessels than it could during the Cold War, for example. The fleet stood at a record high of 6,768 fighting ships during World War II, declined gradually in the 1950s and 1960s and dropped significantly after the Vietnam War. During the 1990s the number fell from the high 500s to the mid-300s as the Navy decommissioned many older ships and the U.S. reaped a “peace dividend” from the end of the Cold War. The count includes aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, amphibious assault ships and other large combat ships. The fleet may grow more than planned if Trump’s military expansion is approved by Congress. But no one is talking about matching — much less exceeding — the enormous armada of another age. The number of Navy personnel has fallen over time, too, from more than 725,000 in 1954 to about 323,000 now. It’s unlikely to grow anywhere near that higher level. ___ TRUMP: “According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home — from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center.” THE FACTS: It’s unclear what Justice Department data he’s citing, but the most recent government information doesn’t back up his claim. Just over half the people Trump talks about were born in the United States, according to Homeland Security Department research. That report said of 82 people the government determined were inspired by a foreign terrorist group to attempt or carry out an attack in the U.S., just over half were native-born citizens. Even the attacks Trump singled out weren’t entirely the work of foreigners. Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his Pakistani wife killed 14 people in the 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, was born in Chicago. It’s true that in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, the FBI’s primary concern was with terrorists from overseas feared to be plotting attacks in the United States. But that’s no longer the case. The FBI and the Justice Department have been preoccupied with violent extremists from inside the U.S. who are inspired by the calls to violence and mayhem of the Islamic State group. The Justice Department has prosecuted scores of IS-related cases since 2014, and many of the defendants are U.S. citizens. ___ TRUMP on military capability: “We are going to have very soon the finest equipment in the world.” THE FACTS: Pentagon leaders have said for years that the U.S. already has the world’s best weaponry and military equipment. They sometimes claim the U.S. is in danger of losing its advantage unless the Congress continues to spend heavily to develop and build new generations of weapons. The Navy’s top officer, Adm. John Richardson, has said repeatedly that the Navy is the world’s finest. He also has said the Navy must adapt to a world of changing security threats. Richardson’s main focus has been on sharpening and changing the way sailors think about the nature of war, rather than relying on bigger budgets. “We will not be able to ‘buy’ our way out of the challenges that we face,” he wrote in a January 2016 plan for maintaining U.S. naval superiority. ___ Find all AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd ___ Associated Press writers Robert Burns, Alicia A.

Geminilake Will Require Intel Audio Firmware Blobs Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 4 March 2017 at 08:02 AM EST. 22 Comments Besides recent Intel graphics hardware making use of firmware binary blobs now for the GuC/HuC functionality, Intel audio hardware continues in making use of firmware binary-only blobs for audio support. Intel Skylake audio began needing firmware audio blobs along with Skylake as well as Broxton hardware. Thus it probably doesn't come as any surprise (unless you were hoping your protesting efforts were paying off) that the upcoming Geminilake hardware will also need firmware blobs for audio. We've been covering Geminilake's upbringing in Linux and the latest is the addition of audio firmware for this upcoming hardware. So Geminilake will be some more hardware unfriendly to GNU Linux-libre users. Geminilake is the SoC successor to Apollo Lake and will be used in low-end laptops, 2-in1 devices, all-in-one PCs, and more. Geminilake uses the Goldmont architecture and Skylake era graphics. Geminilake systems should be shipping later this year. 22 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Making AMD great again! Home Hardware Hands on with AMD’s fab new Ryzen CPU By Jeremy Laird on March 2nd, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Rejoice, for AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is here. And it’s good. Thank science for that. Another dud from AMD didn’t bear thinking about. Instead, we get to ponder just how good Ryzen is and indeed how good it truly needs to be. It isn’t the very fastest CPU money can buy or the greatest gaming CPU ever. But that’s just dandy. It’s still going to blow the PC processor market wide open and force Intel to seriously up its game. If you want the background to AMD’s new chip and a broad overview on what makes it tick, head over here. The task this week is to get a quick feel for what Ryzen is actually like. The chip I’ve played with briefly is the middling model of the launch trio, the Ryzen 7 1700X. Like the other two Ryzen chips AMD is making available at launch, it’s an eight-core beast that crunches two software threads per core. Hexa-core and quad-core models are coming, but aren’t quite ready for launch day. The 1700X clocks in nominally at 3.4GHz with a potential 3.8GHz turbo mode. The ‘X’ suffix, incidentally means it sports AMD’s new XFR auto-overclocking feature, a bit more on which in a moment. For the record the other two chips are the 3.0GHz/3.7GHz 1700 and the 3.6GHz/4GHz 1800X. Pricing for the 1700X is £399. The 1800X rocks in around £499 and the 1700 is yours for £329. Stick a $ sign in front of those numbers and you have the US price, which is both impressive and depressing depending on your point of view. Without further ado, then, let’s get busy. I couldn’t resist firing up the fairly pointless Cinebench synthetic benchmark first, just to see those 16 threads in action. Fly my pretties: Not that it matters much for the real world, but this thing flies in a multi-threaded benchmark like Cinebench. To give you a feel for just how quick it is, it’s nearly two and a half times faster than the incumbent gamer’s choice, the Intel Core i5-7600K. Yowsers. Of course, multi-threading is only half – or should that be 15/16ths – of the story. AMD’s big failure with its previous FX processors was single-threaded performance and it just so happens that games are particularly sensitive to just that. In Cinebench’s single-threaded mode, the Ryzen 7 1700X is between 10 and 20 per cent slower than various gaming-relevant Intel CPUs, with about 10% of that due to a slight comparative deficiency in Ryzen’s architecture and the other 10% thanks to clockspeed. Indeed, it was rumoured prior to launch that clock-for-clock and core-for-core, Ryzen would be roughly a match for Intel’s Haswell-generation chips – the Core iSomething 4000 series chips, in other words. And so it proves in Cinebench. Anyway, I mucked around with a few other canned benchmarks, all of which delivered similar kinds of results. Ryzen monsters quad-core Intel chips in multi-threading. In fact, it’s on about a par with Intel’s own eight-core beast, the 6900K for multithreading. Lest you have forgotten, that’s more or less a £1,000 chip. But what, you cry, of games? Don’t panic, the news here is decent, too, if somewhat preliminary and indeed patchy. You can read detailed benchmarks elsewhere, but to give you one example, in Total War: Attila using the same video card and settings, the Ryzen 1700X cranks out an average of 39 frames per second to 40 from a Core i5-7600K. I got similar results in several other titles. The first caveat to that is that I was running everything at 1440p and high detail settings, which tends to push things towards being GPU limited, even on an Nvidia GTX 1080. The handful of games I ran may also have somewhat flattered Ryzen. Among others, Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games. Part of that is clockspeed, part of it is architecture and part is probably optimisation. You can be sure that few if any games exist that have been compiled to run well on Ryzen. Really broadly, then, Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. If you want to game and stream your exploits at the same time, for instance, Ryzen looks like a killer solution. But a high clocked six-core Ryzen of the near future might be the best AMD bet for gamers. If there is a disappointment, it’s overclocking. All Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked for easy overclocking. But to cut a long story short, they don’t overclock. Well, barely. I squeezed an extra 100MHz out of my chip and that was with water cooling. M’colleagues elsewhere in the reviewersphere report similar findings. Oh, and the XFR auto-overclocking feature doesn’t improve on that. It may be of interest in future when Ryzen chips with more headroom appear. For now, it’s fairly redundant. That said, the 1700X I tested tended to max out at only 3.5GHz in multi-threaded workloads when running at standard rather than overclocked settings rather than the 3.8GHz promised by the chip’s turbo mode. So, that 100MHz overclock was actually more like 400MHz in practice. But I’m not sure I actually care. My feeling coming in was that if Ryzen really was roughly on a par with Haswell and ran at about 3.5GHz, that would be plenty to put the frighteners on Intel. It does just that, so frankly I for one am satisfied. Incidentally, if you’re wondering about operating temps, have a scan of the web. I was only able to run my test chip with water cooling, so the 41 degrees C idle and 51 degrees under load aren’t hugely helpful for the bulk of us that run fairly standard air coolers. What we have then is a chip that isn’t far off Intel for gaming and absolutely obliterates it for multi-threading performance when you factor in pricing. Regards the latter, this chip is literally half the price of Intel’s eight-core 6900K. Staggering. Of course, it’s still bloody expensive at £399. Moreover, you’re never actually going to feel the difference versus the plain old £329 Ryzen 7 1700. So of the initial launch chips, the 1700 is the obvious choice. It’s an awesome all-rounder for the money. However, I still think the sweet spot for most RPSers will likely be the future six-core model. It’ll crank out the same gaming performance (well, in most games) as the eight-core model, just for less money, along with both pretty snazzy multi-threading for content creation and some multi-threading headroom to come as games gradually scale better across multiple cores. Where all this leaves Intel is of course an interesting question. My sense in recent years is that readers have tired of the press bashing Intel for sandbagging, but for my money Ryzen completely confirms that narrative. It makes Intel’s product line up look cynical and overpriced. Personally, I can’t see Intel slashing prices anything like enough to offset the yawning gap between it’s six and eight-core CPUs and Ryzen. In reality, it doesn’t matter much to Intel. Desktop CPUs aren’t all that important and in any case, the likes of Dell will keep cranking out systems for mainstream punters and nobody will care much or notice much. What Intel may do is hurry up the mainstream six-core model for the LGA1151 socket that appeared on its roadmaps recently. Suitably clocked and priced, that would put Intel in a reasonable if still not ideal competitive position. In the meantime, I think enthusiasts will make something of a stampede towards Ryzen. It’s just such a compelling value proposition, even if it remains somewhat unproven. It wouldn’t surprise me to find a few bugs emerging (I hear it’s a bit pernickety when it comes to certain memory configs, for instance) or a few weak spots in its performance profile shake out as the PC community probes its capabilities. AMD is but a small company and it probably doesn’t have the manpower to completely finesse this new architecture first time around. Of course, if that’s correct the upside is that scope remains for future revisions to turn a good chip into a great one. Anyway, this is an initial hands-on, not an entirely definitive and forensic investigation. I’ll have a look at the platform / motherboard part of the Ryzen story in a future post – PCI Express connectivity with Ryzen chips is an emerging concern, for instance. Overall, Ryzen is impressive even if the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers. But if I was buying a CPU right now, it would still be the base model eight-core Ryzen. It’s not perfect and for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs. But it’s a really nice all-rounder for the money.

Fast enough single-threaded, big boost multi-threaded. And the timing’s about right for all of us on a Sandy or Ivy Bridge Core i5 (or below) to upgrade.

Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:40 Gnoupi says: I’m actually a bit surprised to read that. The consensus on all other reviews I read is that it’s not ideal for gaming, performance wise, compared to the concurrency. And that it only passes them in “ideal” multithreaded conditions (video processing/rendering). Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:46 dangermouse76 says: My reading seems to suggest. That 1440p evens out the FPS comparisons as they push the work to the GPU. But when looking at 1080p gaming with these chips the i7 seems to have a larger margin over Ryzen. Edit: As this article seems to bare out. So yeah these chips dont blow me away for gaming. That may not be their purpose, but still. So yeah very interested to see what the Ryzen i5 competition will look like. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:16 dangermouse76 says: Also this is brand new from scratch work from AMD so optimisations from devs and AMD may help bring that gap down.

Where games are CPU limited, the gap is a lot more obvious. Plus there are one or two anomalies, to boot. I think you’ve probably absorbed my generally upbeat tone but ignored the detail of what I wrote.

The way language can glitch like this, causing tiny ambiguities, is really fun for me to dissect!

Renew! Renew! Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:31 carewolf says: Very few games push the CPU and the few that do are multithreaded. What other reviews do to make Intel look better is take something that is close to pushing the CPU but is single-threaded because it usually doesn’t matter, run it in a low resolution like 1080p and then pretend FPS over 100 matters. Then a Kaby Lake is faster than Ryzen, because it does indeed have better single threaded performance. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:29 Unclepauly says: There is much more than “a very few” games that push the cpu. When you go online multiplayer the burden on the CPU increases alot for a large percentage of games. The problem here is that online multiplayer is almost impossible to benchmark consistently. Games with a huge amount of players just compounds the issue. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:18 randomclass says: Also games like Paradox’s grand strategy games, from CK2 to HoI4. They all seem to be laggy in late game, in SP or MP, and it’s all down to CPU, not GPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:54 ravenshrike says: The issue is that the reviews are all over the place with a few more or less matching the 7700k even at 1080p, with others horribly bombing. Most of that is teething issues from the new architecture(Although the on-die memory controller throughput is a bit weak. That needs to be improved by at least 50%, preferably doubled in the next refresh). In three to six months the performance numbers will almost certainly look much better as BIOSes, opcode, and MS drivers are improved, with even some games getting patched to work with Ryzen’s quirks. You’ve got to remember that the Haswell and Broadwell and Lake chips are all very mature at this point with more similarities than differences between them. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:41 kud13 says: A few years back I picked up an AMD FX 4350- also an 8-core 4.0 Ghz base for something ridiculous like 250CAD (this was right before the dollar spiked up). The reason for AMD was I had an AMD-based mobo and I was upgrading piecemeal. Gotta say, I haven’t had any problems with any “modern” games on it since (GPU was a bottleneck for a while, but now I’m running Nvidia 1070). However, Age of Empires 2 HD (that does not support multi-threading, period) DOES make it huff and puff (as opposed to, say, Witcher 3). So I guess we still gotta wait for AMD to come up with powerful single-thread chips. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:52 Sakkura says: 8 cores? Then you mean FX-8350, the FX-4350 is 4 cores. While Ryzen is still not quite on par with Intel in single-threaded performance, it’s very close. And a HUGE upgrade over their old FX chips. We’re talking 60-80% faster. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:49 BadManiac says: I ordered my 1700X today, been waiting for this too long. I’m still gaming on my old Phenom 2 X4, and while running at a respectable 4Ghz, it’s really starting to show it’s age in some games. So for me the jump from 4 cores and 4 threads to 8 cores and 16 threads at hopefully near the same clock speed should be an enormous leap, and I won’t be completely CPU limiting my GTX 1070 any more. :D Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:32 AngoraFish says: My Phenom 2 x4 955 is still running strong and I’ve not noticed any significant CPU bottleneck on anything I play.

I got almost double the framerate on most games. I mean, the good old Phenom II served its purpose. It allowed me to play any game I wanted. It also didn’t do that so well.

But I do more than just playing nothing but games on my desktop, and having 8 physical cores would be a great convenience for the VMs and the sometimes video encodes that I do. Consider me pleasantly impressed. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:07 ScubaMonster says: I’ve seen some articles about the performance comparison, but not any that factor in price at the same time. I get that it’s the cold hard numbers that matter most and these chips are going up against Intel’s offerings. But if a Ryzen chip lags a bit behind its Intel counterpart but is substantially cheaper I would consider that a win. Sure, you could pony up extra bucks if you absolutely must have the best of the best, but if you can get performance close to it for a lot cheaper, that would be a no brainer to me. I don’t know all the pricing to make a comparison myself though. I haven’t really looked at the Ryzen prices compared to their Intel equivalents.

Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:49 Unclepauly says: It really does depend on the types of games a person plays though. Certain genres of games have a greater need for CPU performance while many do not. Plenty of outliers as well. Take ARMA 3 for example, Sandy bridge systems net about 30-35 fps while Kaby Lake(with very fast ram) is netting roughly 55-60 fps. Cherry picked game of course but there are others out there less documented that benefit as well. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:45 Rack says: Sadly the current scenario does Ryzen few favours. A 1700 compares poorly with an i5 7600k at £100 more. Right at the bottom of the pile the 1100 might be a reasonable budget option but all in all Ryzen looks to be a good option for 3d modelling, less so for games. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:16 ButteringSundays says: I haven’t noticed my 5 y/o i5 acting as a bottleneck anywhere I’ve noticed (the 760 is showing its age though… sometimes).

Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:14 Lord Zeon says: The CPU hasn’t been a bottleneck for gaming for almost a decade now. I still use a first gen Bulldozer CPU, the FX-8120, and I’ve never seen a AAA title get caught up on it with my GTX 970. Imagine that – the first of the “awful” AMD architectures that Ryzen is replacing still is entirely relevant in the enthusiast gaming space. I genuinely think that Intel’s marketing has permeated the enthusiast community to the point where everyone has lost the their reference point as to what a CPU needs to do for gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 14:03 Sakkura says: If you’re not seeing the FX-8120 limit performance, then you’re simply not looking. It definitely does. That doesn’t mean everything is unplayable on it, but it really doesn’t qualify for enthusiast gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 15:18 tehfish says: As an FX-8120 owner also, it does bottleneck the GPU in recent games, but it does depend on what GPU you have. You may just be very lucky with a well-matched GPU to go with the CPU there. For an example, with fallout4, an overclocked FX-8120 (4.2ghz, no turbo) and a R9 390: It’s perfectly playable often running happily at 1080p 60fps, then you can hit certain areas where it drops to ~20-30fps with the GPU core down to ~450mhz out of it’s maximum 1060mhz – a clear case of a CPU bottleneck. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 00:18 Etherion says: I also have a quite dated i5 760 cpu, but didn’t feel it as a bottleneck until just recently (current gpu is gtx 770 overclocked) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:45 bfar says: Way back in January last year, I had a long discussion with my peers on a UK forum over 6700k vs 5820k, as they were roughly the same price at the time. I argued that for gaming, the higher clocked 4 core CPU would be the better bet for at least a year or two. We agreed that for all other applications, the lower clocked 6 core chip was the way to go. It seems that a year later, nothing has changed, and it frames the perception of Rysen from an enthusiast perspective. It’s still a major coup for consumers though, because as Jeremy rightly points out, most of Intels chips look like poor value for money all of a sudden. Prices will fall across the board.

Whilst it doesn’t match a 7700K, it’s a great alternative to Intel’s enthusiast class CPUs at a much lower price, and being AMD hopefully supports ECC RAM too. The problem is, I’m not convinced the enthusiast market is large enough. If you’re using virtualisation, rendering, or transcoding video it’s a huge win, but for general productivity and games this isn’t on the radar and probably never will be. Neither are any of Intel’s chips with more than four cores. They also haven’t talked up any virtualisation support, other than encrypted memory. They could do much more in this area if they wanted to. Roll on four fast core versions of Ryzen.. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Intel’s Broadwell-E processors might boast high-end multi-core performance, but this is reflected by their high price. AMD has upset the market with its high-value eight-core processors and their increased performance over Intel’s multi-core solutions. Intel has continued to refine its architecture and provide small performance boosts each generation, while AMD has launched its new Ryzen processors – which are set to compete with the longstanding market leader. Ryzen 7 The most powerful Ryzen processor is the Ryzen 7 1800X, which AMD said is the fastest eight-core processor in the world. Despite its impressive performance, it is priced at R8,199 – less than half the price of the Intel Core i7 6900K (R18,591). This price difference makes the Ryzen line-up a great choice for high-end desktop users looking for a powerful and affordable eight-core CPU with relatively low power consumption. Another important feature of Ryzen 7 processors is that all chips are unlocked, unlike Intel’s Core processors. The increased implementation of new APIs allows processors with good multi-threaded performance to scale well in future applications, including high-resolution gaming. Below are benchmarks published by AMD for the Ryzen 7 1800X and Intel Core i7 6900K. Microarchitecture Intel’s approach to desktop processor architecture has changed since it reached the 14nm processor node, breaking its “tick-tock” design model. The “tick-tock” model involves the release of two architectures per fabrication process node, with the second being a refinement of the previous architecture on the same manufacturing process. The company previously progressed through architectures in this manner, but has remained on the 14nm fabrication process of late – choosing to continue optimising its microarchitecture. While Intel has been upgrading its processors with small performance and clock speed improvements on the 14nm process, AMD has been working on Ryzen – the company’s first desktop CPU architecture manufactured on the 14nm process node. Intel’s Kaby Lake chips received criticism for their small performance increase over previous CPU generations, with the the new processors providing little motivation for upgrading from a Skylake product – apart from Optane support and slightly-higher clock speeds. AMD has reportedly seen a 52% increase in IPC compared to its previous processor architecture, which is the result of a new process node and redesigned CPU architecture. While Intel’s mainstream – and more affordable – desktop products still remain unchallenged, AMD is yet to unveil its Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 3 processors. These are set to compete with Intel’s Core i7, Core i5, and Core i3 CPUs. If the price-per-performance ratio of Ryzen 7 processors scales down to AMD’s mainstream Ryzen products, Intel’s popular Core i5 and Core i7 gaming chips could be the next CPUs threatened by AMD’s new processors.

SHARE Governor hires Intel official as broadband guru Anthony Neal-Graves By Charles Ashby Friday, March 3, 2017 DENVER — Colorado has its first-ever broadband guru. Gov. John Hickenlooper on Friday hired Intel vice president Anthony Neal-Graves to be executive director of the new Colorado Broadband Office. Hickenlooper announced plans to create such an office during his State of the State address before a joint session of the Colorado Legislature in January, saying it was high time the state had someone to head up efforts to ensure the entire state has adequate internet services. “We are working tirelessly to make sure every county throughout the state has the tools needed for economic development, especially in rural areas,” the governor said in a statement. “Tony’s leadership will help move the needle so that all Coloradans have improved access to broadband services sooner rather than later.” The Democratic governor said that about 70 percent of Colorado residents have access to adequate broadband services, a ratio he wants to increase to at least 85 percent by the time his term in office ends next year. His goal, however, is to have the entire state covered by 2020. Graves comes to the state from Portland, Oregon, where he headed Intel’s “Internet of Things Group.” His primary role will be to drive the state’s broadband strategy, which is to include public-private partnerships to lay the equipment needed to extend broadband to all areas of the state. The Legislature has struggled in recent years to find ways to get private companies to invest the money needed to reach rural parts of the state, including creating a special Broadband Deployment Fund. That fund was created as part of a long-range plan to do away with another fund designed to help telecommunications companies bring landline telephone service to all areas of the state. Under current law, the Colorado Public Utilities Commission is to declare certain areas of the state sufficiently equipped for landline and cell service, diverting a charge consumers pay for that into the new broadband fund. But since that fund was created in 2014, only about $2.1 million has been transferred into it, partly because telecommunications companies have sued the utilities commission over the matter, delaying its ability to designate areas of the state as being adequately served for telephone service.

Portwel’s 125 x 95mm “PCOM-B642VG” COM Express Basic Type 6 entry taps Intel’s higher-end quad- and dual-core S-series desktop-class models. No model details were offered, so presumably the module supports all 16 Kaby Lake-S parts, from a dual-core, 3.4GHz Core i3-7100T with 35W to a quad-core 4.2GHz/4.5GHz Core i7-7700K with 91W TDP. The CPUs are available with HD Graphics 630, and one of three Intel chipsets: Q170, H110, and C236. PCOM-B642VG, front and back (click images to enlarge) No OS details were supplied for the module, which follows earlier Portwell Type 6 COMs like the Haswell-based PCOM-B630VG, but Linux should run just fine. The module supports Intel Kaby Lake functionality such as Intel Turbo Boost and Hyper-threading technologies, as well as Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions), Intel MPX (Memory Guard Extensions), and additional HSIO (High Speed Input/Output), says Portwell. The PCOM-B642VG can load up to 32GB DDR4-2400 via dual sockets, and when using the C236 chipset, it supports ECC RAM. Four SATA III ports are provided along with a GbE controller and both PCIe Gen 3 x16 and 8x PCIe Gen 3 x1 expansion. There’s an option to swap out the latter for a single PCIe x4 interface. Triple simultaneous displays are supported via DisplayPort, VGA, and eDP interfaces. An LVDS interface also appears to be available. The PCOM-B642VG is further equipped with 4x USB 3.0, 8x USB 2.0, and Intel HD Audio. The module supports TPM security, as well as I2C, SMBus, and UART interfaces. The PCOM-B642VG “typically” runs on “12V, 5VSB, VBAT” power, and can operate at 0 to 60ºC temperatures, says Portwell. Optional services include carrier board design and development, review schematics and BIOS customization. The module supports applications including medical healthcare systems, military equipment, retail systems, and IoT.   Further information The PCOM-B642VG is available now from Portwell, and will also be distributed via Arrow Electronics and Avnet. More information may be found at Portwell’s PCOM-B642VG product page.   Related posts: First Apollo Lake Nano-ITX SBC emerges COM Express Type 6 quartet sings Braswell's praise Qseven COM offers Apollo Lake and a security chip Linux-friendly COM offers a choice of Bay Trail SoCs COM Express modules build on Intel's Kaby Lake Industrial focused Mini-ITX board packs Skylake punch Kaby Lake board lineup includes a Mini-ITX SBC and two COMs COM runs Linux on Kaby Lake, supports Intel Optane Kontron launches Linux-friendly Kaby Lake COMs Three more Apollo Lake COMs support Qseven and COM Express (advertise here) PLEASE COMMENT BELOW Please comment here...

Intel’s diversity efforts are somewhat paying off Posted Feb 28, 2017 by Megan Rose Dickey (@meganrosedickey) 0 SHARES Next Story Google’s note-taking app Keep joins G Suite, now integrates with Google Docs It became clear in last year’s mid-year diversity report that Intel had a leaky bucket, meaning that even though it had increased the number of underrepresented minorities it was bringing in, its overall minority representation was on the decline. Based on Intel’s latest diversity report, it seems the company is moving in the right direction when it comes to retention of diverse employees. Overall, Intel hit its goal retaining diverse employees, with a 15 percent exit rate for women and people of color compared to a 15.5 percent exit rate for employees in majority groups (white people, Asian people and men). Last year, 14.2 percent of Intel’s new hires were from an underrepresented minority group, which led to an increase of people of color representation from 12.3 percent during the middle of 2016 to 12.5 percent by the end of the year. It’s also an overall increase from Intel’s 2015 representation of people of color (12.4 percent). The exit rate for people of color was slightly higher than their majority colleagues — 15.5 percent for underrepresented minorities compared to 15.3 percent for white and Asian employees. Retention for black employees, however, was slightly better, with an exit rate of 15.2 percent. Regarding the Hispanic/Latinx employee population at Intel, representation of Latinx people dropped from 8.4 percent in 2015 to 8.2 percent by the end of 2016. But Intel says it’s because of a reclassification of race and the addition of a “two races or more” category. The Latinx exit rate at Intel was 15.5 percent, which means a worse retention rate for Latinx employees than black, Asian and white employees. But it wasn’t as bad as the retention rate for Native Americans, which had an exit rate of 17.3 percent. So, Intel is (somewhat surprisingly) best at retaining black people and the worst at retaining Native American employees. In general, Intel retains women at a higher rate than men. In 2016, the exit rate for women at Intel was 15 percent while the exit rate for men was 15.4 percent. It’s not clear why Intel is better at retaining some groups more than others. Across the board, exit rates drastically increased last year compared to the year before, in part because of layoffs. intel retention race intel retention gender  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit This is not the first time Intel has reported retention data, but it is the first time it’s reported retention data specific to underrepresented minorities in its main report, rather than just in the addendum. It’s also worth noting that the data from previous addendums were not relative to each respective race’s size at the company. Related Articles Uber female engineers to Travis: 'there's a systemic problem with sexism here' Twitter's head of diversity is leaving and its chief HR officer has already left Snap says "diversity is about more than numbers" Last year, Intel tried a couple of new things to improve retention. For one, it implemented WarmLine, a service to provide support and guidance to people thinking about leaving the company. Since its launch in Spring 2016, 1,200 people used the service. Intel also did a retention survey around underrepresented minorities. Details of the study’s results were scarce, but Intel Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer Danielle Brown (pictured above on left) wrote in the diversity report that it “provided us a thorough look into the challenges our employees of color face.” The next step is to create “Tailored playbooks” to improve representation of diverse people at the company, as well as inclusion. “Our aim is to engage business leaders and managers in diversity and inclusion efforts more directly so that we can collectively work toward meeting hiring, retention, and progression goals,” Brown wrote. Overall, Intel exceeded its 2016 hiring goals, with 45.1 percent of its new hires coming from an underrepresented group. At the leadership level, female representation grew from 17.6 percent in 2015 to 18.4 percent by the end of last year. Underrepresented minority representation at the leadership level also increased, from 6.3 percent in 2015 to 7.1 percent at the end of 2016, with each respective group seeing increases (representation of black employees went from 2.3 percent to 2.5 percent, Latinx employee representation grew from 3.8 percent to 4 percent and Native American representation increased from 0.3 percent to 0.5 percent). Moving forward, Brown says Intel will address intersectionality, “starting with a focused and targeted strategy around improving the retention and progression of Intel’s women of color.” intel diversity 2017 intel diversity 2017  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Intel Founded 1968 Overview Intel designs, manufactures, and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide.

BUSINESS Foxconn's broken pledges cast doubt on Trump jobs plan Promised jobs Mark Makela / For the Washington Post Old cars are parked across the street from the Foxconn office in Harrisburg, Pa. Old cars are parked across the street from the Foxconn office in Harrisburg, Pa. (Mark Makela / For the Washington Post) Todd C. Frankel For some residents of this small city, there was something familiar about Foxconn's recently announced plan to hire up to 50,000 U.S. workers, one of the many hiring pledges from companies rounded up by President Trump in the first weeks of his administration. The only difference was the scale. In 2013, Foxconn's chairman sent a jolt through this state capital when he said his company — best known for making Apple iPhones in China — would invest $30 million and hire 500 workers for a new high-tech factory in central Pennsylvania. Locals were giddy. Foxconn had a small office here, but this seemed like the start of an entire new industry. Pennsylvania's governor boasted about the deal. The Brookings Institution think tank hailed Foxconn's decision as a sign of U.S. manufacturing's strength. But the factory was never built. The jobs never came. "It just seemed to fade to black" after the announcement, recalled a local official. It was the start of a mystery, created by a chief executive known to promise projects all over the world that never quite pan out. Yet few people seem to notice.

What happened in Harrisburg provides a skeptical lens for viewing the waves of corporate investment promises being used by Trump as evidence that he is following through on his campaign pledge to reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing. "I'm delivering on everything we promised," Trump said Thursday during a meeting with manufacturing executives at the White House, noting how firms have announced new hiring and factories. "People are saying they've never seen so much happen in 30 days of a presidency." Foxconn, for example, announced shortly after Trump's election that it plans to invest $7 billion and hire up to 50,000 workers in the United States. Such a hiring spree would catapult Foxconn from a couple thousand U.S. workers to a major employer on par with Chrysler. Other companies, including SoftBank, Alibaba, Intel and IBM, have also made an unusual display of loudly announcing their intentions to invest in the United States — all with price tags in the billions of dollars and the promise of tens of thousands of jobs — much to Trump's delight. But, as Harrisburg learned, the gulf between these eye-popping announcements and what takes place on the ground can be huge. "They are scrambling to look good," said Mark Selden, senior research associate at Cornell University's East Asian program. "It's a sign of the pressure that Trump is placing on everyone in the world to deliver on his agenda." Companies tend to view these announcements as an opening bid in a negotiation, said Alberto Moel, a senior analyst with Bernstein Research in Hong Kong. Firms know politicians like the splashy headlines. And if everything falls into place — the business climate improves, they extract enough concessions such as tax breaks and free land — they might be able to make it happen. "It actually puts the onus on the U.S. in a way," Moel said. "They are saying: 'I'm along for the ride. Here's my proposal.'" If the deal falls apart, as it often does, no one is going to talk about it. "The government themselves aren't going to remind you of that, Trump has no intention of helping you remember that," Moel said. "What's the downside?" Trump is far from alone in using corporate announcements as political backdrops. It's why ribbon-cuttings and ceremonial shovels exist. In 2012, President Obama visited a new $5-billion Intel computer chip plant in Chandler, Ariz., citing it as "an example of an America that is within our reach." But the facility, known as Fab 42, was never completed. Last week, Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich stood in the Oval Office with Trump to announce a $7-billion investment — essentially, Fab 42 was back on track, with a new price tag and a new president. Trump tweeted his praise. Two days after Trump's inauguration, Foxconn Chief Executive Terry Gou told reporters in Taiwan that his company planned to spend $7 billion on a U.S. factory to make computer displays. It wasn't iPhones — which Trump has said he wants to be "Made in the USA" — but Gou said the factory could create 30,000 to 50,000 U.S. jobs. Foxconn said in a statement that it is "exploring a potential investment that would represent an expansion of our current U.S. operations." But the company could not confirm "the number of jobs that might be created." Foxconn is a coveted hardware manufacturer because of its size. Last year, it reported $136 billion in revenue. It has more than 1 million employees, mostly in China. A single factory making iPhones or LCD screens can employ tens of thousands of workers. Gou, Foxconn's founder, for years has described the United States as a "must-go market." In 2014, as the Pennsylvania deal was quietly dying, Gou teased the opening of a LCD display factory in the U.S. His company talked with officials in Colorado and Arizona. Nothing happened. That same year, the company signed a letter of intent to invest up to $1 billion in Indonesia. That investment still has not occurred. Foxconn said it would invest $5 billion over five years in India as part of an ambitious expansion in 2014. The deal would create up to 50,000 jobs, Gou said. But Foxconn's investment in India has amounted to only a small fraction of what it originally promised. Similar results were seen in Vietnam, where Foxconn committed to a $5-billion investment in 2007, and in Brazil, where Foxconn spoke of a $10-billion plan in 2011. The company made its first major foray in Vietnam only last year. In Brazil, Foxconn has an iPhone factory, but its investment has fallen far short of expectations. "There's a pattern here," said Moel, the analyst. Gou's plans for Harrisburg were revealed in 2013 while he was in the United States on a tour with other Taiwanese business officials to, in part, drum up support for Taiwan's bid to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership, known as TPP. (Coincidentally, Trump pulled the United States out of the trade treaty in his first days in office.) It was a surprise when Gou said Foxconn planned to invest $30 million over two years in a factory to make technology equipment and servers. Gou noted his company's history in Harrisburg. He said the goal was to create "high-precision, high-tech, high-value-added manufacturing in the U.S." Gou also said Foxconn would donate $10 million to Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh for robotics research. "IPhone maker Foxconn to invest $40 million in the US," wrote the China Post. "Foxconn to build plant in Pennsylvania," CNN said. Local media quoted state officials as saying Gou would sign a memorandum of understanding and that the company was busy scouting sites. "There was this intense buzz," recalled David Black, president of the Harrisburg Regional Chamber. "Lots of us were excited by the opportunity," said Bub Manning, who at the time co-owned a local construction firm. "Anytime something of that size comes along in central Pennsylvania, that's a big deal." For years, Foxconn has maintained an office with about 50 workers in Harrisburg, a hub of the computer connector industry. The office is in an old brick warehouse. On a recent visit, the building was filled by a half-empty warren of cubicles. A worker declined to comment to a reporter with the Washington Post. According to local government officials, Foxconn has not done any permitted alterations to the building in 15 years. Manning recalled how his firm tried to chase down information about the planned $30-million factory. "It felt like I was grabbing Jell-O. It never got any traction," Manning said. The $30-million factory faded from view. Foxconn said its $10-million donation to Carnegie Mellon was "moving forward very successfully," with half of the funds having been spent four years later. The school declined to comment. None of this has stopped the praise for Foxconn's investment in Pennsylvania. Recent stories have referred to the phantom factory as a sign of Foxconn's U.S. beachhead. A state economic development official wrote about Foxconn's $30-million factory as evidence of foreign companies that operate in the Keystone State. (The piece was fixed after the Washington Post inquired about it.) State officials toured potential sites with Foxconn representatives, the state Department of Community and Economic Development said in a statement, but "[u]nfortunately, a project did not come to fruition." Foxconn attributed the failure to "material changes to the business and operating climate at that time." "The proof is always in the pudding," said Scott Andes, a senior policy analyst at Brookings. The assumption is that companies follow through on major announcements. "But it is important to be skeptical," Andes said. "I would hope it's not just smoke and mirrors with Foxconn or any other of these companies." Todd C.

Search giant wrongly said shop closed down, refused to list the truth More like this Intel Netgear Personal Tech Intel's dying Atom chips strike again: Netgear recalls four ReadyNAS, Wi-Fi management lines Hardware maker offers to replace or repair at-risk kit 3 Mar 2017 at 22:05, Thomas Claburn Netgear on Thursday said that four of its product lines may experience "higher-than-normal failure rates" and that it is contacting affected customers to assess whether replacement or repair is appropriate. "While this situation is not an immediate cause for concern about the operation of any of these models, we understand that customers might have questions," the company said in a statement. "We will be reaching out to all registered customers of the affected models over the next several months to determine the appropriate actions for their situations." The four product lines – ReadyNAS devices RN3130 and RN3138, and Wi-Fi managers WC7500 and WC7600v2 – happen to have a common component, Intel's Atom C2000 line of chips, which Intel has acknowledged had problems until recently. As many as 16 specific models in this group of four lines may be affected. Intel's chip errata, published in January, identified the B0 stepping of Atoms in the C2000 range as having faulty clock outputs that fail far sooner than they should. When that happens, affected devices will no longer boot. The shoddy chips started shipping in 2013 and continued to be sold until late last year. Intel has refused to disclose how much subpar silicon it has sold. Asked whether Intel's flawed chip was to blame, a Netgear spokesperson told The Register, "We're not naming the vendor but it sounds as if you've done your research." An industry source who spoke to The Register about this issue last month said Intel's customers may be bound by nondisclosure agreements for issues related to Intel technology. Netgear's spokesperson declined to provide the number of affected units, but allowed that the outreach effort to contact customers "is pretty big." Intel's CFO earlier this year indicated that the company had set aside funds to deal with the financial fallout, which presumably involves subsidizing replacement or repair costs incurred by its customers. In a statement emailed to The Register, Richard Jonker, VP of SMB product line management for Netgear, said: "Netgear is taking full responsibility for this component supplier concern and we can state at this time that we are issuing a full-scale recall for the affected products. We will be contacting all registered owners of these products and providing a swap where they will receive a new product and the affected product will be returned to Netgear." Jonker said Netgear takes pride in its supplier relationships and is working with them to provide the best experience for customers. He said the company intends to stand by its warranties and will endeavor to minimize the impact on customers. Other vendors and service providers that have used Intel's Atom C2000 chips and appear to have been affected include: Aaeon, ASRock Rack, Checkpoint, Cisco, Dell, Fortinet, HP, Infortrend, iXsystems, Online/Scaleway, Lanner, NEC, Newisys, Netgate, Quanta, Seagate, Sophos, Supermicro, Synology, and ZNYX Networks. ® Tips and corrections 24 Comments More from The Register Intel reveals Optane will need a 7th-gen core and a PC-centric launch You're going to need a whole lot of Intel Inside to make this work 16 Comments Regular or premium?

Twitter Facebook IoT and 5G are driving computing to the edge More computing is happening on edge devices to handle the information overload Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 04 March, 2017 08:27 - - - - print email Comments By 2020, an average internet user will use 1.5GB of traffic a day, and daily video traffic will reach 1PB, Intel predicts. A huge amount of data will be generated by autonomous vehicles, mobile devices, and internet-of-things devices. Every day, more information is being collected and sent to faster servers in mega data centers, which analyze and make sense of it. That analysis has helped improved image and speech recognition and is making autonomous cars a reality. Emerging superfast data networks like 5G -- a melting pot of wireless technologies -- will dispatch even more gathered information, which could stress data centers. Servers are already being redesigned to handle more data, and throughput technologies like Gen-Z and fiber optics will reduce latency. At Mobile World Congress this week, computing on the edge was a big topic among infrastructure providers. Edge computing involves light processing on intermediary servers or on the edge of the networks. This type of computing can lead to faster responses for mobile services, without putting stress on servers in the core network. Edge computing can also provide instant analytics to ensure the junk information is discarded and only useful information reaches servers on the core network. Edge computing is also emerging for virtualization, which slices loads of data in smaller packages rerouted to the right servers to be handled. At MWC, many companies showed products and shared new ideas for computing on the edge. Most vendors had a common goal: to better control the flow and make better sense of data, especially with more data being collected by IoT devices. Hewlett Packard Enterprise showed off its latest generation of IoT servers called Edgeline, similar to the company's Proliant servers but slimmed down. The servers sit on the edge and are able to analyze data before sending them to core servers in data centers. The servers can virtualize data packets on the edge, which then makes better use of computing resources. For example, the Edgeline servers can handle mobile computing tasks, like responding to Facebook posts or search requests, on the edge. More intense data tasks, like image recognition, can be routed back to the centralized data center network, which handles machine learning tasks. Nearby, Dell was showing off its Edge Gateway 3000 servers for multiple IoT applications. The servers can analyze data at the point of collection and dispatch them to the data center. These servers use Intel's latest Atom chips, which have up to 16 cores. The Model 3001 is targeted toward industrial automation and energy management; the Model 3002 is aimed at transportation and logistics and fits into large vehicles like trucks; and the Model 3003 is designed for video streaming and point-of-sale applications. The servers use new Xeon-D or Atom chips from Intel, which were shown by the chipmaker on the floor of the show. The chips are targeted at edge servers and networking gear. These chips are not as powerful as the Xeon E5 chips used in mainstream servers in data centers. Ubuntu showed off some Open Compute Project network router designs with edge processing. The routers ran Ubuntu Snappy Core and can run software for edge processing. These routers are servers in their own right and reduce the load on high-end servers. Ubuntu "snaps" -- which are like apps -- can be tuned for specific edge processing tasks. More information about new edge router designs will be shared at Open Compute Project Summit next week. Another interesting demo at the Ubuntu booth showed an ARM server doing edge processing for 5G networks. The ARM servers had 64-bit Cavium ThunderX2 chips that are already being used in networking gear but also could double up as low-power server chips for more powerful edge processing. Powerful CPUs aren't needed for edge processing, but chips need to able to collate large datasets and ensure they are virtualized and redirected properly. ARM servers chips can virtualize data with the ARMv8 64-bit architecture, which has been adopted by chipmakers like Cavium. Edge processing will be important for autonomous cars as well. The ultimate vision is that autonomous cars will be able to connect to superfast servers in the cloud to recognize images, draw up maps, and make better driving decisions. But those connections may not always be possible, which is where edge processing on the autonomous car will step in. Intel and Qualcomm are providing unique circuitry for handling edge processing in autonomous vehicles. Intel is pushing FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays) into autonomous vehicles to handle specific tasks, while Qualcomm is relying on digital signal processors. FPGAs and other components are key components for autonomous cars and a flexible 5G infrastructure, said Venkata Renduchintala, president of the Intel Client and Internet of Things businesses and the Systems Architecture Group. Edge processing is also becoming a priority for telecom providers, which are looking for ways to add flexibility to the services they provide to customers. For example, SK Telecom -- which is testing 5G rollouts in South Korea -- found edge processing valuable in virtualizing its data and radio networks. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

For example, SK Telecom -- which is testing 5G rollouts in South Korea -- found edge processing valuable in virtualizing its data and radio networks.

Tech Industry by Erin Carson March 2, 2017 1:11 PM PST @erincarson Gavin Grimm has a lot of support from Silicon Valley. The Washington Post/Getty Images Tech is throwing its support behind transgender rights in connection with an upcoming US Supreme Court case. The Human Rights Campaign said Thursday that 53 companies signed an amicus brief in support of Gavin Grimm, a transgender boy from Virginia, who sued his school board in Gloucester County over the right to use the bathroom that aligns with his gender identity. More than half the companies that signed the brief are tech companies, including Apple, Microsoft, eBay, IBM, Intel, Twitter and Yahoo. "Across the country, corporate leaders are speaking out because they know attacking transgender youth isn't just shameful -- it also puts the families of their employees and customers at risk," said Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin, in a statement. Chipmaker Intel wrote a blog post in addition to signing the brief, saying, "Intel signed this amicus brief to stand with our LGBTQ colleagues, customers, communities, suppliers and partners, and we firmly believe that equality for LGBTQ individuals is a civil right." Several of the companies that signed the brief didn't immediately respond to a request for comment or said they had nothing to add beyond the brief. Tech has become increasingly involved with social issues. In the past several years, companies like Google, Facebook and Apple have released diversity reports and adopted policies and practices to become less homogenous. Companies also spoke out against President Donald Trump's January executive order on immigration. The topic of who can use which bathroom has been hotly debated. In February, Trump reversed policies former President Barack Obama made in 2016 to let transgender public school students use bathrooms matching their gender identity. A number of tech companies spoke out at the time. Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter and Square, tweeted, "Rolling back rights for transgender students is wrong. Twitter and Square stand with the LGBTQ community, always." IBM stated at the time of the policy reversal: "IBM has had an explicit policy of non-discrimination based on gender identity or expression since 2002, and we are opposed to discrimination in all its forms, including any policies that discriminate based on gender identity in education." This isn't the first time tech has weighed in on transgender issues. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff was a vocal opponent of North Carolina's law requiring transgender people to use bathrooms based on their gender at birth. PayPal protested by nixing plans last year to expand in Charlotte, North Carolina, and companies like IBM, Microsoft, Cisco and eBay signed an amicus brief in 2016 supporting the Justice Department's effort to block the so-called "bathroom bill." "Every child deserves an opportunity to succeed free of fear, anxiety, and threats of discrimination. Salesforce strongly believes that all students, including transgender students, should be treated as equals, and we disagree with any effort to limit their rights. Equality for all," Salesforce said in a statement regarding Thursday's brief. That brief will be submitted with Grimm's case, which is expected go before the Supreme Court on March 28.

Intel is Trying to Manipulate AMD Ryzen Launch? by Hilbert Hagedoorn on: 02/27/2017 10:07 AM | Source | 128 comment(s) Yesterday in the forums somebody asked if we received Intel review guidelines from Intel for the Ryzen review as well. A very curious question, I answered no. And if they did we simply never use them as we do things our own way (as we always do). They question itself was already curious but if we dive deeper into the story we see the claims have been made by Semi-Accurate, not the most unbiased source. Then again, we see no reason for them to make this stuff up. Also some other press apparently received that email. So yes, as it seems Intel has been reaching out to certain media in shameless attempt to influence upcoming benchmark scores in their favor. Intel's PR department is contacting media and calling in favors with the press by issuing them  "guidelines" on how to review AMD Ryzen. Intel's PR emails include this line: "call us before you write."  This is the story of the day for sure. It is going to be a rough week for Intel, that's for sure. But if true, come on Intel, really?

Sites doing this favor to intel may as well "close the shop". Because this launch is very important for everyone and people will know truth soon enough. @HH: I am not sure what set of tests you are doing with Ryzen, but would be lovely if we had geekbench included and we could see effect of different DDR4 speeds too. It is very easy to compare different types of workloads. As some people need something particular and others are looking for different instructions.

It's not a hardware limitation, it's just because AMD's focus has been on performance and not overclocked memory compatibility. The benefits from the focus on performance outweighed the potential performance increase of focussing on high speed RAM compatibility. Apparently within a month or so there will be new microcode available, it will then be up the the manufacturer to update the relevant bios. Enthusiasts can update the microcode and other modules manually, but hopefully they won't be slack. So far it may mean that you are limited to mid DDR4-2xxx speeds, after the microcode update supposedly you could use speeds up to mid DDR4-3xxx and probably higher. It would be good therefore that after the microcode is released and bios is available that a comparative review is done between say, DDR4-2400 on the new bios and the review system, everything else the same, and then the benefit of DDR4-3200 and higher on the new bios.

Higher RAM speeds seldom yield much benefit, inside the type of RAM used (there's generally been benefits to increasin from type to type, though ddr3->4 showed kind of meh gains for performance). Some tasks are boosted by it, but usualy not much.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > AMD: Ryzen CPU gaming performance inhibited by… AMD: Ryzen CPU gaming performance inhibited by lack of optimization By Jon Martindale — March 3, 2017 9:53 AM Subscribe Share Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Get our daily Tech News recap Mentioned here AMD Ryzen 7 1800X MSRP $499.99 DT Recommended Product Learn More Why it matters to you If the slightly weaker Ryzen gaming performance has put you off AMD's new chips, it could just be a lack of optimization holding them back so far. AMD has responded to the reviewers’ concerns that the new Ryzen CPUs, specifically the top-of-the-line Ryzen 7 1800X, underperform in gaming tests — especially at 1080p. It claims that the reason AMD’s new flagship hardware didn’t quite match up to Intel in gaming performance was due to a lack of optimization on the software end of things. AMD’s new Ryzen CPUs are absolute powerhouses when it comes to multi-threaded support. In many scenarios where it can leverage its many cores and threads, the 1800X can keep pace with Intel CPUs which cost almost three times as much. The single-core performance wasn’t quite as impressive however and gaming specifically seemed to take a hit with the new architecture. AMD claims that is all going to change in the near future, though. “CPU benchmarking deficits to the competition in certain games at 1080p resolution can be attributed to the development and optimization of the game uniquely to Intel platforms — until now,” AMD’s Corporate Vice President of Marketing John Taylor said in a statement to PC Perspective. More: Upcoming AMD Ryzen 7 1800X CPU achieves new Cinebench world record He added that AMD’s Ryzen CPUs were still excellent for gaming and that even without those optimizations in place, it offers “smooth frame rates and great experiences in GPU bound gaming.” Moving forward, though, he said that AMD provided more than 300 developers with Ryzen devkit hardware and that by the end of 2017, more than 1,000 developers will have AMD hardware to optimize their games. He also highlighted how developers like Oxide Games and Creative Assembly had individually released statements pointing out that optimizations to their engines have yielded “significant performance uplifts” when running on new Ryzen hardware. Although it’s arguable that new hardware can be optimized for specific games — AMD and Nvidia routinely do this with new graphics driver releases — it’s harder to tell how accurate it is to suggest Intel has had more optimization focus from developers over the years. True, its processors have for the past decade been considered the best choice for gamers, but that is not to say there are no AMD CPU gamers out there. On the other hand, Zen is a brand new architecture, AMD’s first for a long time. Games, too, are rarely optimized for a large number of cores and threads and we have seen results that suggest turning off AMD’s simultaneous multithreading (SMT) does have a noticeable effect on performance, according to Hexus. With that in mind, Taylor’s argument is a plausible one, but not one that we can exactly prove either way. The proof will likely be in the CPU pudding. If we see significant improvements in Ryzen gaming performance in the months to come, we’ll know what was holding it back. As new games appear with more of a lead-in time with Ryzen hardware, we could see the chips perform far better than they do now.

Foxconn said it would build a $30 million factory here in 2013, but t never happened. by Todd C. Frankel, Washington Post Close icon Todd C. Frankel Washington Post HARRISBURG — For some residents of this small city, there was something familiar about Foxconn's recently announced plan to hire up to 50,000 U.S. workers, one of the many hiring pledges from companies rounded up by President Trump in the first weeks of his administration. Related Coverage Pence jokes with 'enemy of the people' at Gridiron Dinner White House aides defend Trump's wiretapping claim Afghan family detained in Los Angeles are asking for release The only difference was the scale. In 2013, Foxconn's chairman sent a jolt through this state capital when he said his company — best known for making Apple iPhones in China — would invest $30 million and hire 500 workers for a new high-tech factory in central Pennsylvania. Locals were giddy. Foxconn had a small office here, but this seemed like the start of an entire new industry. Pennsylvania's governor boasted about the deal. The Brookings Institution think tank hailed Foxconn's decision as a sign of U.S. manufacturing's strength. But the factory was never built. The jobs never came. "It just seemed to fade to black" after the announcement, recalled a local official. It was the start of a mystery, created by a chief executive known to promise projects all over the world that never quite pan out. Yet few people seem to notice. Foxconn and others continue to get credit for deals that never take place. In December, Pennsylvania's economic development staff was still touting the $30 million factory that never was. What happened in Harrisburg provides a skeptical lens for viewing the waves of corporate investment promises being used by Trump as evidence that he is following through on his campaign pledge to reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing. "I'm delivering on everything we promised," Trump said Thursday during a meeting with manufacturing executives at the White House, noting how firms have announced new hiring and factories. "People are saying they've never seen so much happen in 30 days of a presidency." Foxconn, for example, announced shortly after Trump's election that it plans to invest $7 billion and hire up to 50,000 workers in the United States. Such a hiring spree would catapult Foxconn from a couple thousand U.S. workers to a major employer on par with Chrysler. Other companies, too, including SoftBank, Alibaba, Intel and IBM, have made an unusual display of loudly announcing their intentions to invest in the United States — all with price tags in the billions of dollars and the promise of tens of thousands of jobs — much to Trump's delight.  MARK MAKELA / For the Washington Post David Black, head of the Harrisburg Regional Chamber of Commerce said FoxConn’s earlier promise to build a plant created “intense buzz” in the town.  "Foxconn is going to spend a tremendous amount of money on building a massive plant," Trump said the day after the investment was revealed, "and probably more than one." But, as Harrisburg learned, the gulf between these eye-popping announcements and what takes place on the ground can be huge — and frequently overlooked. "They are scrambling to look good," Mark Selden, senior research associate at Cornell University's East Asian program, said. "It's a sign of the pressure that Trump is placing on everyone in the world to deliver on his agenda." Companies tend to view these announcements as an opening bid in a negotiation, said Alberto Moel, a senior analyst with Bernstein Research in Hong Kong. Firms know politicians like the splashy headlines. And if everything falls into place — the business climate improves, they extract enough concessions such as tax breaks and free land — they might be able to make it happen. "It actually puts the onus on the U.S. in a way," Moel said. "They are saying: 'I'm along for the ride. Here's my proposal.' " If the deal falls apart, as it often does, no one is going to talk about it. "The government themselves aren't going to remind you of that, Trump has no intention of helping you remember that," Moel said. "What's the downside?" Trump is far from alone in using corporate announcements as political backdrops. It's why ribbon-cuttings and ceremonial shovels exist. In 2012, former President Barack Obama visited a new $5 billion Intel computer chip plant in Chandler, Arizona, citing it as "an example of an America that is within our reach." But the facility, known as Fab 42, was never completed. Last week, Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich stood in the Oval Office with Trump to announce a $7 billion investment — essentially, Fab 42 was back on track, with a new price tag and a new president. Trump tweeted his praise. Even before he was sworn in, it was clear Trump placed greater importance on these job announcements than past administrations. Among the first signs came in December when Tokyo-based SoftBank's chief executive, Masayoshi Son, stood with the president-elect to announce a plan to invest $50 billion and create 50,000 new U.S. jobs. Two days after Trump's inauguration, Foxconn chief executive Terry Gou told reporters in Taiwan that his company planned to spend $7 billion on a U.S. factory to make computer displays. It wasn't iPhones — which Trump has said he wants to be "Made in the USA" — but Gou said the factory could create 30,000 to 50,000 U.S. jobs. Details were few, but one clue seized on was the presence of a Pennsylvania state trade representative at Gou's talk. Foxconn said in a statement that it is "exploring a potential investment that would represent an expansion of our current U.S. operations." But the company could not confirm "the number of jobs that might be created." Foxconn is a coveted hardware manufacturer because of its size. Last year, it reported $136 billion in revenue. It has more than 1 million employees, mostly in China. A single factory making iPhones or LCD screens can employ tens of thousands of workers. When Foxconn says it will invest in a new plant, the decision can transform a region. That's why countries all over the world are eager to lure Foxconn to their shores. Gou, Foxconn's founder, for years has described the United States as a "must-go market." In 2014, as the Pennsylvania deal was quietly dying, Gou teased the opening of a LCD display factory in the states. His company talked with officials in Colorado and Arizona. Nothing happened. That same year, the company signed a letter of intent to invest up to $1 billion in Indonesia. That investment still has not occurred. Foxconn said it would invest $5 billion over five years in India as part of an ambitious expansion in 2014. The deal would create up to 50,000 jobs, Gou said. But Foxconn's investment in India has amounted to only a small fraction of what it originally promised. Similar results were seen in Vietnam, where Foxconn committed to a $5 billion investment in 2007, and in Brazil, where Foxconn spoke of a $10 billion plan in 2011. The company made its first major foray in Vietnam only last year. In Brazil, Foxconn has an iPhone factory, but its investment has fallen far short of expectations. "There's a pattern here," said Moel, the analyst. Gou's plans for Harrisburg were revealed in 2013 while he was in the United States on a tour with other Taiwanese business officials to, in part, drum up support for Taiwan's bid to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership, known as TPP. (Coincidentally, Trump pulled the United States out of the trade treaty in his first days in office.) It was a surprise when Gou said Foxconn planned to invest $30 million over two years in a factory to make technology equipment and servers. Gou noted his company's history in Harrisburg. He said the goal was to create "high-precision, high-tech, high value-added manufacturing in the U.S." Gou also said Foxconn would donate $10 million to Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh for robotics research. "IPhone maker Foxconn to invest $40 million in the US," wrote the China Post. "Foxconn to build plant in Pennsylvania," CNN said. Local media quoted state officials as saying Gou would sign a memorandum of understanding and the company was busy scouting sites. "There was this intense buzz," recalled David Black, president of the Harrisburg Regional Chamber. "Lots of us were excited by the opportunity," said Bub Manning, who at the time co-owned a local construction firm. "Anytime something of that size comes along in central Pennsylvania, that's a big deal." For years, Foxconn has maintained an office with about 50 workers in Harrisburg, a hub of the computer connector industry. The office is in an old brick warehouse. On a recent visit, the building was filled by a half-empty warren of cubicles. A worker declined to comment to a reporter with the Washington Post. According to local government officials, Foxconn has not done any permitted alterations to the building in 15 years. Manning recalled how his firm tried to chase down information about the planned $30 million factory. "It felt like I was grabbing Jell-O. It never got any traction," Manning said. The $30 million factory faded from view. Foxconn said its $10 million donation to Carnegie Mellon was "moving forward very successfully," with half of the funds having been spent four years later. The school declined to comment. None of this has stopped the praise for Foxconn's investment in Pennsylvania. Recent stories have referred to the phantom factory as a sign of Foxconn's U.S. beachhead. A state economic development official wrote about Foxconn's $30 million factory as evidence of foreign companies that operate in the Keystone State. (The piece was fixed after the Washington Post inquired about it.) State officials toured potential sites with Foxconn representatives, the state Department of Community and Economic Development said in a statement. "Unfortunately, a project did not come to fruition." Foxconn attributed the failure to "material changes to the business and operating climate at that time." "The proof is always in the pudding," said Scott Andes, a senior policy analyst at Brookings. The assumption is that companies follow through on major announcements. "But it is important to be skeptical," Andes said. "I would hope it's not just smoke and mirrors with Foxconn or any other of these companies." Feeling burned by the fate of the $30 million factory, some in Harrisburg are cautious about getting their hopes up again. "We learned something from that," said Black of the Harrisburg chamber. But, Manning said, it would be hard to not be seduced by the size of Foxconn's ambition, real or not. "If you smelled a project like that," he said, "you'd get excited even though you know better."

HUGE Exclusive Interview With DHS Insider!  Posted on February 16, 2017 by Admininstrator http://victuruslibertas.com/2017/02/exclusive_interview_with_dhs_insider/ VL has been fortunate enough to work with some awesome people! We have loyal and awakened followers who help bring us information, and we also have trusted insiders, whistleblowers and leakers who trust us enough to give us information, too. Today, we have an exclusive interview with a special DHS insider who has answered some critical questions we have on PizzaGate. Our insider prefers to call it PedoGate and what he told us blew our minds. We are so fortunate that members of the Intel community like our work and feel they can trust us. We have been trying to get to the bottom of PizzaGate for months and the answers we got from our DHS insider stunned and shocked us. Here we go! Q. So, in the Intelligence community, how chaotic is the atmosphere now? A. In my 34 years of Governmental service, I have never seen anything like it.  It’s the bifurcation of the entire intelligence apparatus. Q. It seems the intel community has it in for Trump – is this your feeling? A. There are many Trump supporters within the FBI.  (The CIA, however,  is against Trump because Trump threatens to ruin their game in the middle east.) Q. Can you elaborate? A. CIA and Mossad work in tandem with British intel.  The goal for the CIA was to replace Assad with a puppet and to topple Iran so we could access their oil.  Israel works closely with it’s “sister”, Saudi Arabia, to help this dark cause. Q.  So it seems like the intel community has it in for Trump. How can he protect himself? A. Trump has a tremendous opportunity here, but needs to circle wagons. The travel ban included 7 countries chosen by both Jared Kushner and Rudy. Why did it not include Saudi Arabia, or Pakistan, or Turkey or other countries that hate us? The seven nations mentioned were chosen by Israel, that’s why. And the unspoken alliance of Israel and Saudi Arabia should be exposed. They are brother and sister. Jared Kushner needs to be careful with what he says and to whom. But, the biggest thing Trump can do is expose PedoGate via Sessions. Big names will go down hard, and it gets the blood suckers drained from the swamp. There are as many pedophiles on the Republican side as there is with democrats, but Trump is in a unique position to truly “clean up Dodge”, so to speak. I can tell you that what is in Anthony Weiner’s hard drive, and what videos exist via Jeffery Epstein, WILL BRING massive arrests – in time. Trump’s legacy could be truly great if he was to purge the CIA, stop the extortion, prosecute the pedophiles and reinstate the death penalty for pedo’s convicted a second time.  Pedogate is his path to greatness. Q. How does Russia fit into all this? A.  The CIA and Israel are responsible for the creation of Isis. Isis was created specifically to weaken Iran and destabilize Syria. It worked for awhile until Putin shored up Assad and bolstered Iranian Qud forces. The real reason you see such anti-Russian fever from both Schumer and McCain, Graham and Feinstein, is because the operation has blown up in our faces. Q. Is Israel behind the anti Russian sentiment? A. Yes. Israeli intelligence is furious with Trump, and will do anything to keep Trump from working with Putin.  Understand that if Trump and Putin work together to defeat Isis, they are actually defeating a CIA/Mossad creation, and furthermore, Syria and Iran grow stronger, which the Saudis and the Israeli’s fear. Their goal was to divide Syria and ultimately destroy Iran’s regime. It is not just an oil grab, but a much bigger attempt at moving the chess pieces to allow Israel and Saudi Arabia to dominate the entire Middle East. Q. So they demonize Putin and try to tarnish the Trump administration? A. The Deep State is at war with both Trump and Putin. Understand that when Israeli intelligence hears “America first” from Trump, they go apeshit. Israel has bribed, extorted and intimidated our politicians for decades and suddenly this upstart billionaire threatens to ruin everything. Q. You mention the word extort. Does that relate to Pizzagate? A. PedoGate is only a modern term associated with a long history of Pedo-blackmail connected to both Israel and the Intel community. There is a full court press to stop PedoGate from being looked at because if people knew the true motives behind the pedophilia epidemic, they would do more than march on Washington. They could actually seed a revolution, with the spark coming from decent American parents who want to protect their kids. Our politicians are compromised. The senior analyst nicknamed “FBI Anon” alluded to this in his exchange with folks on 4chan and with you. Q. What do you mean compromised? A. Do you notice 2 central themes running through the MSM lately?  Those themes are “Fear the Russians” and “#PizzaGate is fake news“.  Both tropes come from the same place. Q. Can you explain? A. How do we exert power?  Via fear. Do you ever wonder why both Democrats and Republicans fall all over themselves to kiss up to Israel? Odd, since Israel is the size of Rhode Island… The fact is, many of our politicians – on both sides – have been compromised by CIA and Mossad for years. It’s actually not admiration they are expressing for Israel, but fear. Notice Lindsay Graham and Chuck Schumer repeating the same salute when it comes to Israel. How does that even happen? The American people are finally seeing that there is no two-party system, but one big shadow Government pretending we have political dichotomy. Q.  So PedoGate is real and “they” have to get Americans to disbelieve it? A. Let me explain how threatening PedoGate is… Who wins? Trump. Putin. Americans. Russians. The world…. Who loses? Israel, since they no longer can blackmail our politicians, the same goes for the CIA. The Shadow Government loses. But, the people win. Q. Can you give me specific instances of politicians being compromised by Israel? A. Sure. Lolita Island. Jeffery Epstein, a billionaire convicted of pedophilia received a soft sentence. His island was rigged with video recorders. Many politicians have been compromised. It was a Mossad/CIA operation. Contact ex-senior CIA CCS, Robert David Steele. Bob knows and has even spoken about this with numerous reporters. Q. So an ex-CIA senior agent named Robert Steele is on record saying Epstein’s island was a honey trap to lure our most powerful politicians into a extortion scheme? A. Yes. There are videos of some of the most powerful players in the most humiliating positions. If this gets out, not only are the politicians ruined, but the extortion game is over and suddenly, the influence CIA and Mossad wield over Washington, is gone. Q. Wow ! Now its all making sense. A. Yes. lets continue this conversation later. The interview resumes Q. So I checked out Robert David Steele, and he mentions Chuck Schumer being on Lolita Island. So does FBI anon. Is that why Schumer is targeting Trump’s cabinet picks? A. Connect the dots. Q. How many other politicians have been secretly extorted? A. One in three, roughly. It’s not just the Island, its all of their activities. The reason #Pedogate terrifies the media, the CIA, the Israel Lobby, is because they are all part of this “shadow swamp” Q. Former CIA agent, Robert Steele, says Mossad operated Lolita Island and CIA worked with them. That’s treason on all levels. A. Yes, and its espionage. Just as these leaks from the intel community regarding Flynn.  I expect that at some later moment, Trump will leak some of these videos Q. Wait. Trump has videos of politicians in ‘delicate” situations? A.  No, But the Intel community has them, and Trump has strong support among certain players in the community. Trump has said he wants to “throw a spotlight on the cockroaches”. Q. But Trump just met with Netanyahu and pledged the usual unbreakable bond with Israel. A. Theatre.  Netanyahu is desperate to both play Trump into attacking Syria,and hate Putin, and to convince him PedoGate is a conspiracy theory. Q. That is what Robert Steele says, as well. So, exposing the Pedophiles diminishes Israel’s influence in American politics and also changes the map in a critical mass way? A. The same media screaming “The Russians are coming” is the same media who says “Pizzagate is fake news” That’s CIA and Mossad talking points. Q. How do social media giants like Facebook and Google fit in? A. Facebook and CIA are literally the same petri-dish. Google became a Deep State organ courtesy of Eric Schmidt. Q. Getting back to the Pedo stuff, FBI anon said in July of last year, that the Clinton Foundation sold secrets to foreign nations. Did they also engage in PizzaGate? A. There are videos of WJC that would destroy him. FBI anon leaked weeks ago, on purpose. There was a reason. Q. Ok, FBI anon gave Schumers initials, and Barnet Frank and others, but so far we have only seen low level arrests. A . FBI anon did a “bank shot”. That’s a pool hall term we use. Ask Bob about it. FBI Anon rattled their cages as other DHS and local authorities rounded up all sorts of street-level human traffickers. The big arrests will come in time, but first the small fish are interrogated, and provide information that leads to larger fish. FBI Anon was firing a shot across the bow, much like you shake a beehive to infuriate the bees. Notice how blatantly hostile McCain, Schumer, Graham, and others are? It was what we call a “targeted trigger“. It worked. By long-kniving Flynn, they exposed their hand. Now, Trump has full executive powers to investigate the CIA and Mossad. Notice how there is sound and fury about “Russian influence” and utter silence on “Mossad” influence in our power structure? When FBI anon leaked in early July, the whole idea was to expose the Clinton Foundation,and to hint at the sale of “people” i.e. Pedogate. Look back at his exchange on 4chan. He is a gifted analyst, and knows just what stone to throw at Goliath’s noggin. By triggering the shadow Government, he helps citizen journalists ask the right questions and follow the right breadcrumbs, not the rabbit holes the Elite scum want you to follow. Now, PedoGate victims are speaking out on their experiences! You just had a story on some lady who went through having her family abused by California-Deep-State-sponsored terrorism. If folks knew that CPS in California is tied into a huge racket that kidnaps children from parents, they would realize just how sick this is. Foster homes, CPS, etc… all get paid well to jail parents and then snatch their kids away. These kids suffer abuse, and perpetuate the growing cancer called pedogate. Politicians who have pedophile tendencies are groomed for power, because they can be later extorted and controlled. Meanwhile, victims have no voice- until now. Suddenly, we have citizen journalism, and it will end up saving the people, in the end.  I have to go, but please contact Robert David Steele, the former CIA agent we discussed. I am sure he would appear on your channel. You are providing a real service to the people and we hope you will continue to speak up for the regular folks who are concerned, rightfully, as to the state of our nation.  Take care http://globalwarming-arclein.blogspot.ca/2017/03/the-pedophilia-problem.html Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News.

Ok, FBI anon gave Schumers initials, and Barnet Frank and others, but so far we have only seen low level arrests. A . FBI anon did a “bank shot”. That’s a pool hall term we use. Ask Bob about it. FBI Anon rattled their cages as other DHS and local authorities rounded up all sorts of street-level human traffickers. The big arrests will come in time, but first the small fish are interrogated, and provide information that leads to larger fish. FBI Anon was firing a shot across the bow, much like you shake a beehive to infuriate the bees. Notice how blatantly hostile McCain, Schumer, Graham, and others are? It was what we call a “targeted trigger“. It worked. By long-kniving Flynn, they exposed their hand. Now, Trump has full executive powers to investigate the CIA and Mossad. Notice how there is sound and fury about “Russian influence” and utter silence on “Mossad” influence in our power structure? When FBI anon leaked in early July, the whole idea was to expose the Clinton Foundation,and to hint at the sale of “people” i.e. Pedogate. Look back at his exchange on 4chan. He is a gifted analyst, and knows just what stone to throw at Goliath’s noggin. By triggering the shadow Government, he helps citizen journalists ask the right questions and follow the right breadcrumbs, not the rabbit holes the Elite scum want you to follow. Now, PedoGate victims are speaking out on their experiences! You just had a story on some lady who went through having her family abused by California-Deep-State-sponsored terrorism. If folks knew that CPS in California is tied into a huge racket that kidnaps children from parents, they would realize just how sick this is. Foster homes, CPS, etc… all get paid well to jail parents and then snatch their kids away. These kids suffer abuse, and perpetuate the growing cancer called pedogate. Politicians who have pedophile tendencies are groomed for power, because they can be later extorted and controlled. Meanwhile, victims have no voice- until now. Suddenly, we have citizen journalism, and it will end up saving the people, in the end.  I have to go, but please contact Robert David Steele, the former CIA agent we discussed. I am sure he would appear on your channel. You are providing a real service to the people and we hope you will continue to speak up for the regular folks who are concerned, rightfully, as to the state of our nation.  Take care http://globalwarming-arclein.blogspot.ca/2017/03/the-pedophilia-problem.html Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News.

Trump’s plan to increase defense spending by 10 percent would bring the Pentagon’s total budget up to $603 billion. The increase will be offset by equivalent cuts from other areas of the federal government’s discretionary budget, however, the cuts reportedly will not affect entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Making AMD great again! Home Hardware Hands on with AMD’s fab new Ryzen CPU By Jeremy Laird on March 2nd, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Rejoice, for AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is here. And it’s good. Thank science for that. Another dud from AMD didn’t bear thinking about. Instead, we get to ponder just how good Ryzen is and indeed how good it truly needs to be. It isn’t the very fastest CPU money can buy or the greatest gaming CPU ever. But that’s just dandy. It’s still going to blow the PC processor market wide open and force Intel to seriously up its game. If you want the background to AMD’s new chip and a broad overview on what makes it tick, head over here. The task this week is to get a quick feel for what Ryzen is actually like. The chip I’ve played with briefly is the middling model of the launch trio, the Ryzen 7 1700X. Like the other two Ryzen chips AMD is making available at launch, it’s an eight-core beast that crunches two software threads per core. Hexa-core and quad-core models are coming, but aren’t quite ready for launch day. The 1700X clocks in nominally at 3.4GHz with a potential 3.8GHz turbo mode. The ‘X’ suffix, incidentally means it sports AMD’s new XFR auto-overclocking feature, a bit more on which in a moment. For the record the other two chips are the 3.0GHz/3.7GHz 1700 and the 3.6GHz/4GHz 1800X. Pricing for the 1700X is £399. The 1800X rocks in around £499 and the 1700 is yours for £329. Stick a $ sign in front of those numbers and you have the US price, which is both impressive and depressing depending on your point of view. Without further ado, then, let’s get busy. I couldn’t resist firing up the fairly pointless Cinebench synthetic benchmark first, just to see those 16 threads in action. Fly my pretties: Not that it matters much for the real world, but this thing flies in a multi-threaded benchmark like Cinebench. To give you a feel for just how quick it is, it’s nearly two and a half times faster than the incumbent gamer’s choice, the Intel Core i5-7600K. Yowsers. Of course, multi-threading is only half – or should that be 15/16ths – of the story. AMD’s big failure with its previous FX processors was single-threaded performance and it just so happens that games are particularly sensitive to just that. In Cinebench’s single-threaded mode, the Ryzen 7 1700X is between 10 and 20 per cent slower than various gaming-relevant Intel CPUs, with about 10% of that due to a slight comparative deficiency in Ryzen’s architecture and the other 10% thanks to clockspeed. Indeed, it was rumoured prior to launch that clock-for-clock and core-for-core, Ryzen would be roughly a match for Intel’s Haswell-generation chips – the Core iSomething 4000 series chips, in other words. And so it proves in Cinebench. Anyway, I mucked around with a few other canned benchmarks, all of which delivered similar kinds of results. Ryzen monsters quad-core Intel chips in multi-threading. In fact, it’s on about a par with Intel’s own eight-core beast, the 6900K for multithreading. Lest you have forgotten, that’s more or less a £1,000 chip. But what, you cry, of games? Don’t panic, the news here is decent, too, if somewhat preliminary and indeed patchy. You can read detailed benchmarks elsewhere, but to give you one example, in Total War: Attila using the same video card and settings, the Ryzen 1700X cranks out an average of 39 frames per second to 40 from a Core i5-7600K. I got similar results in several other titles. The first caveat to that is that I was running everything at 1440p and high detail settings, which tends to push things towards being GPU limited, even on an Nvidia GTX 1080. The handful of games I ran may also have somewhat flattered Ryzen. Among others, Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games. Part of that is clockspeed, part of it is architecture and part is probably optimisation. You can be sure that few if any games exist that have been compiled to run well on Ryzen. Really broadly, then, Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. If you want to game and stream your exploits at the same time, for instance, Ryzen looks like a killer solution. But a high clocked six-core Ryzen of the near future might be the best AMD bet for gamers. If there is a disappointment, it’s overclocking. All Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked for easy overclocking. But to cut a long story short, they don’t overclock. Well, barely. I squeezed an extra 100MHz out of my chip and that was with water cooling. M’colleagues elsewhere in the reviewersphere report similar findings. Oh, and the XFR auto-overclocking feature doesn’t improve on that. It may be of interest in future when Ryzen chips with more headroom appear. For now, it’s fairly redundant. That said, the 1700X I tested tended to max out at only 3.5GHz in multi-threaded workloads when running at standard rather than overclocked settings rather than the 3.8GHz promised by the chip’s turbo mode. So, that 100MHz overclock was actually more like 400MHz in practice. But I’m not sure I actually care. My feeling coming in was that if Ryzen really was roughly on a par with Haswell and ran at about 3.5GHz, that would be plenty to put the frighteners on Intel. It does just that, so frankly I for one am satisfied. Incidentally, if you’re wondering about operating temps, have a scan of the web. I was only able to run my test chip with water cooling, so the 41 degrees C idle and 51 degrees under load aren’t hugely helpful for the bulk of us that run fairly standard air coolers. What we have then is a chip that isn’t far off Intel for gaming and absolutely obliterates it for multi-threading performance when you factor in pricing. Regards the latter, this chip is literally half the price of Intel’s eight-core 6900K. Staggering. Of course, it’s still bloody expensive at £399. Moreover, you’re never actually going to feel the difference versus the plain old £329 Ryzen 7 1700. So of the initial launch chips, the 1700 is the obvious choice. It’s an awesome all-rounder for the money. However, I still think the sweet spot for most RPSers will likely be the future six-core model. It’ll crank out the same gaming performance (well, in most games) as the eight-core model, just for less money, along with both pretty snazzy multi-threading for content creation and some multi-threading headroom to come as games gradually scale better across multiple cores. Where all this leaves Intel is of course an interesting question. My sense in recent years is that readers have tired of the press bashing Intel for sandbagging, but for my money Ryzen completely confirms that narrative. It makes Intel’s product line up look cynical and overpriced. Personally, I can’t see Intel slashing prices anything like enough to offset the yawning gap between it’s six and eight-core CPUs and Ryzen. In reality, it doesn’t matter much to Intel. Desktop CPUs aren’t all that important and in any case, the likes of Dell will keep cranking out systems for mainstream punters and nobody will care much or notice much. What Intel may do is hurry up the mainstream six-core model for the LGA1151 socket that appeared on its roadmaps recently. Suitably clocked and priced, that would put Intel in a reasonable if still not ideal competitive position. In the meantime, I think enthusiasts will make something of a stampede towards Ryzen. It’s just such a compelling value proposition, even if it remains somewhat unproven. It wouldn’t surprise me to find a few bugs emerging (I hear it’s a bit pernickety when it comes to certain memory configs, for instance) or a few weak spots in its performance profile shake out as the PC community probes its capabilities. AMD is but a small company and it probably doesn’t have the manpower to completely finesse this new architecture first time around. Of course, if that’s correct the upside is that scope remains for future revisions to turn a good chip into a great one. Anyway, this is an initial hands-on, not an entirely definitive and forensic investigation. I’ll have a look at the platform / motherboard part of the Ryzen story in a future post – PCI Express connectivity with Ryzen chips is an emerging concern, for instance. Overall, Ryzen is impressive even if the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers. But if I was buying a CPU right now, it would still be the base model eight-core Ryzen. It’s not perfect and for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs. But it’s a really nice all-rounder for the money.

Fast enough single-threaded, big boost multi-threaded. And the timing’s about right for all of us on a Sandy or Ivy Bridge Core i5 (or below) to upgrade. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 16:25 blur says: Yuuuup. My 2500k is finally showing its age these days. Any CPU upgrade would necessitate motherboard and RAM as well, so the next batch of Ryzen releases definitely look like they might hit the super sweet spot. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:40 Gnoupi says: I’m actually a bit surprised to read that. The consensus on all other reviews I read is that it’s not ideal for gaming, performance wise, compared to the concurrency. And that it only passes them in “ideal” multithreaded conditions (video processing/rendering). Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:46 dangermouse76 says: My reading seems to suggest. That 1440p evens out the FPS comparisons as they push the work to the GPU. But when looking at 1080p gaming with these chips the i7 seems to have a larger margin over Ryzen. Edit: As this article seems to bare out. So yeah these chips dont blow me away for gaming. That may not be their purpose, but still. So yeah very interested to see what the Ryzen i5 competition will look like.

Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:56 Sakkura says: I wouldn’t count on big improvements, but at least the situations where SMT hurts performance should be going away. Maybe a few percent on top of that, here and there. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:48 Jeremy Laird says: You must have missed these excerpts!: “Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. ” “Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games.” “the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers” “for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs” For the most part, if you run at high res and graphical detail, the gap is inconsequential in most games. Where games are CPU limited, the gap is a lot more obvious. Plus there are one or two anomalies, to boot. I think you’ve probably absorbed my generally upbeat tone but ignored the detail of what I wrote.

The way language can glitch like this, causing tiny ambiguities, is really fun for me to dissect!

Renew! Renew! Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:31 carewolf says: Very few games push the CPU and the few that do are multithreaded. What other reviews do to make Intel look better is take something that is close to pushing the CPU but is single-threaded because it usually doesn’t matter, run it in a low resolution like 1080p and then pretend FPS over 100 matters. Then a Kaby Lake is faster than Ryzen, because it does indeed have better single threaded performance. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:29 Unclepauly says: There is much more than “a very few” games that push the cpu. When you go online multiplayer the burden on the CPU increases alot for a large percentage of games. The problem here is that online multiplayer is almost impossible to benchmark consistently. Games with a huge amount of players just compounds the issue. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:18 randomclass says: Also games like Paradox’s grand strategy games, from CK2 to HoI4. They all seem to be laggy in late game, in SP or MP, and it’s all down to CPU, not GPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:54 ravenshrike says: The issue is that the reviews are all over the place with a few more or less matching the 7700k even at 1080p, with others horribly bombing. Most of that is teething issues from the new architecture(Although the on-die memory controller throughput is a bit weak. That needs to be improved by at least 50%, preferably doubled in the next refresh). In three to six months the performance numbers will almost certainly look much better as BIOSes, opcode, and MS drivers are improved, with even some games getting patched to work with Ryzen’s quirks. You’ve got to remember that the Haswell and Broadwell and Lake chips are all very mature at this point with more similarities than differences between them. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:41 kud13 says: A few years back I picked up an AMD FX 4350- also an 8-core 4.0 Ghz base for something ridiculous like 250CAD (this was right before the dollar spiked up). The reason for AMD was I had an AMD-based mobo and I was upgrading piecemeal. Gotta say, I haven’t had any problems with any “modern” games on it since (GPU was a bottleneck for a while, but now I’m running Nvidia 1070). However, Age of Empires 2 HD (that does not support multi-threading, period) DOES make it huff and puff (as opposed to, say, Witcher 3). So I guess we still gotta wait for AMD to come up with powerful single-thread chips. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:52 Sakkura says: 8 cores? Then you mean FX-8350, the FX-4350 is 4 cores. While Ryzen is still not quite on par with Intel in single-threaded performance, it’s very close. And a HUGE upgrade over their old FX chips. We’re talking 60-80% faster.

I’m still gaming on my old Phenom 2 X4, and while running at a respectable 4Ghz, it’s really starting to show it’s age in some games. So for me the jump from 4 cores and 4 threads to 8 cores and 16 threads at hopefully near the same clock speed should be an enormous leap, and I won’t be completely CPU limiting my GTX 1070 any more. :D Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:32 AngoraFish says: My Phenom 2 x4 955 is still running strong and I’ve not noticed any significant CPU bottleneck on anything I play.

I played every single game on it, no problem. But last year I decided to buy an i5 6600. Got a new mobo, new RAM, the new CPU and a new case. Only then I noticed how obsolete the Phenom II was. I got almost double the framerate on most games. I mean, the good old Phenom II served its purpose. It allowed me to play any game I wanted. It also didn’t do that so well. And there was also a bonus. It worked as a very nice space heater! Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 23:05 Don Reba says: My main requirement from a CPU is maximum AVX2 performance, in which Ryzen lags behind Intel literally by a factor of 2, so my main hope is that competition will force Intel to add more cores and drop prices. It could be argued that I would be better served by a GPU, but, well, it’s a whole other can of worms, and I don’t want the hassle.

But I do more than just playing nothing but games on my desktop, and having 8 physical cores would be a great convenience for the VMs and the sometimes video encodes that I do. Consider me pleasantly impressed. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:07 ScubaMonster says: I’ve seen some articles about the performance comparison, but not any that factor in price at the same time. I get that it’s the cold hard numbers that matter most and these chips are going up against Intel’s offerings. But if a Ryzen chip lags a bit behind its Intel counterpart but is substantially cheaper I would consider that a win. Sure, you could pony up extra bucks if you absolutely must have the best of the best, but if you can get performance close to it for a lot cheaper, that would be a no brainer to me. I don’t know all the pricing to make a comparison myself though. I haven’t really looked at the Ryzen prices compared to their Intel equivalents. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 01:37 haldolium says: Check the chart on the bottom of the site here, it gives an impression where Ryzen stands in terms of pricing to performance: link to computerbase.de Good thing AMD catches up, but by now I am more interested in GPGPU in general since GPU based rendering has taken HUGE steps in the time AMD was figuring out the Zen and for playing games, the CPU is so seldom an issue that I couldn’t care less for the high-end market. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:49 Unclepauly says: It really does depend on the types of games a person plays though. Certain genres of games have a greater need for CPU performance while many do not. Plenty of outliers as well. Take ARMA 3 for example, Sandy bridge systems net about 30-35 fps while Kaby Lake(with very fast ram) is netting roughly 55-60 fps. Cherry picked game of course but there are others out there less documented that benefit as well. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:45 Rack says: Sadly the current scenario does Ryzen few favours. A 1700 compares poorly with an i5 7600k at £100 more. Right at the bottom of the pile the 1100 might be a reasonable budget option but all in all Ryzen looks to be a good option for 3d modelling, less so for games. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:16 ButteringSundays says: I haven’t noticed my 5 y/o i5 acting as a bottleneck anywhere I’ve noticed (the 760 is showing its age though… sometimes). Hardware fetishists are strange beasts – the money they’ll spend for an updated forum signature. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:14 Lord Zeon says: The CPU hasn’t been a bottleneck for gaming for almost a decade now. I still use a first gen Bulldozer CPU, the FX-8120, and I’ve never seen a AAA title get caught up on it with my GTX 970. Imagine that – the first of the “awful” AMD architectures that Ryzen is replacing still is entirely relevant in the enthusiast gaming space. I genuinely think that Intel’s marketing has permeated the enthusiast community to the point where everyone has lost the their reference point as to what a CPU needs to do for gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 14:03 Sakkura says: If you’re not seeing the FX-8120 limit performance, then you’re simply not looking. It definitely does. That doesn’t mean everything is unplayable on it, but it really doesn’t qualify for enthusiast gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 15:18 tehfish says: As an FX-8120 owner also, it does bottleneck the GPU in recent games, but it does depend on what GPU you have. You may just be very lucky with a well-matched GPU to go with the CPU there. For an example, with fallout4, an overclocked FX-8120 (4.2ghz, no turbo) and a R9 390: It’s perfectly playable often running happily at 1080p 60fps, then you can hit certain areas where it drops to ~20-30fps with the GPU core down to ~450mhz out of it’s maximum 1060mhz – a clear case of a CPU bottleneck. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 00:18 Etherion says: I also have a quite dated i5 760 cpu, but didn’t feel it as a bottleneck until just recently (current gpu is gtx 770 overclocked) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:45 bfar says: Way back in January last year, I had a long discussion with my peers on a UK forum over 6700k vs 5820k, as they were roughly the same price at the time. I argued that for gaming, the higher clocked 4 core CPU would be the better bet for at least a year or two. We agreed that for all other applications, the lower clocked 6 core chip was the way to go. It seems that a year later, nothing has changed, and it frames the perception of Rysen from an enthusiast perspective. It’s still a major coup for consumers though, because as Jeremy rightly points out, most of Intels chips look like poor value for money all of a sudden. Prices will fall across the board.

I’ve been running a 7 year old used i7 2600k oc’ed since 2012. To maintain 60fps minimum, the only part that I’ve had to upgrade was always the video card. Starting out on a GTX 460, then SLI 560TI to a GTX 780/970(RMA replace) and now a GTX 1070. Until my games consistently dip below 50fps on max settings with my current or newer video card, I have no real reason to upgrade yet. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 16:57 syllopsium says: Have to admit I was wrong with this – I expected the single threaded performance would suck. Whilst it doesn’t match a 7700K, it’s a great alternative to Intel’s enthusiast class CPUs at a much lower price, and being AMD hopefully supports ECC RAM too. The problem is, I’m not convinced the enthusiast market is large enough. If you’re using virtualisation, rendering, or transcoding video it’s a huge win, but for general productivity and games this isn’t on the radar and probably never will be. Neither are any of Intel’s chips with more than four cores. They also haven’t talked up any virtualisation support, other than encrypted memory. They could do much more in this area if they wanted to. Roll on four fast core versions of Ryzen.. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

AMD, the underdog, has for too many years struggled to keep up with Intel, allowing the latter to put up its feet and focus on mobile parts while charging eye-watering amounts for many-core desktop hips based on previous-generation architecture. Competition can be crucial to long-term innovation and better value in the marketplace, and it is for these reasons that legions of AMD fans continue to hope that Ryzen will re-establish the chip manufacturer as everyone's favourite dark horse. The new processors, spearheaded by the Ryzen 7 1800X, don't quite have the ammunition to surpass Intel in the all-out performance stakes, yet given AMD's misfires in previous generations, the fact that Ryzen is at all competitive is an achievement in itself. And the new chip is competitive in more ways than one. We won't dig through the modernised Zen architecture all over again - our initial review has that covered - but as a reminder we know that while Ryzen's single-thread performance is reasonable, the chip's real party trick is to offer massive multi-thread potential and to do so for an agreeable fee. The Ryzen 7 1800X that first passed through our test bench offers eight cores, 16 threads and a peak frequency of 4.0GHz for £490. An Intel chip with that number of cores would cost over twice as much, so the 1800X looks a comparative bargain, or at least, it does until you start to consider other parts in the Ryzen 7 portfolio.

The Ryzen 7 1700X costs just £390 and loses out to its sibling in but one area: 0.2GHz of clock speed. A £100 saving for the sake of 200MHz? Seems an acceptable trade-off, and with support for XFR, there's every possibility the chip will automatically boost closer to the 4.0GHz mark with a meaty cooler attached. And remember, all Ryzen processors are multiplier unlocked, so those of you who like to dabble in a bit of overclocking won't have your choices artificially limited. The question that remains, then, is how much of a difference does that additional 200MHz make? Let's put the 1700X to the test and unearth some more real-world Ryzen numbers.

Photo by Mark Makela for The Washington Post HARRISBURG, Pa. • For some residents of this small city, there was something familiar about Foxconn’s recently announced plan to hire up to 50,000 U.S. workers, one of the many hiring pledges from companies rounded up by President Donald Trump in the first weeks of his administration. The only difference was the scale. In 2013, Foxconn’s chairman sent a jolt through this state capital when he said his company — best known for making Apple iPhones in China — would invest $30 million and hire 500 workers for a new high-tech factory in central Pennsylvania. Locals were giddy. Foxconn had a small office there, but this seemed like the start of an entire new industry. Pennsylvania’s governor boasted about the deal. The Brookings Institution think tank hailed Foxconn’s decision as a sign of U.S. manufacturing’s strength. But the factory was never built. The jobs never came. “It just seemed to fade to black” after the announcement, recalled a local official. It was the start of a mystery, created by a chief executive known to promise projects all over the world that never quite pan out. Yet few people seem to notice. Foxconn and others continue to get credit for deals that never take place. In December, Pennsylvania’s economic development staff was still touting the $30 million factory that never was. What happened in Harrisburg provides a skeptical lens for viewing the waves of corporate investment promises being used by Trump as evidence that he is following through on his campaign pledge to reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing. “I’m delivering on everything we promised,” Trump said Thursday during a meeting with manufacturing executives at the White House, noting how firms have announced new hiring and factories. “People are saying they’ve never seen so much happen in 30 days of a presidency.” Foxconn, for example, announced shortly after Trump’s election that it plans to invest $7 billion and hire up to 50,000 workers in the United States. Such a hiring spree would catapult Foxconn from a couple of thousand U.S. workers to a major employer on par with Chrysler. Other companies, too, including SoftBank, Alibaba, Intel and IBM, have loudly announced their intentions to invest in the United States — all with price tags in the billions of dollars and the promise of tens of thousands of jobs — much to Trump’s delight. “Foxconn is going to spend a tremendous amount of money on building a massive plant,” Trump said the day after the investment was revealed, “and probably more than one.” But, as Harrisburg learned, the gulf between these eye-popping announcements and reality can be huge — and frequently overlooked. “They are scrambling to look good,” said Mark Selden, senior research associate at Cornell University’s East Asian program. “It’s a sign of the pressure that Trump is placing on everyone in the world to deliver on his agenda.” ‘Along for the ride’ Companies tend to view these announcements as an opening bid in a negotiation, said Alberto Moel, a senior analyst with Bernstein Research in Hong Kong. Firms know politicians like the splashy headlines. And if everything falls into place — the business climate improves, they extract enough concessions such as tax breaks and free land — they might be able to make it happen. “It actually puts the onus on the U.S. in a way,” Moel said. “They are saying: ‘I’m along for the ride. Here’s my proposal.’” If the deal falls apart, as it often does, no one is going to talk about it. “The government themselves aren’t going to remind you of that, Trump has no intention of helping you remember that,” Moel said. “What’s the downside?” Trump is far from alone in using corporate announcements as political backdrops. It’s why ribbon-cuttings and ceremonial shovels exist. In 2012, former President Barack Obama visited a new $5 billion Intel computer chip plant in Chandler, Ariz., citing it as “an example of an America that is within our reach.” But the facility, known as Fab 42, was never completed. Last month, Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich stood in the Oval Office with Trump to announce a $7 billion investment — essentially, Fab 42 was back on track, with a new price tag and a new president. Trump tweeted his praise. Even before he was sworn in, it was clear Trump placed greater importance on these job announcements than past administrations. Among the first signs came in December when Tokyo-based SoftBank’s chief executive, Masayoshi Son, stood with the president-elect to announce a plan to invest $50 billion and create 50,000 new U.S. jobs. Two days after Trump’s inauguration, Foxconn chief executive Terry Gou told reporters in Taiwan that his company planned to spend $7 billion on a U.S. factory to make computer displays. It wasn’t iPhones — which Trump has said he wants to be “Made in the USA” — but Gou said the factory could create 30,000 to 50,000 U.S. jobs. Details were few, but one clue seized on was the presence of a Pennsylvania state trade representative at Gou’s talk. Foxconn said in a statement that it is “exploring a potential investment that would represent an expansion of our current U.S. operations.” But the company could not confirm “the number of jobs that might be created.” Foxconn is a coveted hardware manufacturer because of its size. Last year, it reported $136 billion in revenue. It has more than 1 million employees, most in China. A single factory making iPhones or LCD screens can employ tens of thousands of workers. When Foxconn says it will invest in a new plant, the decision can transform a region. That’s why countries all over the world are eager to lure Foxconn to their shores. Gou, Foxconn’s founder, for years has described the United States as a “must-go market.” Empty promises? In 2014, as the Pennsylvania deal was quietly dying, Gou teased the opening of an LCD display factory in the States. His company talked with officials in Colorado and Arizona. Nothing happened. That same year, the company signed a letter of intent to invest up to $1 billion in Indonesia. That investment still has not occurred. Foxconn said it would invest $5 billion over five years in India as part of an ambitious expansion in 2014. The deal would create up to 50,000 jobs, Gou said. But Foxconn’s investment in India has amounted to only a small fraction of what it promised. Similar results were seen in Vietnam, where Foxconn committed to a $5 billion investment in 2007, and in Brazil, where Foxconn spoke of a $10 billion plan in 2011. The company made its first major foray in Vietnam only last year. In Brazil, Foxconn has an iPhone factory, but its investment has fallen far short of expectations. “There’s a pattern here,” said Moel, the analyst.

(Coincidentally, Trump pulled the United States out of the trade treaty in his first days in office.) It was a surprise when Gou said Foxconn planned to invest $30 million over two years in a factory to make technology equipment and servers. Gou noted his company’s history in Harrisburg. He said the goal was to create “high-precision, high-tech, high value-added manufacturing in the U.S.” “There was this intense buzz,” recalled David Black, president of the Harrisburg Regional Chamber. “Lots of us were excited by the opportunity,” said Bub Manning, who at the time co-owned a local construction firm. “Anytime something of that size comes along in central Pennsylvania, that’s a big deal.” For years, Foxconn has maintained an office with about 50 workers in Harrisburg, a hub of the computer connector industry. The office is in an old brick warehouse. On a recent visit, the building was filled by a half-empty warren of cubicles. A worker declined to comment to a reporter . According to local government officials, Foxconn has not done any permitted alterations to the building in 15 years. Manning recalled how his firm tried to chase down information about the planned $30 million factory. “It felt like I was grabbing Jell-O. It never got any traction,” Manning said. The $30 million factory faded from view. Phantom factories And yet, none of this has stopped the praise for Foxconn’s investment in Pennsylvania. Recent stories have referred to the phantom factory as a sign of Foxconn’s U.S. beachhead. A state economic development official wrote about Foxconn’s $30 million factory as evidence of foreign companies that operate in the Keystone State. (The piece was fixed after The Washington Post inquired about it.) State officials toured potential sites with Foxconn representatives, the state Department of Community and Economic Development said in a statement. “Unfortunately, a project did not come to fruition.” Foxconn attributed the failure to “material changes to the business and operating climate at that time.” Feeling burned by the fate of the $30 million factory, some in Harrisburg are cautious about getting their hopes up again. “We learned something from that,” said Black of the Harrisburg chamber. But, Manning said, it would be hard to not be seduced by the size of Foxconn’s ambition, real or not. “If you smelled a project like that,” he said, “you’d get excited even though you know better.” Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Making AMD great again! Home Hardware Hands on with AMD’s fab new Ryzen CPU By Jeremy Laird on March 2nd, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Rejoice, for AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is here. And it’s good. Thank science for that. Another dud from AMD didn’t bear thinking about. Instead, we get to ponder just how good Ryzen is and indeed how good it truly needs to be. It isn’t the very fastest CPU money can buy or the greatest gaming CPU ever. But that’s just dandy. It’s still going to blow the PC processor market wide open and force Intel to seriously up its game. If you want the background to AMD’s new chip and a broad overview on what makes it tick, head over here. The task this week is to get a quick feel for what Ryzen is actually like. The chip I’ve played with briefly is the middling model of the launch trio, the Ryzen 7 1700X. Like the other two Ryzen chips AMD is making available at launch, it’s an eight-core beast that crunches two software threads per core. Hexa-core and quad-core models are coming, but aren’t quite ready for launch day. The 1700X clocks in nominally at 3.4GHz with a potential 3.8GHz turbo mode. The ‘X’ suffix, incidentally means it sports AMD’s new XFR auto-overclocking feature, a bit more on which in a moment. For the record the other two chips are the 3.0GHz/3.7GHz 1700 and the 3.6GHz/4GHz 1800X. Pricing for the 1700X is £399. The 1800X rocks in around £499 and the 1700 is yours for £329. Stick a $ sign in front of those numbers and you have the US price, which is both impressive and depressing depending on your point of view. Without further ado, then, let’s get busy. I couldn’t resist firing up the fairly pointless Cinebench synthetic benchmark first, just to see those 16 threads in action. Fly my pretties: Not that it matters much for the real world, but this thing flies in a multi-threaded benchmark like Cinebench. To give you a feel for just how quick it is, it’s nearly two and a half times faster than the incumbent gamer’s choice, the Intel Core i5-7600K. Yowsers. Of course, multi-threading is only half – or should that be 15/16ths – of the story. AMD’s big failure with its previous FX processors was single-threaded performance and it just so happens that games are particularly sensitive to just that. In Cinebench’s single-threaded mode, the Ryzen 7 1700X is between 10 and 20 per cent slower than various gaming-relevant Intel CPUs, with about 10% of that due to a slight comparative deficiency in Ryzen’s architecture and the other 10% thanks to clockspeed. Indeed, it was rumoured prior to launch that clock-for-clock and core-for-core, Ryzen would be roughly a match for Intel’s Haswell-generation chips – the Core iSomething 4000 series chips, in other words. And so it proves in Cinebench. Anyway, I mucked around with a few other canned benchmarks, all of which delivered similar kinds of results. Ryzen monsters quad-core Intel chips in multi-threading. In fact, it’s on about a par with Intel’s own eight-core beast, the 6900K for multithreading. Lest you have forgotten, that’s more or less a £1,000 chip. But what, you cry, of games? Don’t panic, the news here is decent, too, if somewhat preliminary and indeed patchy. You can read detailed benchmarks elsewhere, but to give you one example, in Total War: Attila using the same video card and settings, the Ryzen 1700X cranks out an average of 39 frames per second to 40 from a Core i5-7600K. I got similar results in several other titles. The first caveat to that is that I was running everything at 1440p and high detail settings, which tends to push things towards being GPU limited, even on an Nvidia GTX 1080. The handful of games I ran may also have somewhat flattered Ryzen. Among others, Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games. Part of that is clockspeed, part of it is architecture and part is probably optimisation. You can be sure that few if any games exist that have been compiled to run well on Ryzen. Really broadly, then, Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. If you want to game and stream your exploits at the same time, for instance, Ryzen looks like a killer solution. But a high clocked six-core Ryzen of the near future might be the best AMD bet for gamers. If there is a disappointment, it’s overclocking. All Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked for easy overclocking. But to cut a long story short, they don’t overclock. Well, barely. I squeezed an extra 100MHz out of my chip and that was with water cooling. M’colleagues elsewhere in the reviewersphere report similar findings. Oh, and the XFR auto-overclocking feature doesn’t improve on that. It may be of interest in future when Ryzen chips with more headroom appear. For now, it’s fairly redundant. That said, the 1700X I tested tended to max out at only 3.5GHz in multi-threaded workloads when running at standard rather than overclocked settings rather than the 3.8GHz promised by the chip’s turbo mode. So, that 100MHz overclock was actually more like 400MHz in practice. But I’m not sure I actually care. My feeling coming in was that if Ryzen really was roughly on a par with Haswell and ran at about 3.5GHz, that would be plenty to put the frighteners on Intel. It does just that, so frankly I for one am satisfied. Incidentally, if you’re wondering about operating temps, have a scan of the web. I was only able to run my test chip with water cooling, so the 41 degrees C idle and 51 degrees under load aren’t hugely helpful for the bulk of us that run fairly standard air coolers. What we have then is a chip that isn’t far off Intel for gaming and absolutely obliterates it for multi-threading performance when you factor in pricing. Regards the latter, this chip is literally half the price of Intel’s eight-core 6900K. Staggering. Of course, it’s still bloody expensive at £399. Moreover, you’re never actually going to feel the difference versus the plain old £329 Ryzen 7 1700. So of the initial launch chips, the 1700 is the obvious choice. It’s an awesome all-rounder for the money. However, I still think the sweet spot for most RPSers will likely be the future six-core model. It’ll crank out the same gaming performance (well, in most games) as the eight-core model, just for less money, along with both pretty snazzy multi-threading for content creation and some multi-threading headroom to come as games gradually scale better across multiple cores. Where all this leaves Intel is of course an interesting question. My sense in recent years is that readers have tired of the press bashing Intel for sandbagging, but for my money Ryzen completely confirms that narrative. It makes Intel’s product line up look cynical and overpriced. Personally, I can’t see Intel slashing prices anything like enough to offset the yawning gap between it’s six and eight-core CPUs and Ryzen. In reality, it doesn’t matter much to Intel. Desktop CPUs aren’t all that important and in any case, the likes of Dell will keep cranking out systems for mainstream punters and nobody will care much or notice much. What Intel may do is hurry up the mainstream six-core model for the LGA1151 socket that appeared on its roadmaps recently. Suitably clocked and priced, that would put Intel in a reasonable if still not ideal competitive position. In the meantime, I think enthusiasts will make something of a stampede towards Ryzen. It’s just such a compelling value proposition, even if it remains somewhat unproven. It wouldn’t surprise me to find a few bugs emerging (I hear it’s a bit pernickety when it comes to certain memory configs, for instance) or a few weak spots in its performance profile shake out as the PC community probes its capabilities. AMD is but a small company and it probably doesn’t have the manpower to completely finesse this new architecture first time around. Of course, if that’s correct the upside is that scope remains for future revisions to turn a good chip into a great one. Anyway, this is an initial hands-on, not an entirely definitive and forensic investigation. I’ll have a look at the platform / motherboard part of the Ryzen story in a future post – PCI Express connectivity with Ryzen chips is an emerging concern, for instance. Overall, Ryzen is impressive even if the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers. But if I was buying a CPU right now, it would still be the base model eight-core Ryzen. It’s not perfect and for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs. But it’s a really nice all-rounder for the money.

Fast enough single-threaded, big boost multi-threaded. And the timing’s about right for all of us on a Sandy or Ivy Bridge Core i5 (or below) to upgrade.

Any CPU upgrade would necessitate motherboard and RAM as well, so the next batch of Ryzen releases definitely look like they might hit the super sweet spot. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:40 Gnoupi says: I’m actually a bit surprised to read that. The consensus on all other reviews I read is that it’s not ideal for gaming, performance wise, compared to the concurrency. And that it only passes them in “ideal” multithreaded conditions (video processing/rendering). Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:46 dangermouse76 says: My reading seems to suggest. That 1440p evens out the FPS comparisons as they push the work to the GPU. But when looking at 1080p gaming with these chips the i7 seems to have a larger margin over Ryzen. Edit: As this article seems to bare out. So yeah these chips dont blow me away for gaming. That may not be their purpose, but still. So yeah very interested to see what the Ryzen i5 competition will look like. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:16 dangermouse76 says: Also this is brand new from scratch work from AMD so optimisations from devs and AMD may help bring that gap down. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:56 Sakkura says: I wouldn’t count on big improvements, but at least the situations where SMT hurts performance should be going away. Maybe a few percent on top of that, here and there.

In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. ” “Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games.” “the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers” “for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs” For the most part, if you run at high res and graphical detail, the gap is inconsequential in most games. Where games are CPU limited, the gap is a lot more obvious. Plus there are one or two anomalies, to boot. I think you’ve probably absorbed my generally upbeat tone but ignored the detail of what I wrote.

Apologies for my approximate reading and thanks for pointing out those paragraphs to me :) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:45 ZippyLemon says: Off topic but, as an English teacher living in Germany, I’m curious and would like to ask: by “past 22” do you mean “past the age of 22” or “after 10pm”? The way language can glitch like this, causing tiny ambiguities, is really fun for me to dissect! PS almost certainly you meant “after 10pm”, and I would caution you that ’22’ is not an intuitive way for native speakers to write time. 2200, 22:00 and 10pm all read correctly :) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 11:13 Harlander says: Yeah, after 22 you should be getting ready for the Carousel. Renew! Renew! Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:31 carewolf says: Very few games push the CPU and the few that do are multithreaded. What other reviews do to make Intel look better is take something that is close to pushing the CPU but is single-threaded because it usually doesn’t matter, run it in a low resolution like 1080p and then pretend FPS over 100 matters. Then a Kaby Lake is faster than Ryzen, because it does indeed have better single threaded performance. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:29 Unclepauly says: There is much more than “a very few” games that push the cpu. When you go online multiplayer the burden on the CPU increases alot for a large percentage of games. The problem here is that online multiplayer is almost impossible to benchmark consistently. Games with a huge amount of players just compounds the issue. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:18 randomclass says: Also games like Paradox’s grand strategy games, from CK2 to HoI4. They all seem to be laggy in late game, in SP or MP, and it’s all down to CPU, not GPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:54 ravenshrike says: The issue is that the reviews are all over the place with a few more or less matching the 7700k even at 1080p, with others horribly bombing. Most of that is teething issues from the new architecture(Although the on-die memory controller throughput is a bit weak. That needs to be improved by at least 50%, preferably doubled in the next refresh). In three to six months the performance numbers will almost certainly look much better as BIOSes, opcode, and MS drivers are improved, with even some games getting patched to work with Ryzen’s quirks. You’ve got to remember that the Haswell and Broadwell and Lake chips are all very mature at this point with more similarities than differences between them. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:41 kud13 says: A few years back I picked up an AMD FX 4350- also an 8-core 4.0 Ghz base for something ridiculous like 250CAD (this was right before the dollar spiked up). The reason for AMD was I had an AMD-based mobo and I was upgrading piecemeal. Gotta say, I haven’t had any problems with any “modern” games on it since (GPU was a bottleneck for a while, but now I’m running Nvidia 1070). However, Age of Empires 2 HD (that does not support multi-threading, period) DOES make it huff and puff (as opposed to, say, Witcher 3). So I guess we still gotta wait for AMD to come up with powerful single-thread chips. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:52 Sakkura says: 8 cores? Then you mean FX-8350, the FX-4350 is 4 cores. While Ryzen is still not quite on par with Intel in single-threaded performance, it’s very close. And a HUGE upgrade over their old FX chips. We’re talking 60-80% faster. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:49 BadManiac says: I ordered my 1700X today, been waiting for this too long. I’m still gaming on my old Phenom 2 X4, and while running at a respectable 4Ghz, it’s really starting to show it’s age in some games. So for me the jump from 4 cores and 4 threads to 8 cores and 16 threads at hopefully near the same clock speed should be an enormous leap, and I won’t be completely CPU limiting my GTX 1070 any more. :D Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:32 AngoraFish says: My Phenom 2 x4 955 is still running strong and I’ve not noticed any significant CPU bottleneck on anything I play. I’ve upgraded the graphics card a couple of times since I got it, but there’s still no incentive at all for me to splash cash on a new CPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:34 Unclepauly says: The fact is that you are just used to it so don’t notice it. That CPU is has problems in a huge amount of games.

I played every single game on it, no problem. But last year I decided to buy an i5 6600. Got a new mobo, new RAM, the new CPU and a new case. Only then I noticed how obsolete the Phenom II was. I got almost double the framerate on most games. I mean, the good old Phenom II served its purpose. It allowed me to play any game I wanted. It also didn’t do that so well. And there was also a bonus. It worked as a very nice space heater! Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 23:05 Don Reba says: My main requirement from a CPU is maximum AVX2 performance, in which Ryzen lags behind Intel literally by a factor of 2, so my main hope is that competition will force Intel to add more cores and drop prices. It could be argued that I would be better served by a GPU, but, well, it’s a whole other can of worms, and I don’t want the hassle.

But I do more than just playing nothing but games on my desktop, and having 8 physical cores would be a great convenience for the VMs and the sometimes video encodes that I do. Consider me pleasantly impressed. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:07 ScubaMonster says: I’ve seen some articles about the performance comparison, but not any that factor in price at the same time. I get that it’s the cold hard numbers that matter most and these chips are going up against Intel’s offerings. But if a Ryzen chip lags a bit behind its Intel counterpart but is substantially cheaper I would consider that a win. Sure, you could pony up extra bucks if you absolutely must have the best of the best, but if you can get performance close to it for a lot cheaper, that would be a no brainer to me. I don’t know all the pricing to make a comparison myself though. I haven’t really looked at the Ryzen prices compared to their Intel equivalents. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 01:37 haldolium says: Check the chart on the bottom of the site here, it gives an impression where Ryzen stands in terms of pricing to performance: link to computerbase.de Good thing AMD catches up, but by now I am more interested in GPGPU in general since GPU based rendering has taken HUGE steps in the time AMD was figuring out the Zen and for playing games, the CPU is so seldom an issue that I couldn’t care less for the high-end market. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:49 Unclepauly says: It really does depend on the types of games a person plays though. Certain genres of games have a greater need for CPU performance while many do not. Plenty of outliers as well. Take ARMA 3 for example, Sandy bridge systems net about 30-35 fps while Kaby Lake(with very fast ram) is netting roughly 55-60 fps. Cherry picked game of course but there are others out there less documented that benefit as well. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:45 Rack says: Sadly the current scenario does Ryzen few favours. A 1700 compares poorly with an i5 7600k at £100 more. Right at the bottom of the pile the 1100 might be a reasonable budget option but all in all Ryzen looks to be a good option for 3d modelling, less so for games. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:16 ButteringSundays says: I haven’t noticed my 5 y/o i5 acting as a bottleneck anywhere I’ve noticed (the 760 is showing its age though… sometimes). Hardware fetishists are strange beasts – the money they’ll spend for an updated forum signature. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:14 Lord Zeon says: The CPU hasn’t been a bottleneck for gaming for almost a decade now. I still use a first gen Bulldozer CPU, the FX-8120, and I’ve never seen a AAA title get caught up on it with my GTX 970. Imagine that – the first of the “awful” AMD architectures that Ryzen is replacing still is entirely relevant in the enthusiast gaming space. I genuinely think that Intel’s marketing has permeated the enthusiast community to the point where everyone has lost the their reference point as to what a CPU needs to do for gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 14:03 Sakkura says: If you’re not seeing the FX-8120 limit performance, then you’re simply not looking. It definitely does. That doesn’t mean everything is unplayable on it, but it really doesn’t qualify for enthusiast gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 15:18 tehfish says: As an FX-8120 owner also, it does bottleneck the GPU in recent games, but it does depend on what GPU you have. You may just be very lucky with a well-matched GPU to go with the CPU there. For an example, with fallout4, an overclocked FX-8120 (4.2ghz, no turbo) and a R9 390: It’s perfectly playable often running happily at 1080p 60fps, then you can hit certain areas where it drops to ~20-30fps with the GPU core down to ~450mhz out of it’s maximum 1060mhz – a clear case of a CPU bottleneck. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 00:18 Etherion says: I also have a quite dated i5 760 cpu, but didn’t feel it as a bottleneck until just recently (current gpu is gtx 770 overclocked) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:45 bfar says: Way back in January last year, I had a long discussion with my peers on a UK forum over 6700k vs 5820k, as they were roughly the same price at the time. I argued that for gaming, the higher clocked 4 core CPU would be the better bet for at least a year or two. We agreed that for all other applications, the lower clocked 6 core chip was the way to go. It seems that a year later, nothing has changed, and it frames the perception of Rysen from an enthusiast perspective. It’s still a major coup for consumers though, because as Jeremy rightly points out, most of Intels chips look like poor value for money all of a sudden. Prices will fall across the board.

Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 22:28 Jabberslops says: Ryzen still isn’t compelling enough to me to upgrade my gaming computer when what I have is still able to get 100+fps in most games I play. I’ve been running a 7 year old used i7 2600k oc’ed since 2012. To maintain 60fps minimum, the only part that I’ve had to upgrade was always the video card. Starting out on a GTX 460, then SLI 560TI to a GTX 780/970(RMA replace) and now a GTX 1070. Until my games consistently dip below 50fps on max settings with my current or newer video card, I have no real reason to upgrade yet. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 16:57 syllopsium says: Have to admit I was wrong with this – I expected the single threaded performance would suck. Whilst it doesn’t match a 7700K, it’s a great alternative to Intel’s enthusiast class CPUs at a much lower price, and being AMD hopefully supports ECC RAM too. The problem is, I’m not convinced the enthusiast market is large enough. If you’re using virtualisation, rendering, or transcoding video it’s a huge win, but for general productivity and games this isn’t on the radar and probably never will be. Neither are any of Intel’s chips with more than four cores. They also haven’t talked up any virtualisation support, other than encrypted memory. They could do much more in this area if they wanted to. Roll on four fast core versions of Ryzen.. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Making AMD great again! Home Hardware Hands on with AMD’s fab new Ryzen CPU By Jeremy Laird on March 2nd, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Rejoice, for AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is here. And it’s good. Thank science for that. Another dud from AMD didn’t bear thinking about. Instead, we get to ponder just how good Ryzen is and indeed how good it truly needs to be. It isn’t the very fastest CPU money can buy or the greatest gaming CPU ever. But that’s just dandy. It’s still going to blow the PC processor market wide open and force Intel to seriously up its game. If you want the background to AMD’s new chip and a broad overview on what makes it tick, head over here. The task this week is to get a quick feel for what Ryzen is actually like. The chip I’ve played with briefly is the middling model of the launch trio, the Ryzen 7 1700X. Like the other two Ryzen chips AMD is making available at launch, it’s an eight-core beast that crunches two software threads per core. Hexa-core and quad-core models are coming, but aren’t quite ready for launch day. The 1700X clocks in nominally at 3.4GHz with a potential 3.8GHz turbo mode. The ‘X’ suffix, incidentally means it sports AMD’s new XFR auto-overclocking feature, a bit more on which in a moment. For the record the other two chips are the 3.0GHz/3.7GHz 1700 and the 3.6GHz/4GHz 1800X. Pricing for the 1700X is £399. The 1800X rocks in around £499 and the 1700 is yours for £329. Stick a $ sign in front of those numbers and you have the US price, which is both impressive and depressing depending on your point of view. Without further ado, then, let’s get busy. I couldn’t resist firing up the fairly pointless Cinebench synthetic benchmark first, just to see those 16 threads in action. Fly my pretties: Not that it matters much for the real world, but this thing flies in a multi-threaded benchmark like Cinebench. To give you a feel for just how quick it is, it’s nearly two and a half times faster than the incumbent gamer’s choice, the Intel Core i5-7600K. Yowsers. Of course, multi-threading is only half – or should that be 15/16ths – of the story. AMD’s big failure with its previous FX processors was single-threaded performance and it just so happens that games are particularly sensitive to just that. In Cinebench’s single-threaded mode, the Ryzen 7 1700X is between 10 and 20 per cent slower than various gaming-relevant Intel CPUs, with about 10% of that due to a slight comparative deficiency in Ryzen’s architecture and the other 10% thanks to clockspeed. Indeed, it was rumoured prior to launch that clock-for-clock and core-for-core, Ryzen would be roughly a match for Intel’s Haswell-generation chips – the Core iSomething 4000 series chips, in other words. And so it proves in Cinebench. Anyway, I mucked around with a few other canned benchmarks, all of which delivered similar kinds of results. Ryzen monsters quad-core Intel chips in multi-threading. In fact, it’s on about a par with Intel’s own eight-core beast, the 6900K for multithreading. Lest you have forgotten, that’s more or less a £1,000 chip. But what, you cry, of games? Don’t panic, the news here is decent, too, if somewhat preliminary and indeed patchy. You can read detailed benchmarks elsewhere, but to give you one example, in Total War: Attila using the same video card and settings, the Ryzen 1700X cranks out an average of 39 frames per second to 40 from a Core i5-7600K. I got similar results in several other titles. The first caveat to that is that I was running everything at 1440p and high detail settings, which tends to push things towards being GPU limited, even on an Nvidia GTX 1080. The handful of games I ran may also have somewhat flattered Ryzen. Among others, Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games. Part of that is clockspeed, part of it is architecture and part is probably optimisation. You can be sure that few if any games exist that have been compiled to run well on Ryzen. Really broadly, then, Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. If you want to game and stream your exploits at the same time, for instance, Ryzen looks like a killer solution. But a high clocked six-core Ryzen of the near future might be the best AMD bet for gamers. If there is a disappointment, it’s overclocking. All Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked for easy overclocking. But to cut a long story short, they don’t overclock. Well, barely. I squeezed an extra 100MHz out of my chip and that was with water cooling. M’colleagues elsewhere in the reviewersphere report similar findings. Oh, and the XFR auto-overclocking feature doesn’t improve on that. It may be of interest in future when Ryzen chips with more headroom appear. For now, it’s fairly redundant. That said, the 1700X I tested tended to max out at only 3.5GHz in multi-threaded workloads when running at standard rather than overclocked settings rather than the 3.8GHz promised by the chip’s turbo mode. So, that 100MHz overclock was actually more like 400MHz in practice. But I’m not sure I actually care. My feeling coming in was that if Ryzen really was roughly on a par with Haswell and ran at about 3.5GHz, that would be plenty to put the frighteners on Intel. It does just that, so frankly I for one am satisfied. Incidentally, if you’re wondering about operating temps, have a scan of the web. I was only able to run my test chip with water cooling, so the 41 degrees C idle and 51 degrees under load aren’t hugely helpful for the bulk of us that run fairly standard air coolers. What we have then is a chip that isn’t far off Intel for gaming and absolutely obliterates it for multi-threading performance when you factor in pricing. Regards the latter, this chip is literally half the price of Intel’s eight-core 6900K. Staggering. Of course, it’s still bloody expensive at £399. Moreover, you’re never actually going to feel the difference versus the plain old £329 Ryzen 7 1700. So of the initial launch chips, the 1700 is the obvious choice. It’s an awesome all-rounder for the money. However, I still think the sweet spot for most RPSers will likely be the future six-core model. It’ll crank out the same gaming performance (well, in most games) as the eight-core model, just for less money, along with both pretty snazzy multi-threading for content creation and some multi-threading headroom to come as games gradually scale better across multiple cores. Where all this leaves Intel is of course an interesting question. My sense in recent years is that readers have tired of the press bashing Intel for sandbagging, but for my money Ryzen completely confirms that narrative. It makes Intel’s product line up look cynical and overpriced. Personally, I can’t see Intel slashing prices anything like enough to offset the yawning gap between it’s six and eight-core CPUs and Ryzen. In reality, it doesn’t matter much to Intel. Desktop CPUs aren’t all that important and in any case, the likes of Dell will keep cranking out systems for mainstream punters and nobody will care much or notice much. What Intel may do is hurry up the mainstream six-core model for the LGA1151 socket that appeared on its roadmaps recently. Suitably clocked and priced, that would put Intel in a reasonable if still not ideal competitive position. In the meantime, I think enthusiasts will make something of a stampede towards Ryzen. It’s just such a compelling value proposition, even if it remains somewhat unproven. It wouldn’t surprise me to find a few bugs emerging (I hear it’s a bit pernickety when it comes to certain memory configs, for instance) or a few weak spots in its performance profile shake out as the PC community probes its capabilities. AMD is but a small company and it probably doesn’t have the manpower to completely finesse this new architecture first time around. Of course, if that’s correct the upside is that scope remains for future revisions to turn a good chip into a great one. Anyway, this is an initial hands-on, not an entirely definitive and forensic investigation. I’ll have a look at the platform / motherboard part of the Ryzen story in a future post – PCI Express connectivity with Ryzen chips is an emerging concern, for instance. Overall, Ryzen is impressive even if the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers. But if I was buying a CPU right now, it would still be the base model eight-core Ryzen. It’s not perfect and for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs. But it’s a really nice all-rounder for the money.

Fast enough single-threaded, big boost multi-threaded. And the timing’s about right for all of us on a Sandy or Ivy Bridge Core i5 (or below) to upgrade. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 16:25 blur says: Yuuuup. My 2500k is finally showing its age these days. Any CPU upgrade would necessitate motherboard and RAM as well, so the next batch of Ryzen releases definitely look like they might hit the super sweet spot. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:40 Gnoupi says: I’m actually a bit surprised to read that. The consensus on all other reviews I read is that it’s not ideal for gaming, performance wise, compared to the concurrency. And that it only passes them in “ideal” multithreaded conditions (video processing/rendering). Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:46 dangermouse76 says: My reading seems to suggest. That 1440p evens out the FPS comparisons as they push the work to the GPU. But when looking at 1080p gaming with these chips the i7 seems to have a larger margin over Ryzen. Edit: As this article seems to bare out. So yeah these chips dont blow me away for gaming. That may not be their purpose, but still. So yeah very interested to see what the Ryzen i5 competition will look like. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:16 dangermouse76 says: Also this is brand new from scratch work from AMD so optimisations from devs and AMD may help bring that gap down. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:56 Sakkura says: I wouldn’t count on big improvements, but at least the situations where SMT hurts performance should be going away. Maybe a few percent on top of that, here and there.

Where games are CPU limited, the gap is a lot more obvious. Plus there are one or two anomalies, to boot. I think you’ve probably absorbed my generally upbeat tone but ignored the detail of what I wrote.

The way language can glitch like this, causing tiny ambiguities, is really fun for me to dissect! PS almost certainly you meant “after 10pm”, and I would caution you that ’22’ is not an intuitive way for native speakers to write time. 2200, 22:00 and 10pm all read correctly :) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 11:13 Harlander says: Yeah, after 22 you should be getting ready for the Carousel. Renew! Renew! Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:31 carewolf says: Very few games push the CPU and the few that do are multithreaded. What other reviews do to make Intel look better is take something that is close to pushing the CPU but is single-threaded because it usually doesn’t matter, run it in a low resolution like 1080p and then pretend FPS over 100 matters. Then a Kaby Lake is faster than Ryzen, because it does indeed have better single threaded performance. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:29 Unclepauly says: There is much more than “a very few” games that push the cpu. When you go online multiplayer the burden on the CPU increases alot for a large percentage of games. The problem here is that online multiplayer is almost impossible to benchmark consistently. Games with a huge amount of players just compounds the issue. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:18 randomclass says: Also games like Paradox’s grand strategy games, from CK2 to HoI4. They all seem to be laggy in late game, in SP or MP, and it’s all down to CPU, not GPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:54 ravenshrike says: The issue is that the reviews are all over the place with a few more or less matching the 7700k even at 1080p, with others horribly bombing. Most of that is teething issues from the new architecture(Although the on-die memory controller throughput is a bit weak. That needs to be improved by at least 50%, preferably doubled in the next refresh). In three to six months the performance numbers will almost certainly look much better as BIOSes, opcode, and MS drivers are improved, with even some games getting patched to work with Ryzen’s quirks. You’ve got to remember that the Haswell and Broadwell and Lake chips are all very mature at this point with more similarities than differences between them. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:41 kud13 says: A few years back I picked up an AMD FX 4350- also an 8-core 4.0 Ghz base for something ridiculous like 250CAD (this was right before the dollar spiked up). The reason for AMD was I had an AMD-based mobo and I was upgrading piecemeal. Gotta say, I haven’t had any problems with any “modern” games on it since (GPU was a bottleneck for a while, but now I’m running Nvidia 1070). However, Age of Empires 2 HD (that does not support multi-threading, period) DOES make it huff and puff (as opposed to, say, Witcher 3). So I guess we still gotta wait for AMD to come up with powerful single-thread chips. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:52 Sakkura says: 8 cores? Then you mean FX-8350, the FX-4350 is 4 cores. While Ryzen is still not quite on par with Intel in single-threaded performance, it’s very close. And a HUGE upgrade over their old FX chips. We’re talking 60-80% faster. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:49 BadManiac says: I ordered my 1700X today, been waiting for this too long. I’m still gaming on my old Phenom 2 X4, and while running at a respectable 4Ghz, it’s really starting to show it’s age in some games. So for me the jump from 4 cores and 4 threads to 8 cores and 16 threads at hopefully near the same clock speed should be an enormous leap, and I won’t be completely CPU limiting my GTX 1070 any more. :D Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:32 AngoraFish says: My Phenom 2 x4 955 is still running strong and I’ve not noticed any significant CPU bottleneck on anything I play. I’ve upgraded the graphics card a couple of times since I got it, but there’s still no incentive at all for me to splash cash on a new CPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:34 Unclepauly says: The fact is that you are just used to it so don’t notice it. That CPU is has problems in a huge amount of games.

I played every single game on it, no problem. But last year I decided to buy an i5 6600. Got a new mobo, new RAM, the new CPU and a new case. Only then I noticed how obsolete the Phenom II was. I got almost double the framerate on most games. I mean, the good old Phenom II served its purpose. It allowed me to play any game I wanted. It also didn’t do that so well. And there was also a bonus. It worked as a very nice space heater! Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 23:05 Don Reba says: My main requirement from a CPU is maximum AVX2 performance, in which Ryzen lags behind Intel literally by a factor of 2, so my main hope is that competition will force Intel to add more cores and drop prices. It could be argued that I would be better served by a GPU, but, well, it’s a whole other can of worms, and I don’t want the hassle.

But I do more than just playing nothing but games on my desktop, and having 8 physical cores would be a great convenience for the VMs and the sometimes video encodes that I do. Consider me pleasantly impressed. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:07 ScubaMonster says: I’ve seen some articles about the performance comparison, but not any that factor in price at the same time. I get that it’s the cold hard numbers that matter most and these chips are going up against Intel’s offerings. But if a Ryzen chip lags a bit behind its Intel counterpart but is substantially cheaper I would consider that a win. Sure, you could pony up extra bucks if you absolutely must have the best of the best, but if you can get performance close to it for a lot cheaper, that would be a no brainer to me. I don’t know all the pricing to make a comparison myself though. I haven’t really looked at the Ryzen prices compared to their Intel equivalents. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 01:37 haldolium says: Check the chart on the bottom of the site here, it gives an impression where Ryzen stands in terms of pricing to performance: link to computerbase.de Good thing AMD catches up, but by now I am more interested in GPGPU in general since GPU based rendering has taken HUGE steps in the time AMD was figuring out the Zen and for playing games, the CPU is so seldom an issue that I couldn’t care less for the high-end market. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:49 Unclepauly says: It really does depend on the types of games a person plays though. Certain genres of games have a greater need for CPU performance while many do not. Plenty of outliers as well. Take ARMA 3 for example, Sandy bridge systems net about 30-35 fps while Kaby Lake(with very fast ram) is netting roughly 55-60 fps. Cherry picked game of course but there are others out there less documented that benefit as well. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:45 Rack says: Sadly the current scenario does Ryzen few favours. A 1700 compares poorly with an i5 7600k at £100 more. Right at the bottom of the pile the 1100 might be a reasonable budget option but all in all Ryzen looks to be a good option for 3d modelling, less so for games. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:16 ButteringSundays says: I haven’t noticed my 5 y/o i5 acting as a bottleneck anywhere I’ve noticed (the 760 is showing its age though… sometimes). Hardware fetishists are strange beasts – the money they’ll spend for an updated forum signature. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:14 Lord Zeon says: The CPU hasn’t been a bottleneck for gaming for almost a decade now. I still use a first gen Bulldozer CPU, the FX-8120, and I’ve never seen a AAA title get caught up on it with my GTX 970. Imagine that – the first of the “awful” AMD architectures that Ryzen is replacing still is entirely relevant in the enthusiast gaming space. I genuinely think that Intel’s marketing has permeated the enthusiast community to the point where everyone has lost the their reference point as to what a CPU needs to do for gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 14:03 Sakkura says: If you’re not seeing the FX-8120 limit performance, then you’re simply not looking. It definitely does. That doesn’t mean everything is unplayable on it, but it really doesn’t qualify for enthusiast gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 15:18 tehfish says: As an FX-8120 owner also, it does bottleneck the GPU in recent games, but it does depend on what GPU you have. You may just be very lucky with a well-matched GPU to go with the CPU there. For an example, with fallout4, an overclocked FX-8120 (4.2ghz, no turbo) and a R9 390: It’s perfectly playable often running happily at 1080p 60fps, then you can hit certain areas where it drops to ~20-30fps with the GPU core down to ~450mhz out of it’s maximum 1060mhz – a clear case of a CPU bottleneck. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 00:18 Etherion says: I also have a quite dated i5 760 cpu, but didn’t feel it as a bottleneck until just recently (current gpu is gtx 770 overclocked) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:45 bfar says: Way back in January last year, I had a long discussion with my peers on a UK forum over 6700k vs 5820k, as they were roughly the same price at the time. I argued that for gaming, the higher clocked 4 core CPU would be the better bet for at least a year or two. We agreed that for all other applications, the lower clocked 6 core chip was the way to go. It seems that a year later, nothing has changed, and it frames the perception of Rysen from an enthusiast perspective. It’s still a major coup for consumers though, because as Jeremy rightly points out, most of Intels chips look like poor value for money all of a sudden. Prices will fall across the board.

I’ve been running a 7 year old used i7 2600k oc’ed since 2012. To maintain 60fps minimum, the only part that I’ve had to upgrade was always the video card. Starting out on a GTX 460, then SLI 560TI to a GTX 780/970(RMA replace) and now a GTX 1070. Until my games consistently dip below 50fps on max settings with my current or newer video card, I have no real reason to upgrade yet.

Whilst it doesn’t match a 7700K, it’s a great alternative to Intel’s enthusiast class CPUs at a much lower price, and being AMD hopefully supports ECC RAM too. The problem is, I’m not convinced the enthusiast market is large enough. If you’re using virtualisation, rendering, or transcoding video it’s a huge win, but for general productivity and games this isn’t on the radar and probably never will be. Neither are any of Intel’s chips with more than four cores. They also haven’t talked up any virtualisation support, other than encrypted memory. They could do much more in this area if they wanted to. Roll on four fast core versions of Ryzen.. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

The contest is a good place to spot the talent for the next generation of games. Carnegie Mellon won the prize for best gameplay in a national bake-off that pitted students from 12 college teams with student game projects. The Carnegie Mellon team created a zany title called Beat Step Cowboys, a turn-based game where two cowboys duel on a pseudo chess board. In gameplay, second place went to Mouse House by SMU Guild Hall. Third place went to Kyon by the Savannah College of Art & Design. The University of Wisconsin Stout won for best visuals with Everend, a 3D puzzle platformer. In visuals, second place went to Beat Step Cowboys by Carnegie Mellon. Third place went to Channeler by the University of Central Florida/FIEA. Above: The University of Wisconsin Stout wins for best visuals at Intel University contest.

Here are the descriptions of the projects. I’ve also put my comments after each game description. Carnegie Mellon University Above: Beatstep Cowboys Image Credit: Carnegie Mellon University Project Name: Beatstep Cowboys Project Description: You are in the duel of your life. You have four beats to decide what moves to make. Your opponent is making their move. What do you do? This is the life of the Beatstep Cowboys. In this quirky wild west duel, players quickly plan moves that are then carried out simultaneously to the beat of the music. Read your foes’ mind, make quick decisions, and shoot them before they shoot you. Team Members: Amy Stewart, Minoong “J.D.” Ji, Xuelai “King Kong” Zhang. Comments: This title was a hilarious blend of a gunslinger duel and a chess game. The music was paced to increase the tension of the duel. Rochester Institute of Technology Above: Magnolia Image Credit: DigiPen Project Name: Magnolia Project Description: Magnolia is an interactive story dedicated to the memory of a three-year-old girl where you play as her experiencing things she loved in her real life. This experience comes to life with dialogue narrated by Magnolia’s father and her sister. Team Members: Mark Moukarzel, Aji Suprana, Deepak Chennakkadan, Manas Kulkarni, Kim yoon young, Hsi-Hung Shih, and Justin Jacox. Comments: This game was made in the memory of a girl who died. The team said it was an emotional rollercoaster to make the game over eight months. It had a touching song as its soundtrack. It reminded me of That Dragon, Cancer. Drexel University Above: Sole Image Credit: Gossamer Games Project Name: Sole Project Description: Sole is an abstract, aesthetic-driven adventure game where you play as the only source of light in a world shrouded in darkness. Wander through desolate environments, painting the land with light as you discover its mysterious past. Explore the remnants of great cities and uncover the history of an ancient civilization on your journey to restore life to an abandoned world. Team Members: Nabeel Ansari, Nina DeLucia, Vincent De Tommaso, and Thomas Sharpe. Comment: This game was pretty, and it reminded me of titles from Thatgamecompany, like Flower or Journey. New York University Above: Consume me Image Credit: Jenny Jiao Hsia Project Name: Consume Me Project Description: Dieting is awkward and strange. It’s empowering sometimes, horrible sometimes, and we need a conversation with nuance and honesty. Consume Me is a darkly humorous personal game about my relationship with food and my body. These prototypes are part of a larger experience that draws on my past with disordered eating. Fit, slap, and control are just some of the ways the player experiences this dieting mindset expressed through mechanics. Team Members: Jenny Jiao Hsia. Comment: This game has a noble purpose of teaching people to learn how to eat on a good diet and accept their bodies. Rochester Institute of Technology Above: Gibraltar Image Credit: RIT Project Name: Gibraltar Project Description: Gibraltar: a lunch-time strategy game. Claim victory for your faction as you move adorable robots around a board in an attempt to capture territory and vanquish your enemy.

This unique take on strategy games and board games allows players more freedom in crafting their own strategies and experiences. Team Members: John Miller, Danielle Carmi, Elena Mihajlov, and Angela Muscariello. Comments: This title was an ode to old turn-based strategy games. It was funny that the creator, who had been working on it more than three years, no longer remembered why he called it Gibraltar. Savannah College of Art and Design Above: Kyon Image Credit: SCAD Project Name: Kyon Project Description: Kyon is a top-down, third-person action/adventure game set in mythological Ancient Greece.

In this alternate-day dystopia, the player takes on the role of a no-name employee at the Department of Cyber Police and Security: a division of the government tasked with monitoring all domestic communications within “The Nation.” After obtaining a warrant from an automated database extraction system, the player is granted access to their target’s Desktop in order to collect incriminating evidence to prove the target’s guilt. But when the line between criminality and the everyday struggle is blurred, the player must look to their own conscience to arrest or exonerate the targets he or she is surveilling. In all, Perfect Citizen seeks to take the player on a thought provoking journey through the personal lives of imperfect citizens in order to push the bounds of games as a storytelling medium and create a tense yet intimate gameplay experience that directly engages with the conversation of privacy and security. Team Members: Mark Biundo, Alex Vincent, Andy Baden, Brandon Gomez, Daniel Luna, Michael Lowe, Nader Sleem, Jason Brisson, Austin Enoch, and Pilar Costabl.

The Sooner Intel, created by Bob Przybylo in 2011, is an inside look into Oklahoma football and basketball recruiting and is solely for Sooners Illustrated subscribers. It is a sneak peek into what’s happening with OU recruiting and is not to be distributed anywhere else. Sunday could become a huge day for Oklahoma recruiting if Tulsa (Okla.) Union safety Patrick Fields does indeed pick the Sooners. http://www.scout.com/player/209431-patrick-fields?s=73 Not only does it end nearly seven months without a pledge for 2018, but it does absolutely feel like it could be setting the tone for a major March coming up in Norman for #SavageTeam2K18. Fields announced Monday evening his final three of OU, Texas and TCU. Although there is no doubt at all his trip to Austin last weekend was sensational, the prevailing thought in speaking to numerous sources and the gut feel of Sooners Illustrated is OU will be the choice. Fields is going to make his selection Sunday afternoon following the Dallas Opening regional event in Frisco, Texas. Not sure the exact particulars of how he’s going to do it, but that remained his intention as of Thursday. Ranked No. 6 in Sooners Illustrated’s OKPreps top 25 and a high three-star safety, Fields’ potential commitment would once again be a sign of OU keeping its top in-state priorities home. Yes, there are times when OU makes an offer to someone from within the state and the prospect goes elsewhere. It does occur, but not usually when OU vies so hard to acknowledge that recruit as early as it did with Fields. Defensive backs coach Kerry Cooks has put in the time and effort throughout this process to make sure Fields becomes the next Redskin in OU’s secondary, joining 2017 signee Tre Brown. Fields became a name to circle in the spring last year and then was officially offered at the #ChampUBBQ in late July. The way Fields played his junior season justified the offer and ranking and then some as Fields was an integral part in Union earning the state championship. Looking at it from OU’s side of things, again, the seeds have been planted with several prospects and now it’s time to start reaping those rewards. OU learned from #SoonerSquad17 how crucial it is to not only have a good chunk of early commitments but to also have at least a few of those guys be ringleaders and vocal guys and guys respected by peers and top recruits nationwide. Nobody is disputing the talent of Brey Walker or Cameron Rising, but Fields fits it perfectly in terms of being good enough on the field with the respect enough on the trail from top-level recruits to listen to what he has to say. He can help anchor the class and start recruiting for #ST2K18. And when you look at the group, it is one that should get significantly bigger in the next few months. Sooners Illustrated has already predicted March commitments from: *Bradenton (Fla.) IMG Academy RB T.J. Pledger *Mansfield (Texas) High’s S Cam’ron Jones *Tulsa Union DT Jordan Kelley If the Sooners pull off that trio to go with Fields, it would put OU at seven commits heading into April with five of them in the Scout 300 and three of them (Walker, Pledger, Rising) in the Scout 100. That doesn’t even take into consideration certain in-state prospects OU has already put itself in great position with like Putnam City’s Ron Tatum and Midwest City’s Jalen Redmond. OU locked down its borders in 2017 with all five in the Scout 300 and six signees overall. Walker is in the bag, and if OU can lock down Fields on Sunday afternoon, the trend could continue in a hurry.   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout Video: 2019 OU commit Theo Wease Sooners Illustrated Chat - March 6, 2017 Sooners earn win on senior day OU Opening regional review: Commits Przybylo: Opening regional review Share & Embed Patrick Fields commits to OU Full Story Sooners Illustrated Top Stories Przybylo: Opening regional review Sooners Illustrated breaks down The Opening regional in Frisco, Texas. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedYesterday at 9:49 AM OU Opening regional review: Commits A look at what OU's commits did at Sunday's Opening regional in Frisco, Texas. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedYesterday at 8:58 AM Breaking News Patrick Fields commits to OUOU adds No. 4 for 2018 class with three-star safety Patrick Fields. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedSunday at 2:30 PM Sooners earn win on senior dayOU earned a win on senior night, 73-68, vs. TCU. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedSaturday at 2:20 PM Jalen Redmond set for whirlwind weekend Intel returns with an update on Jalen Redmond, who has one busy weekend ahead of him. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedFriday at 6:09 AM OU 17-for-2017: Caleb Kelly's potential?

Frankel March 3 Follow @tcfrankel A Donald Trump campaign sign remains atop a pile of gravel in Harrisburg, Penn, where Foxconn said in 2013 it’d build a $30 million factory. It didn’t happen, but more promises have returned. “Foxconn is going to spend a tremendous amount of money on building a massive plant,” Trump said, “and probably more than one.” (Mark Makela/For The Washington Post) HARRISBURG, Pa. — For some residents of this small city, there was something familiar about Foxconn’s recently announced plan to hire up to 50,000 U.S. workers, one of the many hiring pledges from companies rounded up by President Trump in the first weeks of his administration. The only difference was the scale. In 2013, Foxconn’s chairman sent a jolt through this state capital when he said his company — best known for making Apple iPhones in China — would invest $30 million and hire 500 workers for a new high-tech factory in central Pennsylvania. Locals were giddy. Foxconn had a small office here, but this seemed like the start of an entire new industry. Pennsylvania’s governor boasted about the deal. The Brookings Institution think tank hailed Foxconn’s decision as a sign of U.S. manufacturing’s strength. But the factory was never built. The jobs never came. “It just seemed to fade to black” after the announcement, recalled a local official. It was the start of a mystery, created by a chief executive known to promise projects all over the world that never quite pan out. Yet few people seem to notice. Foxconn and others continue to get credit for deals that never take place. In December, Pennsylvania’s economic development staff was still touting the $30 million factory that never was. What happened in Harrisburg provides a skeptical lens for viewing the waves of corporate investment promises being used by Trump as evidence that he is following through on his campaign pledge to reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing. “I’m delivering on everything we promised,” Trump said last month during a meeting with manufacturing executives at the White House, noting how firms have announced new hiring and factories. “People are saying they’ve never seen so much happen in 30 days of a presidency.” Foxconn, for example, announced shortly after Trump’s election that it plans to invest $7 billion and hire up to 50,000 workers in the United States. Such a hiring spree would catapult Foxconn from a couple thousand U.S. workers to a major employer on par with Chrysler. Other companies, too, including SoftBank, Alibaba, Intel and IBM, have made an unusual display of loudly announcing their intentions to invest in the United States — all with price tags in the billions of dollars and the promise of tens of thousands of jobs — much to Trump’s delight. David Black, head of the Harrisburg Regional Chamber of Commerce said FoxConn’s earlier promise to build a plant created “intense buzz” in the town. (Mark Makela/For The Washington Post) “Foxconn is going to spend a tremendous amount of money on building a massive plant,” Trump said the day after the investment was revealed, “and probably more than one.” But, as Harrisburg learned, the gulf between these eye-popping announcements and what takes place on the ground can be huge — and frequently overlooked. “They are scrambling to look good,” Mark Selden, senior research associate at Cornell University’s East Asian program, said. “It’s a sign of the pressure that Trump is placing on everyone in the world to deliver on his agenda.” Companies tend to view these announcements as an opening bid in a negotiation, said Alberto Moel, a senior analyst with Bernstein Research in Hong Kong. Firms know politicians like the splashy headlines. And if everything falls into place — the business climate improves, they extract enough concessions such as tax breaks and free land — they might be able to make it happen. “It actually puts the onus on the U.S. in a way,” Moel said. “They are saying: ‘I’m along for the ride. Here’s my proposal.’ ” If the deal falls apart, as it often does, no one is going to talk about it. “The government themselves aren’t going to remind you of that, Trump has no intention of helping you remember that,” Moel said. “What’s the downside?” Trump is far from alone in using corporate announcements as political backdrops. It’s why ribbon-cuttings and ceremonial shovels exist. In 2012, President Barack Obama visited a new $5 billion Intel computer chip plant in Chandler, Ariz., citing it as “an example of an America that is within our reach.” But the facility, known as Fab 42, was never completed. Last week, Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich stood in the Oval Office with Trump to announce a $7 billion investment — essentially, Fab 42 was back on track, with a new price tag and a new president. Trump tweeted his praise. (Video: Reuters / Photo: AP) Even before he was sworn in, it was clear Trump placed greater importance on these job announcements than past administrations. Among the first signs came in December when Tokyo-based SoftBank’s chief executive, Masayoshi Son, stood with the president-elect to announce a plan to invest $50 billion and create 50,000 new U.S. jobs. Two days after Trump’s inauguration, Foxconn chief executive Terry Gou told reporters in Taiwan that his company planned to spend $7 billion on a U.S. factory to make computer displays. It wasn’t iPhones — which Trump has said he wants to be “Made in the USA” — but Gou said the factory could create 30,000 to 50,000 U.S. jobs. Details were few, but one clue seized on was the presence of a Pennsylvania state trade representative at Gou’s talk. Foxconn said in a statement that it is “exploring a potential investment that would represent an expansion of our current U.S. operations.” But the company could not confirm “the number of jobs that might be created.” Foxconn is a coveted hardware manufacturer because of its size. Last year, it reported $136 billion in revenue. It has more than 1 million employees, mostly in China. A single factory making iPhones or LCD screens can employ tens of thousands of workers. When Foxconn says it will invest in a new plant, the decision can transform a region. That’s why countries all over the world are eager to lure Foxconn to their shores. Gou, Foxconn’s founder, for years has described the United States as a “must-go market.” In 2014, as the Pennsylvania deal was quietly dying, Gou teased the opening of a LCD display factory in the states. His company talked with officials in Colorado and Arizona. Nothing happened. That same year, the company signed a letter of intent to invest up to $1 billion in Indonesia. That investment still has not occurred. Foxconn said it would invest $5 billion over five years in India as part of an ambitious expansion in 2014. The deal would create up to 50,000 jobs, Gou said. But Foxconn’s investment in India has amounted to only a small fraction of what it originally promised. Similar results were seen in Vietnam, where Foxconn committed to a $5 billion investment in 2007, and in Brazil, where Foxconn spoke of a $10 billion plan in 2011. The company made its first major foray in Vietnam only last year. In Brazil, Foxconn has an iPhone factory, but its investment has fallen far short of expectations. “There’s a pattern here,” said Moel, the analyst. Gou’s plans for Harrisburg were revealed in 2013 while he was in the United States on a tour with other Taiwanese business officials to, in part, drum up support for Taiwan’s bid to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership, known as TPP. (Coincidentally, Trump pulled the United States out of the trade treaty in his first days in office.) It was a surprise when Gou said Foxconn planned to invest $30 million over two years in a factory to make technology equipment and servers. Gou noted his company’s history in Harrisburg. He said the goal was to create “high-precision, high-tech, high value-added manufacturing in the U.S.” Gou also said Foxconn would donate $10 million to Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh for robotics research. “IPhone maker Foxconn to invest $40 million in the US,” wrote the China Post. “Foxconn to build plant in Pennsylvania,” CNN said. Local media quoted state officials as saying Gou would sign a memorandum of understanding and the company was busy scouting sites. “There was this intense buzz,” recalled David Black, president of the Harrisburg Regional Chamber. “Lots of us were excited by the opportunity,” said Bub Manning, who at the time co-owned a local construction firm. “Anytime something of that size comes along in central Pennsylvania, that’s a big deal.” In 2013, Foxconn’s chairman sent a jolt through this state capital when he said his company — best known for making Apple iPhones in China — would invest $30 million and hire 500 workers for a new high-tech factory in central Pennsylvania. (Mark Makela/For The Washington Post) For years, Foxconn has maintained an office with about 50 workers in Harrisburg, a hub of the computer connector industry. The office is in an old brick warehouse. On a recent visit, the building was filled by a half-empty warren of cubicles. A worker declined to comment to a reporter with The Washington Post. According to local government officials, Foxconn has not done any permitted alterations to the building in 15 years. Manning recalled how his firm tried to chase down information about the planned $30 million factory. “It felt like I was grabbing Jell-O. It never got any traction,” Manning said. The $30 million factory faded from view. Foxconn said its $10 million donation to Carnegie Mellon was “moving forward very successfully,” with half of the funds having been spent four years later. The school declined to comment. None of this has stopped the praise for Foxconn’s investment in Pennsylvania. Recent stories have referred to the phantom factory as a sign of Foxconn’s U.S. beachhead. A state economic development official wrote about Foxconn’s $30 million factory as evidence of foreign companies that operate in the Keystone State. (The piece was fixed after The Washington Post inquired about it.) State officials toured potential sites with Foxconn representatives, the state Department of Community and Economic Development said in a statement. “Unfortunately, a project did not come to fruition.” Foxconn attributed the failure to “material changes to the business and operating climate at that time.” “The proof is always in the pudding,” said Scott Andes, a senior policy analyst at Brookings. The assumption is that companies follow through on major announcements. “But it is important to be skeptical,” Andes said. “I would hope it’s not just smoke and mirrors with Foxconn or any other of these companies.” Feeling burned by the fate of the $30 million factory, some in Harrisburg are cautious about getting their hopes up again. “We learned something from that,” said Black of the Harrisburg chamber. But, Manning said, it would be hard to not be seduced by the size of Foxconn’s ambition, real or not. “If you smelled a project like that,” he said, “you’d get excited even though you know better.” Read more: What happened when a pro-Trump county discovered it was a ‘sanctuary city’ If Trump wants pipes built in America, what does that mean?

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Making AMD great again! Home Hardware Hands on with AMD’s fab new Ryzen CPU By Jeremy Laird on March 2nd, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Rejoice, for AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is here. And it’s good. Thank science for that. Another dud from AMD didn’t bear thinking about. Instead, we get to ponder just how good Ryzen is and indeed how good it truly needs to be. It isn’t the very fastest CPU money can buy or the greatest gaming CPU ever. But that’s just dandy. It’s still going to blow the PC processor market wide open and force Intel to seriously up its game. If you want the background to AMD’s new chip and a broad overview on what makes it tick, head over here. The task this week is to get a quick feel for what Ryzen is actually like. The chip I’ve played with briefly is the middling model of the launch trio, the Ryzen 7 1700X. Like the other two Ryzen chips AMD is making available at launch, it’s an eight-core beast that crunches two software threads per core. Hexa-core and quad-core models are coming, but aren’t quite ready for launch day. The 1700X clocks in nominally at 3.4GHz with a potential 3.8GHz turbo mode. The ‘X’ suffix, incidentally means it sports AMD’s new XFR auto-overclocking feature, a bit more on which in a moment. For the record the other two chips are the 3.0GHz/3.7GHz 1700 and the 3.6GHz/4GHz 1800X. Pricing for the 1700X is £399. The 1800X rocks in around £499 and the 1700 is yours for £329. Stick a $ sign in front of those numbers and you have the US price, which is both impressive and depressing depending on your point of view. Without further ado, then, let’s get busy. I couldn’t resist firing up the fairly pointless Cinebench synthetic benchmark first, just to see those 16 threads in action. Fly my pretties: Not that it matters much for the real world, but this thing flies in a multi-threaded benchmark like Cinebench. To give you a feel for just how quick it is, it’s nearly two and a half times faster than the incumbent gamer’s choice, the Intel Core i5-7600K. Yowsers. Of course, multi-threading is only half – or should that be 15/16ths – of the story. AMD’s big failure with its previous FX processors was single-threaded performance and it just so happens that games are particularly sensitive to just that. In Cinebench’s single-threaded mode, the Ryzen 7 1700X is between 10 and 20 per cent slower than various gaming-relevant Intel CPUs, with about 10% of that due to a slight comparative deficiency in Ryzen’s architecture and the other 10% thanks to clockspeed. Indeed, it was rumoured prior to launch that clock-for-clock and core-for-core, Ryzen would be roughly a match for Intel’s Haswell-generation chips – the Core iSomething 4000 series chips, in other words. And so it proves in Cinebench. Anyway, I mucked around with a few other canned benchmarks, all of which delivered similar kinds of results. Ryzen monsters quad-core Intel chips in multi-threading. In fact, it’s on about a par with Intel’s own eight-core beast, the 6900K for multithreading. Lest you have forgotten, that’s more or less a £1,000 chip. But what, you cry, of games? Don’t panic, the news here is decent, too, if somewhat preliminary and indeed patchy. You can read detailed benchmarks elsewhere, but to give you one example, in Total War: Attila using the same video card and settings, the Ryzen 1700X cranks out an average of 39 frames per second to 40 from a Core i5-7600K. I got similar results in several other titles. The first caveat to that is that I was running everything at 1440p and high detail settings, which tends to push things towards being GPU limited, even on an Nvidia GTX 1080. The handful of games I ran may also have somewhat flattered Ryzen. Among others, Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games. Part of that is clockspeed, part of it is architecture and part is probably optimisation. You can be sure that few if any games exist that have been compiled to run well on Ryzen. Really broadly, then, Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. If you want to game and stream your exploits at the same time, for instance, Ryzen looks like a killer solution. But a high clocked six-core Ryzen of the near future might be the best AMD bet for gamers. If there is a disappointment, it’s overclocking. All Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked for easy overclocking. But to cut a long story short, they don’t overclock. Well, barely. I squeezed an extra 100MHz out of my chip and that was with water cooling. M’colleagues elsewhere in the reviewersphere report similar findings. Oh, and the XFR auto-overclocking feature doesn’t improve on that. It may be of interest in future when Ryzen chips with more headroom appear. For now, it’s fairly redundant. That said, the 1700X I tested tended to max out at only 3.5GHz in multi-threaded workloads when running at standard rather than overclocked settings rather than the 3.8GHz promised by the chip’s turbo mode. So, that 100MHz overclock was actually more like 400MHz in practice. But I’m not sure I actually care. My feeling coming in was that if Ryzen really was roughly on a par with Haswell and ran at about 3.5GHz, that would be plenty to put the frighteners on Intel. It does just that, so frankly I for one am satisfied. Incidentally, if you’re wondering about operating temps, have a scan of the web. I was only able to run my test chip with water cooling, so the 41 degrees C idle and 51 degrees under load aren’t hugely helpful for the bulk of us that run fairly standard air coolers. What we have then is a chip that isn’t far off Intel for gaming and absolutely obliterates it for multi-threading performance when you factor in pricing. Regards the latter, this chip is literally half the price of Intel’s eight-core 6900K. Staggering. Of course, it’s still bloody expensive at £399. Moreover, you’re never actually going to feel the difference versus the plain old £329 Ryzen 7 1700. So of the initial launch chips, the 1700 is the obvious choice. It’s an awesome all-rounder for the money. However, I still think the sweet spot for most RPSers will likely be the future six-core model. It’ll crank out the same gaming performance (well, in most games) as the eight-core model, just for less money, along with both pretty snazzy multi-threading for content creation and some multi-threading headroom to come as games gradually scale better across multiple cores. Where all this leaves Intel is of course an interesting question. My sense in recent years is that readers have tired of the press bashing Intel for sandbagging, but for my money Ryzen completely confirms that narrative. It makes Intel’s product line up look cynical and overpriced. Personally, I can’t see Intel slashing prices anything like enough to offset the yawning gap between it’s six and eight-core CPUs and Ryzen. In reality, it doesn’t matter much to Intel. Desktop CPUs aren’t all that important and in any case, the likes of Dell will keep cranking out systems for mainstream punters and nobody will care much or notice much. What Intel may do is hurry up the mainstream six-core model for the LGA1151 socket that appeared on its roadmaps recently. Suitably clocked and priced, that would put Intel in a reasonable if still not ideal competitive position. In the meantime, I think enthusiasts will make something of a stampede towards Ryzen. It’s just such a compelling value proposition, even if it remains somewhat unproven. It wouldn’t surprise me to find a few bugs emerging (I hear it’s a bit pernickety when it comes to certain memory configs, for instance) or a few weak spots in its performance profile shake out as the PC community probes its capabilities. AMD is but a small company and it probably doesn’t have the manpower to completely finesse this new architecture first time around. Of course, if that’s correct the upside is that scope remains for future revisions to turn a good chip into a great one. Anyway, this is an initial hands-on, not an entirely definitive and forensic investigation. I’ll have a look at the platform / motherboard part of the Ryzen story in a future post – PCI Express connectivity with Ryzen chips is an emerging concern, for instance. Overall, Ryzen is impressive even if the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers. But if I was buying a CPU right now, it would still be the base model eight-core Ryzen. It’s not perfect and for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs. But it’s a really nice all-rounder for the money.

The consensus on all other reviews I read is that it’s not ideal for gaming, performance wise, compared to the concurrency. And that it only passes them in “ideal” multithreaded conditions (video processing/rendering). Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:46 dangermouse76 says: My reading seems to suggest. That 1440p evens out the FPS comparisons as they push the work to the GPU. But when looking at 1080p gaming with these chips the i7 seems to have a larger margin over Ryzen. Edit: As this article seems to bare out. So yeah these chips dont blow me away for gaming. That may not be their purpose, but still. So yeah very interested to see what the Ryzen i5 competition will look like. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:16 dangermouse76 says: Also this is brand new from scratch work from AMD so optimisations from devs and AMD may help bring that gap down.

Where games are CPU limited, the gap is a lot more obvious. Plus there are one or two anomalies, to boot. I think you’ve probably absorbed my generally upbeat tone but ignored the detail of what I wrote.

Renew! Renew! Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:31 carewolf says: Very few games push the CPU and the few that do are multithreaded. What other reviews do to make Intel look better is take something that is close to pushing the CPU but is single-threaded because it usually doesn’t matter, run it in a low resolution like 1080p and then pretend FPS over 100 matters. Then a Kaby Lake is faster than Ryzen, because it does indeed have better single threaded performance. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:29 Unclepauly says: There is much more than “a very few” games that push the cpu. When you go online multiplayer the burden on the CPU increases alot for a large percentage of games. The problem here is that online multiplayer is almost impossible to benchmark consistently. Games with a huge amount of players just compounds the issue. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:18 randomclass says: Also games like Paradox’s grand strategy games, from CK2 to HoI4. They all seem to be laggy in late game, in SP or MP, and it’s all down to CPU, not GPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:54 ravenshrike says: The issue is that the reviews are all over the place with a few more or less matching the 7700k even at 1080p, with others horribly bombing. Most of that is teething issues from the new architecture(Although the on-die memory controller throughput is a bit weak. That needs to be improved by at least 50%, preferably doubled in the next refresh). In three to six months the performance numbers will almost certainly look much better as BIOSes, opcode, and MS drivers are improved, with even some games getting patched to work with Ryzen’s quirks. You’ve got to remember that the Haswell and Broadwell and Lake chips are all very mature at this point with more similarities than differences between them. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:41 kud13 says: A few years back I picked up an AMD FX 4350- also an 8-core 4.0 Ghz base for something ridiculous like 250CAD (this was right before the dollar spiked up). The reason for AMD was I had an AMD-based mobo and I was upgrading piecemeal. Gotta say, I haven’t had any problems with any “modern” games on it since (GPU was a bottleneck for a while, but now I’m running Nvidia 1070). However, Age of Empires 2 HD (that does not support multi-threading, period) DOES make it huff and puff (as opposed to, say, Witcher 3). So I guess we still gotta wait for AMD to come up with powerful single-thread chips. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:52 Sakkura says: 8 cores? Then you mean FX-8350, the FX-4350 is 4 cores. While Ryzen is still not quite on par with Intel in single-threaded performance, it’s very close. And a HUGE upgrade over their old FX chips. We’re talking 60-80% faster.

It could be argued that I would be better served by a GPU, but, well, it’s a whole other can of worms, and I don’t want the hassle.

I get that it’s the cold hard numbers that matter most and these chips are going up against Intel’s offerings. But if a Ryzen chip lags a bit behind its Intel counterpart but is substantially cheaper I would consider that a win. Sure, you could pony up extra bucks if you absolutely must have the best of the best, but if you can get performance close to it for a lot cheaper, that would be a no brainer to me. I don’t know all the pricing to make a comparison myself though. I haven’t really looked at the Ryzen prices compared to their Intel equivalents.

Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:49 Unclepauly says: It really does depend on the types of games a person plays though. Certain genres of games have a greater need for CPU performance while many do not. Plenty of outliers as well. Take ARMA 3 for example, Sandy bridge systems net about 30-35 fps while Kaby Lake(with very fast ram) is netting roughly 55-60 fps. Cherry picked game of course but there are others out there less documented that benefit as well. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:45 Rack says: Sadly the current scenario does Ryzen few favours. A 1700 compares poorly with an i5 7600k at £100 more. Right at the bottom of the pile the 1100 might be a reasonable budget option but all in all Ryzen looks to be a good option for 3d modelling, less so for games.

Imagine that – the first of the “awful” AMD architectures that Ryzen is replacing still is entirely relevant in the enthusiast gaming space. I genuinely think that Intel’s marketing has permeated the enthusiast community to the point where everyone has lost the their reference point as to what a CPU needs to do for gaming.

That doesn’t mean everything is unplayable on it, but it really doesn’t qualify for enthusiast gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 15:18 tehfish says: As an FX-8120 owner also, it does bottleneck the GPU in recent games, but it does depend on what GPU you have. You may just be very lucky with a well-matched GPU to go with the CPU there. For an example, with fallout4, an overclocked FX-8120 (4.2ghz, no turbo) and a R9 390: It’s perfectly playable often running happily at 1080p 60fps, then you can hit certain areas where it drops to ~20-30fps with the GPU core down to ~450mhz out of it’s maximum 1060mhz – a clear case of a CPU bottleneck.

I argued that for gaming, the higher clocked 4 core CPU would be the better bet for at least a year or two. We agreed that for all other applications, the lower clocked 6 core chip was the way to go. It seems that a year later, nothing has changed, and it frames the perception of Rysen from an enthusiast perspective. It’s still a major coup for consumers though, because as Jeremy rightly points out, most of Intels chips look like poor value for money all of a sudden. Prices will fall across the board.

Starting out on a GTX 460, then SLI 560TI to a GTX 780/970(RMA replace) and now a GTX 1070. Until my games consistently dip below 50fps on max settings with my current or newer video card, I have no real reason to upgrade yet.

Whilst it doesn’t match a 7700K, it’s a great alternative to Intel’s enthusiast class CPUs at a much lower price, and being AMD hopefully supports ECC RAM too. The problem is, I’m not convinced the enthusiast market is large enough. If you’re using virtualisation, rendering, or transcoding video it’s a huge win, but for general productivity and games this isn’t on the radar and probably never will be. Neither are any of Intel’s chips with more than four cores. They also haven’t talked up any virtualisation support, other than encrypted memory. They could do much more in this area if they wanted to. Roll on four fast core versions of Ryzen.. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Rejoice, for AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is here. And it’s good. Thank science for that. Another dud from AMD didn’t bear thinking about. Instead, we get to ponder just how good Ryzen is and indeed how good it truly needs to be. It isn’t the very fastest CPU money can buy or the greatest gaming CPU ever. But that’s just dandy. It’s still going to blow the PC processor market wide open and force Intel to seriously up its game. If you want the background to AMD’s new chip and a broad overview on what makes it tick, head over here. The task this week is to get a quick feel for what Ryzen is actually like. The chip I’ve played with briefly is the middling model of the launch trio, the Ryzen 7 1700X. Like the other two Ryzen chips AMD is making available at launch, it’s an eight-core beast that crunches two software threads per core. Hexa-core and quad-core models are coming, but aren’t quite ready for launch day. The 1700X clocks in nominally at 3.4GHz with a potential 3.8GHz turbo mode. The ‘X’ suffix, incidentally means it sports AMD’s new XFR auto-overclocking feature, a bit more on which in a moment. For the record the other two chips are the 3.0GHz/3.7GHz 1700 and the 3.6GHz/4GHz 1800X. Pricing for the 1700X is £399. The 1800X rocks in around £499 and the 1700 is yours for £329. Stick a $ sign in front of those numbers and you have the US price, which is both impressive and depressing depending on your point of view. Without further ado, then, let’s get busy. I couldn’t resist firing up the fairly pointless Cinebench synthetic benchmark first, just to see those 16 threads in action. Fly my pretties: Not that it matters much for the real world, but this thing flies in a multi-threaded benchmark like Cinebench. To give you a feel for just how quick it is, it’s nearly two and a half times faster than the incumbent gamer’s choice, the Intel Core i5-7600K. Yowsers. Of course, multi-threading is only half – or should that be 15/16ths – of the story. AMD’s big failure with its previous FX processors was single-threaded performance and it just so happens that games are particularly sensitive to just that. In Cinebench’s single-threaded mode, the Ryzen 7 1700X is between 10 and 20 per cent slower than various gaming-relevant Intel CPUs, with about 10% of that due to a slight comparative deficiency in Ryzen’s architecture and the other 10% thanks to clockspeed. Indeed, it was rumoured prior to launch that clock-for-clock and core-for-core, Ryzen would be roughly a match for Intel’s Haswell-generation chips – the Core iSomething 4000 series chips, in other words. And so it proves in Cinebench. Anyway, I mucked around with a few other canned benchmarks, all of which delivered similar kinds of results. Ryzen monsters quad-core Intel chips in multi-threading. In fact, it’s on about a par with Intel’s own eight-core beast, the 6900K for multithreading. Lest you have forgotten, that’s more or less a £1,000 chip. But what, you cry, of games? Don’t panic, the news here is decent, too, if somewhat preliminary and indeed patchy. You can read detailed benchmarks elsewhere, but to give you one example, in Total War: Attila using the same video card and settings, the Ryzen 1700X cranks out an average of 39 frames per second to 40 from a Core i5-7600K. I got similar results in several other titles. The first caveat to that is that I was running everything at 1440p and high detail settings, which tends to push things towards being GPU limited, even on an Nvidia GTX 1080. The handful of games I ran may also have somewhat flattered Ryzen. Among others, Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games. Part of that is clockspeed, part of it is architecture and part is probably optimisation. You can be sure that few if any games exist that have been compiled to run well on Ryzen. Really broadly, then, Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. If you want to game and stream your exploits at the same time, for instance, Ryzen looks like a killer solution. But a high clocked six-core Ryzen of the near future might be the best AMD bet for gamers. If there is a disappointment, it’s overclocking. All Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked for easy overclocking. But to cut a long story short, they don’t overclock. Well, barely. I squeezed an extra 100MHz out of my chip and that was with water cooling. M’colleagues elsewhere in the reviewersphere report similar findings. Oh, and the XFR auto-overclocking feature doesn’t improve on that. It may be of interest in future when Ryzen chips with more headroom appear. For now, it’s fairly redundant. That said, the 1700X I tested tended to max out at only 3.5GHz in multi-threaded workloads when running at standard rather than overclocked settings rather than the 3.8GHz promised by the chip’s turbo mode. So, that 100MHz overclock was actually more like 400MHz in practice. But I’m not sure I actually care. My feeling coming in was that if Ryzen really was roughly on a par with Haswell and ran at about 3.5GHz, that would be plenty to put the frighteners on Intel. It does just that, so frankly I for one am satisfied. Incidentally, if you’re wondering about operating temps, have a scan of the web. I was only able to run my test chip with water cooling, so the 41 degrees C idle and 51 degrees under load aren’t hugely helpful for the bulk of us that run fairly standard air coolers. What we have then is a chip that isn’t far off Intel for gaming and absolutely obliterates it for multi-threading performance when you factor in pricing. Regards the latter, this chip is literally half the price of Intel’s eight-core 6900K. Staggering. Of course, it’s still bloody expensive at £399. Moreover, you’re never actually going to feel the difference versus the plain old £329 Ryzen 7 1700. So of the initial launch chips, the 1700 is the obvious choice. It’s an awesome all-rounder for the money. However, I still think the sweet spot for most RPSers will likely be the future six-core model. It’ll crank out the same gaming performance (well, in most games) as the eight-core model, just for less money, along with both pretty snazzy multi-threading for content creation and some multi-threading headroom to come as games gradually scale better across multiple cores. Where all this leaves Intel is of course an interesting question. My sense in recent years is that readers have tired of the press bashing Intel for sandbagging, but for my money Ryzen completely confirms that narrative. It makes Intel’s product line up look cynical and overpriced. Personally, I can’t see Intel slashing prices anything like enough to offset the yawning gap between it’s six and eight-core CPUs and Ryzen. In reality, it doesn’t matter much to Intel. Desktop CPUs aren’t all that important and in any case, the likes of Dell will keep cranking out systems for mainstream punters and nobody will care much or notice much. What Intel may do is hurry up the mainstream six-core model for the LGA1151 socket that appeared on its roadmaps recently. Suitably clocked and priced, that would put Intel in a reasonable if still not ideal competitive position. In the meantime, I think enthusiasts will make something of a stampede towards Ryzen. It’s just such a compelling value proposition, even if it remains somewhat unproven. It wouldn’t surprise me to find a few bugs emerging (I hear it’s a bit pernickety when it comes to certain memory configs, for instance) or a few weak spots in its performance profile shake out as the PC community probes its capabilities. AMD is but a small company and it probably doesn’t have the manpower to completely finesse this new architecture first time around. Of course, if that’s correct the upside is that scope remains for future revisions to turn a good chip into a great one. Anyway, this is an initial hands-on, not an entirely definitive and forensic investigation. I’ll have a look at the platform / motherboard part of the Ryzen story in a future post – PCI Express connectivity with Ryzen chips is an emerging concern, for instance. Overall, Ryzen is impressive even if the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers. But if I was buying a CPU right now, it would still be the base model eight-core Ryzen. It’s not perfect and for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs. But it’s a really nice all-rounder for the money.

What other reviews do to make Intel look better is take something that is close to pushing the CPU but is single-threaded because it usually doesn’t matter, run it in a low resolution like 1080p and then pretend FPS over 100 matters. Then a Kaby Lake is faster than Ryzen, because it does indeed have better single threaded performance. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:29 Unclepauly says: There is much more than “a very few” games that push the cpu. When you go online multiplayer the burden on the CPU increases alot for a large percentage of games. The problem here is that online multiplayer is almost impossible to benchmark consistently. Games with a huge amount of players just compounds the issue. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:18 randomclass says: Also games like Paradox’s grand strategy games, from CK2 to HoI4.

Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:54 ravenshrike says: The issue is that the reviews are all over the place with a few more or less matching the 7700k even at 1080p, with others horribly bombing. Most of that is teething issues from the new architecture(Although the on-die memory controller throughput is a bit weak. That needs to be improved by at least 50%, preferably doubled in the next refresh). In three to six months the performance numbers will almost certainly look much better as BIOSes, opcode, and MS drivers are improved, with even some games getting patched to work with Ryzen’s quirks. You’ve got to remember that the Haswell and Broadwell and Lake chips are all very mature at this point with more similarities than differences between them.

The reason for AMD was I had an AMD-based mobo and I was upgrading piecemeal. Gotta say, I haven’t had any problems with any “modern” games on it since (GPU was a bottleneck for a while, but now I’m running Nvidia 1070). However, Age of Empires 2 HD (that does not support multi-threading, period) DOES make it huff and puff (as opposed to, say, Witcher 3). So I guess we still gotta wait for AMD to come up with powerful single-thread chips. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:52 Sakkura says: 8 cores? Then you mean FX-8350, the FX-4350 is 4 cores. While Ryzen is still not quite on par with Intel in single-threaded performance, it’s very close. And a HUGE upgrade over their old FX chips. We’re talking 60-80% faster.

I got almost double the framerate on most games. I mean, the good old Phenom II served its purpose. It allowed me to play any game I wanted. It also didn’t do that so well. And there was also a bonus. It worked as a very nice space heater!

It could be argued that I would be better served by a GPU, but, well, it’s a whole other can of worms, and I don’t want the hassle.

But I do more than just playing nothing but games on my desktop, and having 8 physical cores would be a great convenience for the VMs and the sometimes video encodes that I do. Consider me pleasantly impressed. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:07 ScubaMonster says: I’ve seen some articles about the performance comparison, but not any that factor in price at the same time. I get that it’s the cold hard numbers that matter most and these chips are going up against Intel’s offerings. But if a Ryzen chip lags a bit behind its Intel counterpart but is substantially cheaper I would consider that a win. Sure, you could pony up extra bucks if you absolutely must have the best of the best, but if you can get performance close to it for a lot cheaper, that would be a no brainer to me. I don’t know all the pricing to make a comparison myself though. I haven’t really looked at the Ryzen prices compared to their Intel equivalents.

Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:49 Unclepauly says: It really does depend on the types of games a person plays though. Certain genres of games have a greater need for CPU performance while many do not. Plenty of outliers as well. Take ARMA 3 for example, Sandy bridge systems net about 30-35 fps while Kaby Lake(with very fast ram) is netting roughly 55-60 fps. Cherry picked game of course but there are others out there less documented that benefit as well. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:45 Rack says: Sadly the current scenario does Ryzen few favours. A 1700 compares poorly with an i5 7600k at £100 more. Right at the bottom of the pile the 1100 might be a reasonable budget option but all in all Ryzen looks to be a good option for 3d modelling, less so for games.

I still use a first gen Bulldozer CPU, the FX-8120, and I’ve never seen a AAA title get caught up on it with my GTX 970. Imagine that – the first of the “awful” AMD architectures that Ryzen is replacing still is entirely relevant in the enthusiast gaming space. I genuinely think that Intel’s marketing has permeated the enthusiast community to the point where everyone has lost the their reference point as to what a CPU needs to do for gaming.

That doesn’t mean everything is unplayable on it, but it really doesn’t qualify for enthusiast gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 15:18 tehfish says: As an FX-8120 owner also, it does bottleneck the GPU in recent games, but it does depend on what GPU you have. You may just be very lucky with a well-matched GPU to go with the CPU there. For an example, with fallout4, an overclocked FX-8120 (4.2ghz, no turbo) and a R9 390: It’s perfectly playable often running happily at 1080p 60fps, then you can hit certain areas where it drops to ~20-30fps with the GPU core down to ~450mhz out of it’s maximum 1060mhz – a clear case of a CPU bottleneck.

I argued that for gaming, the higher clocked 4 core CPU would be the better bet for at least a year or two. We agreed that for all other applications, the lower clocked 6 core chip was the way to go. It seems that a year later, nothing has changed, and it frames the perception of Rysen from an enthusiast perspective. It’s still a major coup for consumers though, because as Jeremy rightly points out, most of Intels chips look like poor value for money all of a sudden. Prices will fall across the board.

Whilst it doesn’t match a 7700K, it’s a great alternative to Intel’s enthusiast class CPUs at a much lower price, and being AMD hopefully supports ECC RAM too. The problem is, I’m not convinced the enthusiast market is large enough. If you’re using virtualisation, rendering, or transcoding video it’s a huge win, but for general productivity and games this isn’t on the radar and probably never will be. Neither are any of Intel’s chips with more than four cores. They also haven’t talked up any virtualisation support, other than encrypted memory. They could do much more in this area if they wanted to. Roll on four fast core versions of Ryzen.. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Attacks on Intel across different segments could help the company extend its market share gains in 2017. Harsh Chauhan (TechJunk13) Mar 3, 2017 at 8:00AM Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is giving both NVIDIA and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) a run for their money, as the latest market share numbers for graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs) indicate. Jon Peddie Research shows that AMD's overall GPU market share -- including both discrete and embedded graphics -- increased to 14.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016. That is a gain of 2.6 percentage points from the prior-year period, outpacing both its peers. Intel, meanwhile, saw its share decline 3.6 percentage points to 68.1% as consumers appear to gravitate towards powerful discrete GPUs over integrated units. The bad news for the market leader: Intel is not losing market share only in graphics processors. Image source: Advanced Micro Devices. Mercury Research points out that AMD also gained on Intel in the CPU market. Its x86 processor market share increased to 13.6% from 12.7% in 2015. On the other hand, Intel saw its market share fall accordingly to 86.3%. In 2017, both Intel and AMD will duke it out with new CPU products -- will the underdog be able to gain on Intel once again? AMD's smart strategy AMD has devised a broad strategy of tapping both the high-end and budget markets for growth. While its latest and greatest Ryzen architecture has been designed to compete in the high end segment, AMD has decided to consolidate its lower-priced offerings to meet demand from users on a budget, according to Mercury Research. As it turns out, most PC growth until 2020 will take place in emerging markets. IDC predicts that they will account for 54.3% of PC market share in 2020, compared to 51.2% last year. Currently, the GDP per capita in most emerging markets is under $10,000, including the BRIC nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China), so having budget offerings is a smart move for AMD. According to Forbes contributor Antony Leather, AMD's baseline 4-core CPU -- the Ryzen 3 1100 -- will cost $129. By comparison, Intel's entry-level Core i3-7100 Kaby Lake processor, launched this year, is selling for just under $120 at many online retailers though its specs are not quite as strong with two fewer cores. Competing at essentially the same price point, AMD is hoping to win over budget-minded consumers, giving it a leg up in this segment of the market. What about the high end? Though Intel has already launched its Kaby Lake processors, its top-of-the-line Core i7-7700K is expected to sport weaker specs than AMD's flagship Ryzen 7 1800X processor. In response, Intel is rumored to be launching its Kaby Lake-X Core i7-7740K processor in August this year. However, it will be late to the market with something that truly competes against the flagship Ryzen, which AMD is launching this month, giving it about six months to rack up sales before Intel can respond. Additionally, rumors on Taiwanese site BenchLife indicate that to tap the premium market, Intel might come out with a 10-core high-end processor that could sell for as much as $1,700. Details are sparse, but such a price point generally indicates that Intel would eclipse AMD's own top-of-the-line processor (expected to retail for $499). The gaming hardware market is expected to grow 6% annually through 2019, and the majority of that growth will take place in the high-end segment where AMD will be able to enjoy a running start.  With these impressive releases offered at competitive prices, it won't be surprising if AMD manages to steal additional market share from Intel in 2017.

The company has spent years in the proverbial desert, struggling with Bulldozer improvements while simultaneously designing its new Zen architecture. It’s no exaggeration to say AMD’s future as a PC company literally depends on Ryzen’s success. AMD has positioned Ryzen aggressively with price points that match extremely favorably with Intel’s Core i7 family and HEDT desktop parts, but there have always been questions about how well Ryzen would perform. It’s been years since AMD fielded a high performance CPU design and the company doesn’t have the same market share it once commanded. If the company is serious about pushing Ryzen into workstations, consumer PCs, and servers, it’s got a very high bar to clear. Today’s review will focus on the Ryzen 7 1800X‘s performance, rather than rehashing Ryzen’s design or architecture. Anyone with questions is invited to peruse those articles or ask in comments below. Before discussing Ryzen’s performance, however, we need to talk about its launch. Normally, a manufacturer gives us 7-10 days at minimum; the more significant the product, the longer the review window. AMD bucked this trend by launching Ryzen less than a week after we received our hardware kits. Because I’d previously committed to attend Nvidia’s GTX 1080 Ti launch at GDC, I only had 60 hours to test the Ryzen 7 1800X. AMD plans to hit Intel where it hurts — its wallet. As short as our review window was, I may have gotten lucky. In at least a few cases, reviewers didn’t receive their kits until 24-48 hours before the launch. I’ve run enough benchmarks on the Ryzen 7 1800X to feel comfortable characterizing this article as a review, but it’s also something of a hot mess. I suspect you’ll see wide variation in reported benchmarks and experiences; don’t be surprised if different people have different results. The limited testing time was exacerbated by the motherboard AMD shipped us for testing. Asus has a well-deserved reputation for quality, but my Crosshair VI Hero threw so many errors, AMD ultimately concluded I might have a bad board, not just a wonky BIOS. To be clear: I was scarcely the only reporter to experience problems or see odd performance, but our board seems to have been at the low end of the bell curve. Both Asus and AMD helped troubleshoot our problems, but the hours we devoted to this cut deeply into test time and required us to repeatedly benchmark certain tests rather than moving on to other hardware. After switching to a Gigabyte Aorus X370 motherboard I retested our game benchmarks, beginning around 12 AM this morning. While the Gigabyte motherboard did improve the situation slightly and was markedly more stable, it didn’t resolve the gaming Achilles heel I referred to in the title (we’ll be exploring that issue in greater detail below). As a result, our tests are not as thorough as we would have liked. We redesigned our CPU benchmark suite in preparation for Ryzen, but didn’t have time to run every CPU through every new test. Because we needed to test in parallel, not every CPU could be benchmarked with the same cooler or the same SSD. We chose the tests we did partly to ensure that these differences would not meaningfully impact our results, and our future deep dives into the chip will standardize on common hardware once again. With those caveats in mind, let’s check the numbers. Test setup: We’ve expanded our CPU test suite since the Core i7-7700K launched. Our Intel Core i7-6700K, 7700K, 6900K, and 6950X all used 32GB of G-Skill DDR4-3200 (F4-3200C14Q-32GTZ) clocked at that frequency. Neither of the Ryzen testbeds we tested, however, was capable of running four DIMMs at these clocks. Since we’d already tested the Intel systems, we had to make a choice: 16GB of DDR4-3200 or 32GB of DDR4-2133. Since none of our benchmarks require >16GB of RAM and AMD isn’t using quad-channel memory for Ryzen, we opted for 16GB. All of our GPU and 3D benchmarks were run using a GeForce GTX 1070. All of our game benchmarks are run at 1920×1080. While this isn’t considered an enthusiast resolution anymore, the point of these tests is to stress the CPU, not the GPU. All of our testbeds ran Windows 10 with the latest patches and updates installed. All of our GPU benchmarks were performed with Nvidia’s ForceWare 376.88. We’re going to split our benchmark results between workstation and application tests and 3D benchmarks with workstation and content creation tests up first. Our test results and analysis are in the slideshow below. As always, you can click on any slide to expand it in a new window. In workstation and computation tests, Ryzen is a beast to be reckoned with. Even when it doesn’t match Intel in raw performance, its performance-per-dollar gives it a huge advantage over its much larger, more expensive, rival. That said, there’s a narrow case to be made for chips like the Core i7-7700K, particularly in lightly threaded workloads. If you’re still dealing with single-thread or dual-threaded applications, the Core i7-7700K can still deliver the best performance per dollar. In most cases, however, the Ryzen 7 1800X is in a class of its own. That’s also true for gaming — but in very different contexts. Results like these are guaranteed to raise questions, and we’ve spoken to AMD extensively over the past few days to explore the issue. According to AMD, there are three issues collectively contributing to these problems. First, Ryzen’s SenseMi technology and Precision Boost are extremely fine-grained controls that offer significantly finer granularity than any previous AMD solution, which means BIOS implementations of these features are new and not necessarily working at 100% efficiency yet. Second, AMD has been out of the high-performance market for so long, virtually no software is written explicitly for or optimized to perform well on AMD CPUs. Ryzen puts AMD on a far better footing, but software patches don’t arrive overnight. Third, there are some games that are far more sensitive to the differences between AMD and Intel CPUs than others. We happened to pick a test suite that had more of these slowdowns in it than others, and even we don’t see it every test (Vulkan, for example, runs quite well). The other reason AMD missed it is because they chose 1440p for a minimum resolution, figuring that no one with a $500 CPU would still be gaming in 1080p. I can understand that argument even if I don’t normally find it persuasive (I prefer to keep a lower resolution to allow CPU performance to shine through). According to AMD, the difference in performance between itself and Intel is much reduced at 1440p and completely eliminated in 4K. I haven’t had the opportunity to verify those figures yet, but it does make sense — as resolution rises, the bottleneck in the system moves from the CPU to the GPU. If you game at 1440p or above, these results may not have much bearing on your experience. I had a number of conversations with AMD on the game performance question as well as discussions of board stability in general. Having tested a second motherboard, I think many of my stability and performance concerns were driven, at least in part, by faulty hardware. That said, Ryzen’s relative weakness in gaming while being such a vast improvement over the FX-9590 and offering extremely strong application/workstation performance is a bit odd. It’s possible that AMD’s heavy reliance on multi-threading, while effective in non-gaming tests, made it take a whack in game tests. This last, however, is merely speculation on my part. Last but not least, here’s a touch of icing for the proverbial cake. There is one caveat to be aware of. Remember, all of our Intel rigs used 32GB of DDR4-3200, while the AMD systems could only use 16GB of the same RAM. While this is undoubtedly having an impact on the results, it’s not going to tilt them in some crazy direction; 16GB of RAM doesn’t consume 42W of power, and that’s how much it would have to draw to bring the 1800X and 6900K into line with one another. Even with this caveat in mind, when was the last time you saw AMD hitting lower power consumption figures than Intel? Conclusions We still have plenty of questions about Ryzen and its performance, and we’ll be revisiting these topics in days to come. How strong Ryzen is, in an absolute sense, depends on where your interests lie. Evaluated strictly as a gaming chip, Ryzen is a good (but not great) option, due to its significant deficits against Intel. Evaluated as a workstation processor or 3D rendering solution, it’s extraordinary. The formal list price on the Core i7-6900K is $1089 – $1109. List price on the Ryzen R7 1800X is $500 bucks. I still think AMD should’ve held off launching until its partners had a bit more time to improve their boards, but that’s not my decision. If you’re unhappy about Ryzen’s gaming weaknesses relative to Intel, I’d suggest taking a walk down memory lane. When AMD began to gain ground on Intel in the late 1990s, it didn’t leap from budget chip manufacturing to the Athlon 64 X2 in a single bound. The K6 and K6-2 were adequate chips for budget-conscious gamers and Windows desktop software, but they weren’t going head-to-head with Intel’s Pentium II’s and winning the competition. It took years, and multiple product iterations, before the Athlon 64 was ready to tackle Intel in the server room. Given how far AMD’s market share has fallen, it’s going to take the company at least a year to build up any serious market share. I’ve said for years that Ryzen didn’t need to beat Intel in every particular, it simply needed to offer a viable alternative at a good price. Ryzen more than does that. It may not be the best chip at everything, but it’s more than good enough to help AMD win back some badly-needed market share. Even more importantly, this is a CPU core that AMD can scale up and out as the need arises. It’s great to have competition back in the CPU market.

Intel is delivering new technologies and working with industry leaders on platforms now to realize the full promise of 5G. The event, which runs from Feb. 27 to March 2 in Barcelona, Spain, focuses on the mobile communications industry. Author By New Europe The European political newspaper Up Next Huawei CEO Eric Xu shares vision for becoming video enabler for telcos Mar 3, 2017 Published 12:15 March 3, 2017 Updated 12:15 March 3, 2017 Intel demonstrates range of 5G power and versatility By New Europe The European political newspaper Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn + At the Mobile World Congress 2017, Intel highlighted new products and trials to improve LTE and 5G connectivity in collaborations with AT&T and Spreadtrum. Building on momentum of a successful trial announced in December where the launch the first 5G business customer trial at Intel’s Austin, Texas, facility was announced, AT&T announced its plans to kick off another 5G trial with Intel and Ericsson in Spring 2017. This second trial will focus on residential and small-to-medium business customers, who will be able to stream DIRECTV NOW and access next-gen entertainment and enhanced broadband services. Spreadtrum Communications launched a new 5-mode LTE system-on-chip (SoC) based on Intel Airmont architecture and 14nm process technology. Spreadtrum’s new integrated CAT 7 modem SoC (SC9861G-IA) is designed to not only be power-efficient, but with Intel® Virtualization Technology, it also supports a multi-domain security system architecture, providing security for smart devices. Spreadtrum SC9861G-IA is scheduled for mass production in the second quarter of 2017 and targets the global mid-level and premium smartphone markets. The week before, Intel also announced a 5G Innovators Initiative to brings together leading technology companies, industry leaders and academia to explore, test and innovate with 5G network and distributed edge technology in the U.S. In cooperation with Ericsson, the initiative was launched with Honeywell, GE, and the University of California, Berkeley. Asha Keddy, vice president and general manager of Next Generation Standards, Intel Communications and Devices Group, says: “5G is not simply about making smart phones faster. It’s about the machines and things that will deliver an entirely new smart and connected future. Building our 5G future requires a new approach to industry collaboration and development. The 5GI2 initiative combines technological strengths and intellectual capital from each of the participants to build step-by-step blueprints for how early applications of 5G connectivity, IoT and cloud services will bring new forms of value to multiple industries.” The 5GI2 will first focus on the Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT) and develop pilots for application of technologies including augmented and virtual reality for first responder drone surveillance of hazardous environments and other uses. The pilots will include step-by-step blueprints of the network, cloud and 5G connectivity requirements – from speed and responsiveness to security and analytics.

(list/comparison) Gaming PCs 14 Steam Machines Are Here, but Which One is for You? (list/comparison) Shawn Sanders Updated August 3, 2015 Shares It began with a Big Picture-idea. No literally! Valve’s grand scheme to snatch the rug out from under the console competition and cement themselves as the new kings of living-room gaming began with the launch of their Big Picture feature for their Steam digital distribution and social networking platform. Big Picture is a great way to play your Steam PC games in a Xbox Live-like TV-ready user interface. Now with this “Big” substantial foot in the door, Valve moves on the living room like a lioness on a gazelle–having developed a Linux-based operating software dubbed SteamOS and a unique companion controller. The haptic-heavy controller can be bought on its own and the SteamOS can be installed on any modern PC for the do-it-yourself crowd. Valve has also worked with 14 PC providers and encouraged them to build their own Steam Machines around the newly forged SteamOS to offer gamers a more hands-off approach akin to a plug-n-play PS4 or Xbox One console experience. These systems vary in size, price, performance and customization potential. Here we list them all with specs where provided. We also try offer a tiny morsel of insight for where you should focus your Steam Machine curiosity. First up…? 1. Alienware Steam Machine Valve themselves say this version of the Steam box will offer “The full potential of what a Steam Machine should be.” But price and specs are TBD. It has a familiar console-style form factor. We do know it will feature an Intel CPU and an Nvidia GPU. I’m betting those will be a GTX 780 or 780 Ti and a Haswell CPU from Intel. This is definitely one to watch coming with Valve’s seal of approval. More can’t be said until we have more pricing, specs and info on availability. Price: TBA Specs: TBD – Intel CPU and Nvidia GPU. 2. Alternate’s Steam Machine Alternate is not familiar to many so their lofty price tag will be a major hurdle for such an unproven system. Adding insult to injury, their specs are very middle of road for such an expensive system. Wait for reviews to circulate on this one, before taking the plunge. Price: $1339 Spec: Intel Core i5 4570, 1TB Solid State Hybrid Drive, Gigabyte GTX 760 GPU, 16GB of memory, HDMI-out, 4x USB and optical out. 3. CyberPowerPC CyberPowerPC did more to make their Steam Machines seem unique. They are called “Steam Machine A” and “Steam Machine I”. These products of nomenclature wizardry each wield a 500GB of HDD and 8GB of DDR3 memory. But GPU and CPU are still to be determined. Those choices will clearly dictate the $200 cost difference. Of the 14, I would pass on CyberPowerPC. Their premium PCs have never impressed. So I wouldn’t hold my breath for their Steam Machine. Alas, time will tell for sure. Price: $499/$699 Specs: 500GB HDD, 8GB DDR3 RAM (Full specs TBA) 4. Digital Storm – Bolt II Digital Storm is a name you can trust given their long history of quality boutique PC builds. Yet one is hard-pressed to tell the difference between the Bolt II and your garden variety tower PC. It may not be a looker by set-top living room standards. But the Bolt II from Digital Storm packs the inner-muscle to feed the most ravenous gaming appetite. Nonetheless, I fear the Bolt II does little to sway traditional PC gamers with a design similar to a do-it-yourself PC build. Moreover the look may  further scare away console gamers looking for easy entry into PC gaming. Still, this is Digital Storm we’re talking about. Good quality is a given. So, if living space and financials are not an issue then I suggest you investigate the Bolt II. Price: $2584 Specs: Intel Core i7 4770K (unlocked Haswell), Nvidia GTX 780 Ti, 16gb RAM, 1TB HDD + 120GB SSD 5. Gigabyte – Brix Pro We don’t have a price on Gigabyte’s Brix Pro Steam Machine. What we do know…? It will come minus the one PC component Gigabyte excels at and that’s video cards. The Brix Pro will sport a i7 4770K, one of the most coveted CPU’s on the market today. But Gigiabyte is relying on Intel’s integrated Iris Pro 5200. The Iris Pro competes at a very casual level–too casual for a dedicated gaming machine in our honest assesment (no hands-on time ATM). It is definitely THE best integrated graphics solution on any CPU. Yet I fear it will not be sufficient. It will surely keep overall cost down, however, well below many other Steam Machines. Well… At least it should if Gigabyte is serious about competing in this madcap new arms race. Price: TBA Specs: Intel Core i7 4770K (unlocked Haswell), Intel Iris Pro (integrated graphics), 2x 4GB RAM, 1TB HDD SATA3 drive 6. Falcon Nothwest – Tiki You don’t make it in the cutthroat boutique PC racket as long as Falcon Nothwest without being damn good at what you do. These folks have been cranking out high end PC’s since ’92. Now say hello to the company’s Tiki Steam Machine. The Tiki line features premium wallet-crippling prices all the way up to $6000. The Tiki boasts wide customization in some areas and flat out creme de la creme components in other areas. The performance and support will undoubtedly be superb. Money left over for games after this purchase…? That’s a whole other ball of wax. Price: $1799 – $6000 (configuration dependent) Specs: CPU is optional (selection TBA), Nvidia GTX Titan, 8-16GB RAM (configurable), Up to 6TB (selection TBA) 7. iBuyPower (Product Name TBA) Similar to CyberPowerPC, the iBuypower Steam Machine is much more consumer friendly. This is largely due to the consumer level components housed within. These will both serve as solid affordable test beds for what a Steam Machine can do. To be effective, each of these companies will need to ensure quality customer support and performance if they hope to sway early adopters. These are for those with considerably less disposable cash, and want to test the waters of the new SteamOS platform. Price: $499 Specs: Quad Core AMD or Intel processor, Radeon GCN Graphics, 8GB RAM, 500GB+ Storage (type TBA) 8. Materiel.Net (Product Name TBA) I’m not familiar with Material.net or their unnamed Steam Machine. So I reserve my opinion…well mostly. This unit will ship with an Nvidia GTX 760 OC card from MSI. That’s a great card for 1080p gaming or below. The form factor is another unattractive square and the price point is not as competitive. I’m curious about these lesser known companies. So we’ll keep a keen eye on this one. Price: $1098 Specs: Intel Core i5 4440, MSI GTX 760, 8GB RAM, 8GB+1TB SSHD 9. ORIGIN PC – Chronos ORIGIN PC may be one of the newer kids on the boutique PC block. But they’ve proven themselves to be a leader at this game in a very short time. I’m only recommending a few of these Steam Machines to customers, since we have yet to go hands-on. But ORIGIN, like Falcon Northwest, is a company I trust having been spearheaded by some of the original Alienware guys. ORIGIN PC only use the very best components in their builds. The engineering on this Steam Machine has produced a slightly original stlying. Additionaly, the ingredient make for some mouth-watering gaming potential. Just expect an equally 4-Star price tag. Price: TBA Specs: Intel Core i7 4770K (3.9-4,6GHz), 2x 6GB Nvidia GeForce Titan cards, Ram and storage – TBA. 10. Next SPA That big green X on this Steam Machine is sure to confuse someone. I would assume it was a modded Xbox if I didn’t know better. But few of these Steam Machines win the “Design Innovation” award. So no harm, no foul. We have here, another new comer and my guess is not a State-side one at that. The innards are middle of the road, which speaks to a sub-$1000 price point. But I’m all speculation on this one. Time will tell. Price: TBA Specs: Intel Core i5, Nvidia GT 760, 8GB RAM, 1TB storage (type TBA) 11. Scan – NC10 Now this is what I’ve been waiting to see. A diminutive Steam Machine more akin to a portable HDD than a PC or console. The Scan NC10 even uses a 765M GPU, the type found in laptops and All-in-One PCs. That helps keep size down. The CPU is not all that exciting, using an Intel Core i3 4000M. But supreme CPU power may not be required for the Linux based SteamOS. Our eyes will be glued to this little guy come launch. Price: $1090 Specs: Intel Core i3 4000m, Nvidia Geforce GTX 76M, 8GB RAM, 500GB 12. Webhallen (name TBA) I don’t know about this folks. The company Webhallen is a e-commerce store in Sweden. It was formerly owned by Amazon. What is worrisome, PC building  is not the company’s bread and butter. Sure they pull from their stock to build PCs. But I would hardly go to an e-commerce equivalent of Best Buy, CompUSA, or even GameStop for definitive gaming machine. Like most of the other Steam Machines, Webhallen is using components from other companies and housing them in a custom PC chassis. Adequate tech and customer support would be my initial questions. Sounds like a gamble that should be watched instead of adopted early. Price: $1499 Specs: Intel Core i7 4771, Nvidia GTX 780, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSHD 13. Zotac (name TBA) This thing looks more like a network router than a Steam Machine. Zotac products are not sold in the U.S. but I’ve used them first hand and vouch for their reliability. The company has been serving gamer component needs for many years. The price tag on this one also shows promise. It’s not dirt cheap but highly affordable. Too bad we don’t have a specific specifications list. More on this one as it comes in. Price: $599 Specs: Intel Core (TBD), Nvidia GeForce GTX (TBD), RAM and Storage are also TBD 14. Maingear – Spark The Spark was the most recent Steam Machine to come onboard. While it doesn’t look much different than the other square form factors, it weighs less than 1-pound. Connectivity options were mentioned as well — 4x USB 3.0 ports, an HDMI-out port, Mini DisplayPort, 801.11ac WiFi and Bluetooth 4.0 are all in attendance. Surprisingly, Maingear is showing AMD a lot of love in this unit for both the CPU and the GPU. Maingear is another name you can trust. But AMD is not my personal choice for gaming — especially on the GPU side. Again, that’s a personal preference based on my experience with their poor driver support. Also the R9, while a very powerful video card, is a incessantly loud one at that. You’re sure to hear it too, in a box that weighs less than 8-ounces. That said, we have every confidence Maingear is making the best decisions for their particular Steam Machine. Time will tell if they’re right for gamers. Price: TBD Specs: AMD A8-5557M processor, AMD Radeon R9 M275X GPU, HDD or SSD storage options up to 256GB   The Steam Controller w/ Haptic Feedback, Touch Screen and Dual Trackpads  Tweet It Like It Google + Linkedin Pin it Stumble Shawn Sanders Sponsored Content Related Posts Best Gaming PC for 2017 – The Complete Guide Battlefield 3 PC Case Mod Features Chain Gun and Drinks Fridge How to Build Your Next Gaming PC Dell XPS 600 Renegade goes for sale Valve’s Steam Link Streams Your PC Games on Your TV In Win H-Frame Aluminum Computer Case – Flux Capacitor Not Included Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

By CiaraLinnane Corporate news editor The number of U.S. retailers ranked at the most-distressed level of the credit-rating spectrum has more than tripled since the Great Recession of 2008-2009 and is heading toward record levels in the next five years, Moody’s Investors Service said Monday. Don’t miss: Nordstrom says Trump’s tweets after Ivanka’s collections were dropped didn’t hurt results The rating agency is the latest to weigh in on the state of the sector, and has 19 names in its retail and apparel portfolio, or 14% of the total, that are now trading at Caa/Ca. That’s deep into speculative, or “junk,” territory. It’s also a percentage close to the 16% considered distressed during the 2008/2009 period, said a Moody’s report led by retail analyst Charles O’Shea. The rise is part of a wider trend affecting sectors across Moody’s coverage that has retail replacing oil and gas as the most-troubled industry. Retailers are in the midst of a secular shift to online sales led by juggernaut Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.38% and that’s forcing many of them to spend heavily on their e-commerce operations. At the same time, mall traffic has slowed dramatically as consumer behavior changes, forcing many to discount heavily, hurting profit margins.

Intel's Michelle Tinsley joins Lunch Break with Tanya Rivero with a printed sweater and a look at other innovations that will improve the retail customer experience. Photo: Intel The 19 issuers on Moody’s list have more than $3.7 billion of debt maturing in the next five years, with about 30% of that total coming due by the end of 2018. The number is even higher when private credit is included. Read now: From a risk-of-bankruptcy standpoint, the retail business is the new oil and gas “While credit markets continue to provide ready access for companies spanning the rating spectrum—allowing many to proactively refinance debt and bolster balance sheets—that could change abruptly if market conditions or investor sentiment shift,” said O’Shea. The increase in distressed retailers comes after a long period of low interest rates, during which sponsor activity speeded up to meet investor appetite for yield. Each leveraged buyout cycle tends to produce a new pool of B2/B3 companies, a number of which inevitably get downgraded to Caa, said O’Shea. That was the case for Claire’s Stores Inc., J. Crew Group parent Chinos Intermediate Holdings A Inc., Tops Holding II Corp., and Rue 21 Inc., all of which now have weak credit metrics after taking on high levels of leverage to fund buyouts. LBOs almost always start life with high leverage, because sponsors are incentivized to minimize equity and maximize debt in each deal to ensure their own returns. “These companies are frequently challenged from the start, with weak credit metrics,” said O’Shea. “Exacerbating this is the cadence of distributions to boost sponsor returns that typically follow, pushing the leverage envelope. When a highly leveraged company faces operating difficulties, Caa is the usual result.” That makes companies more vulnerable to default if credit markets tighten, as they tend to tap external sources of uncommitted capital to fund maturities. Moody’s is expecting the overall speculative-grade default rate to fall to 3.5% in January 2017 from 5.8% last January. It did not provide a default rate forecast for retailers alone. But Fitch Ratings said recently it expects the default rate for the sector to spike to 9% in 2017 from its current 1% trailing 12-months level. S&P Global Ratings, meanwhile, said the majority of outlooks across retail and restaurants are stable but the ratings trends are negative. “Shifting consumer preferences and patches of global economic and policy uncertainty are contributing to the increasingly negative outlook bias,” the agency said in a recent report. The main factors causing downgrades are stressed liquidity, weak credit profiles, challenged competitive positions, sponsor ownership and erratic management structures, said Moody’s. Anytime there is a sudden change in the C-suite, credit risk rises and the rise will be exacerbated if there is no clear successor in sight. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -0.21% and Costco Wholesale Corp. COST, -2.07% two of Moody’s highest rated retailers, have changed CEOs in the past few years without any bumps because of succession planning, said O’Shea. A bigger pool of low-rated retailers also poses challenges for their stronger competitors, he said. “As they struggle to survive, distressed retailers can take more desperate measures, including highly promotional pricing that can border on irrational. This leaves stronger firms with the choice of either competing in a race to the bottom, or giving up sales in order to preserve margin.” See also: Sears is ‘one sick puppy,’ and there may be no remedy Other retailers on Moody’s list include Sears Holding Corp. SHLD, -1.31% Bon-Ton Stores Inc. BONT, +1.87% 99 Cents Only Stores Inc., Nine West Holdings Inc., True Religion Apparel Inc. and Fairway Group Holdings Corp. The SPDR S&P Retail exchange-traded fund was down 1.5% Tuesday, and is up a paltry 0.1% in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.33%  has gained 22%.

Some offer software, some offer components, and some offer complete platforms. In an interesting marriage of partners, Intel, AT&T, and Sonim Technologies fall into that third “systems” category. I say it’s interesting because I don’t generally expect to see end systems from Intel. But of the goal is to help accelerate time to market, they’ve clearly hit the nail on the head. While it’s essentially a Sonim end product, the communications requirements were driven by AT&T and the reference board design came from Intel. Sonim pretty much picked it up from there, including the industrial design. Dubbed by Intel as its LTE IoT Quick Deployment (LIQD) program, the program lets device OEMs like Sonim develop pre-certified, deployment-ready LTE solutions for commercial and industrial IoT applications. AT&T is the first carrier certified by Intel, and also the third partner in the Intel-Sonim product deployment. The end box is called the XPi, and because of AT&T’s involvement, it’s pre-certified and pre-integrated into the carrier’s platform services. This enables remote sensor management and faster deployment in the field. Designed for demanding industrial environments, the XPi can operate in such applications as transportation, logistics, agriculture and construction. It can detect changes in temperature, humidity, ambient light, acceleration, and movement. To extend functionality, a sensor interface has been implemented to provide modular extensibility via accessories that can be securely mounted to the unit. The XPi is based on the Intel Quark SE microcontroller C1000, and offers users a scalable IoT sensor platform with Bluetooth Smart connectivity and the ability to access AT&T’s platform solutions, aka M2X. It runs a version of the Zephyr Project real-time operating system, which is a deterministic flavor of Linux. A later version may include some form of Android. According to Intel, “We will enable OEMs and carriers to deliver smart and connected devices that can deploy in weeks instead of months. Customers utilizing Intel LIQD devices will also be able to move from concept stage to large deployments without the engineering or technical burden of building a custom solution.” Sounds like a win for everyone. Sonim XPi is expected to be available by the middle of the year for around $149. When successive generations arrive, significant price reductions may come with them, possibly even below $50.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Making AMD great again! Home Hardware Hands on with AMD’s fab new Ryzen CPU By Jeremy Laird on March 2nd, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Rejoice, for AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is here. And it’s good. Thank science for that. Another dud from AMD didn’t bear thinking about. Instead, we get to ponder just how good Ryzen is and indeed how good it truly needs to be. It isn’t the very fastest CPU money can buy or the greatest gaming CPU ever. But that’s just dandy. It’s still going to blow the PC processor market wide open and force Intel to seriously up its game. If you want the background to AMD’s new chip and a broad overview on what makes it tick, head over here. The task this week is to get a quick feel for what Ryzen is actually like. The chip I’ve played with briefly is the middling model of the launch trio, the Ryzen 7 1700X. Like the other two Ryzen chips AMD is making available at launch, it’s an eight-core beast that crunches two software threads per core. Hexa-core and quad-core models are coming, but aren’t quite ready for launch day. The 1700X clocks in nominally at 3.4GHz with a potential 3.8GHz turbo mode. The ‘X’ suffix, incidentally means it sports AMD’s new XFR auto-overclocking feature, a bit more on which in a moment. For the record the other two chips are the 3.0GHz/3.7GHz 1700 and the 3.6GHz/4GHz 1800X. Pricing for the 1700X is £399. The 1800X rocks in around £499 and the 1700 is yours for £329. Stick a $ sign in front of those numbers and you have the US price, which is both impressive and depressing depending on your point of view. Without further ado, then, let’s get busy. I couldn’t resist firing up the fairly pointless Cinebench synthetic benchmark first, just to see those 16 threads in action. Fly my pretties: Not that it matters much for the real world, but this thing flies in a multi-threaded benchmark like Cinebench. To give you a feel for just how quick it is, it’s nearly two and a half times faster than the incumbent gamer’s choice, the Intel Core i5-7600K. Yowsers. Of course, multi-threading is only half – or should that be 15/16ths – of the story. AMD’s big failure with its previous FX processors was single-threaded performance and it just so happens that games are particularly sensitive to just that. In Cinebench’s single-threaded mode, the Ryzen 7 1700X is between 10 and 20 per cent slower than various gaming-relevant Intel CPUs, with about 10% of that due to a slight comparative deficiency in Ryzen’s architecture and the other 10% thanks to clockspeed. Indeed, it was rumoured prior to launch that clock-for-clock and core-for-core, Ryzen would be roughly a match for Intel’s Haswell-generation chips – the Core iSomething 4000 series chips, in other words. And so it proves in Cinebench. Anyway, I mucked around with a few other canned benchmarks, all of which delivered similar kinds of results. Ryzen monsters quad-core Intel chips in multi-threading. In fact, it’s on about a par with Intel’s own eight-core beast, the 6900K for multithreading. Lest you have forgotten, that’s more or less a £1,000 chip. But what, you cry, of games? Don’t panic, the news here is decent, too, if somewhat preliminary and indeed patchy. You can read detailed benchmarks elsewhere, but to give you one example, in Total War: Attila using the same video card and settings, the Ryzen 1700X cranks out an average of 39 frames per second to 40 from a Core i5-7600K. I got similar results in several other titles. The first caveat to that is that I was running everything at 1440p and high detail settings, which tends to push things towards being GPU limited, even on an Nvidia GTX 1080. The handful of games I ran may also have somewhat flattered Ryzen. Among others, Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games. Part of that is clockspeed, part of it is architecture and part is probably optimisation. You can be sure that few if any games exist that have been compiled to run well on Ryzen. Really broadly, then, Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. If you want to game and stream your exploits at the same time, for instance, Ryzen looks like a killer solution. But a high clocked six-core Ryzen of the near future might be the best AMD bet for gamers. If there is a disappointment, it’s overclocking. All Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked for easy overclocking. But to cut a long story short, they don’t overclock. Well, barely. I squeezed an extra 100MHz out of my chip and that was with water cooling. M’colleagues elsewhere in the reviewersphere report similar findings. Oh, and the XFR auto-overclocking feature doesn’t improve on that. It may be of interest in future when Ryzen chips with more headroom appear. For now, it’s fairly redundant. That said, the 1700X I tested tended to max out at only 3.5GHz in multi-threaded workloads when running at standard rather than overclocked settings rather than the 3.8GHz promised by the chip’s turbo mode. So, that 100MHz overclock was actually more like 400MHz in practice. But I’m not sure I actually care. My feeling coming in was that if Ryzen really was roughly on a par with Haswell and ran at about 3.5GHz, that would be plenty to put the frighteners on Intel. It does just that, so frankly I for one am satisfied. Incidentally, if you’re wondering about operating temps, have a scan of the web. I was only able to run my test chip with water cooling, so the 41 degrees C idle and 51 degrees under load aren’t hugely helpful for the bulk of us that run fairly standard air coolers. What we have then is a chip that isn’t far off Intel for gaming and absolutely obliterates it for multi-threading performance when you factor in pricing. Regards the latter, this chip is literally half the price of Intel’s eight-core 6900K. Staggering. Of course, it’s still bloody expensive at £399. Moreover, you’re never actually going to feel the difference versus the plain old £329 Ryzen 7 1700. So of the initial launch chips, the 1700 is the obvious choice. It’s an awesome all-rounder for the money. However, I still think the sweet spot for most RPSers will likely be the future six-core model. It’ll crank out the same gaming performance (well, in most games) as the eight-core model, just for less money, along with both pretty snazzy multi-threading for content creation and some multi-threading headroom to come as games gradually scale better across multiple cores. Where all this leaves Intel is of course an interesting question. My sense in recent years is that readers have tired of the press bashing Intel for sandbagging, but for my money Ryzen completely confirms that narrative. It makes Intel’s product line up look cynical and overpriced. Personally, I can’t see Intel slashing prices anything like enough to offset the yawning gap between it’s six and eight-core CPUs and Ryzen. In reality, it doesn’t matter much to Intel. Desktop CPUs aren’t all that important and in any case, the likes of Dell will keep cranking out systems for mainstream punters and nobody will care much or notice much. What Intel may do is hurry up the mainstream six-core model for the LGA1151 socket that appeared on its roadmaps recently. Suitably clocked and priced, that would put Intel in a reasonable if still not ideal competitive position. In the meantime, I think enthusiasts will make something of a stampede towards Ryzen. It’s just such a compelling value proposition, even if it remains somewhat unproven. It wouldn’t surprise me to find a few bugs emerging (I hear it’s a bit pernickety when it comes to certain memory configs, for instance) or a few weak spots in its performance profile shake out as the PC community probes its capabilities. AMD is but a small company and it probably doesn’t have the manpower to completely finesse this new architecture first time around. Of course, if that’s correct the upside is that scope remains for future revisions to turn a good chip into a great one. Anyway, this is an initial hands-on, not an entirely definitive and forensic investigation. I’ll have a look at the platform / motherboard part of the Ryzen story in a future post – PCI Express connectivity with Ryzen chips is an emerging concern, for instance. Overall, Ryzen is impressive even if the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers. But if I was buying a CPU right now, it would still be the base model eight-core Ryzen. It’s not perfect and for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs. But it’s a really nice all-rounder for the money.

Fast enough single-threaded, big boost multi-threaded. And the timing’s about right for all of us on a Sandy or Ivy Bridge Core i5 (or below) to upgrade. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 16:25 blur says: Yuuuup. My 2500k is finally showing its age these days. Any CPU upgrade would necessitate motherboard and RAM as well, so the next batch of Ryzen releases definitely look like they might hit the super sweet spot. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:40 Gnoupi says: I’m actually a bit surprised to read that. The consensus on all other reviews I read is that it’s not ideal for gaming, performance wise, compared to the concurrency. And that it only passes them in “ideal” multithreaded conditions (video processing/rendering). Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:46 dangermouse76 says: My reading seems to suggest. That 1440p evens out the FPS comparisons as they push the work to the GPU. But when looking at 1080p gaming with these chips the i7 seems to have a larger margin over Ryzen. Edit: As this article seems to bare out. So yeah these chips dont blow me away for gaming. That may not be their purpose, but still. So yeah very interested to see what the Ryzen i5 competition will look like. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:16 dangermouse76 says: Also this is brand new from scratch work from AMD so optimisations from devs and AMD may help bring that gap down. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:56 Sakkura says: I wouldn’t count on big improvements, but at least the situations where SMT hurts performance should be going away. Maybe a few percent on top of that, here and there.

Where games are CPU limited, the gap is a lot more obvious. Plus there are one or two anomalies, to boot. I think you’ve probably absorbed my generally upbeat tone but ignored the detail of what I wrote.

The way language can glitch like this, causing tiny ambiguities, is really fun for me to dissect! PS almost certainly you meant “after 10pm”, and I would caution you that ’22’ is not an intuitive way for native speakers to write time. 2200, 22:00 and 10pm all read correctly :) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 11:13 Harlander says: Yeah, after 22 you should be getting ready for the Carousel. Renew! Renew! Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:31 carewolf says: Very few games push the CPU and the few that do are multithreaded. What other reviews do to make Intel look better is take something that is close to pushing the CPU but is single-threaded because it usually doesn’t matter, run it in a low resolution like 1080p and then pretend FPS over 100 matters. Then a Kaby Lake is faster than Ryzen, because it does indeed have better single threaded performance. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:29 Unclepauly says: There is much more than “a very few” games that push the cpu. When you go online multiplayer the burden on the CPU increases alot for a large percentage of games. The problem here is that online multiplayer is almost impossible to benchmark consistently. Games with a huge amount of players just compounds the issue. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:18 randomclass says: Also games like Paradox’s grand strategy games, from CK2 to HoI4. They all seem to be laggy in late game, in SP or MP, and it’s all down to CPU, not GPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:54 ravenshrike says: The issue is that the reviews are all over the place with a few more or less matching the 7700k even at 1080p, with others horribly bombing. Most of that is teething issues from the new architecture(Although the on-die memory controller throughput is a bit weak. That needs to be improved by at least 50%, preferably doubled in the next refresh). In three to six months the performance numbers will almost certainly look much better as BIOSes, opcode, and MS drivers are improved, with even some games getting patched to work with Ryzen’s quirks. You’ve got to remember that the Haswell and Broadwell and Lake chips are all very mature at this point with more similarities than differences between them. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:41 kud13 says: A few years back I picked up an AMD FX 4350- also an 8-core 4.0 Ghz base for something ridiculous like 250CAD (this was right before the dollar spiked up). The reason for AMD was I had an AMD-based mobo and I was upgrading piecemeal. Gotta say, I haven’t had any problems with any “modern” games on it since (GPU was a bottleneck for a while, but now I’m running Nvidia 1070). However, Age of Empires 2 HD (that does not support multi-threading, period) DOES make it huff and puff (as opposed to, say, Witcher 3). So I guess we still gotta wait for AMD to come up with powerful single-thread chips. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:52 Sakkura says: 8 cores? Then you mean FX-8350, the FX-4350 is 4 cores. While Ryzen is still not quite on par with Intel in single-threaded performance, it’s very close. And a HUGE upgrade over their old FX chips. We’re talking 60-80% faster. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:49 BadManiac says: I ordered my 1700X today, been waiting for this too long. I’m still gaming on my old Phenom 2 X4, and while running at a respectable 4Ghz, it’s really starting to show it’s age in some games. So for me the jump from 4 cores and 4 threads to 8 cores and 16 threads at hopefully near the same clock speed should be an enormous leap, and I won’t be completely CPU limiting my GTX 1070 any more. :D Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:32 AngoraFish says: My Phenom 2 x4 955 is still running strong and I’ve not noticed any significant CPU bottleneck on anything I play. I’ve upgraded the graphics card a couple of times since I got it, but there’s still no incentive at all for me to splash cash on a new CPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:34 Unclepauly says: The fact is that you are just used to it so don’t notice it. That CPU is has problems in a huge amount of games.

I played every single game on it, no problem. But last year I decided to buy an i5 6600. Got a new mobo, new RAM, the new CPU and a new case. Only then I noticed how obsolete the Phenom II was. I got almost double the framerate on most games. I mean, the good old Phenom II served its purpose. It allowed me to play any game I wanted. It also didn’t do that so well. And there was also a bonus. It worked as a very nice space heater! Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 23:05 Don Reba says: My main requirement from a CPU is maximum AVX2 performance, in which Ryzen lags behind Intel literally by a factor of 2, so my main hope is that competition will force Intel to add more cores and drop prices. It could be argued that I would be better served by a GPU, but, well, it’s a whole other can of worms, and I don’t want the hassle.

But I do more than just playing nothing but games on my desktop, and having 8 physical cores would be a great convenience for the VMs and the sometimes video encodes that I do. Consider me pleasantly impressed. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:07 ScubaMonster says: I’ve seen some articles about the performance comparison, but not any that factor in price at the same time. I get that it’s the cold hard numbers that matter most and these chips are going up against Intel’s offerings. But if a Ryzen chip lags a bit behind its Intel counterpart but is substantially cheaper I would consider that a win. Sure, you could pony up extra bucks if you absolutely must have the best of the best, but if you can get performance close to it for a lot cheaper, that would be a no brainer to me. I don’t know all the pricing to make a comparison myself though. I haven’t really looked at the Ryzen prices compared to their Intel equivalents. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 01:37 haldolium says: Check the chart on the bottom of the site here, it gives an impression where Ryzen stands in terms of pricing to performance: link to computerbase.de Good thing AMD catches up, but by now I am more interested in GPGPU in general since GPU based rendering has taken HUGE steps in the time AMD was figuring out the Zen and for playing games, the CPU is so seldom an issue that I couldn’t care less for the high-end market. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:49 Unclepauly says: It really does depend on the types of games a person plays though. Certain genres of games have a greater need for CPU performance while many do not. Plenty of outliers as well. Take ARMA 3 for example, Sandy bridge systems net about 30-35 fps while Kaby Lake(with very fast ram) is netting roughly 55-60 fps. Cherry picked game of course but there are others out there less documented that benefit as well. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:45 Rack says: Sadly the current scenario does Ryzen few favours. A 1700 compares poorly with an i5 7600k at £100 more. Right at the bottom of the pile the 1100 might be a reasonable budget option but all in all Ryzen looks to be a good option for 3d modelling, less so for games. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:16 ButteringSundays says: I haven’t noticed my 5 y/o i5 acting as a bottleneck anywhere I’ve noticed (the 760 is showing its age though… sometimes). Hardware fetishists are strange beasts – the money they’ll spend for an updated forum signature. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:14 Lord Zeon says: The CPU hasn’t been a bottleneck for gaming for almost a decade now. I still use a first gen Bulldozer CPU, the FX-8120, and I’ve never seen a AAA title get caught up on it with my GTX 970. Imagine that – the first of the “awful” AMD architectures that Ryzen is replacing still is entirely relevant in the enthusiast gaming space. I genuinely think that Intel’s marketing has permeated the enthusiast community to the point where everyone has lost the their reference point as to what a CPU needs to do for gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 14:03 Sakkura says: If you’re not seeing the FX-8120 limit performance, then you’re simply not looking. It definitely does. That doesn’t mean everything is unplayable on it, but it really doesn’t qualify for enthusiast gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 15:18 tehfish says: As an FX-8120 owner also, it does bottleneck the GPU in recent games, but it does depend on what GPU you have. You may just be very lucky with a well-matched GPU to go with the CPU there. For an example, with fallout4, an overclocked FX-8120 (4.2ghz, no turbo) and a R9 390: It’s perfectly playable often running happily at 1080p 60fps, then you can hit certain areas where it drops to ~20-30fps with the GPU core down to ~450mhz out of it’s maximum 1060mhz – a clear case of a CPU bottleneck. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 00:18 Etherion says: I also have a quite dated i5 760 cpu, but didn’t feel it as a bottleneck until just recently (current gpu is gtx 770 overclocked) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:45 bfar says: Way back in January last year, I had a long discussion with my peers on a UK forum over 6700k vs 5820k, as they were roughly the same price at the time. I argued that for gaming, the higher clocked 4 core CPU would be the better bet for at least a year or two. We agreed that for all other applications, the lower clocked 6 core chip was the way to go. It seems that a year later, nothing has changed, and it frames the perception of Rysen from an enthusiast perspective. It’s still a major coup for consumers though, because as Jeremy rightly points out, most of Intels chips look like poor value for money all of a sudden. Prices will fall across the board.

Starting out on a GTX 460, then SLI 560TI to a GTX 780/970(RMA replace) and now a GTX 1070. Until my games consistently dip below 50fps on max settings with my current or newer video card, I have no real reason to upgrade yet.

Whilst it doesn’t match a 7700K, it’s a great alternative to Intel’s enthusiast class CPUs at a much lower price, and being AMD hopefully supports ECC RAM too. The problem is, I’m not convinced the enthusiast market is large enough. If you’re using virtualisation, rendering, or transcoding video it’s a huge win, but for general productivity and games this isn’t on the radar and probably never will be. Neither are any of Intel’s chips with more than four cores. They also haven’t talked up any virtualisation support, other than encrypted memory. They could do much more in this area if they wanted to. Roll on four fast core versions of Ryzen.. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

[x] HOME TECH GAMING BUSINESS CONSUMER MOBILE HEXUS.TV TRUST COMPETITIONS FORUMS SEARCH You are here: CPU News 25 AMD says seeding of dev kits will boost Ryzen gaming performance by Mark Tyson on 3 March 2017, 10:00 Tags: AMD (NYSE:AMD) Quick Link: HEXUS.net/qadewn Add to My Vault: Yesterday we saw the launch of the AMD Ryzen 7 range of CPUs. I'm sure that has not escaped many HEXUS reader information radars. Overall we concluded that the new high-end AMD processors offered "massive multi-core performance, [and] aggressive pricing," but single thread performance trailed Intel by a smidgeon, and probably most controversially there were gaming optimisations needed going forward. SMT seems to be a problem for AMD right now with the disabling of this feature was actually seen to result in better performance in games. Here at HEXUS we tested Total War: Warhammer at Ultra settings QHD, and disabling SMT increased the average frame rate from 79fps to 85.8fps. With Hitman (again Ultra settings at QHD) a similar uplift was observed, with frame rates improved from 91.4fps to 95.6fps. Other reviewers did quite a few FHD 1080p gaming tests and this again showed AMD performance anomalies. As PC Perspective reports gaming at 1080p on Ryzen "shows a deficit in performance compared to Intel Kaby Lake and Broadwell-E processors," in many AAA games. Now, regarding this issue, PCPer has received an answer of sorts from John Taylor, CVP of Marketing at AMD. In a nutshell he told PCPer that developers simply aren't used to AMD Ryzen yet, and AMD's seeding of a targeted 1000+ developer systems in 2017 will help address the performance anomaly. In contrast, developers are already leveraging optimisations that uniquely apply to the Intel platform. For reference and clarity, the full statement by AMD's Taylor is directly below: As we presented at Ryzen Tech Day, we are supporting 300+ developer kits with game development studios to optimize current and future game releases for the all-new Ryzen CPU. We are on track for 1000+ developer systems in 2017. For example, Bethesda at GDC yesterday announced its strategic relationship with AMD to optimize for Ryzen CPUs, primarily through Vulkan low-level API optimizations, for a new generation of games, DLC and VR experiences. Oxide Games also provided a public statement today on the significant performance uplift observed when optimizing for the 8-core, 16-thread Ryzen 7 CPU design – optimizations not yet reflected in Ashes of the Singularity benchmarking. Creative Assembly, developers of the Total War series, made a similar statement today related to upcoming Ryzen optimizations. CPU benchmarking deficits to the competition in certain games at 1080p resolution can be attributed to the development and optimization of the game uniquely to Intel platforms – until now. Even without optimizations in place, Ryzen delivers high, smooth frame rates on all 'CPU-bound' games, as well as overall smooth frame rates and great experiences in GPU-bound gaming and VR. With developers taking advantage of Ryzen architecture and the extra cores and threads, we expect benchmarks to only get better, and enable Ryzen excel at next generation gaming experiences as well. Game performance will be optimized for Ryzen and continue to improve from at-launch frame rate scores. John Taylor, AMD. It's hard to know what if any differences might emanate from the dev kit seeding program but the 'years of Intel optimisations' assertion does ring true. Already AMD is confident that two developers are making the right moves to optimise for Ryzen CPUs. Oxide Games and Creative Assembly, developers of Ashes of the Singularity and Total War respectively, are acting to improve threading and performance on Ryzen systems "very soon" says PC Per. The source article also includes some 'testimonials' from Oxide Games and Creative Assembly about what they are doing to improve Ryzen performance in their games engine / games. Also remember that AMD's new partnership with Bethesda in Vulkan game development will help show AMD CPUs and GPUs in a good light.

Posted by Corky34 - Fri 03 Mar 2017 10:16 To say it's caused by "optimization of the game uniquely to Intel platforms" seems more like sour grapes to me, it's not that games have been optimised uniquely to Intel platforms, that's unless AMD are positing that developers never optimised for any AMD platforms, it's that games have not been optimised for the new Zen architecture, yet. Posted by CAPTAIN_ALLCAPS - Fri 03 Mar 2017 10:35 One theory I have read somewhere is that task schedulers may be shuffling threads from one four-core module to another. Since L3 cache is not shared across the modules (8+8 arrangement) this will cause cache misses and hit performance. I am also sure that memory latency will improve going forwards as motherboard manufacturers get to grips with the IMC. All told I am not actually too worried. I don't believe it can do so well in 3DMark Firestrike/Timespy and yet be bad for games in general, even if that is a synthetic benchmark. Now that Ryzen is in the open, games programmers will pay more attention in time for the more game-oriented CPU releases. Still, I have always thought there should be an option in operating systems along the lines of “disable SMT for this program”. Plenty of software loses performance when using SMT - many EPS modelling HPCs/clusters have to disable SMT globally. It would be nice to keep the SMT cores for background tasks. Posted by Mtomi - Fri 03 Mar 2017 10:40 Corky34 To say it's caused by "optimization of the game uniquely to Intel platforms" seems more like sour grapes to me, it's not that games have been optimised uniquely to Intel platforms, that's unless AMD are positing that developers never optimised for any AMD platforms, it's that games have not been optimised for the new Zen architecture, yet. It's actually sounds like a really plausible scenario. First Ryzen is a whole new architecture so its unlikely any game could be optimized for it. Secondly, if you see the reviews the benches show that the single core performance is just there where AMD said it will be, on par with Broadwell, and the multi core performance is even better given the SMT is better scaling than intels HT. So the grunt is there in the CPU, it won't disappear by starting a game instead of a benchmark. It needs optimization. I expect alot of patches in the next 1-2 months and a lot of performance from those in games. Posted by Irien - Fri 03 Mar 2017 10:42 Can't help feeling compiler optimisations might also come into play. Intel spend a lot on compiler tech and integrating patches etc into the main line compilers, and that must surely give an advantage. With Zen so new, perhaps the toolchains simply haven't been updated as aggressively for AMD's architecture? Posted by Corky34 - Fri 03 Mar 2017 10:50 Mtomi It's actually sounds like a really plausible scenario…. I'm not saying it's not but they way AMD seem to be couching it is that developers have optimised for Intel platforms while ignoring AMD when that seems implausible at best, like i said it's not that developers have only ever optimised for Intel platforms while ignoring AMD, it's that they've not had time to optimise for the new Zen architecture. It seems like the sort of answer you'd expect from a PR representative whose more concerned about protecting the brand than letting people know they recognise the problem and are working to fix it.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Making AMD great again! Home Hardware Hands on with AMD’s fab new Ryzen CPU By Jeremy Laird on March 2nd, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Rejoice, for AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is here. And it’s good. Thank science for that. Another dud from AMD didn’t bear thinking about. Instead, we get to ponder just how good Ryzen is and indeed how good it truly needs to be. It isn’t the very fastest CPU money can buy or the greatest gaming CPU ever. But that’s just dandy. It’s still going to blow the PC processor market wide open and force Intel to seriously up its game. If you want the background to AMD’s new chip and a broad overview on what makes it tick, head over here. The task this week is to get a quick feel for what Ryzen is actually like. The chip I’ve played with briefly is the middling model of the launch trio, the Ryzen 7 1700X. Like the other two Ryzen chips AMD is making available at launch, it’s an eight-core beast that crunches two software threads per core. Hexa-core and quad-core models are coming, but aren’t quite ready for launch day. The 1700X clocks in nominally at 3.4GHz with a potential 3.8GHz turbo mode. The ‘X’ suffix, incidentally means it sports AMD’s new XFR auto-overclocking feature, a bit more on which in a moment. For the record the other two chips are the 3.0GHz/3.7GHz 1700 and the 3.6GHz/4GHz 1800X. Pricing for the 1700X is £399. The 1800X rocks in around £499 and the 1700 is yours for £329. Stick a $ sign in front of those numbers and you have the US price, which is both impressive and depressing depending on your point of view. Without further ado, then, let’s get busy. I couldn’t resist firing up the fairly pointless Cinebench synthetic benchmark first, just to see those 16 threads in action. Fly my pretties: Not that it matters much for the real world, but this thing flies in a multi-threaded benchmark like Cinebench. To give you a feel for just how quick it is, it’s nearly two and a half times faster than the incumbent gamer’s choice, the Intel Core i5-7600K. Yowsers. Of course, multi-threading is only half – or should that be 15/16ths – of the story. AMD’s big failure with its previous FX processors was single-threaded performance and it just so happens that games are particularly sensitive to just that. In Cinebench’s single-threaded mode, the Ryzen 7 1700X is between 10 and 20 per cent slower than various gaming-relevant Intel CPUs, with about 10% of that due to a slight comparative deficiency in Ryzen’s architecture and the other 10% thanks to clockspeed. Indeed, it was rumoured prior to launch that clock-for-clock and core-for-core, Ryzen would be roughly a match for Intel’s Haswell-generation chips – the Core iSomething 4000 series chips, in other words. And so it proves in Cinebench. Anyway, I mucked around with a few other canned benchmarks, all of which delivered similar kinds of results. Ryzen monsters quad-core Intel chips in multi-threading. In fact, it’s on about a par with Intel’s own eight-core beast, the 6900K for multithreading. Lest you have forgotten, that’s more or less a £1,000 chip. But what, you cry, of games? Don’t panic, the news here is decent, too, if somewhat preliminary and indeed patchy. You can read detailed benchmarks elsewhere, but to give you one example, in Total War: Attila using the same video card and settings, the Ryzen 1700X cranks out an average of 39 frames per second to 40 from a Core i5-7600K. I got similar results in several other titles. The first caveat to that is that I was running everything at 1440p and high detail settings, which tends to push things towards being GPU limited, even on an Nvidia GTX 1080. The handful of games I ran may also have somewhat flattered Ryzen. Among others, Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games. Part of that is clockspeed, part of it is architecture and part is probably optimisation. You can be sure that few if any games exist that have been compiled to run well on Ryzen. Really broadly, then, Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. If you want to game and stream your exploits at the same time, for instance, Ryzen looks like a killer solution. But a high clocked six-core Ryzen of the near future might be the best AMD bet for gamers. If there is a disappointment, it’s overclocking. All Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked for easy overclocking. But to cut a long story short, they don’t overclock. Well, barely. I squeezed an extra 100MHz out of my chip and that was with water cooling. M’colleagues elsewhere in the reviewersphere report similar findings. Oh, and the XFR auto-overclocking feature doesn’t improve on that. It may be of interest in future when Ryzen chips with more headroom appear. For now, it’s fairly redundant. That said, the 1700X I tested tended to max out at only 3.5GHz in multi-threaded workloads when running at standard rather than overclocked settings rather than the 3.8GHz promised by the chip’s turbo mode. So, that 100MHz overclock was actually more like 400MHz in practice. But I’m not sure I actually care. My feeling coming in was that if Ryzen really was roughly on a par with Haswell and ran at about 3.5GHz, that would be plenty to put the frighteners on Intel. It does just that, so frankly I for one am satisfied. Incidentally, if you’re wondering about operating temps, have a scan of the web. I was only able to run my test chip with water cooling, so the 41 degrees C idle and 51 degrees under load aren’t hugely helpful for the bulk of us that run fairly standard air coolers. What we have then is a chip that isn’t far off Intel for gaming and absolutely obliterates it for multi-threading performance when you factor in pricing. Regards the latter, this chip is literally half the price of Intel’s eight-core 6900K. Staggering. Of course, it’s still bloody expensive at £399. Moreover, you’re never actually going to feel the difference versus the plain old £329 Ryzen 7 1700. So of the initial launch chips, the 1700 is the obvious choice. It’s an awesome all-rounder for the money. However, I still think the sweet spot for most RPSers will likely be the future six-core model. It’ll crank out the same gaming performance (well, in most games) as the eight-core model, just for less money, along with both pretty snazzy multi-threading for content creation and some multi-threading headroom to come as games gradually scale better across multiple cores. Where all this leaves Intel is of course an interesting question. My sense in recent years is that readers have tired of the press bashing Intel for sandbagging, but for my money Ryzen completely confirms that narrative. It makes Intel’s product line up look cynical and overpriced. Personally, I can’t see Intel slashing prices anything like enough to offset the yawning gap between it’s six and eight-core CPUs and Ryzen. In reality, it doesn’t matter much to Intel. Desktop CPUs aren’t all that important and in any case, the likes of Dell will keep cranking out systems for mainstream punters and nobody will care much or notice much. What Intel may do is hurry up the mainstream six-core model for the LGA1151 socket that appeared on its roadmaps recently. Suitably clocked and priced, that would put Intel in a reasonable if still not ideal competitive position. In the meantime, I think enthusiasts will make something of a stampede towards Ryzen. It’s just such a compelling value proposition, even if it remains somewhat unproven. It wouldn’t surprise me to find a few bugs emerging (I hear it’s a bit pernickety when it comes to certain memory configs, for instance) or a few weak spots in its performance profile shake out as the PC community probes its capabilities. AMD is but a small company and it probably doesn’t have the manpower to completely finesse this new architecture first time around. Of course, if that’s correct the upside is that scope remains for future revisions to turn a good chip into a great one. Anyway, this is an initial hands-on, not an entirely definitive and forensic investigation. I’ll have a look at the platform / motherboard part of the Ryzen story in a future post – PCI Express connectivity with Ryzen chips is an emerging concern, for instance. Overall, Ryzen is impressive even if the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers. But if I was buying a CPU right now, it would still be the base model eight-core Ryzen. It’s not perfect and for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs. But it’s a really nice all-rounder for the money.

That 1440p evens out the FPS comparisons as they push the work to the GPU. But when looking at 1080p gaming with these chips the i7 seems to have a larger margin over Ryzen. Edit: As this article seems to bare out. So yeah these chips dont blow me away for gaming. That may not be their purpose, but still. So yeah very interested to see what the Ryzen i5 competition will look like. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:16 dangermouse76 says: Also this is brand new from scratch work from AMD so optimisations from devs and AMD may help bring that gap down.

Where games are CPU limited, the gap is a lot more obvious. Plus there are one or two anomalies, to boot. I think you’ve probably absorbed my generally upbeat tone but ignored the detail of what I wrote.

The way language can glitch like this, causing tiny ambiguities, is really fun for me to dissect!

What other reviews do to make Intel look better is take something that is close to pushing the CPU but is single-threaded because it usually doesn’t matter, run it in a low resolution like 1080p and then pretend FPS over 100 matters. Then a Kaby Lake is faster than Ryzen, because it does indeed have better single threaded performance. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:29 Unclepauly says: There is much more than “a very few” games that push the cpu. When you go online multiplayer the burden on the CPU increases alot for a large percentage of games. The problem here is that online multiplayer is almost impossible to benchmark consistently. Games with a huge amount of players just compounds the issue. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:18 randomclass says: Also games like Paradox’s grand strategy games, from CK2 to HoI4. They all seem to be laggy in late game, in SP or MP, and it’s all down to CPU, not GPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:54 ravenshrike says: The issue is that the reviews are all over the place with a few more or less matching the 7700k even at 1080p, with others horribly bombing. Most of that is teething issues from the new architecture(Although the on-die memory controller throughput is a bit weak. That needs to be improved by at least 50%, preferably doubled in the next refresh). In three to six months the performance numbers will almost certainly look much better as BIOSes, opcode, and MS drivers are improved, with even some games getting patched to work with Ryzen’s quirks. You’ve got to remember that the Haswell and Broadwell and Lake chips are all very mature at this point with more similarities than differences between them.

The reason for AMD was I had an AMD-based mobo and I was upgrading piecemeal. Gotta say, I haven’t had any problems with any “modern” games on it since (GPU was a bottleneck for a while, but now I’m running Nvidia 1070). However, Age of Empires 2 HD (that does not support multi-threading, period) DOES make it huff and puff (as opposed to, say, Witcher 3). So I guess we still gotta wait for AMD to come up with powerful single-thread chips. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:52 Sakkura says: 8 cores? Then you mean FX-8350, the FX-4350 is 4 cores. While Ryzen is still not quite on par with Intel in single-threaded performance, it’s very close. And a HUGE upgrade over their old FX chips. We’re talking 60-80% faster. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:49 BadManiac says: I ordered my 1700X today, been waiting for this too long. I’m still gaming on my old Phenom 2 X4, and while running at a respectable 4Ghz, it’s really starting to show it’s age in some games. So for me the jump from 4 cores and 4 threads to 8 cores and 16 threads at hopefully near the same clock speed should be an enormous leap, and I won’t be completely CPU limiting my GTX 1070 any more. :D Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:32 AngoraFish says: My Phenom 2 x4 955 is still running strong and I’ve not noticed any significant CPU bottleneck on anything I play. I’ve upgraded the graphics card a couple of times since I got it, but there’s still no incentive at all for me to splash cash on a new CPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:34 Unclepauly says: The fact is that you are just used to it so don’t notice it. That CPU is has problems in a huge amount of games.

I played every single game on it, no problem. But last year I decided to buy an i5 6600. Got a new mobo, new RAM, the new CPU and a new case. Only then I noticed how obsolete the Phenom II was. I got almost double the framerate on most games. I mean, the good old Phenom II served its purpose. It allowed me to play any game I wanted. It also didn’t do that so well. And there was also a bonus. It worked as a very nice space heater! Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 23:05 Don Reba says: My main requirement from a CPU is maximum AVX2 performance, in which Ryzen lags behind Intel literally by a factor of 2, so my main hope is that competition will force Intel to add more cores and drop prices. It could be argued that I would be better served by a GPU, but, well, it’s a whole other can of worms, and I don’t want the hassle.

But I do more than just playing nothing but games on my desktop, and having 8 physical cores would be a great convenience for the VMs and the sometimes video encodes that I do. Consider me pleasantly impressed. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:07 ScubaMonster says: I’ve seen some articles about the performance comparison, but not any that factor in price at the same time. I get that it’s the cold hard numbers that matter most and these chips are going up against Intel’s offerings. But if a Ryzen chip lags a bit behind its Intel counterpart but is substantially cheaper I would consider that a win. Sure, you could pony up extra bucks if you absolutely must have the best of the best, but if you can get performance close to it for a lot cheaper, that would be a no brainer to me. I don’t know all the pricing to make a comparison myself though. I haven’t really looked at the Ryzen prices compared to their Intel equivalents. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 01:37 haldolium says: Check the chart on the bottom of the site here, it gives an impression where Ryzen stands in terms of pricing to performance: link to computerbase.de Good thing AMD catches up, but by now I am more interested in GPGPU in general since GPU based rendering has taken HUGE steps in the time AMD was figuring out the Zen and for playing games, the CPU is so seldom an issue that I couldn’t care less for the high-end market. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:49 Unclepauly says: It really does depend on the types of games a person plays though. Certain genres of games have a greater need for CPU performance while many do not. Plenty of outliers as well. Take ARMA 3 for example, Sandy bridge systems net about 30-35 fps while Kaby Lake(with very fast ram) is netting roughly 55-60 fps. Cherry picked game of course but there are others out there less documented that benefit as well. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:45 Rack says: Sadly the current scenario does Ryzen few favours. A 1700 compares poorly with an i5 7600k at £100 more. Right at the bottom of the pile the 1100 might be a reasonable budget option but all in all Ryzen looks to be a good option for 3d modelling, less so for games. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:16 ButteringSundays says: I haven’t noticed my 5 y/o i5 acting as a bottleneck anywhere I’ve noticed (the 760 is showing its age though… sometimes). Hardware fetishists are strange beasts – the money they’ll spend for an updated forum signature. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:14 Lord Zeon says: The CPU hasn’t been a bottleneck for gaming for almost a decade now. I still use a first gen Bulldozer CPU, the FX-8120, and I’ve never seen a AAA title get caught up on it with my GTX 970. Imagine that – the first of the “awful” AMD architectures that Ryzen is replacing still is entirely relevant in the enthusiast gaming space. I genuinely think that Intel’s marketing has permeated the enthusiast community to the point where everyone has lost the their reference point as to what a CPU needs to do for gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 14:03 Sakkura says: If you’re not seeing the FX-8120 limit performance, then you’re simply not looking. It definitely does. That doesn’t mean everything is unplayable on it, but it really doesn’t qualify for enthusiast gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 15:18 tehfish says: As an FX-8120 owner also, it does bottleneck the GPU in recent games, but it does depend on what GPU you have. You may just be very lucky with a well-matched GPU to go with the CPU there. For an example, with fallout4, an overclocked FX-8120 (4.2ghz, no turbo) and a R9 390: It’s perfectly playable often running happily at 1080p 60fps, then you can hit certain areas where it drops to ~20-30fps with the GPU core down to ~450mhz out of it’s maximum 1060mhz – a clear case of a CPU bottleneck. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 00:18 Etherion says: I also have a quite dated i5 760 cpu, but didn’t feel it as a bottleneck until just recently (current gpu is gtx 770 overclocked) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:45 bfar says: Way back in January last year, I had a long discussion with my peers on a UK forum over 6700k vs 5820k, as they were roughly the same price at the time. I argued that for gaming, the higher clocked 4 core CPU would be the better bet for at least a year or two. We agreed that for all other applications, the lower clocked 6 core chip was the way to go. It seems that a year later, nothing has changed, and it frames the perception of Rysen from an enthusiast perspective. It’s still a major coup for consumers though, because as Jeremy rightly points out, most of Intels chips look like poor value for money all of a sudden. Prices will fall across the board.

Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 22:28 Jabberslops says: Ryzen still isn’t compelling enough to me to upgrade my gaming computer when what I have is still able to get 100+fps in most games I play. I’ve been running a 7 year old used i7 2600k oc’ed since 2012. To maintain 60fps minimum, the only part that I’ve had to upgrade was always the video card. Starting out on a GTX 460, then SLI 560TI to a GTX 780/970(RMA replace) and now a GTX 1070. Until my games consistently dip below 50fps on max settings with my current or newer video card, I have no real reason to upgrade yet. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 16:57 syllopsium says: Have to admit I was wrong with this – I expected the single threaded performance would suck. Whilst it doesn’t match a 7700K, it’s a great alternative to Intel’s enthusiast class CPUs at a much lower price, and being AMD hopefully supports ECC RAM too. The problem is, I’m not convinced the enthusiast market is large enough. If you’re using virtualisation, rendering, or transcoding video it’s a huge win, but for general productivity and games this isn’t on the radar and probably never will be. Neither are any of Intel’s chips with more than four cores. They also haven’t talked up any virtualisation support, other than encrypted memory. They could do much more in this area if they wanted to. Roll on four fast core versions of Ryzen.. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

While its announcement did not come from Barcelona, Xiaomi officially unveiled its first in-house designed mobile SoC, which will power its own Mi 5c smartphone. While in Barcelona, Spreadtrum announced a new 14nm SoC produced on Intel's Airmont architecture. Xiaomi's announcement about its Surge 1 chipset comes after over two years of development through its Pinecone subsidiary with development beginning in late 2014. The specifications of the chip include an integrated five-mode Cat4 LTE modem supporting 23 frequency bands. Although the modem is five-mode it may not support WCDMA right away with that functionality coming via an OTA update after the release of the phone. Other specifications of the SoC include an 8-core ARM Cortex A53 CPU with four cores clocked at 2.2GHz and four more clocked at 1.4GHz. The GPU is a four-core ARM Mali T860. Also in the SoC is a 32-bit DSP supporting high-quality voice calls with 16kHz sampling and which also supports VoLTE; as well as a 14 bit dual ISP that enables increased light sensitivity and noise reduction algorithms. The Mi 5c itself sits at the lower end of the mid-range smartphone market as its prices start around US$220 at release, which is slated for March 3, 2017. In its announcement, Spreadtrum bills its new SC9861G-IA as a mid-range and high-end LTE SoC platform. The SoC was produced via Intel's custom foundry services. Intel announced Spreadtrum was designing on its 14nm foundry platform in fall 2016. The octa-core 2GHz SoC has an integrated Cat7 modem capable of 300Mbps on the downlink and 100Mbps on the uplink. This is the second mobile SoC from Spreadtrum capable of Cat7 LTE, the company announced the previous-generation SC9860 which was also capable of Cat7 during the 2016 Mobile World Congress. The GPU in the 9861G is the PowerVR GT7200 GPU as opposed to an ARM Mali T880MP4 which was used in the previous-generation LTE chip, this marks another win for Imagination Technologies which displaced ARM's Mali on MediaTek's newly-announced Helio X30 as well. The SC9860 was built on TSMC's 16nm FFC process. Overall this is the third LTE SoC from Spreadtrum since April 2015, when the SC9830 was announced. The SC9830 powered some non-flagship lower cost smartphones from market leader Samsung in 2016. The Surge S1 and the SC9861G-IA are more examples of SoC that are best suited for mid-tier and below smartphones, IHS suggested. The SoC will likely be competitive with the MediaTek Helio X30, Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 and 400 series products, Samsung Exynos 3 and 7 ModAP, and the Kirin 650 from HiSilicon. While Xiaomi is a newcomer to the SoC/LTE baseband market, Spreadtrum's own experience in the relatively early days of its LTE portfolio may prove how difficult it is to gain market share. Spreadtrum's LTE baseband market share has failed to exceed 4% since it entered the market in the second quarter of 2015. Xiaomi will face a different situation as its SoC will be tied to the performance or market acceptance of its own phones in which it is used, starting with the Mi 5c, IHS identified. For third-party mobile SoC suppliers like Spreadtrum, relationships with large OEMs are critical as there are several examples of other companies who have entered and exited the market after failing to reach the necessary scale with their businesses to justify the expensive continual investment to compete in the market, IHS said. Broadcom, Marvell and Nvidia are just three such examples of companies which for all intents and purposes decided to exit the mobile SoC market before reaching very high shipment volumes. If Xiaomi is successful with its Surge S1 SoC and Spreadtrum has a hit with its own SC9861, suppliers like MediaTek and Qualcomm will most likely be adversely affected, IHS said. Both companies currently power phones from Xiaomi where a home-grown solution could limit future penetration and the product from Spreadtrum could compete strongly in China and other highly contested developing markets.

Often times, when trolling YouTube or playing a quick round of Overwatch the limitations on performance seem tied to something else. Your internet is too slow, or you need a new graphics card. Computer processors have gotten faster - every year Intel unveils a microarchitecture with breathless claims of mighty performance improvements, but CPUs haven't had a real leap forward in a while. AMD's new Ryzen processors comes perilously close to changing the game. In recent years, AMD has kind of become the ugly cousin to competitors Intel and Nvidia. While AMD may power the Xbox One and the PS4, the company has languished in the traditional computer market. On the graphics side, Nvidia has stomped AMD to hold the majority marketshare — Nvida's cards are found in most gaming laptops, and a lot of workstations too. On the CPU. side Intel is practically ubiquitous with the word computer. Seeing the tiny AMD sticker on a good laptop is an oddity, not a regularity. AMD desperately wants that to change and the Ryzen CPU is the first step. AMD's Ryzen processor is based on the company's new Zen microarchitecture. Zen is nearly half the size of AMD's last microarchitecture, the six-year-old Bulldozer. And Ryzen, running on Zen, is much, much faster. Not just faster than the chips running on the ageing Bulldozer. Ryzen is also significantly faster than much of what Intel has to offer. Today, only three Ryzen chips are available, and they're only going to work with desktop computers. There's the 1700, which retails for $US330 ($436), the 1700x, which retails for $US400 ($529), and the top of the line 1800x, which retails for $US500 ($661). It feels almost like a gamble for AMD to launch its new microarchitecture with desktop CPUs. Work places are increasingly moving to laptops, and that's what most consumers look for when they head to the big box store to buy a new computer. But it makes sense when you see how the top of the line Ryzen 1800x stacks up against Intel's best Kaby Lake CPU, the i7-7700K. This thing flies when rendering 3D images in Blender or videos in Handbrake, or even the game Rise of the Tomb Raider. In all three instances it was nearly twice as fast as the i7, despite costing just $US150 ($198) more. From top to bottom: Blender, Handbrake, Rise of the Tomb Raider. Much of the Ryzen's speed comes from the number of processor cores it packs into the CPU. It has eight cores, capable of running 16 threads concurrently. The i7-7700K has just 4 cores that run 8 threads concurrently. So the Ryzen can handle twice as many processes concurrently — which is especially useful when you have to render giant chunks of media in programs like Blender and Handbrake. According to both Intel and AMD, the processor that is most comparable to the 1800X is Intel's i7-6900K. But the i7-6900K runs on the older Broadwell-E architecture...and it currently retails for $US1000 ($1,322). Which means the Ryzen 1800X can give the same performance for half the price. That's magic! That's money saved! That also has to mean there's a catch. In the case of AMD's miracle new ultra fast processors there are two catches. The first is related to speed — Ryzen is still slow in a lot of instances. Intel has dominated so much of the computer market than many software designers have optimised their product to run especially well on Intel CPUs. Which is why it took the 1800x twice as long to render images in Photoshop, and why it was neck and neck with the i7-7700K in both our WebXPRT and Civilizations VI benchmarks. It's also why it scored only 2000 points higher in Geekbench 4 despite having twice as many cores. Clockwise from left to right: Geekbench 4, WebXPRT, Photoshop, Civilizations VI. Until software designers start optimising for Ryzen it will only be able to brute force its way into winning benchmarks, and software designers may never do that unless AMD can gain more of the CPU marketshare. Though AMD reps assured Gizmodo that software designers will soon be able to incorporate many potential optimizations tailored for Ryzen. Yet that won't help with Ryzen's other issue: the integrated GPU. The Ryzen CPUs don't have one. There's no way to get video out. If you want to view anything on your computer built with Ryzen inside — browser, operating systems, even BIOS — you'll have to spend additional money on a graphics card. That's not a problem for gamers, or editors and designers rendering huge files. They will have already invested in a video card. It is a problem for budget conscious PC builders. And it will continue to be a problem until AMD drops its Accelerated Processing Units (the name for AMD's CPUs with integrated graphics) later this year. The APUs and other mobile friendly chips are certainly on the horizon — AMD has promised as much, but right now what AMD has delivered is incredible speeds that will benefit only a small portion of computer users. Which is a damn shame. Ryzen runs cooler than Kaby Lake or Skylake, and it sucks up less power, and it's faster. In nearly every way that counts Ryzen seems superior to what Intel is currently offering. But it's going to need more than raw speed if it ever wants to truly win. The 1800X's price to power ratio has me nearly convinced AMD has a contender — now stick this in a laptop that goes for less than the Intel version and we might have a winner.

Chris Jager 06 Mar 2017 1:30 PM Dear Lifehacker, I've been a smoker since I was 14. I'm now 22 and I consider myself to be smoking hot (pun intended). I've heard that smoking cigarettes can age you prematurely. However, judging by the before-and-after photos I've seen, most of these people were pretty rough to begin with! Will smoking really ruin my good looks, or will I just go from a 9 to an 8.5? (I whiten my teeth professionally, so that's not a problem.)

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Making AMD great again! Home Hardware Hands on with AMD’s fab new Ryzen CPU By Jeremy Laird on March 2nd, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Rejoice, for AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is here. And it’s good. Thank science for that. Another dud from AMD didn’t bear thinking about. Instead, we get to ponder just how good Ryzen is and indeed how good it truly needs to be. It isn’t the very fastest CPU money can buy or the greatest gaming CPU ever. But that’s just dandy. It’s still going to blow the PC processor market wide open and force Intel to seriously up its game. If you want the background to AMD’s new chip and a broad overview on what makes it tick, head over here. The task this week is to get a quick feel for what Ryzen is actually like. The chip I’ve played with briefly is the middling model of the launch trio, the Ryzen 7 1700X. Like the other two Ryzen chips AMD is making available at launch, it’s an eight-core beast that crunches two software threads per core. Hexa-core and quad-core models are coming, but aren’t quite ready for launch day. The 1700X clocks in nominally at 3.4GHz with a potential 3.8GHz turbo mode. The ‘X’ suffix, incidentally means it sports AMD’s new XFR auto-overclocking feature, a bit more on which in a moment. For the record the other two chips are the 3.0GHz/3.7GHz 1700 and the 3.6GHz/4GHz 1800X. Pricing for the 1700X is £399. The 1800X rocks in around £499 and the 1700 is yours for £329. Stick a $ sign in front of those numbers and you have the US price, which is both impressive and depressing depending on your point of view. Without further ado, then, let’s get busy. I couldn’t resist firing up the fairly pointless Cinebench synthetic benchmark first, just to see those 16 threads in action. Fly my pretties: Not that it matters much for the real world, but this thing flies in a multi-threaded benchmark like Cinebench. To give you a feel for just how quick it is, it’s nearly two and a half times faster than the incumbent gamer’s choice, the Intel Core i5-7600K. Yowsers. Of course, multi-threading is only half – or should that be 15/16ths – of the story. AMD’s big failure with its previous FX processors was single-threaded performance and it just so happens that games are particularly sensitive to just that. In Cinebench’s single-threaded mode, the Ryzen 7 1700X is between 10 and 20 per cent slower than various gaming-relevant Intel CPUs, with about 10% of that due to a slight comparative deficiency in Ryzen’s architecture and the other 10% thanks to clockspeed. Indeed, it was rumoured prior to launch that clock-for-clock and core-for-core, Ryzen would be roughly a match for Intel’s Haswell-generation chips – the Core iSomething 4000 series chips, in other words. And so it proves in Cinebench. Anyway, I mucked around with a few other canned benchmarks, all of which delivered similar kinds of results. Ryzen monsters quad-core Intel chips in multi-threading. In fact, it’s on about a par with Intel’s own eight-core beast, the 6900K for multithreading. Lest you have forgotten, that’s more or less a £1,000 chip. But what, you cry, of games? Don’t panic, the news here is decent, too, if somewhat preliminary and indeed patchy. You can read detailed benchmarks elsewhere, but to give you one example, in Total War: Attila using the same video card and settings, the Ryzen 1700X cranks out an average of 39 frames per second to 40 from a Core i5-7600K. I got similar results in several other titles. The first caveat to that is that I was running everything at 1440p and high detail settings, which tends to push things towards being GPU limited, even on an Nvidia GTX 1080. The handful of games I ran may also have somewhat flattered Ryzen. Among others, Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games. Part of that is clockspeed, part of it is architecture and part is probably optimisation. You can be sure that few if any games exist that have been compiled to run well on Ryzen. Really broadly, then, Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. If you want to game and stream your exploits at the same time, for instance, Ryzen looks like a killer solution. But a high clocked six-core Ryzen of the near future might be the best AMD bet for gamers. If there is a disappointment, it’s overclocking. All Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked for easy overclocking. But to cut a long story short, they don’t overclock. Well, barely. I squeezed an extra 100MHz out of my chip and that was with water cooling. M’colleagues elsewhere in the reviewersphere report similar findings. Oh, and the XFR auto-overclocking feature doesn’t improve on that. It may be of interest in future when Ryzen chips with more headroom appear. For now, it’s fairly redundant. That said, the 1700X I tested tended to max out at only 3.5GHz in multi-threaded workloads when running at standard rather than overclocked settings rather than the 3.8GHz promised by the chip’s turbo mode. So, that 100MHz overclock was actually more like 400MHz in practice. But I’m not sure I actually care. My feeling coming in was that if Ryzen really was roughly on a par with Haswell and ran at about 3.5GHz, that would be plenty to put the frighteners on Intel. It does just that, so frankly I for one am satisfied. Incidentally, if you’re wondering about operating temps, have a scan of the web. I was only able to run my test chip with water cooling, so the 41 degrees C idle and 51 degrees under load aren’t hugely helpful for the bulk of us that run fairly standard air coolers. What we have then is a chip that isn’t far off Intel for gaming and absolutely obliterates it for multi-threading performance when you factor in pricing. Regards the latter, this chip is literally half the price of Intel’s eight-core 6900K. Staggering. Of course, it’s still bloody expensive at £399. Moreover, you’re never actually going to feel the difference versus the plain old £329 Ryzen 7 1700. So of the initial launch chips, the 1700 is the obvious choice. It’s an awesome all-rounder for the money. However, I still think the sweet spot for most RPSers will likely be the future six-core model. It’ll crank out the same gaming performance (well, in most games) as the eight-core model, just for less money, along with both pretty snazzy multi-threading for content creation and some multi-threading headroom to come as games gradually scale better across multiple cores. Where all this leaves Intel is of course an interesting question. My sense in recent years is that readers have tired of the press bashing Intel for sandbagging, but for my money Ryzen completely confirms that narrative. It makes Intel’s product line up look cynical and overpriced. Personally, I can’t see Intel slashing prices anything like enough to offset the yawning gap between it’s six and eight-core CPUs and Ryzen. In reality, it doesn’t matter much to Intel. Desktop CPUs aren’t all that important and in any case, the likes of Dell will keep cranking out systems for mainstream punters and nobody will care much or notice much. What Intel may do is hurry up the mainstream six-core model for the LGA1151 socket that appeared on its roadmaps recently. Suitably clocked and priced, that would put Intel in a reasonable if still not ideal competitive position. In the meantime, I think enthusiasts will make something of a stampede towards Ryzen. It’s just such a compelling value proposition, even if it remains somewhat unproven. It wouldn’t surprise me to find a few bugs emerging (I hear it’s a bit pernickety when it comes to certain memory configs, for instance) or a few weak spots in its performance profile shake out as the PC community probes its capabilities. AMD is but a small company and it probably doesn’t have the manpower to completely finesse this new architecture first time around. Of course, if that’s correct the upside is that scope remains for future revisions to turn a good chip into a great one. Anyway, this is an initial hands-on, not an entirely definitive and forensic investigation. I’ll have a look at the platform / motherboard part of the Ryzen story in a future post – PCI Express connectivity with Ryzen chips is an emerging concern, for instance. Overall, Ryzen is impressive even if the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers. But if I was buying a CPU right now, it would still be the base model eight-core Ryzen. It’s not perfect and for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs. But it’s a really nice all-rounder for the money.

Fast enough single-threaded, big boost multi-threaded. And the timing’s about right for all of us on a Sandy or Ivy Bridge Core i5 (or below) to upgrade. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 16:25 blur says: Yuuuup. My 2500k is finally showing its age these days. Any CPU upgrade would necessitate motherboard and RAM as well, so the next batch of Ryzen releases definitely look like they might hit the super sweet spot. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:40 Gnoupi says: I’m actually a bit surprised to read that. The consensus on all other reviews I read is that it’s not ideal for gaming, performance wise, compared to the concurrency. And that it only passes them in “ideal” multithreaded conditions (video processing/rendering). Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:46 dangermouse76 says: My reading seems to suggest. That 1440p evens out the FPS comparisons as they push the work to the GPU. But when looking at 1080p gaming with these chips the i7 seems to have a larger margin over Ryzen. Edit: As this article seems to bare out. So yeah these chips dont blow me away for gaming. That may not be their purpose, but still. So yeah very interested to see what the Ryzen i5 competition will look like. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:16 dangermouse76 says: Also this is brand new from scratch work from AMD so optimisations from devs and AMD may help bring that gap down. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:56 Sakkura says: I wouldn’t count on big improvements, but at least the situations where SMT hurts performance should be going away. Maybe a few percent on top of that, here and there.

Where games are CPU limited, the gap is a lot more obvious. Plus there are one or two anomalies, to boot. I think you’ve probably absorbed my generally upbeat tone but ignored the detail of what I wrote.

The way language can glitch like this, causing tiny ambiguities, is really fun for me to dissect! PS almost certainly you meant “after 10pm”, and I would caution you that ’22’ is not an intuitive way for native speakers to write time. 2200, 22:00 and 10pm all read correctly :) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 11:13 Harlander says: Yeah, after 22 you should be getting ready for the Carousel. Renew! Renew! Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:31 carewolf says: Very few games push the CPU and the few that do are multithreaded. What other reviews do to make Intel look better is take something that is close to pushing the CPU but is single-threaded because it usually doesn’t matter, run it in a low resolution like 1080p and then pretend FPS over 100 matters. Then a Kaby Lake is faster than Ryzen, because it does indeed have better single threaded performance. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:29 Unclepauly says: There is much more than “a very few” games that push the cpu. When you go online multiplayer the burden on the CPU increases alot for a large percentage of games. The problem here is that online multiplayer is almost impossible to benchmark consistently. Games with a huge amount of players just compounds the issue. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:18 randomclass says: Also games like Paradox’s grand strategy games, from CK2 to HoI4. They all seem to be laggy in late game, in SP or MP, and it’s all down to CPU, not GPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:54 ravenshrike says: The issue is that the reviews are all over the place with a few more or less matching the 7700k even at 1080p, with others horribly bombing. Most of that is teething issues from the new architecture(Although the on-die memory controller throughput is a bit weak. That needs to be improved by at least 50%, preferably doubled in the next refresh). In three to six months the performance numbers will almost certainly look much better as BIOSes, opcode, and MS drivers are improved, with even some games getting patched to work with Ryzen’s quirks. You’ve got to remember that the Haswell and Broadwell and Lake chips are all very mature at this point with more similarities than differences between them. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:41 kud13 says: A few years back I picked up an AMD FX 4350- also an 8-core 4.0 Ghz base for something ridiculous like 250CAD (this was right before the dollar spiked up). The reason for AMD was I had an AMD-based mobo and I was upgrading piecemeal. Gotta say, I haven’t had any problems with any “modern” games on it since (GPU was a bottleneck for a while, but now I’m running Nvidia 1070). However, Age of Empires 2 HD (that does not support multi-threading, period) DOES make it huff and puff (as opposed to, say, Witcher 3). So I guess we still gotta wait for AMD to come up with powerful single-thread chips. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:52 Sakkura says: 8 cores? Then you mean FX-8350, the FX-4350 is 4 cores. While Ryzen is still not quite on par with Intel in single-threaded performance, it’s very close. And a HUGE upgrade over their old FX chips. We’re talking 60-80% faster. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:49 BadManiac says: I ordered my 1700X today, been waiting for this too long. I’m still gaming on my old Phenom 2 X4, and while running at a respectable 4Ghz, it’s really starting to show it’s age in some games. So for me the jump from 4 cores and 4 threads to 8 cores and 16 threads at hopefully near the same clock speed should be an enormous leap, and I won’t be completely CPU limiting my GTX 1070 any more. :D Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:32 AngoraFish says: My Phenom 2 x4 955 is still running strong and I’ve not noticed any significant CPU bottleneck on anything I play.

I played every single game on it, no problem. But last year I decided to buy an i5 6600. Got a new mobo, new RAM, the new CPU and a new case. Only then I noticed how obsolete the Phenom II was. I got almost double the framerate on most games. I mean, the good old Phenom II served its purpose. It allowed me to play any game I wanted. It also didn’t do that so well. And there was also a bonus. It worked as a very nice space heater! Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 23:05 Don Reba says: My main requirement from a CPU is maximum AVX2 performance, in which Ryzen lags behind Intel literally by a factor of 2, so my main hope is that competition will force Intel to add more cores and drop prices. It could be argued that I would be better served by a GPU, but, well, it’s a whole other can of worms, and I don’t want the hassle.

But I do more than just playing nothing but games on my desktop, and having 8 physical cores would be a great convenience for the VMs and the sometimes video encodes that I do. Consider me pleasantly impressed. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:07 ScubaMonster says: I’ve seen some articles about the performance comparison, but not any that factor in price at the same time. I get that it’s the cold hard numbers that matter most and these chips are going up against Intel’s offerings. But if a Ryzen chip lags a bit behind its Intel counterpart but is substantially cheaper I would consider that a win. Sure, you could pony up extra bucks if you absolutely must have the best of the best, but if you can get performance close to it for a lot cheaper, that would be a no brainer to me. I don’t know all the pricing to make a comparison myself though. I haven’t really looked at the Ryzen prices compared to their Intel equivalents. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 01:37 haldolium says: Check the chart on the bottom of the site here, it gives an impression where Ryzen stands in terms of pricing to performance: link to computerbase.de Good thing AMD catches up, but by now I am more interested in GPGPU in general since GPU based rendering has taken HUGE steps in the time AMD was figuring out the Zen and for playing games, the CPU is so seldom an issue that I couldn’t care less for the high-end market. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:49 Unclepauly says: It really does depend on the types of games a person plays though. Certain genres of games have a greater need for CPU performance while many do not. Plenty of outliers as well. Take ARMA 3 for example, Sandy bridge systems net about 30-35 fps while Kaby Lake(with very fast ram) is netting roughly 55-60 fps. Cherry picked game of course but there are others out there less documented that benefit as well. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:45 Rack says: Sadly the current scenario does Ryzen few favours. A 1700 compares poorly with an i5 7600k at £100 more. Right at the bottom of the pile the 1100 might be a reasonable budget option but all in all Ryzen looks to be a good option for 3d modelling, less so for games. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:16 ButteringSundays says: I haven’t noticed my 5 y/o i5 acting as a bottleneck anywhere I’ve noticed (the 760 is showing its age though… sometimes).

Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:14 Lord Zeon says: The CPU hasn’t been a bottleneck for gaming for almost a decade now. I still use a first gen Bulldozer CPU, the FX-8120, and I’ve never seen a AAA title get caught up on it with my GTX 970. Imagine that – the first of the “awful” AMD architectures that Ryzen is replacing still is entirely relevant in the enthusiast gaming space. I genuinely think that Intel’s marketing has permeated the enthusiast community to the point where everyone has lost the their reference point as to what a CPU needs to do for gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 14:03 Sakkura says: If you’re not seeing the FX-8120 limit performance, then you’re simply not looking. It definitely does. That doesn’t mean everything is unplayable on it, but it really doesn’t qualify for enthusiast gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 15:18 tehfish says: As an FX-8120 owner also, it does bottleneck the GPU in recent games, but it does depend on what GPU you have. You may just be very lucky with a well-matched GPU to go with the CPU there. For an example, with fallout4, an overclocked FX-8120 (4.2ghz, no turbo) and a R9 390: It’s perfectly playable often running happily at 1080p 60fps, then you can hit certain areas where it drops to ~20-30fps with the GPU core down to ~450mhz out of it’s maximum 1060mhz – a clear case of a CPU bottleneck. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 00:18 Etherion says: I also have a quite dated i5 760 cpu, but didn’t feel it as a bottleneck until just recently (current gpu is gtx 770 overclocked) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:45 bfar says: Way back in January last year, I had a long discussion with my peers on a UK forum over 6700k vs 5820k, as they were roughly the same price at the time. I argued that for gaming, the higher clocked 4 core CPU would be the better bet for at least a year or two. We agreed that for all other applications, the lower clocked 6 core chip was the way to go. It seems that a year later, nothing has changed, and it frames the perception of Rysen from an enthusiast perspective. It’s still a major coup for consumers though, because as Jeremy rightly points out, most of Intels chips look like poor value for money all of a sudden. Prices will fall across the board.

Starting out on a GTX 460, then SLI 560TI to a GTX 780/970(RMA replace) and now a GTX 1070. Until my games consistently dip below 50fps on max settings with my current or newer video card, I have no real reason to upgrade yet.

Whilst it doesn’t match a 7700K, it’s a great alternative to Intel’s enthusiast class CPUs at a much lower price, and being AMD hopefully supports ECC RAM too. The problem is, I’m not convinced the enthusiast market is large enough. If you’re using virtualisation, rendering, or transcoding video it’s a huge win, but for general productivity and games this isn’t on the radar and probably never will be. Neither are any of Intel’s chips with more than four cores. They also haven’t talked up any virtualisation support, other than encrypted memory. They could do much more in this area if they wanted to. Roll on four fast core versions of Ryzen.. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

(Yonatan Sindel/Flash90) YERUSHALAYIM - In its annual report, Intel Israel said that it had exported $3.3 billion of high-tech equipment in 2016 – 8 percent of all of Israel’s tech exports for the year. According to Daniel Ben Attar, head of production of Intel Israel, much of that was in the form of processors and equipment made in the company’s facility in Kiryat Gat. “This facility is considered one of Intel’s best in the world,” said Ben Attar. “The exports from this site make a great contribution to the Israeli economy, and provide a good source of income for Intel worldwide. Some 56 percent of our annual exports come from this facility.” Intel Israel currently has 10,200 workers in Israel, 67 percent of them (about 6,900 workers) working in development, with another third in the manufacturing facilities, which churn out processors for the “Intel Inside” laptops and desktops sold by manufacturers around the world. According to the company, it is directly responsible for an additional 30,000 jobs in Israel in companies that provide supplies and services to Intel Israel. “Intel’s facilities have had an enormous impact on Israel,” according to Yaniv Gerty, CEO of Intel Israel. “Over the past 43 years we have exported some $46 billion in goods and services, a huge amount that has had a major impact on Israel’s economic growth and on the lives of Israelis.” Filed under: Economy, Export Print Email Gmail Related Finance Ministry Mulls Intel Grant Intel to Shutter Yerushalayim Production Facility Intel Bails Out Kiryat Gat Factory High-Tech, Pharmaceutical Exports Jump Tech, Pharma Exports Fall Sharply, Report Says More in Israel Antiquities Theft Foiled Near Shaalvim Netanyahu Meets With Israeli Envoys in Asia-Pacific Security Forces Kill Terrorist in Shootout Near Ramallah U.S. Warning to Israel Signals New Backpedaling by Trump Switzerland Allegedly Funding Radical Anti-Israel NGOs OP-ED Name-Calling in the Name of Civil Rights How’s He Doing?

The answer to that, as it turns out, is a bit complicated. Before I dive into the details of the reviews, you might want to brush up on a couple of things: For a quick refresher on what Ryzen is, head here. For a very basic outline on how processors work, head here. So, now that you know what Ryzen is, you also know why I’m excited for it. Intel has been ruling the CPU market for a decade now and all AMD has managed to do so far, is struggle to keep its head above the water. Intel, taking advantage of this, simply monopolised the market and did what any monopoly would do, it kept prices high. Now I’m not against anything that Intel has done, it’s done a stellar job with its CPU design over the years and filled a gap that AMD was simply incapable of filling. While Intel may have completely ruined AMD’s future with shady marketing tactics in AMD’s Athlon 64 days, Intel’s Core architecture and Sandy Bridge in particular, took CPUs to another level of performance. That said, Intel didn’t did extract a high price for this GigaHertz goodness and I owe the company no loyalty. AMD, for its part, should also have done better. And now it has, finally. Ryzen 7 compute performance As expected, Ryzen 7 thrashes Intel in just about every benchmark that benefits from a high core count. This includes 3D rendering, number crunching, video editing, etc. At the same time, Ryzen 7’s clock speeds are lower than Intel’s and its IPC (instructions per clock) is also lower. This lower’s gaming performance as modern games, even today, don’t need 8 cores. Intel’s integer operations performance is also higher, resulting in better gaming performance. As ArsTechnica found in its review, the Ryzen 1800X beats the Intel i7 6950X – which is more than double the price – in tests like Cinebench and video encoding. Tests which focus on integer performance, like 3DMark, definitely appear to favour Intel. Again, integer performance is essential for gaming. To get a bit technical, AMD’s Ryzen will benefit tasks that require a large number of floating point operations, such as raw math tasks and rendering. Just about everything else will need integer performance, which Intel can offer thanks to its AVX 2 (advanced vector extensions) instruction sets. The bottom line is this, in pure computational tasks, AMD is either way better or just a tad slower than Intel. In terms of value for money, Ryzen is phenomenal as it does this at half the price of Intel’s best offering. Even if Intel’s architecture is better, it’s just priced too high. Ryzen 7 gaming performance This is what we’ve been waiting for, isn’t it? Sadly, there is bad news on this front. As mentioned earlier, a higher core count doesn’t affect games. A higher clock speed and a higher IPC does. Benchmarks on various sites show that AMD’s Ryzen 7 is slower than even Intel’s quad-core i7 7700K, which is cheaper than the 1800X, by the way. The difference in performance in games like Rise of the Tomb Raider, Ashes of the Singularity, Hitman, etc., ranges from 4 percent to almost 30 percent. This is very significant to a gamer, especially if you’re building a high-end gaming rig. For those who stream their games live on Twitch and the like, there is still no good news. Apparently, AMD Ryzen doesn’t suffer as much of a performance drop as Intel when streaming games, but despite that, the overall performance of the flagship Ryzen 7 1800X is lower than that of the Intel’s 7700K. For gaming, nothing beats Intel, yet. I’m building a new PC, should I buy Ryzen? AMD’s Ryzen 5 and 3 haven’t yet been announced, so I can’t comment on the lower end of the spectrum. If you’re building a high-end rig, however, the choice is clear. If you’re building a high-end workstation for real work, i.e., 3D rendering, video encoding, etc., AI research, etc., AMD Ryzen 7 just offers too much value for money. Taking a Ryzen 7 for this is literally a no-brainer. If you’re building a PC for gaming, however, the Intel i7 7700K is still the way to go. The performance difference is simply too great. It’s also cheaper than the 1800X. If you’re looking for in-depth Ryzen reviews, head here. For a slightly more layman friendly version, head here.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Making AMD great again! Home Hardware Hands on with AMD’s fab new Ryzen CPU By Jeremy Laird on March 2nd, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Rejoice, for AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is here. And it’s good. Thank science for that. Another dud from AMD didn’t bear thinking about. Instead, we get to ponder just how good Ryzen is and indeed how good it truly needs to be. It isn’t the very fastest CPU money can buy or the greatest gaming CPU ever. But that’s just dandy. It’s still going to blow the PC processor market wide open and force Intel to seriously up its game. If you want the background to AMD’s new chip and a broad overview on what makes it tick, head over here. The task this week is to get a quick feel for what Ryzen is actually like. The chip I’ve played with briefly is the middling model of the launch trio, the Ryzen 7 1700X. Like the other two Ryzen chips AMD is making available at launch, it’s an eight-core beast that crunches two software threads per core. Hexa-core and quad-core models are coming, but aren’t quite ready for launch day. The 1700X clocks in nominally at 3.4GHz with a potential 3.8GHz turbo mode. The ‘X’ suffix, incidentally means it sports AMD’s new XFR auto-overclocking feature, a bit more on which in a moment. For the record the other two chips are the 3.0GHz/3.7GHz 1700 and the 3.6GHz/4GHz 1800X. Pricing for the 1700X is £399. The 1800X rocks in around £499 and the 1700 is yours for £329. Stick a $ sign in front of those numbers and you have the US price, which is both impressive and depressing depending on your point of view. Without further ado, then, let’s get busy. I couldn’t resist firing up the fairly pointless Cinebench synthetic benchmark first, just to see those 16 threads in action. Fly my pretties: Not that it matters much for the real world, but this thing flies in a multi-threaded benchmark like Cinebench. To give you a feel for just how quick it is, it’s nearly two and a half times faster than the incumbent gamer’s choice, the Intel Core i5-7600K. Yowsers. Of course, multi-threading is only half – or should that be 15/16ths – of the story. AMD’s big failure with its previous FX processors was single-threaded performance and it just so happens that games are particularly sensitive to just that. In Cinebench’s single-threaded mode, the Ryzen 7 1700X is between 10 and 20 per cent slower than various gaming-relevant Intel CPUs, with about 10% of that due to a slight comparative deficiency in Ryzen’s architecture and the other 10% thanks to clockspeed. Indeed, it was rumoured prior to launch that clock-for-clock and core-for-core, Ryzen would be roughly a match for Intel’s Haswell-generation chips – the Core iSomething 4000 series chips, in other words. And so it proves in Cinebench. Anyway, I mucked around with a few other canned benchmarks, all of which delivered similar kinds of results. Ryzen monsters quad-core Intel chips in multi-threading. In fact, it’s on about a par with Intel’s own eight-core beast, the 6900K for multithreading. Lest you have forgotten, that’s more or less a £1,000 chip. But what, you cry, of games? Don’t panic, the news here is decent, too, if somewhat preliminary and indeed patchy. You can read detailed benchmarks elsewhere, but to give you one example, in Total War: Attila using the same video card and settings, the Ryzen 1700X cranks out an average of 39 frames per second to 40 from a Core i5-7600K. I got similar results in several other titles. The first caveat to that is that I was running everything at 1440p and high detail settings, which tends to push things towards being GPU limited, even on an Nvidia GTX 1080. The handful of games I ran may also have somewhat flattered Ryzen. Among others, Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games. Part of that is clockspeed, part of it is architecture and part is probably optimisation. You can be sure that few if any games exist that have been compiled to run well on Ryzen. Really broadly, then, Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. If you want to game and stream your exploits at the same time, for instance, Ryzen looks like a killer solution. But a high clocked six-core Ryzen of the near future might be the best AMD bet for gamers. If there is a disappointment, it’s overclocking. All Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked for easy overclocking. But to cut a long story short, they don’t overclock. Well, barely. I squeezed an extra 100MHz out of my chip and that was with water cooling. M’colleagues elsewhere in the reviewersphere report similar findings. Oh, and the XFR auto-overclocking feature doesn’t improve on that. It may be of interest in future when Ryzen chips with more headroom appear. For now, it’s fairly redundant. That said, the 1700X I tested tended to max out at only 3.5GHz in multi-threaded workloads when running at standard rather than overclocked settings rather than the 3.8GHz promised by the chip’s turbo mode. So, that 100MHz overclock was actually more like 400MHz in practice. But I’m not sure I actually care. My feeling coming in was that if Ryzen really was roughly on a par with Haswell and ran at about 3.5GHz, that would be plenty to put the frighteners on Intel. It does just that, so frankly I for one am satisfied. Incidentally, if you’re wondering about operating temps, have a scan of the web. I was only able to run my test chip with water cooling, so the 41 degrees C idle and 51 degrees under load aren’t hugely helpful for the bulk of us that run fairly standard air coolers. What we have then is a chip that isn’t far off Intel for gaming and absolutely obliterates it for multi-threading performance when you factor in pricing. Regards the latter, this chip is literally half the price of Intel’s eight-core 6900K. Staggering. Of course, it’s still bloody expensive at £399. Moreover, you’re never actually going to feel the difference versus the plain old £329 Ryzen 7 1700. So of the initial launch chips, the 1700 is the obvious choice. It’s an awesome all-rounder for the money. However, I still think the sweet spot for most RPSers will likely be the future six-core model. It’ll crank out the same gaming performance (well, in most games) as the eight-core model, just for less money, along with both pretty snazzy multi-threading for content creation and some multi-threading headroom to come as games gradually scale better across multiple cores. Where all this leaves Intel is of course an interesting question. My sense in recent years is that readers have tired of the press bashing Intel for sandbagging, but for my money Ryzen completely confirms that narrative. It makes Intel’s product line up look cynical and overpriced. Personally, I can’t see Intel slashing prices anything like enough to offset the yawning gap between it’s six and eight-core CPUs and Ryzen. In reality, it doesn’t matter much to Intel. Desktop CPUs aren’t all that important and in any case, the likes of Dell will keep cranking out systems for mainstream punters and nobody will care much or notice much. What Intel may do is hurry up the mainstream six-core model for the LGA1151 socket that appeared on its roadmaps recently. Suitably clocked and priced, that would put Intel in a reasonable if still not ideal competitive position. In the meantime, I think enthusiasts will make something of a stampede towards Ryzen. It’s just such a compelling value proposition, even if it remains somewhat unproven. It wouldn’t surprise me to find a few bugs emerging (I hear it’s a bit pernickety when it comes to certain memory configs, for instance) or a few weak spots in its performance profile shake out as the PC community probes its capabilities. AMD is but a small company and it probably doesn’t have the manpower to completely finesse this new architecture first time around. Of course, if that’s correct the upside is that scope remains for future revisions to turn a good chip into a great one. Anyway, this is an initial hands-on, not an entirely definitive and forensic investigation. I’ll have a look at the platform / motherboard part of the Ryzen story in a future post – PCI Express connectivity with Ryzen chips is an emerging concern, for instance. Overall, Ryzen is impressive even if the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers. But if I was buying a CPU right now, it would still be the base model eight-core Ryzen. It’s not perfect and for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs. But it’s a really nice all-rounder for the money.

Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:40 Gnoupi says: I’m actually a bit surprised to read that. The consensus on all other reviews I read is that it’s not ideal for gaming, performance wise, compared to the concurrency. And that it only passes them in “ideal” multithreaded conditions (video processing/rendering). Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:46 dangermouse76 says: My reading seems to suggest. That 1440p evens out the FPS comparisons as they push the work to the GPU. But when looking at 1080p gaming with these chips the i7 seems to have a larger margin over Ryzen. Edit: As this article seems to bare out. So yeah these chips dont blow me away for gaming. That may not be their purpose, but still. So yeah very interested to see what the Ryzen i5 competition will look like. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:16 dangermouse76 says: Also this is brand new from scratch work from AMD so optimisations from devs and AMD may help bring that gap down. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:56 Sakkura says: I wouldn’t count on big improvements, but at least the situations where SMT hurts performance should be going away. Maybe a few percent on top of that, here and there.

Where games are CPU limited, the gap is a lot more obvious. Plus there are one or two anomalies, to boot. I think you’ve probably absorbed my generally upbeat tone but ignored the detail of what I wrote.

The way language can glitch like this, causing tiny ambiguities, is really fun for me to dissect!

Renew! Renew! Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:31 carewolf says: Very few games push the CPU and the few that do are multithreaded. What other reviews do to make Intel look better is take something that is close to pushing the CPU but is single-threaded because it usually doesn’t matter, run it in a low resolution like 1080p and then pretend FPS over 100 matters. Then a Kaby Lake is faster than Ryzen, because it does indeed have better single threaded performance.

When you go online multiplayer the burden on the CPU increases alot for a large percentage of games. The problem here is that online multiplayer is almost impossible to benchmark consistently. Games with a huge amount of players just compounds the issue. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:18 randomclass says: Also games like Paradox’s grand strategy games, from CK2 to HoI4. They all seem to be laggy in late game, in SP or MP, and it’s all down to CPU, not GPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:54 ravenshrike says: The issue is that the reviews are all over the place with a few more or less matching the 7700k even at 1080p, with others horribly bombing. Most of that is teething issues from the new architecture(Although the on-die memory controller throughput is a bit weak. That needs to be improved by at least 50%, preferably doubled in the next refresh). In three to six months the performance numbers will almost certainly look much better as BIOSes, opcode, and MS drivers are improved, with even some games getting patched to work with Ryzen’s quirks. You’ve got to remember that the Haswell and Broadwell and Lake chips are all very mature at this point with more similarities than differences between them.

The reason for AMD was I had an AMD-based mobo and I was upgrading piecemeal. Gotta say, I haven’t had any problems with any “modern” games on it since (GPU was a bottleneck for a while, but now I’m running Nvidia 1070). However, Age of Empires 2 HD (that does not support multi-threading, period) DOES make it huff and puff (as opposed to, say, Witcher 3). So I guess we still gotta wait for AMD to come up with powerful single-thread chips. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:52 Sakkura says: 8 cores? Then you mean FX-8350, the FX-4350 is 4 cores. While Ryzen is still not quite on par with Intel in single-threaded performance, it’s very close. And a HUGE upgrade over their old FX chips. We’re talking 60-80% faster.

I’m still gaming on my old Phenom 2 X4, and while running at a respectable 4Ghz, it’s really starting to show it’s age in some games. So for me the jump from 4 cores and 4 threads to 8 cores and 16 threads at hopefully near the same clock speed should be an enormous leap, and I won’t be completely CPU limiting my GTX 1070 any more. :D Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:32 AngoraFish says: My Phenom 2 x4 955 is still running strong and I’ve not noticed any significant CPU bottleneck on anything I play.

I played every single game on it, no problem. But last year I decided to buy an i5 6600. Got a new mobo, new RAM, the new CPU and a new case. Only then I noticed how obsolete the Phenom II was. I got almost double the framerate on most games. I mean, the good old Phenom II served its purpose. It allowed me to play any game I wanted. It also didn’t do that so well. And there was also a bonus. It worked as a very nice space heater!

It could be argued that I would be better served by a GPU, but, well, it’s a whole other can of worms, and I don’t want the hassle.

Consider me pleasantly impressed. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:07 ScubaMonster says: I’ve seen some articles about the performance comparison, but not any that factor in price at the same time. I get that it’s the cold hard numbers that matter most and these chips are going up against Intel’s offerings. But if a Ryzen chip lags a bit behind its Intel counterpart but is substantially cheaper I would consider that a win. Sure, you could pony up extra bucks if you absolutely must have the best of the best, but if you can get performance close to it for a lot cheaper, that would be a no brainer to me. I don’t know all the pricing to make a comparison myself though. I haven’t really looked at the Ryzen prices compared to their Intel equivalents.

Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:49 Unclepauly says: It really does depend on the types of games a person plays though. Certain genres of games have a greater need for CPU performance while many do not. Plenty of outliers as well. Take ARMA 3 for example, Sandy bridge systems net about 30-35 fps while Kaby Lake(with very fast ram) is netting roughly 55-60 fps. Cherry picked game of course but there are others out there less documented that benefit as well. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:45 Rack says: Sadly the current scenario does Ryzen few favours. A 1700 compares poorly with an i5 7600k at £100 more. Right at the bottom of the pile the 1100 might be a reasonable budget option but all in all Ryzen looks to be a good option for 3d modelling, less so for games. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:16 ButteringSundays says: I haven’t noticed my 5 y/o i5 acting as a bottleneck anywhere I’ve noticed (the 760 is showing its age though… sometimes).

Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:14 Lord Zeon says: The CPU hasn’t been a bottleneck for gaming for almost a decade now. I still use a first gen Bulldozer CPU, the FX-8120, and I’ve never seen a AAA title get caught up on it with my GTX 970. Imagine that – the first of the “awful” AMD architectures that Ryzen is replacing still is entirely relevant in the enthusiast gaming space. I genuinely think that Intel’s marketing has permeated the enthusiast community to the point where everyone has lost the their reference point as to what a CPU needs to do for gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 14:03 Sakkura says: If you’re not seeing the FX-8120 limit performance, then you’re simply not looking. It definitely does. That doesn’t mean everything is unplayable on it, but it really doesn’t qualify for enthusiast gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 15:18 tehfish says: As an FX-8120 owner also, it does bottleneck the GPU in recent games, but it does depend on what GPU you have. You may just be very lucky with a well-matched GPU to go with the CPU there. For an example, with fallout4, an overclocked FX-8120 (4.2ghz, no turbo) and a R9 390: It’s perfectly playable often running happily at 1080p 60fps, then you can hit certain areas where it drops to ~20-30fps with the GPU core down to ~450mhz out of it’s maximum 1060mhz – a clear case of a CPU bottleneck. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 00:18 Etherion says: I also have a quite dated i5 760 cpu, but didn’t feel it as a bottleneck until just recently (current gpu is gtx 770 overclocked) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:45 bfar says: Way back in January last year, I had a long discussion with my peers on a UK forum over 6700k vs 5820k, as they were roughly the same price at the time. I argued that for gaming, the higher clocked 4 core CPU would be the better bet for at least a year or two. We agreed that for all other applications, the lower clocked 6 core chip was the way to go. It seems that a year later, nothing has changed, and it frames the perception of Rysen from an enthusiast perspective. It’s still a major coup for consumers though, because as Jeremy rightly points out, most of Intels chips look like poor value for money all of a sudden. Prices will fall across the board.

I’ve been running a 7 year old used i7 2600k oc’ed since 2012. To maintain 60fps minimum, the only part that I’ve had to upgrade was always the video card. Starting out on a GTX 460, then SLI 560TI to a GTX 780/970(RMA replace) and now a GTX 1070. Until my games consistently dip below 50fps on max settings with my current or newer video card, I have no real reason to upgrade yet. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 16:57 syllopsium says: Have to admit I was wrong with this – I expected the single threaded performance would suck. Whilst it doesn’t match a 7700K, it’s a great alternative to Intel’s enthusiast class CPUs at a much lower price, and being AMD hopefully supports ECC RAM too. The problem is, I’m not convinced the enthusiast market is large enough. If you’re using virtualisation, rendering, or transcoding video it’s a huge win, but for general productivity and games this isn’t on the radar and probably never will be. Neither are any of Intel’s chips with more than four cores. They also haven’t talked up any virtualisation support, other than encrypted memory. They could do much more in this area if they wanted to. Roll on four fast core versions of Ryzen.. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

You Need To Know About Ryzen, AMD's Shot At An Intel-Killing Chip Alex Cranz Mar 3, 2017, 3:30pm ⋅ Filed to:  cpus intel kaby lake microarchitecture ryzen zen Share Sometimes it feels like computers have reached peak speed. Often times, when trolling YouTube or playing a quick round of Overwatch the limitations on performance seem tied to something else. Your internet is too slow, or you need a new graphics card. Computer processors have gotten faster — every year Intel unveils a microarchitecture with breathless claims of mighty performance improvements, but CPUs haven't had a real leap forward in a while. AMD's new Ryzen processors comes perilously close to changing the game. In recent years, AMD has kind of become the ugly cousin to competitors Intel and Nvidia. While AMD may power the Xbox One and the PS4, the company has languished in the traditional computer market. On the graphics side, Nvidia has stomped AMD to hold the majority marketshare — Nvida's cards are found in most gaming laptops, and a lot of workstations too. On the CPU. side Intel is practically ubiquitous with the word computer. Seeing the tiny AMD sticker on a good laptop is an oddity, not a regularity. AMD desperately wants that to change and the Ryzen CPU is the first step. AMD's Ryzen processor is based on the company's new Zen microarchitecture. Zen is nearly half the size of AMD's last microarchitecture, the six-year-old Bulldozer. And Ryzen, running on Zen, is much, much faster. Not just faster than the chips running on the ageing Bulldozer. Ryzen is also significantly faster than much of what Intel has to offer. Today, only three Ryzen chips are available, and they're only going to work with desktop computers. There's the 1700, which retails for $US330 ($436), the 1700x, which retails for $US400 ($529), and the top of the line 1800x, which retails for $US500 ($661). It feels almost like a gamble for AMD to launch its new microarchitecture with desktop CPUs. Work places are increasingly moving to laptops, and that's what most consumers look for when they head to the big box store to buy a new computer. But it makes sense when you see how the top of the line Ryzen 1800x stacks up against Intel's best Kaby Lake CPU, the i7-7700K. This thing flies when rendering 3D images in Blender or videos in Handbrake, or even the game Rise of the Tomb Raider. In all three instances it was nearly twice as fast as the i7, despite costing just $US150 ($198) more. From top to bottom: Blender, Handbrake, Rise of the Tomb Raider. Much of the Ryzen's speed comes from the number of processor cores it packs into the CPU. It has eight cores, capable of running 16 threads concurrently. The i7-7700K has just 4 cores that run 8 threads concurrently. So the Ryzen can handle twice as many processes concurrently — which is especially useful when you have to render giant chunks of media in programs like Blender and Handbrake. According to both Intel and AMD, the processor that is most comparable to the 1800X is Intel's i7-6900K. But the i7-6900K runs on the older Broadwell-E architecture...and it currently retails for $US1000 ($1,322). Which means the Ryzen 1800X can give the same performance for half the price. That's magic! That's money saved! That also has to mean there's a catch. In the case of AMD's miracle new ultra fast processors there are two catches. The first is related to speed — Ryzen is still slow in a lot of instances. Intel has dominated so much of the computer market than many software designers have optimised their product to run especially well on Intel CPUs. Which is why it took the 1800x twice as long to render images in Photoshop, and why it was neck and neck with the i7-7700K in both our WebXPRT and Civilizations VI benchmarks. It's also why it scored only 2000 points higher in Geekbench 4 despite having twice as many cores. Clockwise from left to right: Geekbench 4, WebXPRT, Photoshop, Civilizations VI. Until software designers start optimising for Ryzen it will only be able to brute force its way into winning benchmarks, and software designers may never do that unless AMD can gain more of the CPU marketshare. Though AMD reps assured Gizmodo that software designers will soon be able to incorporate many potential optimizations tailored for Ryzen. Yet that won't help with Ryzen's other issue: the integrated GPU. The Ryzen CPUs don't have one. There's no way to get video out. If you want to view anything on your computer built with Ryzen inside — browser, operating systems, even BIOS — you'll have to spend additional money on a graphics card. That's not a problem for gamers, or editors and designers rendering huge files. They will have already invested in a video card. It is a problem for budget conscious PC builders. And it will continue to be a problem until AMD drops its Accelerated Processing Units (the name for AMD's CPUs with integrated graphics) later this year. The APUs and other mobile friendly chips are certainly on the horizon — AMD has promised as much, but right now what AMD has delivered is incredible speeds that will benefit only a small portion of computer users. Which is a damn shame. Ryzen runs cooler than Kaby Lake or Skylake, and it sucks up less power, and it's faster. In nearly every way that counts Ryzen seems superior to what Intel is currently offering. But it's going to need more than raw speed if it ever wants to truly win. The 1800X's price to power ratio has me nearly convinced AMD has a contender — now stick this in a laptop that goes for less than the Intel version and we might have a winner. Correction: The original piece identified the i7-6900K as Skylake. It is, in fact, Broadwell-E. Comments Daaaaamm,I'mLookin'Good @skinja Mar 3, 2017, 4:25pm i weas sad to see it was only just scraping past intel chips. but im glad to know its mainly due to software optimisation, which is what i suspected in the first place. and i guess its also amazing that its winning by brute forcing most of the time. i didnt realise there was no integrated gpu, seems like a shot in the foot and an area that could have helped with their sales. im glad i cant afford to upgrade my 9yo pc right now, gives me time to wait it out for the rest of the year and see how things change down the track. i hope AMD goes from strength to strength in the coming months when theyre supported by software optimisation and have their other products out. Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Mar 4, 2017, 7:16am I think people are overestimating compiler optimisation. No developer explicitly targets AMD64, and very few target Intel64. Most compilers include a favour setting but it's almost always left on blend: optimisations are included for both architectures but only if they match or benefit both. It remains to be seen, but I wouldn't expect more than a percent or two difference based on what we know so far.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Making AMD great again! Home Hardware Hands on with AMD’s fab new Ryzen CPU By Jeremy Laird on March 2nd, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Rejoice, for AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is here. And it’s good. Thank science for that. Another dud from AMD didn’t bear thinking about. Instead, we get to ponder just how good Ryzen is and indeed how good it truly needs to be. It isn’t the very fastest CPU money can buy or the greatest gaming CPU ever. But that’s just dandy. It’s still going to blow the PC processor market wide open and force Intel to seriously up its game. If you want the background to AMD’s new chip and a broad overview on what makes it tick, head over here. The task this week is to get a quick feel for what Ryzen is actually like. The chip I’ve played with briefly is the middling model of the launch trio, the Ryzen 7 1700X. Like the other two Ryzen chips AMD is making available at launch, it’s an eight-core beast that crunches two software threads per core. Hexa-core and quad-core models are coming, but aren’t quite ready for launch day. The 1700X clocks in nominally at 3.4GHz with a potential 3.8GHz turbo mode. The ‘X’ suffix, incidentally means it sports AMD’s new XFR auto-overclocking feature, a bit more on which in a moment. For the record the other two chips are the 3.0GHz/3.7GHz 1700 and the 3.6GHz/4GHz 1800X. Pricing for the 1700X is £399. The 1800X rocks in around £499 and the 1700 is yours for £329. Stick a $ sign in front of those numbers and you have the US price, which is both impressive and depressing depending on your point of view. Without further ado, then, let’s get busy. I couldn’t resist firing up the fairly pointless Cinebench synthetic benchmark first, just to see those 16 threads in action. Fly my pretties: Not that it matters much for the real world, but this thing flies in a multi-threaded benchmark like Cinebench. To give you a feel for just how quick it is, it’s nearly two and a half times faster than the incumbent gamer’s choice, the Intel Core i5-7600K. Yowsers. Of course, multi-threading is only half – or should that be 15/16ths – of the story. AMD’s big failure with its previous FX processors was single-threaded performance and it just so happens that games are particularly sensitive to just that. In Cinebench’s single-threaded mode, the Ryzen 7 1700X is between 10 and 20 per cent slower than various gaming-relevant Intel CPUs, with about 10% of that due to a slight comparative deficiency in Ryzen’s architecture and the other 10% thanks to clockspeed. Indeed, it was rumoured prior to launch that clock-for-clock and core-for-core, Ryzen would be roughly a match for Intel’s Haswell-generation chips – the Core iSomething 4000 series chips, in other words. And so it proves in Cinebench. Anyway, I mucked around with a few other canned benchmarks, all of which delivered similar kinds of results. Ryzen monsters quad-core Intel chips in multi-threading. In fact, it’s on about a par with Intel’s own eight-core beast, the 6900K for multithreading. Lest you have forgotten, that’s more or less a £1,000 chip. But what, you cry, of games? Don’t panic, the news here is decent, too, if somewhat preliminary and indeed patchy. You can read detailed benchmarks elsewhere, but to give you one example, in Total War: Attila using the same video card and settings, the Ryzen 1700X cranks out an average of 39 frames per second to 40 from a Core i5-7600K. I got similar results in several other titles. The first caveat to that is that I was running everything at 1440p and high detail settings, which tends to push things towards being GPU limited, even on an Nvidia GTX 1080. The handful of games I ran may also have somewhat flattered Ryzen. Among others, Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games. Part of that is clockspeed, part of it is architecture and part is probably optimisation. You can be sure that few if any games exist that have been compiled to run well on Ryzen. Really broadly, then, Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. If you want to game and stream your exploits at the same time, for instance, Ryzen looks like a killer solution. But a high clocked six-core Ryzen of the near future might be the best AMD bet for gamers. If there is a disappointment, it’s overclocking. All Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked for easy overclocking. But to cut a long story short, they don’t overclock. Well, barely. I squeezed an extra 100MHz out of my chip and that was with water cooling. M’colleagues elsewhere in the reviewersphere report similar findings. Oh, and the XFR auto-overclocking feature doesn’t improve on that. It may be of interest in future when Ryzen chips with more headroom appear. For now, it’s fairly redundant. That said, the 1700X I tested tended to max out at only 3.5GHz in multi-threaded workloads when running at standard rather than overclocked settings rather than the 3.8GHz promised by the chip’s turbo mode. So, that 100MHz overclock was actually more like 400MHz in practice. But I’m not sure I actually care. My feeling coming in was that if Ryzen really was roughly on a par with Haswell and ran at about 3.5GHz, that would be plenty to put the frighteners on Intel. It does just that, so frankly I for one am satisfied. Incidentally, if you’re wondering about operating temps, have a scan of the web. I was only able to run my test chip with water cooling, so the 41 degrees C idle and 51 degrees under load aren’t hugely helpful for the bulk of us that run fairly standard air coolers. What we have then is a chip that isn’t far off Intel for gaming and absolutely obliterates it for multi-threading performance when you factor in pricing. Regards the latter, this chip is literally half the price of Intel’s eight-core 6900K. Staggering. Of course, it’s still bloody expensive at £399. Moreover, you’re never actually going to feel the difference versus the plain old £329 Ryzen 7 1700. So of the initial launch chips, the 1700 is the obvious choice. It’s an awesome all-rounder for the money. However, I still think the sweet spot for most RPSers will likely be the future six-core model. It’ll crank out the same gaming performance (well, in most games) as the eight-core model, just for less money, along with both pretty snazzy multi-threading for content creation and some multi-threading headroom to come as games gradually scale better across multiple cores. Where all this leaves Intel is of course an interesting question. My sense in recent years is that readers have tired of the press bashing Intel for sandbagging, but for my money Ryzen completely confirms that narrative. It makes Intel’s product line up look cynical and overpriced. Personally, I can’t see Intel slashing prices anything like enough to offset the yawning gap between it’s six and eight-core CPUs and Ryzen. In reality, it doesn’t matter much to Intel. Desktop CPUs aren’t all that important and in any case, the likes of Dell will keep cranking out systems for mainstream punters and nobody will care much or notice much. What Intel may do is hurry up the mainstream six-core model for the LGA1151 socket that appeared on its roadmaps recently. Suitably clocked and priced, that would put Intel in a reasonable if still not ideal competitive position. In the meantime, I think enthusiasts will make something of a stampede towards Ryzen. It’s just such a compelling value proposition, even if it remains somewhat unproven. It wouldn’t surprise me to find a few bugs emerging (I hear it’s a bit pernickety when it comes to certain memory configs, for instance) or a few weak spots in its performance profile shake out as the PC community probes its capabilities. AMD is but a small company and it probably doesn’t have the manpower to completely finesse this new architecture first time around. Of course, if that’s correct the upside is that scope remains for future revisions to turn a good chip into a great one. Anyway, this is an initial hands-on, not an entirely definitive and forensic investigation. I’ll have a look at the platform / motherboard part of the Ryzen story in a future post – PCI Express connectivity with Ryzen chips is an emerging concern, for instance. Overall, Ryzen is impressive even if the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers. But if I was buying a CPU right now, it would still be the base model eight-core Ryzen. It’s not perfect and for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs. But it’s a really nice all-rounder for the money.

Fast enough single-threaded, big boost multi-threaded. And the timing’s about right for all of us on a Sandy or Ivy Bridge Core i5 (or below) to upgrade. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 16:25 blur says: Yuuuup. My 2500k is finally showing its age these days. Any CPU upgrade would necessitate motherboard and RAM as well, so the next batch of Ryzen releases definitely look like they might hit the super sweet spot. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:40 Gnoupi says: I’m actually a bit surprised to read that. The consensus on all other reviews I read is that it’s not ideal for gaming, performance wise, compared to the concurrency. And that it only passes them in “ideal” multithreaded conditions (video processing/rendering). Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:46 dangermouse76 says: My reading seems to suggest. That 1440p evens out the FPS comparisons as they push the work to the GPU. But when looking at 1080p gaming with these chips the i7 seems to have a larger margin over Ryzen. Edit: As this article seems to bare out. So yeah these chips dont blow me away for gaming. That may not be their purpose, but still. So yeah very interested to see what the Ryzen i5 competition will look like. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:16 dangermouse76 says: Also this is brand new from scratch work from AMD so optimisations from devs and AMD may help bring that gap down. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:56 Sakkura says: I wouldn’t count on big improvements, but at least the situations where SMT hurts performance should be going away. Maybe a few percent on top of that, here and there.

Where games are CPU limited, the gap is a lot more obvious. Plus there are one or two anomalies, to boot. I think you’ve probably absorbed my generally upbeat tone but ignored the detail of what I wrote.

The way language can glitch like this, causing tiny ambiguities, is really fun for me to dissect! PS almost certainly you meant “after 10pm”, and I would caution you that ’22’ is not an intuitive way for native speakers to write time. 2200, 22:00 and 10pm all read correctly :) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 11:13 Harlander says: Yeah, after 22 you should be getting ready for the Carousel. Renew! Renew! Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:31 carewolf says: Very few games push the CPU and the few that do are multithreaded. What other reviews do to make Intel look better is take something that is close to pushing the CPU but is single-threaded because it usually doesn’t matter, run it in a low resolution like 1080p and then pretend FPS over 100 matters. Then a Kaby Lake is faster than Ryzen, because it does indeed have better single threaded performance. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:29 Unclepauly says: There is much more than “a very few” games that push the cpu. When you go online multiplayer the burden on the CPU increases alot for a large percentage of games. The problem here is that online multiplayer is almost impossible to benchmark consistently. Games with a huge amount of players just compounds the issue. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:18 randomclass says: Also games like Paradox’s grand strategy games, from CK2 to HoI4. They all seem to be laggy in late game, in SP or MP, and it’s all down to CPU, not GPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:54 ravenshrike says: The issue is that the reviews are all over the place with a few more or less matching the 7700k even at 1080p, with others horribly bombing. Most of that is teething issues from the new architecture(Although the on-die memory controller throughput is a bit weak. That needs to be improved by at least 50%, preferably doubled in the next refresh). In three to six months the performance numbers will almost certainly look much better as BIOSes, opcode, and MS drivers are improved, with even some games getting patched to work with Ryzen’s quirks. You’ve got to remember that the Haswell and Broadwell and Lake chips are all very mature at this point with more similarities than differences between them. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:41 kud13 says: A few years back I picked up an AMD FX 4350- also an 8-core 4.0 Ghz base for something ridiculous like 250CAD (this was right before the dollar spiked up). The reason for AMD was I had an AMD-based mobo and I was upgrading piecemeal. Gotta say, I haven’t had any problems with any “modern” games on it since (GPU was a bottleneck for a while, but now I’m running Nvidia 1070). However, Age of Empires 2 HD (that does not support multi-threading, period) DOES make it huff and puff (as opposed to, say, Witcher 3). So I guess we still gotta wait for AMD to come up with powerful single-thread chips. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:52 Sakkura says: 8 cores? Then you mean FX-8350, the FX-4350 is 4 cores. While Ryzen is still not quite on par with Intel in single-threaded performance, it’s very close. And a HUGE upgrade over their old FX chips. We’re talking 60-80% faster. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:49 BadManiac says: I ordered my 1700X today, been waiting for this too long. I’m still gaming on my old Phenom 2 X4, and while running at a respectable 4Ghz, it’s really starting to show it’s age in some games. So for me the jump from 4 cores and 4 threads to 8 cores and 16 threads at hopefully near the same clock speed should be an enormous leap, and I won’t be completely CPU limiting my GTX 1070 any more. :D Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:32 AngoraFish says: My Phenom 2 x4 955 is still running strong and I’ve not noticed any significant CPU bottleneck on anything I play. I’ve upgraded the graphics card a couple of times since I got it, but there’s still no incentive at all for me to splash cash on a new CPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:34 Unclepauly says: The fact is that you are just used to it so don’t notice it. That CPU is has problems in a huge amount of games.

I played every single game on it, no problem. But last year I decided to buy an i5 6600. Got a new mobo, new RAM, the new CPU and a new case. Only then I noticed how obsolete the Phenom II was. I got almost double the framerate on most games. I mean, the good old Phenom II served its purpose. It allowed me to play any game I wanted. It also didn’t do that so well. And there was also a bonus. It worked as a very nice space heater! Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 23:05 Don Reba says: My main requirement from a CPU is maximum AVX2 performance, in which Ryzen lags behind Intel literally by a factor of 2, so my main hope is that competition will force Intel to add more cores and drop prices. It could be argued that I would be better served by a GPU, but, well, it’s a whole other can of worms, and I don’t want the hassle.

But I do more than just playing nothing but games on my desktop, and having 8 physical cores would be a great convenience for the VMs and the sometimes video encodes that I do. Consider me pleasantly impressed. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:07 ScubaMonster says: I’ve seen some articles about the performance comparison, but not any that factor in price at the same time. I get that it’s the cold hard numbers that matter most and these chips are going up against Intel’s offerings. But if a Ryzen chip lags a bit behind its Intel counterpart but is substantially cheaper I would consider that a win. Sure, you could pony up extra bucks if you absolutely must have the best of the best, but if you can get performance close to it for a lot cheaper, that would be a no brainer to me. I don’t know all the pricing to make a comparison myself though. I haven’t really looked at the Ryzen prices compared to their Intel equivalents. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 01:37 haldolium says: Check the chart on the bottom of the site here, it gives an impression where Ryzen stands in terms of pricing to performance: link to computerbase.de Good thing AMD catches up, but by now I am more interested in GPGPU in general since GPU based rendering has taken HUGE steps in the time AMD was figuring out the Zen and for playing games, the CPU is so seldom an issue that I couldn’t care less for the high-end market. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:49 Unclepauly says: It really does depend on the types of games a person plays though. Certain genres of games have a greater need for CPU performance while many do not. Plenty of outliers as well. Take ARMA 3 for example, Sandy bridge systems net about 30-35 fps while Kaby Lake(with very fast ram) is netting roughly 55-60 fps. Cherry picked game of course but there are others out there less documented that benefit as well. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:45 Rack says: Sadly the current scenario does Ryzen few favours. A 1700 compares poorly with an i5 7600k at £100 more. Right at the bottom of the pile the 1100 might be a reasonable budget option but all in all Ryzen looks to be a good option for 3d modelling, less so for games. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:16 ButteringSundays says: I haven’t noticed my 5 y/o i5 acting as a bottleneck anywhere I’ve noticed (the 760 is showing its age though… sometimes). Hardware fetishists are strange beasts – the money they’ll spend for an updated forum signature. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:14 Lord Zeon says: The CPU hasn’t been a bottleneck for gaming for almost a decade now. I still use a first gen Bulldozer CPU, the FX-8120, and I’ve never seen a AAA title get caught up on it with my GTX 970. Imagine that – the first of the “awful” AMD architectures that Ryzen is replacing still is entirely relevant in the enthusiast gaming space. I genuinely think that Intel’s marketing has permeated the enthusiast community to the point where everyone has lost the their reference point as to what a CPU needs to do for gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 14:03 Sakkura says: If you’re not seeing the FX-8120 limit performance, then you’re simply not looking. It definitely does. That doesn’t mean everything is unplayable on it, but it really doesn’t qualify for enthusiast gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 15:18 tehfish says: As an FX-8120 owner also, it does bottleneck the GPU in recent games, but it does depend on what GPU you have. You may just be very lucky with a well-matched GPU to go with the CPU there. For an example, with fallout4, an overclocked FX-8120 (4.2ghz, no turbo) and a R9 390: It’s perfectly playable often running happily at 1080p 60fps, then you can hit certain areas where it drops to ~20-30fps with the GPU core down to ~450mhz out of it’s maximum 1060mhz – a clear case of a CPU bottleneck. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 00:18 Etherion says: I also have a quite dated i5 760 cpu, but didn’t feel it as a bottleneck until just recently (current gpu is gtx 770 overclocked) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:45 bfar says: Way back in January last year, I had a long discussion with my peers on a UK forum over 6700k vs 5820k, as they were roughly the same price at the time. I argued that for gaming, the higher clocked 4 core CPU would be the better bet for at least a year or two. We agreed that for all other applications, the lower clocked 6 core chip was the way to go. It seems that a year later, nothing has changed, and it frames the perception of Rysen from an enthusiast perspective. It’s still a major coup for consumers though, because as Jeremy rightly points out, most of Intels chips look like poor value for money all of a sudden. Prices will fall across the board.

I’ve been running a 7 year old used i7 2600k oc’ed since 2012. To maintain 60fps minimum, the only part that I’ve had to upgrade was always the video card. Starting out on a GTX 460, then SLI 560TI to a GTX 780/970(RMA replace) and now a GTX 1070. Until my games consistently dip below 50fps on max settings with my current or newer video card, I have no real reason to upgrade yet. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 16:57 syllopsium says: Have to admit I was wrong with this – I expected the single threaded performance would suck. Whilst it doesn’t match a 7700K, it’s a great alternative to Intel’s enthusiast class CPUs at a much lower price, and being AMD hopefully supports ECC RAM too. The problem is, I’m not convinced the enthusiast market is large enough. If you’re using virtualisation, rendering, or transcoding video it’s a huge win, but for general productivity and games this isn’t on the radar and probably never will be. Neither are any of Intel’s chips with more than four cores. They also haven’t talked up any virtualisation support, other than encrypted memory.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BUSINESS Guest Can AMD’s Ryzen deflate Intel? Jack Gold, J.Gold Associates@jckgld March 2, 2017 5:40 PM Above: AMD's new Ryzen processor brand. Image Credit: AMD AMD today released its highly anticipated Ryzen desktop processors aimed squarely at high performance computing needs — as well as at Intel. Its Ryzen 7 devices will go head to head with Intel’s Core i7, and its newly announced Ryzen 5 will go head to head with Intel’s Core i5. AMD has been behind almost across the board in processor design over the past few years. Can Ryzen really propel it back into a viable competitive position with Intel? AMD has had a difficult struggle over the past several years as it tried to find its footing in a highly competitive market. Its PC oriented CPUs fell short as competitive products to Intel’s, and it was essentially forced to become the discount processor company for lower end products. Its GPUs also suffered due to a resurgent Nvidia, who not only extended a lead in graphics but refocused its efforts in multiprocessing extensions targeted at AI and ML (e.g.., in autonomous vehicles, drones, etc.). AMD’s dabbling in ARM, including in ARM-based servers that were supposed to threaten Intel’s dominance in cloud-centric data centers but never really materialized, has not produced any dramatic improvements in AMD’s business. And its recent realization that it needed to play in the AI space has yet to bear any significant fruit. With all this as background, AMD is making a major push with its new Zen architecture based Ryzen CPUs, starting at the higher end desktop space targeting high-performance “junkies” needing the best and fastest performing chips. Mostly driven by the gaming market, these users force their chips to do unnatural acts – pushing them past their limits with overclocking, voltage/power manipulation, and bleeding-edge cooling schemes. While this demographic makes up a relatively small percentage of the overall PC market (10-15 percent at best), it is nonetheless important as it’s highly lucrative compared to the cutthroat competition in consumer mainstream machines. These high performance chips sell in the $500-$1000 range and are a highly visible way for vendors to get “street creed” for their brands. AMD has a need to be seen not only as the “low cost spread” but also as a viable competitor to Intel across the full spectrum of chip requirements. And if early tests of the new Ryzen chips are any indication, the company has done a great job of upping its game. The 8 core, 16 thread devices, although not very svelte in the power department with a draw of 95 watts, have shown impressive benchmarks for gaming and content creation that rivals or exceeds some of Intel’s high end Core i7 products. But is this enough for long-term success? A few hurdles still exist for AMD. First, while its current chips are very capable, getting AMD back into the game, the chip business has always been one of competitors leapfroging each other. Intel will soon release a new generation that will, in all likelihood, improve upon what it (and AMD) currently offer. Further, AMD is still targeting the lower price points. Rather than increase it margins, it believes it can vastly increase its market share by undercutting Intel on price, albeit with what it believes are superior products. But if a price war ensues, Intel can weather the storm better than AMD can. And AMD runs the risk of being seen as the low cost solution rather than the best product. I don’t mean this to be overly negative. AMD has made very significant progress over the past couple of years and under its revitalized management headed by Lisa Su. There is little doubt that its Zen architecture is a breakthrough in reestablishing its competitiveness with Intel and that it will be applying this architecture to more than just high-end gaming systems. I’d expect to see Ryzen derivatives make their way to all corners of the AMD product line in the coming few quarters. And it’s highly likely the new chips will be very well received by the builders and high-end gamers who have been looking for true alternatives to Intel’s dominance. I’d expect to see a significant uptick in AMD’s sales once Ryzen makes its way fully into the channel. But as Ryzen/Zen move into other segments of the PC and server markets, AMD will still need to prove itself a worthy competitor to Intel with products that challenge Intel across their full product breadth – something that may be easier said than done. Bottom Line: With Ryzen, AMD has shown that it isn’t a moribund old-line company that is living on the edges of the PC market. Clearly the new products are something that Intel will take notice of and the market will reward. The question is, can AMD become a full line viable competitor to Intel in the x86 space. I am optimistic it can, as doing so would be good for the entire market, including Intel who will be spurred on by the competition. But we’ll have to wait several quarters to see if it can execute.

Sessions announced Thursday afternoon that he would recuse himself from any current or future probes, amid pressure from lawmakers. The attorney general reportedly spoke twice with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential race, during which he was a senator from Alabama and top supporter of Trump’s campaign. During his confirmation hearing for the attorney general post in January, Sessions said that he never spoke with any Russian officials during the campaign. Sessions has since argued that he met and talked with Kislyak in his capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Schiff dismissed that notion on Thursday, saying the attorney general would have to be “extraordinarily naive or gullible to believe that the Ambassador was seeking him out in his office for a discussion on military matters.” “Sessions is neither,” he said.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Rejoice, for AMD’s new Ryzen CPU is here. And it’s good. Thank science for that. Another dud from AMD didn’t bear thinking about. Instead, we get to ponder just how good Ryzen is and indeed how good it truly needs to be. It isn’t the very fastest CPU money can buy or the greatest gaming CPU ever. But that’s just dandy. It’s still going to blow the PC processor market wide open and force Intel to seriously up its game. If you want the background to AMD’s new chip and a broad overview on what makes it tick, head over here. The task this week is to get a quick feel for what Ryzen is actually like. The chip I’ve played with briefly is the middling model of the launch trio, the Ryzen 7 1700X. Like the other two Ryzen chips AMD is making available at launch, it’s an eight-core beast that crunches two software threads per core. Hexa-core and quad-core models are coming, but aren’t quite ready for launch day. The 1700X clocks in nominally at 3.4GHz with a potential 3.8GHz turbo mode. The ‘X’ suffix, incidentally means it sports AMD’s new XFR auto-overclocking feature, a bit more on which in a moment. For the record the other two chips are the 3.0GHz/3.7GHz 1700 and the 3.6GHz/4GHz 1800X. Pricing for the 1700X is £399. The 1800X rocks in around £499 and the 1700 is yours for £329. Stick a $ sign in front of those numbers and you have the US price, which is both impressive and depressing depending on your point of view. Without further ado, then, let’s get busy. I couldn’t resist firing up the fairly pointless Cinebench synthetic benchmark first, just to see those 16 threads in action. Fly my pretties: Not that it matters much for the real world, but this thing flies in a multi-threaded benchmark like Cinebench. To give you a feel for just how quick it is, it’s nearly two and a half times faster than the incumbent gamer’s choice, the Intel Core i5-7600K. Yowsers. Of course, multi-threading is only half – or should that be 15/16ths – of the story. AMD’s big failure with its previous FX processors was single-threaded performance and it just so happens that games are particularly sensitive to just that. In Cinebench’s single-threaded mode, the Ryzen 7 1700X is between 10 and 20 per cent slower than various gaming-relevant Intel CPUs, with about 10% of that due to a slight comparative deficiency in Ryzen’s architecture and the other 10% thanks to clockspeed. Indeed, it was rumoured prior to launch that clock-for-clock and core-for-core, Ryzen would be roughly a match for Intel’s Haswell-generation chips – the Core iSomething 4000 series chips, in other words. And so it proves in Cinebench. Anyway, I mucked around with a few other canned benchmarks, all of which delivered similar kinds of results. Ryzen monsters quad-core Intel chips in multi-threading. In fact, it’s on about a par with Intel’s own eight-core beast, the 6900K for multithreading. Lest you have forgotten, that’s more or less a £1,000 chip. But what, you cry, of games? Don’t panic, the news here is decent, too, if somewhat preliminary and indeed patchy. You can read detailed benchmarks elsewhere, but to give you one example, in Total War: Attila using the same video card and settings, the Ryzen 1700X cranks out an average of 39 frames per second to 40 from a Core i5-7600K. I got similar results in several other titles. The first caveat to that is that I was running everything at 1440p and high detail settings, which tends to push things towards being GPU limited, even on an Nvidia GTX 1080. The handful of games I ran may also have somewhat flattered Ryzen. Among others, Tech Report’s gaming numbers show that Ryzen can be a fair old bit off the current Intel pace in some games. Part of that is clockspeed, part of it is architecture and part is probably optimisation. You can be sure that few if any games exist that have been compiled to run well on Ryzen. Really broadly, then, Ryzen looks like a goer for games but it will occasionally lag the best Intel chips in certain games, sometimes because the game doesn’t scale well across lots of cores and on occasion probably because it’s poorly optimised for Ryzen’s processing peccadilloes. In that sense, these early eight-core chips are somewhat suboptimal for games with the possible exception of multi-tasking. If you want to game and stream your exploits at the same time, for instance, Ryzen looks like a killer solution. But a high clocked six-core Ryzen of the near future might be the best AMD bet for gamers. If there is a disappointment, it’s overclocking. All Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked for easy overclocking. But to cut a long story short, they don’t overclock. Well, barely. I squeezed an extra 100MHz out of my chip and that was with water cooling. M’colleagues elsewhere in the reviewersphere report similar findings. Oh, and the XFR auto-overclocking feature doesn’t improve on that. It may be of interest in future when Ryzen chips with more headroom appear. For now, it’s fairly redundant. That said, the 1700X I tested tended to max out at only 3.5GHz in multi-threaded workloads when running at standard rather than overclocked settings rather than the 3.8GHz promised by the chip’s turbo mode. So, that 100MHz overclock was actually more like 400MHz in practice. But I’m not sure I actually care. My feeling coming in was that if Ryzen really was roughly on a par with Haswell and ran at about 3.5GHz, that would be plenty to put the frighteners on Intel. It does just that, so frankly I for one am satisfied. Incidentally, if you’re wondering about operating temps, have a scan of the web. I was only able to run my test chip with water cooling, so the 41 degrees C idle and 51 degrees under load aren’t hugely helpful for the bulk of us that run fairly standard air coolers. What we have then is a chip that isn’t far off Intel for gaming and absolutely obliterates it for multi-threading performance when you factor in pricing. Regards the latter, this chip is literally half the price of Intel’s eight-core 6900K. Staggering. Of course, it’s still bloody expensive at £399. Moreover, you’re never actually going to feel the difference versus the plain old £329 Ryzen 7 1700. So of the initial launch chips, the 1700 is the obvious choice. It’s an awesome all-rounder for the money. However, I still think the sweet spot for most RPSers will likely be the future six-core model. It’ll crank out the same gaming performance (well, in most games) as the eight-core model, just for less money, along with both pretty snazzy multi-threading for content creation and some multi-threading headroom to come as games gradually scale better across multiple cores. Where all this leaves Intel is of course an interesting question. My sense in recent years is that readers have tired of the press bashing Intel for sandbagging, but for my money Ryzen completely confirms that narrative. It makes Intel’s product line up look cynical and overpriced. Personally, I can’t see Intel slashing prices anything like enough to offset the yawning gap between it’s six and eight-core CPUs and Ryzen. In reality, it doesn’t matter much to Intel. Desktop CPUs aren’t all that important and in any case, the likes of Dell will keep cranking out systems for mainstream punters and nobody will care much or notice much. What Intel may do is hurry up the mainstream six-core model for the LGA1151 socket that appeared on its roadmaps recently. Suitably clocked and priced, that would put Intel in a reasonable if still not ideal competitive position. In the meantime, I think enthusiasts will make something of a stampede towards Ryzen. It’s just such a compelling value proposition, even if it remains somewhat unproven. It wouldn’t surprise me to find a few bugs emerging (I hear it’s a bit pernickety when it comes to certain memory configs, for instance) or a few weak spots in its performance profile shake out as the PC community probes its capabilities. AMD is but a small company and it probably doesn’t have the manpower to completely finesse this new architecture first time around. Of course, if that’s correct the upside is that scope remains for future revisions to turn a good chip into a great one. Anyway, this is an initial hands-on, not an entirely definitive and forensic investigation. I’ll have a look at the platform / motherboard part of the Ryzen story in a future post – PCI Express connectivity with Ryzen chips is an emerging concern, for instance. Overall, Ryzen is impressive even if the harsh reality is that the one group of PC users for whom Ryzen is probably least immediately compelling are gamers. But if I was buying a CPU right now, it would still be the base model eight-core Ryzen. It’s not perfect and for pure gaming Intel still makes the best CPUs. But it’s a really nice all-rounder for the money.

Fast enough single-threaded, big boost multi-threaded. And the timing’s about right for all of us on a Sandy or Ivy Bridge Core i5 (or below) to upgrade.

Any CPU upgrade would necessitate motherboard and RAM as well, so the next batch of Ryzen releases definitely look like they might hit the super sweet spot. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:40 Gnoupi says: I’m actually a bit surprised to read that. The consensus on all other reviews I read is that it’s not ideal for gaming, performance wise, compared to the concurrency. And that it only passes them in “ideal” multithreaded conditions (video processing/rendering). Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:46 dangermouse76 says: My reading seems to suggest. That 1440p evens out the FPS comparisons as they push the work to the GPU. But when looking at 1080p gaming with these chips the i7 seems to have a larger margin over Ryzen. Edit: As this article seems to bare out. So yeah these chips dont blow me away for gaming. That may not be their purpose, but still. So yeah very interested to see what the Ryzen i5 competition will look like. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:16 dangermouse76 says: Also this is brand new from scratch work from AMD so optimisations from devs and AMD may help bring that gap down. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:56 Sakkura says: I wouldn’t count on big improvements, but at least the situations where SMT hurts performance should be going away. Maybe a few percent on top of that, here and there.

Where games are CPU limited, the gap is a lot more obvious. Plus there are one or two anomalies, to boot. I think you’ve probably absorbed my generally upbeat tone but ignored the detail of what I wrote.

The way language can glitch like this, causing tiny ambiguities, is really fun for me to dissect! PS almost certainly you meant “after 10pm”, and I would caution you that ’22’ is not an intuitive way for native speakers to write time. 2200, 22:00 and 10pm all read correctly :) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 11:13 Harlander says: Yeah, after 22 you should be getting ready for the Carousel. Renew! Renew! Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:31 carewolf says: Very few games push the CPU and the few that do are multithreaded. What other reviews do to make Intel look better is take something that is close to pushing the CPU but is single-threaded because it usually doesn’t matter, run it in a low resolution like 1080p and then pretend FPS over 100 matters. Then a Kaby Lake is faster than Ryzen, because it does indeed have better single threaded performance. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:29 Unclepauly says: There is much more than “a very few” games that push the cpu. When you go online multiplayer the burden on the CPU increases alot for a large percentage of games. The problem here is that online multiplayer is almost impossible to benchmark consistently. Games with a huge amount of players just compounds the issue. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:18 randomclass says: Also games like Paradox’s grand strategy games, from CK2 to HoI4. They all seem to be laggy in late game, in SP or MP, and it’s all down to CPU, not GPU. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:54 ravenshrike says: The issue is that the reviews are all over the place with a few more or less matching the 7700k even at 1080p, with others horribly bombing. Most of that is teething issues from the new architecture(Although the on-die memory controller throughput is a bit weak. That needs to be improved by at least 50%, preferably doubled in the next refresh). In three to six months the performance numbers will almost certainly look much better as BIOSes, opcode, and MS drivers are improved, with even some games getting patched to work with Ryzen’s quirks. You’ve got to remember that the Haswell and Broadwell and Lake chips are all very mature at this point with more similarities than differences between them.

The reason for AMD was I had an AMD-based mobo and I was upgrading piecemeal. Gotta say, I haven’t had any problems with any “modern” games on it since (GPU was a bottleneck for a while, but now I’m running Nvidia 1070). However, Age of Empires 2 HD (that does not support multi-threading, period) DOES make it huff and puff (as opposed to, say, Witcher 3). So I guess we still gotta wait for AMD to come up with powerful single-thread chips. Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 21:52 Sakkura says: 8 cores? Then you mean FX-8350, the FX-4350 is 4 cores. While Ryzen is still not quite on par with Intel in single-threaded performance, it’s very close. And a HUGE upgrade over their old FX chips. We’re talking 60-80% faster.

I’m still gaming on my old Phenom 2 X4, and while running at a respectable 4Ghz, it’s really starting to show it’s age in some games. So for me the jump from 4 cores and 4 threads to 8 cores and 16 threads at hopefully near the same clock speed should be an enormous leap, and I won’t be completely CPU limiting my GTX 1070 any more. :D Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 22:32 AngoraFish says: My Phenom 2 x4 955 is still running strong and I’ve not noticed any significant CPU bottleneck on anything I play.

I played every single game on it, no problem. But last year I decided to buy an i5 6600. Got a new mobo, new RAM, the new CPU and a new case. Only then I noticed how obsolete the Phenom II was. I got almost double the framerate on most games. I mean, the good old Phenom II served its purpose. It allowed me to play any game I wanted. It also didn’t do that so well. And there was also a bonus. It worked as a very nice space heater! Log in to Reply 02/03/2017 at 23:05 Don Reba says: My main requirement from a CPU is maximum AVX2 performance, in which Ryzen lags behind Intel literally by a factor of 2, so my main hope is that competition will force Intel to add more cores and drop prices. It could be argued that I would be better served by a GPU, but, well, it’s a whole other can of worms, and I don’t want the hassle.

But I do more than just playing nothing but games on my desktop, and having 8 physical cores would be a great convenience for the VMs and the sometimes video encodes that I do. Consider me pleasantly impressed. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 00:07 ScubaMonster says: I’ve seen some articles about the performance comparison, but not any that factor in price at the same time. I get that it’s the cold hard numbers that matter most and these chips are going up against Intel’s offerings. But if a Ryzen chip lags a bit behind its Intel counterpart but is substantially cheaper I would consider that a win. Sure, you could pony up extra bucks if you absolutely must have the best of the best, but if you can get performance close to it for a lot cheaper, that would be a no brainer to me. I don’t know all the pricing to make a comparison myself though. I haven’t really looked at the Ryzen prices compared to their Intel equivalents. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 01:37 haldolium says: Check the chart on the bottom of the site here, it gives an impression where Ryzen stands in terms of pricing to performance: link to computerbase.de Good thing AMD catches up, but by now I am more interested in GPGPU in general since GPU based rendering has taken HUGE steps in the time AMD was figuring out the Zen and for playing games, the CPU is so seldom an issue that I couldn’t care less for the high-end market. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 06:49 Unclepauly says: It really does depend on the types of games a person plays though. Certain genres of games have a greater need for CPU performance while many do not. Plenty of outliers as well. Take ARMA 3 for example, Sandy bridge systems net about 30-35 fps while Kaby Lake(with very fast ram) is netting roughly 55-60 fps. Cherry picked game of course but there are others out there less documented that benefit as well. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 08:45 Rack says: Sadly the current scenario does Ryzen few favours. A 1700 compares poorly with an i5 7600k at £100 more. Right at the bottom of the pile the 1100 might be a reasonable budget option but all in all Ryzen looks to be a good option for 3d modelling, less so for games. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:16 ButteringSundays says: I haven’t noticed my 5 y/o i5 acting as a bottleneck anywhere I’ve noticed (the 760 is showing its age though… sometimes). Hardware fetishists are strange beasts – the money they’ll spend for an updated forum signature. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 13:14 Lord Zeon says: The CPU hasn’t been a bottleneck for gaming for almost a decade now. I still use a first gen Bulldozer CPU, the FX-8120, and I’ve never seen a AAA title get caught up on it with my GTX 970. Imagine that – the first of the “awful” AMD architectures that Ryzen is replacing still is entirely relevant in the enthusiast gaming space. I genuinely think that Intel’s marketing has permeated the enthusiast community to the point where everyone has lost the their reference point as to what a CPU needs to do for gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 14:03 Sakkura says: If you’re not seeing the FX-8120 limit performance, then you’re simply not looking. It definitely does. That doesn’t mean everything is unplayable on it, but it really doesn’t qualify for enthusiast gaming. Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 15:18 tehfish says: As an FX-8120 owner also, it does bottleneck the GPU in recent games, but it does depend on what GPU you have. You may just be very lucky with a well-matched GPU to go with the CPU there. For an example, with fallout4, an overclocked FX-8120 (4.2ghz, no turbo) and a R9 390: It’s perfectly playable often running happily at 1080p 60fps, then you can hit certain areas where it drops to ~20-30fps with the GPU core down to ~450mhz out of it’s maximum 1060mhz – a clear case of a CPU bottleneck. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 00:18 Etherion says: I also have a quite dated i5 760 cpu, but didn’t feel it as a bottleneck until just recently (current gpu is gtx 770 overclocked) Log in to Reply 03/03/2017 at 10:45 bfar says: Way back in January last year, I had a long discussion with my peers on a UK forum over 6700k vs 5820k, as they were roughly the same price at the time. I argued that for gaming, the higher clocked 4 core CPU would be the better bet for at least a year or two. We agreed that for all other applications, the lower clocked 6 core chip was the way to go. It seems that a year later, nothing has changed, and it frames the perception of Rysen from an enthusiast perspective. It’s still a major coup for consumers though, because as Jeremy rightly points out, most of Intels chips look like poor value for money all of a sudden. Prices will fall across the board.

I’ve been running a 7 year old used i7 2600k oc’ed since 2012. To maintain 60fps minimum, the only part that I’ve had to upgrade was always the video card. Starting out on a GTX 460, then SLI 560TI to a GTX 780/970(RMA replace) and now a GTX 1070. Until my games consistently dip below 50fps on max settings with my current or newer video card, I have no real reason to upgrade yet. Log in to Reply 05/03/2017 at 16:57 syllopsium says: Have to admit I was wrong with this – I expected the single threaded performance would suck. Whilst it doesn’t match a 7700K, it’s a great alternative to Intel’s enthusiast class CPUs at a much lower price, and being AMD hopefully supports ECC RAM too. The problem is, I’m not convinced the enthusiast market is large enough. If you’re using virtualisation, rendering, or transcoding video it’s a huge win, but for general productivity and games this isn’t on the radar and probably never will be. Neither are any of Intel’s chips with more than four cores. They also haven’t talked up any virtualisation support, other than encrypted memory. They could do much more in this area if they wanted to. Roll on four fast core versions of Ryzen.. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Justin Mitchell reports. March 2nd 2017 5 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/ US President Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress in Washington, DC. Picture: Jim Lo Scalzo/AFP Photo news.com.au Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend DONALD Trump is being praised for his uncharacteristically positive maiden speech to congress. The US President’s address before the joint session of US politicians in Washington was, well, more presidential than anyone was expecting. But while yesterday’s appearance hinted the new leader was growing into his role, President Trump may have also set himself up for disaster. Disguised by moderate language and a calm delivery, Trump’s over-the-top promises and sensational ideas were still there. He made some big calls, just in a less blusterous tone than usual. These are the big promises Trump made in the speech that’s been labelled his most restrained yet. SAVE JOBS Mr Trump promised he was going to “bring back millions of jobs” to the US and claimed he had already started. “Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart and many others have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs,” he said. But analysis by Associated Press indicates Mr Trump may have jumped the gun taking credit for those positions. The corporate job decision that Mr Trump is referring to largely predates his election. In the case of Intel, construction of the Chandler, Arizona, factory referred to by Trump actually began during Barack Obama’s presidency, AP reported. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel’s high- powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Mr Trump also mentioned that he had withdrawn the US from the “job-killing” Trans-Pacific Partnership, although this was met with less enthusiastic applause. LIFT WAGES AND LOWER TAXES The President also said protecting workers meant reforming the system of legal immigration. This leads to his next job-related promise — to lift wages for the nation’s poorest citizens. “It will save countless dollars, raise workers’ wages, and help struggling families, including immigrant families, enter the middle class, and they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy indeed. “I believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade. It’s been a long time since we had fair trade,” he said. “The current outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on taxpayers.” The president also said he would “provide massive tax relief for the middle class”, but is yet to explain how he plans to do this. US President Donald Trump’s address sounded measured, but his promises were sensational. Picture: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images/AFPSource:AFP SPEND SPED SPEND Mr Trump bagged the previous administration for its spending in the Middle East, which he reckons would have been better invested on local infrastructure. He said America had spent about $6 trillion in the Middle East, while the country’s own infrastructure crumbled. “With $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice,” he said. So despite slamming the spending of his predecessors, the President pledged to come up with $1 trillion for new infrastructure. “I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States financed through both public and private capital, creating millions of new jobs.” He said this effort would be guided by two core principles “buy American and hire American”. STOP DRUGS Mr Trump pledged to dismantle criminal cartels and “stop drugs from pouring into our country”. The President said he had directed the Department of Justice to form a taskforce of reducing violent crime. “I have further ordered to co-ordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels,” he said. “We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.” Mr Trump said construction would start soon on his campaign promise to build a wall between the US and Mexico, and it would be an “effective weapon against drugs and crime”. He says his administration is removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals from the United States. Trump said “bad ones” were going out as he spoke. The address received an unexpectedly positive response. Picture: Mike Theiler/AFP PhotoSource:AFP DESTROY ISIS Mr Trump will be left red-faced if he doesn’t destroy Islamic State while he’s president, and sooner rather than later. “As promised, I directed the Department of Defence to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS, a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men and women and children, of all faiths and all beliefs,” he said. “We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet. “I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran’s ballistic missile program and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel.” FIX HEALTH CARE Mr Trump spent a significant chunk of his campaign time and material rubbishing the previous president’s health care package Obamacare, setting a challenge for himself to better it. Mr Trump called on members of Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare. “We should help Americans to purchase their own coverage through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts, but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our government,” he said. He said legal reforms should be implemented to protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs. “The time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines,” he said. But time will tell if President Trump will be able to deliver.

Adam SchiffAdam SchiffJuan Williams: Time for a special prosecutor House intel chief: Russia probe will include potential surveillance of campaigns Schiff: Not even Spicer wants to speak about Trump's wiretapping claim MORE (Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, slammed President Trump on Saturday over his allegation that former President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower before the election. "If there is something bad or sick going on, it is the willingness of the nation's chief executive to make the most outlandish and destructive claims without providing a scintilla of evidence to support them,” Schiff said in a statement on Saturday. Trump took to Twitter early Saturday morning to accuse his predecessor of ordering the wiretaps, but did not provide any evidence to support the claim. ADVERTISEMENT “Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!” Trump wrote. “Is it legal for a sitting President to be ‘wire tapping’ a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!” he added in another tweet. “I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!” A spokesman for Obama issued a statement denying that Obama's White House ordered such surveillance.  "A cardinal rule of the Obama Administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice," said spokesman Kevin Lewis. "As part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen," Lewis added. "Any suggestion otherwise is simply false." Democratic lawmakers slammed Trump over the tweets, with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) arguing that Trump was attempting to distract from his own scrutiny. Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) said if Trump Tower had been bugged, then it would mean Trump is in trouble. “Mr. President: If there was a wiretap at Trump Tower, that means a fed judge found probable cause of crime which means you are in deep sh--,” Lieu wrote in response to Trump. Schiff said Trump’s recent tweets show he will never be a man who understands the Constitution or regards the truth. “No matter how much we hope and pray that this President will grow into one who respects and understands the Constitution, separation of powers, role of a free press, responsibilities as the leader of the free world, or demonstrates even the most basic regard for the truth, we must now accept that President Trump will never become that man," he said.

Subscribe TRENDING: MWC 2017 RYZEN AMD Asus Tinker Board Vega Dell XPS 27 GeForce GTX 1080 Ti home Leisure Gaming by Paul Lilly — Friday, March 03, 2017 AMD CEO Says Ryzen Gaming Performance Will Improve With Future Patches And Developer Support Independent testing of Ryzen (including our own in-depth benchmarking and analysis) confirms what AMD has promising all along, that its fancy new CPU architecture is the real deal and it is able to compete with Intel at the high end. The only caveat is that Ryzen's gaming performance is not where many thought it would be, especially considering the architecture's excellent IPC efficiency and performance in other areas, such as Cinebench and POV-Ray. What gives? The short answer is, this is a temporary thing until developers get rolling with optimizations. During an "Ask Me Anything" (AMA) session at Reddit, AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su was asked point blank if gaming performance was something the chip designer will work towards going forward with Ryzen. Her reply was an emphatic, "Absolutely!," adding that gamers "should expect gaming performance to only get better with time as the developers have more time with 'Zen." If there is skepticism over AMD's explanation, it's understandable, but we're not so quick to dismiss it as lip service. Just the opposite, there is every reason to believe that AMD is shooting it straight and that gaming performance will in fact improve over time. For one, AMD has been saying all along that Ryzen is a high-performance architecture with a substantial gain in IPC versus Bulldozer, and that turned out to be true. But secondly, the notion that optimizations will make a significant difference is more than plausible. For the past several years, AMD has been an afterthought in the enthusiast market, and has instead focused on the budget sector. It makes sense that game developers optimized their games to run on Intel hardware while for the most part ignoring AMD's slower technology. That is basically the bush AMD is beating around, but with Ryzen closing the gap, developers have reason to optimize for AMD hardware. To that end, AMD is working closely with game developers and a few have shared their current view of Ryzen optimizations with us, in our recent deep dive review...  Creative Assembly's Total War: Warhammer "Creative Assembly is committed to reviewing and optimizing its games on the all-new Ryzen CPU. While current third-party testing doesn’t reflect this yet, our joint optimization program with AMD means that we are looking at options to deliver performance optimization updates in the future to provide better performance on Ryzen CPUs moving forward," said Creative Assembly, developers of the Total War series” It's not just one developer, either... "Oxide games is incredibly excited with what we are seeing from the Ryzen CPU. Using our Nitrous game engine, we are working to scale our existing and future game title performance to take full advantage of Ryzen and its 8-core, 16-thread architecture, and the results thus far are impressive. These optimizations are not yet available for Ryzen benchmarking. However, expect updates soon to enhance the performance of games like Ashes of the Singularity on Ryzen CPUs, as well as our future game releases,” said Brad Wardell, CEO Stardock and Oxide” In other words, game developers are publicly backing AMD's explanation, putting their own credibility on the line when they really don't have a dog in the fight. According to Dr. Su, over 300 developers are now working on optimizations for Ryzen. In the short-term, Dr. Su says she fully expects to see gains in 1080p performance on Ryzen. And looking a little further down the road, this is something that will continue in future iterations of the zen architecture, which Dr. Su refers to as Zen2 and Zen3.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The start of a new administration is never a clean slate, even when parties flip. Day One is just another day for military operations, a budget that is still in place from the old crowd and a vast array of economic, social and law enforcement initiatives left over by the last president. You would not know this from President Donald Trump. He loudly and proudly takes credit for any positive development that has bloomed since he took office Jan. 20, even when the roots and buds of it were from President Barack Obama's time. In his speech to Congress and other remarks in recent days, Trump has claimed credit for: —big savings in an F-35 fighter jet contract that were in motion well before he became president. —corporate job announcements that also had been months or longer in the making. —an infusion of money from NATO partners that has not materialized at all, but reflects a long-standing intent by some members to increase their military capabilities. —a tough-on-criminals approach to immigration enforcement that was planned and put into place during Obama's presidency. —a $12 billion drop in the U.S. debt, a routine blip traced to the regular timing of tax payments and other fiscal factors unconnected to any president. —his plan to restore military supremacy, though he inherited military capabilities that are already second to none. Trump does, though, seek to shift some responsibility to the last administration for an operation he authorized that did not go smoothly — the covert mission in Yemen in which a Navy SEAL and civilians were killed. That mission "was started before I got here," Trump said. It can take months for a new president to pile up achievements or failures that are truly his own. A look at a selection of his statements from the past week: TRUMP: Speaking of the NATO alliance, "Our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice. Very nice." THE FACTS: No new money has come pouring in from NATO allies. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made a strong case when he met with allied defense ministers at a NATO gathering last month, pressing them to meet their 2014 commitment to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024. Mattis and other leaders said the allies understood the message and there was some discussion about working out plans to meet the goal. Only five of the 28 member countries currently meet the 2 percent level, and no new commitments have been made since the NATO meeting. Others in the alliance have routinely said they will work toward the increase. In any event, the commitment is for these nations to spend more on their own military capabilities, which would strengthen the alliance, not to hand over money. ___ TRUMP: "According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America's taxpayers many billions of dollars a year." THE FACTS: That's not exactly what that report says. It says immigrants "contribute to government finances by paying taxes and add expenditures by consuming public services." The report found that while first-generation immigrants are more expensive to governments than their native-born counterparts, primarily at the state and local level, immigrants' children "are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population." This second generation contributed more in taxes on a per capita basis, for example, than did the rest of the population in the period studied, 1994-2013. The report found that the "long-run fiscal impact" of immigrants and their children would probably be seen as more positive "if their role in sustaining labor force growth and contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial activity were taken into account." ___ TRUMP: "We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price" of the F-35 jet fighter. THE FACTS: The cost savings he persists in bragging about were secured in full or in large part before he became president. The head of the Air Force program announced significant price reductions in the contract for the Lockheed F-35 fighter jet Dec. 19 — after Trump had tweeted about the cost but weeks before Trump met the company's CEO about it. Pentagon managers took action even before the election to save money on the contract. Todd Harrison, a defense analyst and aerospace specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, "I don't see any evidence to suggest that President Trump had anything to do with this." ___ TRUMP: "Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Wal-Mart and many others have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs." THE FACTS: Trump is taking credit for corporate jobs decisions that largely predate his election. In the case of Intel, construction of the factory in Chandler, Arizona, that Trump referred to actually began during Obama's presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel's high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Some of the job announcements have come after companies, such as the wireless carrier Sprint, reduced their numbers of workers. More important, even as some companies create jobs, others are laying off workers. The best measure of whether more jobs are actually being created is the monthly employment report issued by the Labor Department, which nets out those gains and losses. The department will issue its report for February, the first full month of Trump's term, on March 10. ___ TRUMP: His budget plan will offer "one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history." THE FACTS: Three times in recent years, Congress raised defense budgets by larger percentages than the $54 billion, or 10 percent, increase that Trump proposes. The base defense budget grew by $41 billion, or 14.3 percent, in 2002; by $37 billion, or 11.3 percent, in 2003, and by $47 billion, or 10.9 percent, in 2008, according to Defense Department figures. And going back farther, his increase doesn't come close to ones in the defense budget seen in the early 1980s, when they hit 20 percent or more, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ___ TRUMP: "Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force." THE FACTS: That's true, but for the vast majority of them, it's because they choose to be. That 94 million figure includes everyone age 16 and older who doesn't have a job and isn't looking for one. It also includes retirees, parents who are staying home to raise children, and high school and college students who are studying rather than working. They are unlikely to work regardless of the state of the economy. With the huge baby boomer generation reaching retirement age and many of them retiring, the population of those out of the labor force is increasing and will continue to do so, economists forecast. It's true that some of those out of the workforce are of working age and have given up looking for work. But that number is probably a small fraction of the 94 million Trump cited. The nation's unemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent, near the lowest in a decade. ___ TRUMP: "Our Navy is now the smallest it's been since, believe or not, World War I. Don't worry. It's going to soon be the largest it's been." THE FACTS: No, the fleet is not growing to the largest it's been, or anything close. The fleet indeed shrank to its smallest size since the decade after World War I — bottoming out at 271 in 2015 before rising to 274 this year, compared with 139 in 1930. But that number alone is not that meaningful. The nature of warfare has changed since the naval battles of the world wars; the rise of air power is just one significant factor. As well, for the past few decades the Navy has dramatically increased the warfighting effectiveness of its ships, meaning it can do more with far fewer vessels than it could during the Cold War, for example. The fleet stood at a record high of 6,768 fighting ships during World War II, declined gradually in the 1950s and 1960s and dropped significantly after the Vietnam War. During the 1990s the number fell from the high 500s to the mid-300s as the Navy decommissioned many older ships and the U.S. reaped a "peace dividend" from the end of the Cold War. The count includes aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, amphibious assault ships and other large combat ships. The fleet may grow more than planned if Trump's military expansion is approved by Congress. But no one is talking about matching — much less exceeding — the enormous armada of another age. The number of Navy personnel has fallen over time, too, from more than 725,000 in 1954 to about 323,000 now. It's unlikely to grow anywhere near that higher level. ___ TRUMP: "According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home — from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center." THE FACTS: It's unclear what Justice Department data he's citing, but the most recent government information doesn't back up his claim. Just over half the people Trump talks about were born in the United States, according to Homeland Security Department research. That report said of 82 people the government determined were inspired by a foreign terrorist group to attempt or carry out an attack in the U.S., just over half were native-born citizens. Even the attacks Trump singled out weren't entirely the work of foreigners. Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his Pakistani wife killed 14 people in the 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, was born in Chicago. It's true that in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, the FBI's primary concern was with terrorists from overseas feared to be plotting attacks in the United States. But that's no longer the case. The FBI and the Justice Department have been preoccupied with violent extremists from inside the U.S. who are inspired by the calls to violence and mayhem of the Islamic State group. The Justice Department has prosecuted scores of IS-related cases since 2014, and many of the defendants are U.S. citizens. ___ TRUMP on military capability: "We are going to have very soon the finest equipment in the world." THE FACTS: Pentagon leaders have said for years that the U.S. already has the world's best weaponry and military equipment. They sometimes claim the U.S. is in danger of losing its advantage unless the Congress continues to spend heavily to develop and build new generations of weapons. The Navy's top officer, Adm. John Richardson, has said repeatedly that the Navy is the world's finest. He also has said the Navy must adapt to a world of changing security threats. Richardson's main focus has been on sharpening and changing the way sailors think about the nature of war, rather than relying on bigger budgets. "We will not be able to 'buy' our way out of the challenges that we face," he wrote in a January 2016 plan for maintaining U.S. naval superiority. ___ Find all AP Fact Checks at http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd ___ Associated Press writers Robert Burns, Alicia A.

Valleyview & Cherryview To Get Atomic Mode-Setting Enabled Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 4 March 2017 at 08:14 AM EST. 4 Comments Intel's set to enable atomic mode-setting by default with code slated to land for the Linux 4.12 kernel. The initial patches for enabling atomic mode-setting by default turned it on for Gen5 (Ironlake) hardware and newer, but left out Valleyview and Cherryview hardware due to problems. But now it looks like for Linux 4.12 the Cherryview/Valleyview problems could be addressed and see those mobile platforms go atomic too. These patches published Friday by Ville Syrjälä fix the VLV/CHV hardware's watermark issue and goes ahead to enable the atomic support by default. See the aforelinked article for more details on the atomic mode-setting impact. To test Intel's atomic support right now on a Linux 4.9+ kernel, boot the kernel with i915.nuclear_pageflip=1 to enjoy it until the default change-over is made, most likely for Linux 4.12 unless something goes awry. 4 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

If that's the case, you likely have a gaming PC already, but with the relatively recent release of Intel's Kaby Lake processors and the forthcoming Ryzen CPUs from AMD, a lot of folks are looking at upgrading. As we saw recently in our Core i7-7700K review and Colton's upgrade experience, you might have a lot to gain from finally ditching your trusty old Sandy Bridge or Nehalem machine. Still, there ain't a one of us that's getting any younger. It's 2017, and your ATX full tower that you've customized with a hand-cut glass window, RGB lightstrips, and two separate water-cooling reservoirs still runs great and is cooler than ever. Problem is, it definitely has an insufficient Spouse Approval Factor, especially in the living room. Those of you fortunate enough to have a dedicated den or man-cave can get away with it. For the rest of us, maybe it's time to go smaller, and more subtle. Maybe one of those mini-PCs we've been hearing so much about lately is just the trick. Maybe something like this. So yes, a warm welcome to single, married, and all other gerbils alike, because I'm back again with another miniature gaming PC to review. This time around, I've got MSI's Trident 3 small-form-factor desktop. This is the smallest of MSI's gaming PCs, the others being the Nightblade and the Aegis. MSI calls it "console-sized," and at just 13.63" long by 9.15" deep by 2.83" tall (34.6 x 23.2 x 7.2 cm), the machine is very nearly the same size and weight as a PlayStation 4 Pro. Despite its diminutive dimensions, however, it houses a full-powered desktop gaming PC powered by Intel's four-core, eight-thread Core i7-7700 and a desktop GTX 1060 6GB graphics card. Now, this machine is a fair bit larger than the Zotac Zbox Magnus EN1070 I reviewed a couple of months ago. In fact, it occupies over twice the volume: 5.8L, versus the 2.6L of the Zotac. With the EN1070, I was impressed by the machine's graphics prowess but left wanting more from that machine's low-power CPU. MSI solved the CPU power issue with the Trident 3's 65W chip, but this larger PC trades the mobile GTX 1070 for a somewhat less powerful GTX 1060 6GB. Whether that trade was a good one to make will be a key theme in our investigations. For now, check out the full specifications.   MSI Trident 3 VR7RC-025US Processor Intel Core i7-7700 Memory 16GB Kingston DDR4-2400 (2x8GB SODIMMs) Chipset Intel H110 Express Graphics Intel HD Graphics 630 (normally disabled) Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 with 6GB GDDR5 RAM Storage Kingston RBU-SNS8152S3256GG5 M.2 SATA SSD, 256GB Hitachi Travelstar 7K1000, 1TB 7200 RPM SATA HDD Audio Realtek ALC1150 Expansion and display outputs 1 USB 3.0 Type-C 3 USB 3.0 Type-A 4 USB 2.0 Type-A 1 HDMI 2.0 with HDCP 2.2 1 DisplayPort 1 DVI-D Communications Intel I219-V Gigabit Ethernet Intel 3168 Wi-Fi-AC + Bluetooth 4.2+LE Dimensions 13.63" x 9.15" x 2.83" (34.6 x 23.2 x 7.2 cm) Weight 6.9 lbs (3.1 kg) Included cables 230W power adapter, HDMI, DisplayPort OS Windows 10 Home Since the Trident 3's custom motherboard is based on Intel's H110 chipset, we won't be doing any overclocking, and given that it comes with every one of its available expansion slots filled, we won't be doing much upgrading. Those facts shouldn't be much of a problem, though. The Core i7-7700 that the machine includes is lightning-quick, 16GB of RAM is plenty enough, and the combination of M.2 SSD and 2.5" HDD gives us fast storage for the OS and lots of space for games. Clever gerbils will note that further unlike the EN1070, this machine comes as a complete, ready-to-go system. As a result, we can judge the Trident 3 more specifically on its value proposition. We can also talk about the included storage hardware and the bundled software. All of that comes later, though. First, let's have a closer look at the machine.

Elegant case design. Cons Other desktops offer superior raw gaming performance. Bottom Line Loaded with AMD's new flagship Ryzen 7 1800X CPU, the CyberPower Gamer Master Ultra is a compelling fusion of gaming and processing performance at a delectable price. By Matthew Murray What Nvidia began with the release of its Pascal graphics architecture last fall AMD is now continuing with its new Ryzen CPUs: Both are changing how much performance you can expect for ever-decreasing amounts of money. The first computer we've seen that fuses both technologies is the CyberPower Gamer Master Ultra, a $2,399 gaming desktop that, when it comes to processing chores, can also hold its own against some desktops costing thousands of dollars more. If you're willing to shell out more cash, you can find a better pure gaming system. But if you want something that's capable at work as it is at play, it won't be easy to find something better balanced than this. //Compare Similar Products Compare Acer Predator G1-710-70001   %displayPrice%%seller% HP Omen X   %displayPrice%%seller% Alienware Aurora (2016)   %displayPrice%%seller% Origin Chronos VR   %displayPrice%%seller% Digital Storm Velox (Core i7-7700K)   %displayPrice%%seller% Asus ROG GT51   %displayPrice%%seller% Falcon Northwest Talon (2016)   %displayPrice%%seller% Maingear Rush X99 Super Stock   %displayPrice%%seller% Dell XPS Tower Special Edition   %displayPrice%%seller% Falcon Northwest Tiki (2017)   %displayPrice%%seller% Velocity Micro Raptor Z95   %displayPrice%%seller% MSI Trident   %displayPrice%%seller% Design and Features The relatively low price of the Gamer Master Ultra might work in its favor in terms of its aesthetics. Like most boutique manufacturers, CyberPower can sometimes go overboard on the bling, but here the design is restrained and even—dare I say it?—elegant. The case is an Enthoo Evolv ATX, all aluminum and all black along the front and top, except for the light-blue outlining the Power button (on the front of the top panel) and the activity light (on the bottom of the front panel). The center of the front panel is angled inward, bestowing a serious and mature look, and parallelogram-shaped vents along the left and right sides of the top panel add a bit of extra, low-key visual appeal. Tinted tempered glass doors cover not just the side of the Gamer Master Ultra that lets you view and access your components, but the other side as well, in case you want to show off the cable routing. (To open either side, just remove the four thumbscrews holding the door on, and then lift it straight off.) The biggest splash is made by the bright-white CyberPower logo applied to the primary door's glass panel. View All 6 Photos in Gallery There are a few shocks of white on the Gigabyte Aorus X370 Gaming 5 motherboard and the braided power cabling, an occasional flash of silver, and lighting accents (dull orange on the intake and exhaust fans, bright red on the motherboard itself), but otherwise the interior is awash in black. The top-mounted Corsair Hydro H110i GT liquid cooler, the two DIMMs of Corsair memory (totaling 16GB; the board can hold as much as 64GB), the EVGA Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 video card, the 850-watt Corsair power supply—all black. The 512GB Samsung SSD 960 Pro (for Windows and programs) and a 2TB 7,200rpm hard drive for storing files are tucked out of sight in the lower-right drive cage (which, of course, is black). There's no optical drive, which is fine given that these days you're more likely to download your PC games from a digital service like Steam or Origin, and having one on the front would only spoil the case's stylish austerity. (As it is, the easy-access ports—two USB 3.0, microphone, and headphone—and the Reset button are hidden by a flip-up door at the top of the front panel.) The back is necessarily a different story, as there you'll find the rear-panel ports: six USB 3.0, three USB 3.1 Type-A, one USB-C, two Ethernet, six audio (including S/PDIF), and PS/2 (for connecting an old-school keyboard or mouse). There's also an HDMI port, but you should defer instead to the ports on the graphics card, which comprise three DisplayPort, one HDMI, and one DVI. Power-Packed Processing Although you can't see it beneath the water block, the raison d'être for this system is the Ryzen 7 1800X processor. This is AMD's new top-end chip, which with a base clock speed of 3.6GHz and eight processing cores (which amounts to 16 threads), is a direct competitor to the Intel Core i7-6900K—but more impressive in some ways. That chip's base clock is 3.2GHz, and it has a higher TDP (140 watts versus 95 watts), but even more than that, it has a higher price. Whereas Intel recommends selling the Core i7-6900K for about $1,089, AMD has priced the Ryzen 7 1800X at only $499—a stunning difference for a processor this comparable. This becomes particularly important when looking at the Gamer Master Ultra's performance. Despite this configuration costing just $100 more than the Acer Predator G1-710-70001, our previous Editors' Choice for midrange gaming desktops, it soared past that computer on our multimedia tests. It finished our Photoshop filter application test in just 3 minutes, 1 second (the Acer needed 3:21), and our HandBrake video encoding task in 34 seconds (against the Acer's 56), and its CineBench rendering result was 1,621 (more than twice the Acer's 794). The only test on which it fell behind was the PCMark 8 overall system benchmark, with a result of 2,790 to the Acer's 3,623. See How We Test Desktops But the Gamer Master Ultra compares favorably even with more expensive systems, too. Our $2,599.99 review configuration of the HP Omen X scored higher on PCMark 8 (3,931) and was faster at Photoshop (2:38), but less adept at the more highly threaded CineBench (774) and HandBrake (57 seconds). Exactly the same was true of the 2016 Alienware Aurora and the Origin Chronos VR, each of which in our review configurations cost more than $3,600; the $4,182 Falcon Northwest Tiki; the $4,737 Kaby Lake–equipped Digital Storm Velox; and the $4,999 Asus ROG GT51. We've only seen appreciably better results from truly luxury gaming desktops, like the Falcon Northwest Talon and the Maingear Rush X99 Super Stock, both of which use the 10-core, 20-thread Intel Core i7-6950X Extreme Edition CPU. Still Good for Gaming When it comes to gaming, a PC's graphics card generally matters more than its processor, and because the Gamer Master Ultra at this price only has one GTX 1080, it can't really compete with the dual-GPU behemoths on the market. But the hardware that's here ensures the computer is still more than sufficient for full HD or VR gaming. Compared with the Acer Predator G1 and the HP Omen X, the Gamer Master Ultra smoked the 3DMark Cloud Gate and Fire Strike Extreme tests: It scored 45,751 on the former and 10,164 on the latter versus 30,584 and 9,263 for the Acer and 32,071 and 9,469 for the HP. Likewise, on our Heaven and Valley tests at 1,920-by-1,080 resolution with graphics quality set to Ultra, the CyberPower desktop sailed through with 133 frames per second (fps) and 109fps, respectively, versus the Acer's 121fps for both and the HP's respective 126fps and 124fps. It falls a little short, but at full HD, these differences are gravy anyway. Upping the resolution to 4K (3,480 by 2,160) caused frame rates to drop significantly, as you'd expect, but Heaven was still at 33fps and Valley at 42fps—above our 30fps threshold for smooth playability, and, in both cases, above the Acer (30fps and 38fps) and the Omen X (30fps and 40fps). Ryzen Shine The CyberPower Gamer Master Ultra is the first in what will undoubtedly be a long line of desktops challenging conventional notions of where the intersection of performance and budget should lie. For less than $2,500, you're getting a high-end gaming machine that's also adept at handling heavily multithreaded workloads. This has been Intel's exclusive province for years, and the composition (and pricing) of high-end and luxury gaming desktops has reflected that. And if you want to push the gaming envelope to the edge and beyond, with super-high 4K frame rates, you're best off going with a high-end gaming desktop, like our Editors' Choice, the Digital Storm Velox. The Ryzen 7 1800X provides an enormous performance benefit you'll see and feel in most other usage scenarios, particularly with software that can use its prodigious number of cores and threads. And because the chip is such a good deal, the same is true of a computer that uses it and uses it well. The Gaming Master Ultra falls squarely into that category, turning out not just luscious frame rates at 1080p, decent ones at 4K, and solid VR potential, but giving you additional processing capabilities you've never had before at this price. Factoring all this together with its forward-looking potential, the Gamer Master Ultra replaces the Acer Predator G1-710-70001 as our Editors' Choice for midrange gaming desktops.

Lenovo The new Lenovo Yoga 720 is an example of modern technology done right. The device, which was launched at Mobile World Congress (MWC 2017) in Barcelona, is technically a 2-in-1 gaming laptop thanks to its combination of power, flexibility and portability. The Yoga 720 is a multitasker’s dream machine. For a convertible, it packs a whole lot of power in its relatively slim frame. Boosting the Lenovo Yoga 720’s rep are the latest Intel processors (up to 7th gen Core i7) and up to 1 TB PCIe SSD storage. It carries 8 GB of DDR4 RAM on board, but can accommodate a maximum of 16 GB for double the muscle. The Lenovo Yoga 720 furnishes a 720p HD camera alongside a couple of JBL speakers (backed by Dolby Audio Premium software) and a built-in fingerprint reader for easy and secure log-in through Windows Hello. The device also comes with an optional active pen support for editing, note-taking and sketching. According to Lenovo, the company made it a mission to make the Yoga 720’s versatility cater to the needs of its users in every aspect. “Users need consistency and continuity across every facet of their lives (work, home, school, hobbies) and are weary of switching from one computer to another based on location or activity,” says the Chinese multinational tech company. “The versatile Yoga 720 is ideal for multitaskers who want to effortlessly switch between budgeting on a spreadsheet with full keyboard in laptop mode to sharing a video in tent mode.” The Lenovo Yoga 720 comes with an optional active pen support for editing, note-taking and sketching.  Lenovo Lenovo’s new device comes in two sizes and two display options. The 15.6-inch Yoga 720 and its smaller 13.3-inch brother are available in 4K UHD models (with 3,840 x 2,160 resolution) and FHD variants (with 1,920 x 1,080 resolution). The larger machine packs an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050M graphics card while the smaller unit comes with an Intel HD Graphics 620 video card. The 15.6-inch Yoga 720 can supposedly last up to 8 hours with the 4K UHD display and up to 9 hours with the FHD display. Meanwhile, the 13.3-inch version’s battery life extends up to 7 hours with the 4K UHD screen and up to 8 hours with the FHD monitor. Those who are interested in getting the Lenovo Yoga 720 should wait until its arrival in April. Prices start at US$1,099 (AU$1,452) for the 15.6-inch Yoga 720 while the smaller variant has a starting price of US$1,099 (AU$1,135). The devices are available in two colour options (platinum silver and iron grey) with the 13.3-inch unit getting an extra copper version.

They’re right to—it was an excellent speech. But the shift actually started a few weeks ago, during a few moments of the president’s Feb. 16 press conference.  While most of the rhetoric during that event was total Trump 2016, the president also gave viewers a rare glimpse into a man struggling to reconcile the bold and divisive promises he made on the campaign trail with the reality of being the person who ultimately must decide how to balance the rule of law with justice and morality. ADVERTISEMENT In the press conference, President Trump pledged to act with “great heart” when considering the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which temporarily stopped the deportation of individuals unwittingly brought illegally into the United States by their parents. The president followed those words a few days later with action, releasing rules that keep DACA in place. Democrats have said they are looking for a sign that President Trump is serious about immigration reform. That was it. The president understands there are policy, political and moral arguments against deporting these young people. Voters largely have rejected the idea of mass deportation. They too want a policy that is humane, one that balances “heart” with law. Even after this past election, polls show voters want federal policymakers to find a path to permanent legal status for undocumented migrants. Surveys also show most voters believe immigrants contribute to our society and that they also don’t buy the argument that immigrants are more prone to crime. (To be sure: DACA doesn’t allow criminals to stay in the United States. Successful applicants must be free of felony convictions and significant misdemeanors and be enrolled in school or in the U.S. military.) Mass deportation, even for the small population of DACA youth, also is costly. About $29 billion, or the price of adding another EPA to our bottom line. That’s worrisome when our national debt is approaching $20 trillion and when research shows immigrants are a net fiscal benefit to the U.S. Treasury. Finally, there’s the moral argument. President Trump made it clear he thinks about this issue as a parent—and he should. I have a seven-year old. She barely grasps the concept of borders and certainly doesn’t understand the rule of law. She follows her parents, trusting we won’t lead her astray. She’d blindly cross a border if I promised her Hogwarts, Harry, and Hermione were on the other side. In short: like those eligible for DACA, she’s an innocent. President Trump has taken the first step, but now he must work with congressional leaders on a more wide-ranging, permanent policy that increases security at the border, removes criminal migrants, and builds a legal immigration system that protects American workers and the productive young men and women who were brought here as innocents. The process won’t be easy. The hardline faction, including some in his own administration, will try to wrestle the president’s heart back, arguing he should reverse DACA. I personally encountered the hardline faction while working on immigration policy a decade ago during the Bush administration. In the first White House blogging effort, we reached out to individuals on both sides to try to correct misstatements (fake news?) about the 2007 reform legislation. Subscribing to the Reagan belief that coming to a new land requires a “special courage”—conservatives usually call this entrepreneurialism—I was surprised by the unwillingness to listen to the essential facts about the bill, and by the personal vitriol directed at anyone who dared dissent from the deportation line.   The fight then was bitter. It will be so again today, but in every presidency there are moments when a commander in chief must follow his heart and decide on his own how to balance humanity, morality, and the rule of law. This moment is yours, Mr. President. Rushton served in the White House Office of Strategic Initiatives from 2007 to 2009 and at the Republican National Committee from 2003 to 2007.

Ryzen's core and thread count look ready to take on Intel's high-end Broadwell-E desktop chips, but the dual-channel memory configuration's peak theoretical bandwidth is more in line with Intel's more pedestrian Kaby Lake Core processors. G.Skill probably saw this scenario coming, and it readied up its Fortis and Flare X lines of memory specifically designed and tested for AMD's AM4 platform. G.Skill markets its Fortis memory modules as a cost-effective solution for builders assembling a gaming-focused AM4 system. Fortis modules come in pairs with total capacity of 8GB or 16GB, allowing for four-DIMM configurations of up to 32GB. The 8GB kits are available in 2400 MT/s speed, and the 16 GB kits are offered in 2133, 2400, and 2666 MT/s configurations. The 8GB and 16GB kits 2400 MT/s kits are available with 16-16-16-39 or 17-17-17-39 timings. The company's Flare X modules are designed for maximum performance. G.Skill is currently offering 8GB and 16GB kits of paired modules, but the manufacturer says 32GB kits are on the way, allowing for Ryzen systems with up to 64GB of memory. The currently-shipping configurations are the same as the Fortis series, but G.Skill says 3200 MT/s and 3466 MT/s models are coming. The top-speed modules will only be available in a maximum capacity of 8GB per DIMM, though. The timings for the 2133 MT/s kit are 15-15-15-35 and the 2400 MT/s set is clocked at 16-16-16-39 or 17-17-17-39. Finally, the 2666 MT/s kit is set to 18-18-18-43. We were unable to locate product pages for the Fortis and Flare X memory modules on G.Skill's web site, but they're already selling at Newegg. The 8GB Fortis kits sell for $67 and the 16GB Flare X sets go for $130. Tags: Memory Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

(AMD) Stock Became a Market Stunner — Can it Last? AMD stock is defying gravity right now, but eventually, order will be restored By Josh Enomoto, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Mar 3, 2017, 10:04 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

(AMD) Stock Became a Market Stunner — Can it Last? Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) Stock STILL Has What It Takes to Go Higher View All Posts If I’m being painfully transparent, I almost want to call Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NYSE:AMD) “fake news.” A little more than two years ago, AMD stock was trading for under two bucks. Now, it has been toying with $15 with little sign of slowing down. And I don’t consider a near 5% loss on the day to be a sign of anything. This is especially true considering Advanced Micro Devices is up 22.6% for the year so far. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr I understand the point that rallies can be extremely pronounced from the depths of market volatility. We’ve seen similar patterns in the number one rival for AMD stock: Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). Those that bought the dips in Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and held on for the big surge were handsomely rewarded. But these are companies that are recognized leaders in their field of specialty. AMD, in contrast, historically has been the discount leader, playing catch-up with the big boys. Still, AMD stock registered an amazing 295% run last year. Even more astounding, speculators that caught AMD in mid-February of 2016 saw their investment rise by around 600%! Go in hard with a couple performances like that and you’ll be out of the rat race in no time. But is there any growth remaining in Advanced Micro Devices? A Game Changer (Literally!) for AMD Stock InvestorPlace contributor Joseph Hargett certainly thinks so. His bullishness isn’t based just on the momentum begetting momentum thesis. Rather, Hargett sees the company’s latest Ryzen CPU as a game changer, something that will put the hurting on Intel. From the initial reports, it’s hard to disagree. Ryzen will go head-to-head with Intel’s flagship i7 processor, which isn’t a surprising move in and of itself. Advanced Micro Devices and Intel have always warred for consumer attention like bitter siblings. Naturally, Intel has had the upper hand, whereas AMD was considered the “poor man’s Intel.” That same dynamic can be found in the markets, with AMD stock gyrating from euphoria to despair and back again. Although it’s a commonly expressed sentiment with mixed results, this time could be different for Advanced Micro Devices. The Ryzen is armed with more features than the i7, including attributes that are vital to its core video-gamer base. Most importantly, it clocks in at half the price of its rival’s offering, which will inevitably draw much excitement. AMD has previously supplied chips to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Sony Corp (ADR) (NYSE:SNE) for their video game systems. On the technical front, Hargett notes that there’s significant shorting activity in AMD stock. All it would take are a few good reviews, and that will send shares moving higher. Those who are short Advanced Micro Devices will have to cover their position to stay in it. But the overwhelming upside pressure could be too much, forcing them to close their transaction. In order to do that, borrowed shares of AMD stock that initiated the short would have to be bought back. After those market gymnastics, demand for AMD shoots even higher.

See Offers J.P. Devine Posted March 3 Updated March 3 increase font size Wanna dance to these ‘what ifs’? From life choices to politics to the Oscars, everyone has their own 'what if' lists, J.P. Devine writes. Share Comment Read Article What if, in 1953 in Air Force intelligence school, I had been sent to headquarters in Paris with my friend Cpl. Freddie Blackman, or to Rome with Sgt. Nick Lorre and Lt. “Scoop” Larkin, instead of drawing the wrong red envelope and winding up in Korea and Japan? Asia affected my life deeply in so many ways, but Paris, a writer’s dreamscape? Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → What if? I would probably still be living in Paris now, writing my sixth best-selling novel and married to a beautiful French girl. What if I had gone to Rome? Instead of pushing my wheelchair down the Via Flaminia in my early 80s, what if I had come home to St. Louis, retired from running a corner pizza shop after being divorced from Rosemary DeBranco, she of the thousand-and-one pastel angora sweaters and simple strand of pearls, whose father did own a chain of pizza parlors? What if? In Hollywood, I had three clear shots at a major career advancement; I passed on each because they involved typical Hollywood moral choices — long story. What if I had said, “what the hell”? I would now be a fat, old, retired drunken Emmy/Oscar winner living in the Actor’s Home without She, who would have opted out. But I did what I did and feel good about it, and married a beautiful French girl, and here I am suffering from a bad knee and writing humor at bargain prices to make you laugh in this winter of discontent. We all succumb to the “what ifs” once in a while. What if the fickle finger of fate, that mythical card sharp in that deep forest of fantasies where we keep that “I won the lottery” glow, had grabbed the political red envelope and given it to Hillary and company? We would all be singing “Happy Days Are Here Again” and tap dancing on top of the cars at the car wash. Our LGBT brothers and sisters and children would be tasting freedom and shedding fear. Our Hispanic brothers and sisters would come out into the sunlight without looking over their shoulders. Hawkers on the streets of Manhattan would be selling rainbow hijabs you could wear if you wanted to, or not. Many of you are lining the bird cage with my column now. Guess what? I love you anyway and remember, this is my column, not yours. Go get one. Today, let’s look at a series of “what ifs” as exemplified by the 2016 movies: For example: What if God, the great celestial card dealer of all, had intervened and kept anyone from being wise to the envelope handed to poor Warren Beatty? “La La Land” would have emerged from that debacle as the Best Picture, and I, and millions of others, would be happier this morning. Even in the current Russian winter of Washington politics, we would at least have something to hum about, something to makes us want to break into a tap dance on the darkest of our days. Maybe not you, but certainly those of us who needed to sing and dance our way out of the Great Terror Tsunami of the last election. I know; you’re one of the winner’s circle and “giving Trump a chance” crowd. But again, this is my column; go get your own. “La La” was a happy dance in a happy place. It made us remember Fred and Ginger, Gene and Debbie. It was full of primary colors. You remember primary colors from kindergarten? Nobody wanted the dull colors; we wanted red, green and blue, and then yellow thrown in. Well, some of us are emotionally still in kindergarten. We want a carton of milk and an orange at recess, penny candy after school; we want a box of crayons to brighten our days with. “La La Land” was that box of crayons. Opinion alert: “Manchester By the Sea,” beautifully acted, was a gray day full of gray people. “Moonlight,” even with its touching last stage love, had no moonlight to give a romantic glow to its victims. Somber. Final, a what if to those of you, even my friends, who say, “I don’t get the paper anymore, it’s too full of bad news.” What if this newspaper, with its “bad news,” was not in your box or on your doorstep this morning or ever again? All of you, my neighbors and friends, from Augusta to Sidney, Hallowell to Skowhegan, my faithful and random readers, have your own “what if” lists. Come tell me about them; write them in. It’s OK. It’s safe. This is still America, and this newspaper, full of good and bad news, will still be on your doorstep tomorrow morning. Wanna dance? J.P. Devine is a Waterville writer.

TurboStat Updated, More Power Management Code For Linux 4.11 Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Kernel on 3 March 2017 at 06:17 AM EST. Add A Comment One week after sending in the main power management and ACPI updates for the Linux 4.11 kernel, Rafael Wysocki has served up a second batch of feature updates for this next kernel version. This secondary PM update for Linux 4.11 includes fixes for a cpuidle menu governor problem, a fix for the Intel P-State operation mode, updates to the generic power domains, hibernation core cleanups, and other basic changes within the power management realm. Before anyone asks, no, there aren't any targeted Ryzen changes with this code. Perhaps more interesting are the turbostat updates for this Intel utility that lives within the kernel Git tree. TurboStat now has Geminilake support, better Bay Trail SoC support, several new options, more verbose output by default, and other changes.

(“AMD” or the “Company”) including the features, functionality, availability, timing, expected benefits of AMD future products including AMD’s Ryzen processors, which are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Forward-looking statements are commonly identified by words such as ”would,” “intends,” “believes,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “intends,” “plans,” “pro forma,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” or the negative of these words and phrases, other variations of these words and phrases or comparable terminology. Investors are cautioned that the forward-looking statements in this press release are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the date of this press release and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. Material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, without limitation, the following: Intel Corporation’s dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit AMD’s ability to compete effectively; AMD has a wafer supply agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc.

Cinebench R15 nT is used to simulate multi-threaded CPU performance; the AMD Ryzen™ 7 1800X scored 1601.43, while the Intel Core i7-6900K Extreme scored 1473.79 for a benchmark score comparison of 1601.43/1473.79 = 1.09× or 9% more. RZN-92 Lowest power – Power efficiency of consumer client desktop 8-core processors based on Cinebench R15 nT score divided by wall power watts during testing. Scores: 1410 (AMD Ryzen 7 1700) vs. 1473 (Core i7-6900K). System config: AMD Reference Motherboard (1800X) and ASUS STRIX X99 Gaming (6900K), 16GB DDR4-2400, NVIDIA Titan X (Pascal), graphics driver 21.21.13.7633, Windows 10 x64 RS1. Measured system wall power during testing: 115W (1700) vs. 142W (6900K). Power efficiency: 1410/115=12.26 points per watt (1700) vs. 1473/142W=10.37 points per watt (6900K). Result: AMD Ryzen 7 1700 offers 18.22% more performance per watt. RZN-103 Testing by AMD Performance labs. PC manufacturers may vary configurations yielding different results. Cinebench R15 multi-threaded performance used to represent multi-threaded performance. The Ryzen 7 1600X (6c/12t) achieved a score of 1195 in the multi-thread test; The Core i5-7600K (4c/4t) achieved a score of 655 in the multi-thread test; resulting in a 69% multi-threaded performance advantage for the Ryzen 5 1600X. RZN-174 Though both are often measured in watts, it is important to distinguish between thermal and electrical watts. Thermal wattage for processors is conveyed via thermal design power (TDP). TDP is a calculated value that conveys an appropriate thermal solution to achieve the intended operation of a processor. Electrical watts are not a variable in the TDP calculation. By design, electrical watts can vary from workload to workload and may exceed thermal watts.

A new processor, an updated operating system, better battery life and that same sumptuous screen make this one hard to resist. For Modern OS Useful improvements across the board Probably the best Ultrabook (still) Against OS update still required for optimal performance QHD+ model is expensive Not really worth it if you already have the 9350 Last October Dell quietly updated its suave XPS 13 range of ultraportables. Pretty much since their inception, these beasts have been the undisputed champions of the premium laptop plains. Dell has hit on a winning recipe, and wisely chosen to only update and tweak it on this, its fourth generation. At the heart of the machine, there’s now a Core i5-7200U or i7-7500U processor. We tested the 2.7GHz i7 Developer Edition, which came with 16GB RAM, a 512GB SSD and the same not-of-this-world 3200 x 1800-resolution glossy touchscreen as the previous model, the 9350. This notebook also ships with Ubuntu Linux, and since we already reviewed the Windows version, this write-up will be fairly Linux-centric. The main strong point in this outing is the migration to the Kaby Lake architecture. This promises around a 10% performance increase, improved battery life and, thanks to the new Intel HD 620 graphics, accelerated VP9 and 10-bit HEVC video playback. Beyond that we have a larger battery and a newer ‘Killer’ Wi-Fi chip from Qualcomm. Getting Linux to play nice with new and shiny hardware could potentially be a struggle, but Dell has worked hard to ensure that, while some benchmarks lag behind Windows, everything works exactly as it should.  While these things are just names, the Developer Edition moniker is something of a misnomer. Not all developers use Linux, and not all Linux users are developers. It’s heart-warming to see Dell supporting Linux, but maybe the firm should just call the proverbial spade a spade, and re-baptise this newest-born model as the Ubuntu/Linux/Penguin Edition (take your pick). Ubuntu 14.04, which shipped with the previous Developer Edition, is getting a little long in the tooth, so the update to 16.04 this time around is most welcome. That said, Kaby Lake did not receive mainline kernel support until the 4.5 series, and 16.04 ships with 4.4. However, installing a 4.8 kernel is easy using the recently pushed 16.04.2 Hardware Enablement Stack. Of course, one can always install a whole new flavour of Linux, and there are tales of success from users doing this with Ubuntu 16.10, Arch Linux, Fedora and many more. But it’s easier (and for many users preferable) to just install two packages (linux-image-generic-hwe-16.04 and xserver-xorg-hwe-16.04) and enjoy a modern kernel and video driver stack. This update will actually be pushed out automatically to desktop users in the coming weeks, but some people just can’t wait. Intel is a generous contributor to FOSS so its hardware is well-supported – the main issue is that it takes time for new hardware support to make it into fixed release distros. Spec Sheet Here is the Dell XPS 13 9360 DE configuration sent to TechRadar for review: CPU: 2.7GHz (3.5Ghz Turbo) Intel Core i7-7500U Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 620 RAM: 16GB LPDDR3 (1866MHz) Screen: 13.3-inch QHD+ (3200 x 1800) touch panel Storage: 512GB PCIe m.2 SSD Ports: 1 x USB 3.0, 1 x USB 3.0 w/PowerShare, 1 x USB-C (Thunderbolt 3), SD card reader, headphone jack Connectivity: Qualcomm Killer 1535 802.11ac Wi-Fi; Bluetooth 4.1 Camera: 720p widescreen webcam with dual mics Weight: 2.9lb (1.29kg) Size: 304 x 200 x 9-15mm (W x D x H) Software and Linux support After installing the HWE packages, we were met with very tiny text and icons in the Unity interface. It turns out that scaling is handled differently with the new drivers, but all it takes to remedy is adjusting the Scaling setting in the Displays applet. Setting it to 2 will make things comfortable again, but young ones who still have keen eyes may prefer something closer to 1.5. The main desktop environments in Linux all have good support for scaling on HiDPI screens, so installing Gnome or KDE (or a whole new distro that uses one of these) won’t cause any problems. However, certain proprietary applications have hard-coded font sizes, which means they don’t respect the desktop environment’s scaling settings. The main culprits here are Steam and Spotify. Steam can be fixed using the HiDPI skin available on Github, and Spotify can be fed the ‘--force-device-scale-factor’ option. In days of old, Linux users were at a disadvantage when it came to BIOS updates. Vendors used to supply DOS executables for updating the BIOS, which were meant to be run from the Windows ‘Boot to command prompt’ option. It is possible to use these with, for example, a bootable FreeDOS USB, if one wants an entirely libre solution, but these can be quite tricky to make. Now we live in a UEFI world and would much rather have a cleaner way to freely freshen our firmwares. That way, dear readers, is the fwupd tool, and Dell has made enormous contributions to its development. Dell has also provided handy recovery tools in case things go south. When Kaby Lake was introduced, there was some concern that laptops on Linux were not entering the deepest sleep C-states, C8-C10. However, our tests with powerstat showed that these states of near-hibernation were entered after a relatively short idle time, and that idle power consumption was a mere 6.5W. Battery and benchmarks During our Phoronix Test Suite (PTS) benchmarking, temperatures, as reported by lm_sensors anyway, did occasionally become worrying. In particular the FurMark benchmark (which scored a respectable 473 points at 1080p) saw core temps rise as high as 85 degrees. At this temperature you’d hope for some fan noise, and there is some, but even at full power the sound of the fan whirring doesn’t become obnoxious. While the left-hand side of the keyboard did get warm, it was never uncomfortably so, suggesting that ventilation and heat dissipation worked well here. The CPU is only dual-core, but still managed to build a 4.9 kernel in just under four minutes. PTS’ sparse matrix multiplication test reported an impressive 1029.63 Mflops. Given all the native caching it’s hard to get reliable numbers for the SSD (PTS’ IOZone test generated some impressive, though impossible readings), but using dd (with the conv=fdatasync,notrunc options) reported write speeds of 567MB/s and read speeds (after clearing the cache) of around 1.2GB/s. Using mpv with all radios disabled and at 50% brightness, we managed to get 8 hours of full-screen playback with the 720p version of Sintel, and 5 hours with the 4K version. The taxing Unigine Heaven benchmark at 1080p managed 17 frames per second windowed and 8 fps full-screen, which tells you that this machine will struggle with triple-A games.  Final verdict The XPS 13 retains its crown as the undisputed champion of the Ultrabook market, and one can only admire Dell for its unwavering Linux support on a flagship machine. Don’t be misled by the name – it’s not just for developers, and can happily play less-demanding modern games at reasonable settings. Of course, such treasure comes at a price and though the QHD+ screen is something to behold, some people will prefer to settle for the HD version. Those who do will get a consolation prize of improved battery life, but will never know the joy of the tiny pixels and vibrant colour reproduction which the fancier screen is capable of.

The Obama administration officials sought to ensure that something like Russia's meddling in the 2016 election never happens again and to set up a future investigation into the matter with a "a clear trail of intelligence for government investigators," the New York Times reported Wednesday, citing former American officials. American intelligence agencies and European allies had provided the Obama White House "damning" information that showed meetings taking place between Russian officials, and others close to President Vladimir Putin, and associates of Trump, according to the Times. A former intelligence official confirmed to Fox News that the Obama administration's goal was to "keep the Russian issue alive" and ensure evidence of Moscow's reported election interference was widely disseminated. Normally such circulation is kept private, but the former official said the Russia hacking issue was so serious that two versions of the intelligence were created–one for the public and the other classified. To make sure the intelligence could be seen widely by people with the necessary security clearances, officials would ask specific questions and then archive the answers to be easily discovered by future investigators. The "raw" intelligence was given a low classification level to enable more people to access the files. Reports on the Obama administration's efforts to preserve intelligence regarding contact between Trump associates and Moscow coincided with the revelation Wednesday night that Attorney General Jeff Sessions met twice last year with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. Senior congressional Democrats have called on Sessions to resign for not disclosing the meetings during his confirmation hearing to become attorney general. Sessions has maintained that he did not discuss any campaign-related issues with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Session's spokeswoman, Sarah Isgur Flores, said Thursday that the former Alabama lawmaker met with Kislyak as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who "had over 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors" last year.

Sessions had said at his confirmation hearing he had no contact with Russians during the election. The Hill's Jordan Fabian has more on the recusal: "I have recused myself in the matters that deal with the Trump campaign," he said at a press conference. Sessions had come under mounting bipartisan pressure to recuse himself after it was revealed late Wednesday that he spoke twice with the Russian envoy last year and failed to tell senators during his confirmation hearing.

TRUMP VISITS AIRCRAFT CARRIER: As the controversy around Sessions swirled in D.C., President Trump headed to Newport News, Va., to tout his planned defense budget in a speech aboard the soon-to-be-commissioned U.S.S. Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier. The speech was more notable for what wasn't said than what was -- Trump didn't mention the Sessions controversy. In terms of his defense budget, Trump repeated his promise for a "great rebuilding" of the military. "We are going to have very soon the finest equipment in the world," Trump said. "We will give our military the tools you need to prevent war, and if required to fight war and only to do one thing. You know what that is? Win. Win. We're going to start winning again." Trump has proposed a $603 billion base defense budget for fiscal 2018. The Hill's Max Greenwood has more on the speech here. HOUSE TO TACKLE 2017 DEFENSE SPENDING: Before Congress can get to Trump's fiscal 2018 proposal, it needs to pass spending bills for fiscal 2017, and lawmakers on Thursday introduced a bill for defense. House appropriators unveiled a $577.9 billion fiscal 2017 defense spending bill in hopes of passing it quickly so that lawmakers can tackle a pending supplemental funding request and the fiscal 2018 budget.

US FORCES STRIKE AL QAEDA IN YEMEN: The U.S. military battered al Qaeda's Yemeni branch with more than 20 airstrikes overnight Thursday in the first known military operation in the country since a controversial raid that left one Navy SEAL dead. "U.S. forces conducted a series of precision strikes in Yemen against al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, in the early morning of March 2," Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis said in a statement Thursday. "More than 20 strikes targeted AQAP militants, equipment and infrastructure in the Yemeni governorates of Abyan, al Bayda and Shabwah." The strikes were done in partnership with the Yemeni government, Davis added. "The strikes will degrade the AQAP's ability to coordinate external terror attacks and limit their ability to use territory seized from the legitimate government of Yemen as a safe space for terror plotting," Davis said. "AQAP has taken advantage of ungoverned spaces in Yemen to plot, direct and inspire terror attacks against the United States and our allies. U.S. forces will continue to work with the government of Yemen to defeat AQAP and deny it the ability to operate in Yemen."

But what you don't see often is a company showing the instances where their hardware doesn't win. After Dr Lisa Su gave her initial presentation at AMD's Ryzen launch event in San Francisco, other speakers began to take the stage. But it wasn't until a breakout session afterwards where AMD delved a little deeper into gaming benchmarks for their 1800X 8-core CPU - as well as some figures for their 6-core offerings, Ryzen 5. Ryzen is officially on sale now, and the benchmarks were under NDA so I couldn't share them with you earlier. But what you'll see is the Ryzen 7 1800X, 1700X and 1700 pitched against Intel's i7-6900K, i7-6800K and the more common i7-7700K, respectively, with Intel's CPUs coming out ahead for the most part. Images: AMD The CPU that's stands out to me is the Ryzen 7 1700, since it's priced at $469 locally (the kind of CPU people building a gaming PC for $2000 or under would consider). It's also a fraction cheaper, by about $20, than the i7-7700K used in the last slide. (The gap between the 1700 and the 7700K in GTA 5 at 1440p is pretty stark, mind you, considering both machines are running a NVIDIA GTX 1070 GPU.) If you're interested, here was the settings AMD say they used for all six machines in their testing: Image: AMD It's a bit of an odd mix, but it's also missing a few titles that have favoured AMD over the last year. There's no Total War: WARHAMMER, which AMD was a big supporter of prior to release, and there's no Hitman or Rise of the Tomb Raider, two other games that have been staples in DirectX 12 testing. But those games have also been good to AMD graphics cards, not AMD CPUs in particular. And one point AMD frequently hammered home in San Francisco was that they were still in the process of optimising their compilers and reaching out to developers, which should result in performance gains down the road. (Those performance gains will probably be marginal, as you often see with driver updates, but every bit adds up.) Right now, AMD's pitch is all about the value play. As far as they're concerned, their CPUs are cheaper - significantly so, in the case of the 1800X - and the performance is comparable, if not marginally better in certain scenarios. And having more cores means they'll get more usage out of non-gaming applications, like streaming or video encoding, too. But gamers will want to keep an eye on what those scenarios are. Right now, the price difference between the Ryzen 7 1700 and the i7-7700K is pretty negligible. But if you happen to be a streamer? Or you're a game developer who does a lot of encoding/rendering and you want an 8-core or 10-core CPU? That's a different equation. Either way, it's always interesting to see a company come out with tests that don't always show their product winning. Gamers, and the tech world, is so often accustomed to the opposite, tests that are skewed just the right way so CEOs and PR can say "we have the fastest product EVER". AMD's pitch is a little different. Third party benchmarks might not be quite as flattering - and we'll have our own in the next week or so - but it's a refreshing change of message nonetheless. The author travelled to San Francisco as a guest of AMD. Comments justachap @justachap Mar 3, 2017, 11:43am Looked at the prices for these new CPU's and they don't seem that much cheaper compared to the Intel CPU's. Unless if they just had a price drop? Reply 0 Alex Walker @alexwalker AUTHOR Mar 3, 2017, 11:48am They haven't yet; I've been checking in with retailers to check just in case. The 6900K is still priced at $1400+ however, while the Ryzen 1800X is about $700. The difference between the 7700K and the Ryzen 1700 is pretty minimal in Australia though, which weakens AMD's messaging a tad. Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Mar 3, 2017, 12:21pm I probably wouldn't expect the 6900K to come down by much until the KBL-X CPUs hit in a few months. There's an opportunity here for AMD to pick up some of the HEDT market if they can convince people that it's better to buy now for cheap than wait to see how KBL-X looks. Are these the benchmarks you mentioned in your reply to me last article, Alex? You mentioned benchmarks that you had (or had seen) but weren't allowed to talk about yet. Reply 0 Alex Walker @alexwalker AUTHOR Mar 3, 2017, 12:27pm Basically. There were a couple of other graphs with the Ryzen 5 - but those weren't supplied to me, so unfortunately I can't republish it here. Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Mar 3, 2017, 12:32pm Does it mention anywhere what GPU they were using for these tests? Just curious how CPU-bound the results are or if none of them were being properly taxed. With a good GPU the CPU load usually isn't that stressful. On the settings table, systems C/D and E/F have the same settings so I'm guessing they had different GPUs in them. Last edited March 3, 2017 12:34 pm Reply 0 B-ob @beeawwb Mar 3, 2017, 12:36pm Alex mentions a "NVIDIA GTX 1070" in passing about one of the comparisons, assume it's that one. Reply 0 Alex Walker @alexwalker AUTHOR Mar 4, 2017, 8:59am TITAN X for the first two comparisons, GTX 1080 for the second, GTX 1070 for the last lot. Reply 0 twisti @twisti Mar 3, 2017, 4:49pm So basically Intel is still king for gaming. Hopefully these AMD GPUs will drop in price enough to justify the performance and lack of overclockability. Reply 0 xpz24 Guest Mar 3, 2017, 6:27pm its because most dx11 games will perform better with higher clock speed than more cores. Which is why a $309.99 i7 6700K will perform better than a $1,109.00 i7-6900K. Reply 0 Alex Walker @alexwalker AUTHOR Mar 4, 2017, 9:01am Yeah. The bet here is that games will start to take advantage of more cores/multi-threading and that the balance will tip to users with 6/8/10/12 cores in the next year, two years. (but that relies an awful lot on work from the developers, single core threaded performance is still a priority for developers because most PCs are 2 or 4 core systems, and Vulkan/DX12 is still in the early stages, so a lot of the benefits it provides isn't being taken advantage of) Reply 0 coldbin @coldbin Mar 4, 2017, 9:57am I hope you're right but we've been waiting 10 years since PS3, Intel q6600 days for developers to get off their asses haha. Reply 0 riddick @riddick Mar 3, 2017, 7:30pm You can only truly stress thus test the CPU's at lower resolutions such as 1080p many of these benchmarks are completely invalid for comparing these CPU's unfortunately and people are easily fooled! Reply 0 MediaSearchProgram Guest Mar 4, 2017, 5:56pm Dear Alex, Thanks for the information regarding AMD Ryzen benchmarks and your thoughts, I am happy to see AMD has after many years come out with a product that can be competitive in workstation and multimedia environments. Unfortunately it seems that they have not been able to grasp Intel's leadership when it comes to gaming side as the performance is lesser. I plan on making a video on YouTube, hopefully you will be able to view it and provide feedback. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7jFuvAklYvYYIMXUUsixwA Thank you, Maximilian Reply 0 Join the discussion!

The brief, organized by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), is in favor of a suit brought by transgender student Gavin Grimm. Grimm alleges that Gloucester County School Board violated his Title IX rights by not letting him use the boys' restroom at his school. A federal court in June ordered the school board to give Grimm access to the boys' restroom. The Supreme Court, however, halted the lower court's order, and will hear the case itself. In their brief, the tech companies argue that reversing the 4th Circuit federal court's decision could have a harmful and far-reaching impact. ADVERTISEMENT "A reversal could embolden other local and state governments to enact legislation that also contravenes federal law and restricts transgender people's access to restrooms that comport with their gender identity, both in the public sphere and in the workplace," the brief reads. "This piecemeal approach will result in a geographic patchwork, the borders of which will be defined by the treatment of the transgender community. Such a result will have very real, adverse effects on amici's businesses." "These companies are sending a powerful message to transgender children and their families that America's leading businesses have their backs," said HRC President Chad Griffin in a news release.

SNAP, the company's ticker, closed its first day on the New York Stock Exchange at $24.48 -- a 44 percent increase from its $17 initial share price this morning. Snap's CEO Evan Spiegal gave an exclusive interview to the Los Angeles Times today, in which he addressed concerns that Snap would have trouble with future growth. "We built our business on creativity," Spiegel said. "And we're going to have to go through an education process for the next five years to explain to people how our users and that creativity creates value." The IPO was the largest since Alibaba's in 2014.   ROBOCALLS TOP FCC MEETING AGENDA: The Federal Communications Commission will take up a proposal to crack down on robocalls from fraudulent numbers at its March open meeting, according to a tentative agenda released Thursday by Chairman Ajit Pai. As part of a pilot project to improve the FCC's transparency, Pai released the text of all six items that will be considered at the March 23 meeting. Included in that agenda is a notice of proposed rulemaking that would allow phone service providers to block calls from "spoofed" numbers, which disguise the source of certain robocalls. "The American people have long made it clear -- and industry, consumer groups, and government are unified behind them -- that they want unwanted robocalls to stop," Pai wrote in a blog post on Medium. "This month, we'll hopefully take an important step toward combating this scourge."

The three bills being pushed by the minority members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee would require the FCC to adopt rules to protect communications networks, set up an interagency panel to handle cybersecurity investigations and require Internet of Things devices to have certified cybersecurity standards. "Our networks and devices are the hub of our digital lives," Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.), the committee's top Democrat, said in a statement.

Amazon's S3 cloud hosting service -- and the large swath of websites and apps run off the S3 platform -- were hobbled Wednesday, leading to consternation across the internet. The site explained the outage in a Thursday statement as the result of an employee trying to fix a billing server that had slowed. "Unfortunately, one of the inputs to the command was entered incorrectly and a larger set of servers was removed than intended," said Amazon.

Rosenworcel previously served on the Commission from 2012 to 2017. She stepped down in January after lawmakers failed to reach a deal on reconfirming her.

The FCC is led by a chair and four commissioners, two from each party. Some speculated that Rosenworcel could be paired with a Republican nominee. Democrats at the time accused Senate GOP leaders of reneging on a deal to fill the FCC's two current vacancies. The nomination was officially withdrawn on Feb 28th. The decision comes as the Trump administration has pulled back a number of nominees to regulatory commissions and agencies.   Not over yet?: Despite the withdrawal, several sources told The Hill that Senate Minority Leader Charles SchumerCharles SchumerSchumer promises Dems will try to defeat 'Trumpcare' Conway: Dems want 'to stop everything' Trump is trying to do Week ahead: Pressure builds for special prosecutor | House looks at cyber help for small businesses MORE (D-N.Y.) still has his heart set on getting Rosenworcel back on the FCC and will continue to push for her renomination and subsequent confirmation.

Featured Story Malaysia Plans to Increase LPG Imports from Iran: Official TEHRAN (Tasnim) - Wiratmaja Puja, Indonesia's Director General of Oil and Gas at the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry, said Jakarta plans to increase liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) imports from Iran. "We wish to add the amount of imported LPG from Iran at a discounted price, if possible," Wiratmaja said as cited by Tempo news website on Monday. He added that the Indonesian government is seeking to double its import volume from 500,000 tons to 1 million tons of LPG for domestic needs. Back in December, Indonesia's Pertamina Spokeswoman Wianda Pusponegoro said the energy company is expected to sign an agreement to import Iranian liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in 2017. Pertamina plans to import up to 12 cargoes, each of which contains 44,000 tons of gas, in 2017, she added.

By Gary Jones / Published 5th March 2017 GOOGLE The Google Pixel 2 will be released in 2017, facing the Samsung Galaxy S8 The Google Pixel 2 is currently being worked on as the next Google Phone to launch in 2017. That’s according to the company’s SVP of hardware, Rick Osterloh, who revealed the big news during a press event at Mobile World Congress earlier this week. The company is set to reveal the Google Pixel 2 later this year and will remain a “premium” device. “There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it,” Osterloh commented. “You can count on a successor this year, even if you don’t hear a date from me now.” Rumours of the Google Pixel 2 first emerged earlier this year, with the device expected to feature a number of hardware improvements on the first-generation device. Samsung Galaxy S8 - Leaked photos and concept images REVEALED Tuesday, 17th January 2017 SAMSUNG'S Galaxy S8 looks set to be unveiled in April and here's how it could look. 1 / 15 PH Samsung Galaxy S8 in pictures This will include a more powerful processor, as well as more memory and storage. It’s rumored that Google is carrying out several tests at the moment with different processors, including the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon chips and specialised Intel hardware. Despite the latest update, Google is set to feature renewed smartphone competition in the coming weeks, with the Samsung Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8 both set to launch in the not too distant future. The Samsung Galaxy S8 release date is still weeks away, but now a major new leak has revealed everything you could want to know about the new phone. Having already been the subject of multiple leaks and countless rumours, the entire Galaxy S8 specs sheet has now emerged online. Revealing all the inner workings of the upcoming iPhone rival, the leaked specs sheets has confirmed the eagerly awaited handset is going to be something truly special. Related Articles Major Samsung Galaxy S8 leak reveals phone's entire specs sheet and it's amazing Google Chrome Warning - This serious scam could put your online activity at risk BlackBerry KEYone launched - Iconic smartphone maker is back with shock iPhone 7 rival Surfaced via tech blog TechnoBuffalo, the comprehensive Galaxy S8 leak also shows how similar the phone will be to the Galaxy S8+, with the larger phone having seen its full features list emerge earlier this week. Kicking things off with the screen, the S8 looks set to be a visual delight with a 5.8-inch QHD panel set to boast a stunning 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution. This panel will curve around both the phone's left and right hand edges and will be squeezed in to a phone with near identical dimensions to last year's 5.1-inch Galaxy S7 thanks to a new edge-to-edge design made possible by killing off the physical home button on the phone's lower front edge. Elsewhere the phone, which like its predecessor will be water and dust resistant, will play host to a 12MP dual pixel primary camera and a new 8-megapixel selfie shooter that'll be enhanced by its own integrated flash. That's not all the front camera will be capable of, either. Partnered with a new iris scanner, the phone will be capable of being unlocked just by looking at it, with the camera helping read the unique pattern within your eye.

Balana, Julie Alipala - @inquirerdotnet @Team_Inquirer / 12:30 AM March 05, 2017 In this undated image made from militant video and released by SITE Intel Group on Feb. 24, 2017, shows German hostage Jurgen Gustav Kantner at an undisclosed location. Abu Sayyaf extremists in the Philippines have released a video of the beheading of Kantner. The brief video circulated Monday, Feb. 27, by the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors jihadi websites, is the first sign that the brutal militants proceeded with their threat to kill Kantner in the southern Philippines after a Sunday ransom deadline lapsed. (SITE Intel Group via AP) Updated: 12:54 a.m., March 5, 2017 ZAMBOANGA CITY – Government security forces on Saturday had recovered the remains of beheaded German hostage Jurgen Kantner in Indanan, Sulu. Col. Cirilito Sobejana, commander of the Joint Task Force Sulu, said soldiers were conducting search and retrieval operation when they found Kantner’s body and severed head in Sitio Talibang in Barangay Buanza around 5:45 p.m. ADVERTISEMENT Professor Octavio Dinampo, who was once also kidnapped, said Kantner’s remains were recovered “between the vicinity of the camps of two leaders of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF).” He said the two camps belonged to Nur Misuari in Sitio Bacud in Kagay village and that of Lupa Sug State Revolutionary Command chair Khaid Adjibon in Sitio Talibang. The distance between the MNLF camps is about half a kilometer. Sobejana said Kantner’s remains would be kept at the morgue of the Kuta Heneral Teodulo Bautista Hospital Morgue while documentary requirements were being completed before to transport to Manila. Kantner’s remains will then be sent home to Germany, he said. Meanwhile, Sobejana said members of the Scene of the Crime Operatives (SOCO) in Sulu were requested to conduct site preservation for evidence gathering and post mortem procedures. Kanter was abducted by members of the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) from his yacht, the Rockall, in waters off the southern Philippines last year. The vessel was found drifting last Nov. 7, with the body of Kantner’s female companion, Sabine Merz, inside. The couple had previously been kidnapped and held for 52 days in Somalia in 2008. The Armed Forces of the Philippines said that the ASG, tagged as a terrorist organization by the Philippines and the US, still has 31 hostages – 12 Vietnamese, seven Indonesians, six Filipinos, five Malaysians, and one Dutch.  /atm RELATED STORIES Abus show beheading of German German hostage last words: ‘Now he kill me’ German hostage beheaded by Abu Sayyaf – SITE Intel group play_circle_filled Duterte to CA: Allow Gina Lopez to present her mining stance March 07, 2017 play_circle_filled Nationwide smoking ban to include indoor cigarette use, says Palace March 07, 2017 play_circle_filled Palace: There was a 'certain attempt' to influence Duterte financially March 07, 2017 play_circle_filled Palace: 'Madam Secretary' show should’ve used fictional US President instead March 07, 2017 TAGS: Abu Sayya hostage, Jurgen Kantner For feedback, complaints, or inquiries, contact us.

For trans people in tech, it’s complicated when the industry suddenly cares Posted Mar 4, 2017 by Taylor Hatmaker (@tayhatmaker) 0 SHARES Next Story Crunch Report | NBCUniversal Invests $500 Million in Snap When Yelp added a way for its trans and gender non-conforming users to find safe restrooms, it felt like a mixed blessing for a community that’s used to being ignored. Over time, Yelp’s feature will provide a robust database of public bathrooms — the kind the transgender community has been building for itself for years. While just about everyone can agree that having restroom info right on Yelp’s massive legacy local business platform is a good thing, it does bring some tensions to the surface for the transgender tech community. From North Carolina’s HB2 to the upcoming Gavin Grimm case, the issue of transgender rights does appear to be reaching a tipping point in the tech community. The big question: What took so long? In an atmosphere of intense political polarization around the issue, figuring out a low-stress restroom contingency plan in public places can be a total nightmare for trans people. Naturally, most people outside of the trans community have no idea how much fear and stress can go into something as simple as meeting a friend for a beer or two after work. Now, that conversation — and the larger accompanying question of equal access — comes up on the national stage in the way that marriage equality did a few years prior. Yelp makes a statement For a company like Yelp, building bathroom data into a platform that already tracks things like Wi-Fi, bike parking and kid-friendliness wasn’t that difficult. Still, it did require dedicated resources, pulling as many as a dozen people off of their existing tasks, ratcheting up the priority level and getting it done. Last week, news of the upcoming Supreme Court case of transgender student Gavin Grimm set Yelp’s wheels in motion. It set out to demonstrate its commitment to transgender rights beyond just signing onto tech’s “friend of the court” brief with 53 other companies. Yelp’s new restroom tool announcement was originally timed for the same day as the brief, but after the brief was released a day early, the restroom feature news stood alone a bit more than intended. “Given the attention this issue is receiving on a legislative level, the choice to build this resource into the fabric of our platform really does — and has — opened up Yelp to a lot of criticism from those on the other side of the transgender rights issue,” a Yelp spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We made a lot of conscious choices along the way that others would view as incredibly risky, and they may well be, but from our perspective, accepting those risks to get this done actually defines how genuine this effort is.” Trans rights in tech’s rocky landscape Talking to trans people who’ve waited for this day to come, it’s clear that casting aside skepticism can be a challenge. For Teagan, a software developer who founded Refuge Restrooms, a crowdsourced database of safe bathroom info, it mostly boils down to one question. “How committed are they actually to this stuff?” She cites a litany of diversity and inclusion controversies in tech as the foundation for that cynicism, including Github’s Julie Ann Horvath and Yelp’s own Talia Jane. “I mean honestly… I want the information to exist. I’m glad they are doing it. I don’t think it was done to specifically target Refuge [Restrooms]. But yeah, they feel like a mainstream tech corp took a feature worked on by and for trans folks. A feature and app that was made specifically because Yelp & Foursquare didn’t have anything like this.” Teagan described how members of the Refuge team were caught off guard by the wave of mainstream publicity around Yelp’s news. As a trans person in tech, seeing major companies take up the banner of transgender rights can feel bittersweet if not downright disorienting. As Teagan observes, “Yelp had a PokeStop filter before they had a gender neutral bathroom filter. So you know?” One former Intel software engineer who spoke with TechCrunch is heartened by trans issues coming to the fore in tech, but he has plenty of reservations. As a trans guy, he stays in the loop about the experience of other transgender employees at Intel, where things are still hit or miss. “A [trans woman] that came out while on the job has been gushing about how great her experience is, meanwhile a trans friend of mine who was stealth at Intel is afraid to come out because of his transphobic team members.” For long-time industry workers like him, tech’s sudden interest seems a bit out of left field. “The amicus brief feels like ‘huh?’ to me… Like, I didn’t know these companies cared? Which does make me wonder. It’s easy to sign onto a thing, less easy to do things like provide training to teams to help gender transition, provide insurance that covers trans healthcare and allowing trans folks to take leave to deal with surgery.” Show them the money In talking to advocates for the transgender community, one piece of advice comes up again and again: Pay trans people. “Partner with them, or support them financially, or work out a licensing deal,” suggests Brook Shelley, Senior Developer Relations Engineer at Turbine Labs and co-chair for Basic Rights Oregon. “Marginalized folks are doing this work, and they need the financial and personal support that a company can bring, because ‘thanks!’ doesn’t pay the rent.” At the very least, for companies willing to listen, growing pains around how to best serve the trans community will make for a rich learning opportunity. For its part, Yelp seemed to be open to hearing criticism around implementing the trans-friendly feature. The company consulted with its LGBTQ group OUTburst — “The gravity that centers [Yelp’s] efforts and priorities on any LGBTQ-related initiative” — and transgender engineers and other trans team members during the process, as well as coordinating with the Human Rights Campaign for how to contextualize the new feature. Reaching the inflection point In response to the Yelp news, Kristin Russo, the co-founder of OUR Restroom, looks forward to leveraging the platform’s new feature to put the heat on business owners who don’t see her mission to “[help] businesses understand the importance of unisex single-stall restrooms” as a priority. “A company like Yelp holds a giant sway for so many businesses,” Russo explained to TechCrunch. “I think it will help us enormously to be able to say things like ‘Hey, we do this work and can help you change your signs, and did you also know that gender neutral restrooms is now a search filter on Yelp?'” As a cisgender ally who works on many LGBTQ projects, Russo doesn’t believe that it’s too little too late, but she understands why many trans people are frustrated with the pace of progress. “Would it have been great to have more companies fighting for this years ago? Sure. However I think that it does often take a certain kind of critical mass to get these kinds of decisions on the desks of the people who make big changes in the ways their business operates, so I’m just happy that we are reaching that place.” If mainstream support will actually move the needle remains to be seen, but with 2017 shaping up to be a landmark year for trans rights, tech companies wishing to champion them will have plenty of chances.

Terry McConnell More from Terry McConnell Published on: March 4, 2017 | Last Updated: March 4, 2017 6:00 AM MST Demonstrators, including Michaela Danek, center, and Carmen Gonzalez, right, shout slogans during a protest against President Donald Trump's efforts to crack down on immigration Thursday, Feb. 16, 2017, in San Francisco. Immigrants around the country have been staying home from work and school today, hoping to demonstrate their importance to America's economy and its way of life. Marcio Jose Sanchez / AP Share Adjust Comment Print A lot of Californians are mad as hell. Some even say they’re not going to take it anymore. “It” is the result of November’s presidential election. What these Californians are doing is organizing a secessionist movement — as in, taking California out of the United States. Their movement is called Calexit, as in Brexit. Their inspiration is the growing gulf that separates them — politically, culturally, demographically — from the rest of the union. Hillary Clinton outpolled Donald Trump by a two-to-one margin here. “Without California, Trump would have won the popular vote,” tweeted conservative pundit and Trump critic David Frum. The Golden State has a population of 39 million people, more than any other state in the union, and more people than in all of Canada. Metro Los Angeles alone is home to close to 19 million, a total greater than Ontario and Alberta combined. As Frum points out, those are numbers that come with economic clout, and therein lies the rub for many Californians. The U.S. without California, he writes, would be the world’s second-ranked technology power instead of the first. California boasts the world’s sixth largest economy, greater than France, Italy, South Korea and India. It’s also a global technological giant, home to Silicon Valley and companies like Google, Apple, Cisco, Intel, Oracle, and SpaceX. California is also culturally distinct from much of the rest of the U.S. It’s synonymous with liberal causes, from environmental protection to gun control to health care, and that has other Americans judging Californians, and not in a flattering way. It’s a reality not lost on Marcus Ruiz Evans, one of the movers and shakers behind Calexit. “California,” he admitted to the Washington Post, “(is) seen as weird.” That weirdness extends to politics beyond the presidential variety. Governor Jerry Brown has vowed to ensure Californians have health insurance coverage, offered through the state-run health exchange called Covered California, even if Trump Republicans repeal ObamaCare. But where the state most hears a different drummer is on immigration. Californians are decidedly in favour of it, and it’s easy to see why. California has the largest immigrant population in the union, approximately 10 million in total, a quarter of those undocumented. If you’re not an immigrant in California, you know one. Or two. Or more. In response to Trump’s ambitions to engage in large-scale deportation of illegal immigrants, the state legislature is considering a bill that would declare the state a “sanctuary.” Lawmakers have even hired former Obama attorney general Eric Holder to battle the Trump administration on the issue. That step earned the enmity of the new president. “Trump claims California is ‘out of control,’ ” writes columnist George Skelton in the Los Angeles Times, though the irony is undoubtedly lost on the president. Trump has threatened to cut off federal funds to California. “We’ll defund,” Trump told Fox News. “We give tremendous amounts of money to California.” The problem is that, like residents of Canada’s “have” provinces, Californians contribute more money to the federal treasury than what comes back. There has been much grousing about the Trump administration ever since the threats were levelled, fertile ground for Calexit. The secessionists even have the support of Silicon Valley billionaires Peter Thiel and Shervin Pishevar. Companies like Google have expressed concern about their ability in an anti-immigrant climate to recruit foreigners for jobs not enough Americans are qualified to fill. In January, the group Yes California was given permission to circulate a petition with the intention of putting the sovereignty question on the 2018 ballot. If the petition is successful — close to 600,000 signatures are required — a special vote to decide the state’s future would follow in 2019.  Calexit does have its skeptics. “Canadians know you don’t escape the shadow of your giant neighbour by drawing a border,” wrote Prof. Timothy William Waters in the Los Angeles Times. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said he believes secession is a bad idea. Such opinions are far from universal. According to a new Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll taken in California, one-third of respondents support “peaceful withdrawal from the union.” As one tweeter wrote: “We’ll just take our avocados and legal weed and go.” Terry McConnell is a former Journal columnist, editorial writer and copy editor now living in California Saturday's letters: Protect species at risk Dan Barnes: Tone set, statements made, points milked as Oilers kick...

Hammond Jim Miles Paul Craig Roberts David Swanson Select Page Economic Impact of Trump Immigration Policies on Chinese By Antonio Graceffo | Mar 3, 2017 | News & Analysis, Politics, US | 1 | Donald Trump speaking at CPAC 2011 in Washington, D.C. (Gage Skidmore/CC BY-SA 2.0) Three groups of Chinese are facing very different forms of US immigration and possible changes under the new administration. One of Trump’s main campaign promises was to radically restrict immigration. At the time many pundits and commentators dismissed this as campaign rhetoric. However, it seems that this is one promise that Trump intends to make good on. The Trump administration has already attempted to ban immigration from seven Muslim countries, and DW has now reported that he has targeted over 11 million undocumented immigrants for forced deportation. The H1B visa for highly skilled workers may be overhauled or even abolished. According to Max Bearak of the Washington Post, Trump feels that the programs brings cheap labor and is open to “widespread abuse”. The H1B visas are widely used by the IT, engineering, and other high tech industries in order to attract foreign talent to work in US firms. Paige Tanner of The Market Realist reported that US companies such as Apple, Google, and Intel (INTC) would be hardest hit, as between 17% and 38% of the work force at American technology firms is Asian. Chinese graduates hoping to go to the US under this program may no longer be able to. Additionally, economists believe that losing all of those skilled workers will have a negative impact on the US and take away the US competitive edge in the technology sector. While ending the H1B visa may have some impact on the economy, the Chinese English language news outlet Juwai reports that the visa with the most direct impact is the EB-5 investment visa, which is favored by the Chinese. Juwai explains that under this program foreigners investing $1 million or as little as $500,000 in an economically depressed area and creating 10 or more full-time jobs can remain in the US with a Green Card. This visa has been a major source of funding for various construction projects, such as Brooklyn’s Atlantic Yards, as well a small North Dakota factory that makes biodegradable food containers. According to The Guardian reporters Sam Thielman and Mona Chalabi, Trump’s new tower in Jersey City known as Trump Bay street, as well as a project led by President Trump’s son-in-law have received considerable financing through the program. They estimate that approximately $50 million of the Bay Street funding has come from ChineseEB-5 visa holders. Forbes Magazine estimated that the EB-5 visa has been responsible for $8.7 billion worth of investment in the US since 2012. Forbes Magazine reports that over 90% of Eb-5 applicants are Chinese. The real estate news source The Real Deal implied that demand for the visa usually goes up when the Chinese economy turns south, as investors are keen to get their money out of China and into dollars. According to CNN Money, the program is so popular among Chinese that in the government actually ran out of EB-5 visas in 2014. This surge in demand came in spite of increased regulations regarding financial disclosure. With Trump’s tightening of immigration laws, many investors are wary about investing in the US until they know whether the EB-5 will remain in place. As buying property is one of the quickest and easiest ways to invest a million dollars in the US, restrictions on the EB-5 visa could negatively impact the US real-estate market. Forbes Magazine’s Kenneth Rapoza reported that Trump opponents speculate that while the president may order mass deportations of undocumented immigrants and crackdown on the H1B visas, he will not restrict the EB-5 visa because the program provides much needed investment capital, which helps the US economy. Forbes journalist Ellen Sheng reported that the EB-5 program may soon be altered. In early January, the Department of Homeland Security suggested increasing the investment minimum to $1.35 million. The program will be up for renewal on April 28, 2017, and as of now, it remains unclear if the investment limits will be increased or if the program will be renewed at all. While debate rages in the US about illegal aliens, foreign H1visa experts and Chinese EB-5 investor visas, the US edition of the China Daily reports that one of the fastest growing Chinese demographics in the US is Chinese pensioners. The Chinese government has even made it easier for these people to collect their Chinese pensions while living abroad. Adam Hartung of Forbes Magazine felt that not enough attention was being paid to this group who will add to an already ageing US population and potentially become a burden on the US social system. Hartung stated that under customary visa conditions, people lacking the ability to work would not be admitted into the country and that accepting this many elderly could be a disaster economically. In short, three groups of Chinese are facing very different forms of US immigration and possible changes under the new administration. Chinese foreign experts in the IT industry are afraid of losing their visa privileges. In contrast, EB-5 visa holders are probably protected by Donald Trump because of his own personal interest in the real-estate industry, and the US receiving investment dollars in general, but the privilege of coming to the US may wind up increasing in price dramatically. The final group, Chinese pensioners are quietly increasing in number and could become a further drain on US social security which is already threatened by America’s own ageing crisis.

Matt Hoffman reports. Buzz60 Pedestrians walk through Red Square on March 3, 2017 in Moscow, Russia. (Photo: Spencer Platt, Getty Images) 1039 CONNECTTWEET 2 LINKEDIN 209 COMMENTEMAILMORE MOSCOW — Russian politicians enamored with President Trump's talk of improved relations with Moscow last fall are already disillusioned that he's reversed course because of investigations into Russian meddling in the U.S. election. Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said he was surprised Trump started “receding” from his earlier pro-Russian rhetoric about closer cooperation. “Even in the way he talks you can now hear notes of Obama,” he said. “And you can hear in his address (to Congress Tuesday): the military budget will be increased by over $50 billion.” “We have to hope for the best, but prepare for the worst,” Sergei Mironov, head of the Just Russia party told a parliamentary round table on foreign policy this week.  “The sooner Trump understands that world history is governed by laws and not business schemes, that there are values that are not measured in dollars, the better for Russian-American relations.” Their disappointment follows a tougher line on Russia from Trump’s White House. Last month, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump expected Russia to return Crimea, which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014. That is at odds with comments Trump made during the campaign, when he suggested Russia should keep Crimea and that U.S. sanctions imposed after its seizure be lifted. The Kremlin rejected any intention of returning Crimea. Shortly after, state-run media suddenly stopped its pro-Trump coverage. CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share According to Bloomberg, the media in Russia are covering President Trump too much. Veuer's Nick Cardona (@nickcardona93) has the story. Buzz60 In the United States, anti-Russian sentiment has been growing in Congress over intelligence allegations that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered cyberattacks aimed at helping elect Trump, charges both the Kremlin and Trump deny. Still, the FBI is investigating contacts between Russians and Trump officials before and after the election, and the scandal already has forced Trump to fire his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, over contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak. The allegations prompted Trump to acknowledge at a news conference last month that he probably can't do business with Russia now because of the political climate. Some Russians are skeptical of a Kremlin plot to elect Trump. "Whatever silly thing the president does raises the possibility of a Russia connection," said Alina Lobzina, a freelance news producer, who urged Americans to stop blaming Russia. "Seriously, from across the ocean it looks like a House of Cards episode, and not the best one." Breaking with his earlier praise of Russia and Putin, Trump did not mention either in Tuesday night's speech to Congress. “There was an atmosphere of positive expectations” in the Kremlin, said Konstantin von Eggert, a political commentator with Russia’s independent Dozhd TV station. Now the relationship between the two countries is "toxic," he said. "The Kremlin is realizing that maybe the best outcome would be to maintain the current level of tensions between Russia and America rather than having something worse,” he said. READ MORE: Russia: Furor over Sessions meetings with ambassador 'a witch hunt’ Exclusive: Two other Trump advisers also spoke with Russian envoy during GOP convention Trump team issued at least 20 denials of contacts with Russia Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak leaves trail of U.S. election meddling The latest sign of U.S. tensions about Russia came Thursday, when Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the election-meddling probe because he had met with the Russian ambassador twice last year, when he was a senator and Trump campaign adviser, but failed to disclose at his confirmation hearing when asked about contacts with Russians. Sessions said the meetings were innocuous and the election never came up. Putin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Friday that he agreed with Trump that the examination of innocent contacts with Russia amounted to a “witch hunt.” Peskov said on Wednesday that he saw nothing wrong with Trump’s failure to mention Russia in his hour-long address to Congress. “We have patience. We will wait until Trump’s statements are backed up by some action that will allow us to understand what we can expect in terms of bilateral Russian-American relations,” he said. Alexei Makarkin, deputy head of the Center for Political Technologies, said Russian officials' expectations about Trump are becoming more realistic. “There was a sense in the beginning that Trump is our kind of guy, that he will come in and solve everything," he said. "But these sentiments did not take into account the nature of the American political system and the character of the new president, who really does not intend to be Russia’s ally." "Everything will depend on whether they are able to reach an agreement on specific issues, like Ukraine or Syria."

He is best-known for taking computer firm Compaq Asia Pacific from a US$30 million dollar company to US$1 billion. He did this as Vice President and Managing Director in seven years, between 1989 and 1996, three years ahead of schedule. Over the years, besides being a CEO, technopreneur and private investor across industries like IT, air transport and education, he has been active in public and community service in organisations like the National Family Council, and the Halogen Foundation, which mentors young leaders and entrepreneurs. Lim is currently the Founder and Managing Director of PLAN-B ICAG Pte Ltd, a boutique corporate advisory firm, and has made it his mission to turn other businesses around through restructuring, acceleration, mentorship, and technology incubation. He went On the Record with Bharati Jagdish about what he thinks is wrong with the macro-economy, what is needed to help SMEs in Singapore and how he pulled off his first big success.   Lim Soon Hock: Ekhard Pfieffer, the then-President and CEO of Compaq was a great influence. He taught me a very valuable principle - that if you believe something is impossible, you will never get it done; but if you believe something is possible, the impossible becomes possible. After I signed on to the Compaq job, I have to confess, I had a lot of trepidation because Compaq at that time was one of the most expensive PCs and I had to sell it in one of the world's most difficult markets - Asia. Asia was price-sensitive and had low purchasing power then. He gave me this challenge saying: “Lim Soon Hock, I have only one goal for you. In 10 years' time, that is, in 1999, this has to be a billion USD company.” I said I would try. I signed the employment contract in spite of the fear I had. But he was proven right, that even if you have supposedly insurmountable odds in the market, if you are willing to be creative, innovative, establish new rules in the playing field, you can succeed. That is exactly what I did.   Bharati: What do you think was the key to making that happen?   Lim: I cannot claim all the credit. I had a fantastic team. It was an A-team. I didn’t expect to transplant everything that worked in the US or in Europe into Asia. You’ve got to find your own strategies and you’ve got to find your own tactics to develop and grow the business. At the time I was recruited, China was already starting to open up. Every company in the US was looking at China because it had huge potential. I struggled developing the business. Struggled. Out of the whole Asia Pacific region, this was the market I had most difficulty in developing the numbers.   China was only just opening up. They were poor. Compaq machines were the most expensive. Where to find the money? No clients wanted to buy. I was struggling, but I was able to seize what I called the opportunity of the moment. The day before my trip to Beijing, there was a big article in the local newspaper about the political leadership. I realised that something like 80 per cent of the political leadership was actually from Tsinghua University.   The day after that I was driving past Tsinghua University, and I got an idea. I asked my colleague in China to arrange a meeting for me to meet the president of the university because I wanted to understand what they were doing in terms of promoting PC technology, and encouraging PC adoption. He managed to arrange a meeting and I saw him the following day. I had lunch with him and took a tour around the campus. We passed by a few empty rooms in the building. The lights were switched off and they were run-down. So I spoke to him in the office, seizing the opportunity. I proposed a training centre be set up, a joint venture between Compaq and Tsinghua University. I would provide all the equipment. I would provide all the training to three professors. I would bring in Microsoft. I would bring in Intel. I didn't even clear with my boss that I was going to set up a joint venture, but it was the moment and I didn't want to miss it. I wanted to seize it.   The university president was so delighted. For him, it was great political credit to be able to go into something jointly with a very successful US company. The rest was history. We started the training centre and the whole of China covered the event. It was front-page news. My sales in the next six months went through the roof.   Bharati: How did people who couldn’t afford a PC before manage to buy one after this development?   Lim: They bought our machine. They bought our PC, but not so much because they wanted our machine. They wanted a PC, but because of the university partnership, they now had a larger purpose in buying our machines. By using and buying our machine, they would have the opportunity to be trained by the very prestigious Tsinghua University, to get a certificate, a joint certificate: Tsinghua-Compaq. The certificate was the incentive. That was the incentive, the value, the asset they were trying to purchase. At the same time, they got a good machine and possibly a good job after that. So they worked harder to afford it.   RELYING ON FOREIGN INVESTORS   Bharati: You’ve worked for several MNCs. What has your experience taught you about what’s wrong with the Singapore economy and local businesses and how these problems can be addressed better?   Lim: I think if you look at the success of our model today, the success is very much driven by foreign MNC investment. It is also driven by the fact that we have succeeded in promoting wealth management, financial management in Singapore, the services industry, telecoms, airports, ports, and of course the government-linked companies have a role to play. I think those we should continue to promote, those we should continue to keep, and grow.   But where I think we could have done better, is developing entrepreneurship in Singapore and also developing and growing our SMEs. We should have spent more time to grow more of the promising SMEs to be more successful. If you look at many economies, whether Taiwan, Korea, or the US, the entire economy is driven by a critical mass of large companies. We could have done this earlier. But it’s not too late. We do more now.   Bharati: The government has been doing it though. There are entrepreneurship schemes, schemes designed for SMEs in particular. What more would you like to see?   Lim: Yes, I acknowledge that there have been many initiatives. But at the core of it, we need to develop and build a more vibrant and sustainable culture of entrepreneurship, not just schemes; and people shouldn’t be too dependent on these schemes or handouts. We need to start with the schools. We need to get more of our young people exposed to entrepreneurship, and beyond entrepreneurship, a larger objective of developing an entrepreneurial mindset. And I think that's important.   We can intensify our efforts, we can strengthen it, we can solidify it, we can deepen it. Help people develop the ability and willingness to take risks, the ability to see the opportunities out there, the ability to set new rules, to play in blue oceans, create blue oceans where you can succeed and the aggressiveness to not want to succeed just in Singapore, but also globally.   Bharati: How exactly do you think this mindset and attitude can be cultivated?   Lim: Some schools are offering entrepreneurship education. Based on what I understand from the ministry, they basically left it to the schools to decide whether they want to embark on it. My view is that if we truly believe that entrepreneurship is going to be a very important pillar of our future economy, then I think we should introduce entrepreneur education nationwide. We should also make sure that entrepreneur education is not just an enrichment program, a 2-3 day kind of thing. It has to be a structured programme where students are put through the entire process, the entire journey, the entire cycle of developing a business. My view is that at the end of the day, Singapore has to depend on its own entrepreneurs and businessmen.   Bharati: Not foreign investors.   Lim: My biggest worry is that our fear of foreign investment hollowing out of Singapore is going to happen. I am hoping it won't. I hope I am wrong. Not that Singapore is politically unstable, not that Singapore is not economically attractive in terms of the right environment, incentives, economic support, talent pool etc., but I think China will be so big, so developed, so mature that foreign companies would have to be in China to compete with the Chinese to succeed worldwide.   I know the thinking of MNCs. They have to be in markets where there are going to make a big difference. I think soon there are going to be so many big Chinese companies that are global in orientation, global in terms of reach, doing their own business; but I think you are going to see a lot of foreign companies here moving to China. I think we’ve got to be aware of that, because if that happens who are we going to depend on?   We are going to depend on our own local companies to provide the jobs, to generate GDP. We have no choice.   I hope I am wrong, I just worry about it. Hopefully we can have more SMEs become bigger local companies to create more jobs. What we need as a country Is a critical mass of large local companies, not just large local banks, not just the large GLCs, but we want more clones of companies like Hyflux, OSIM, and previously Creative. You can count the number of companies. They are not enough.   Don't get me wrong. I am not saying the government is not doing enough. The government is doing a lot, but what I am trying to say is that we need to do something revolutionary, not evolutionary.  I feel the revolutionary way is to introduce entrepreneur education in schools for everyone. Not from Primary 1, but the moment they get into secondary school. Maybe Secondary 3 onwards and again, not just entrepreneurial skills, but the entrepreneurial mindset.   CULTIVATING THE ENTREPRENEURIAL MINDSET   Bharati: This mindset, you mentioned earlier, comprises the ability and willingness to take risks, the ability to see opportunities, the ability to set new rules. How do you really teach such things? People need to be exposed to such things from a young age and not just in school but in every aspect of their lives, don’t they?    Lim: Yes, to also know that it's not about all success, you must also have strength and resilience to take failure. When I try to market this idea to government, I tell them that it should be a non-examinable subject. No exam. Why would you want to have exams?   In real life, when you set up a business, you can either fail or you can succeed, but it doesn't say anything about you.   It just means wrong business, wrong choice, execution, but valuable lessons to learn. In Silicon Valley right now, the badge of honor is failure. So between two companies, all things being equal, investors are going to invest in a guy who has failed before and picked himself up or wants to learn and pick himself up. If the political leadership here truly believes in entrepreneurship, then they must put their money where their mouth is and invest in our youth nationwide.   I have been invited to be a judge in many business plan competitions. Invariably, the presentations are very well done - beautiful slides, plenty of text, plenty of pictures. But when I ask them the basic question: “Can you tell me in no more than 2-3 sentences, what business you are in,” many stumble.   If you don't have a clear understanding of what business you are in, how are you going to move forward? What problem are you trying to solve for your customers? You need to know these basics.   Bharati: You mentioned entrepreneurship education. My concern is that the approach to the other aspects of education within our system or the way parents condition their kids could negate the building of an entrepreneurial mindset.   Lim: I hope not. I think the recent move by the government to focus on skills and experience and expertise, rather than just academic education, to de-emphasise academic achievement or academic excellence is the way to go. Ideally, if we can have both, great.   But not everybody is academically brilliant. I think what we need is someone who is academically well-informed, academically well-developed. That's all.   The rest is what I call the non-academic challenges that would take advantage of any special skill set you have, any special talent that you have, any special passion you have, any special interest that you have.   In my view, there is value in all these non-academic capabilities. So the SkillsFuture move, the direction to de-emphasise academic qualifications, and also to look at passions, interests, excellence in non-academic areas, in lieu of academic qualifications, to secure a job, to secure a government position, to start a business, I think, is the right way to go.   Tongue-in-cheek, I told a minister once, that actually Singapore would have arrived, if our next PM is not somebody from the elite admin service, but completely an ordinary person with special skills. Perhaps he could have been a great painter. He could have been a successful businessman. He could have been a successful sportsman.   Bharati: Why do you believe in that?   Lim: It's not about me believing in that. It's about delivering the ultimate promise of this new focus on skills, experience alongside academic qualifications.   Bharati: What did this minister say to you in response?   Lim: He just smiled at me. Elsewhere in the world, President Reagan was an actor. I think he made a great president.   Bharati: Now, there’s Donald Trump, who is a businessman.   Lim: Well that's a separate story, but we should have done it much earlier, this focus on skills. It took us some time to realise that in the new digital economy, in the new shared economy, it's not all about academic qualifications. It’s about the ability to get things done, the ability to innovate, the ability to create and you don't have to be academically brilliant to be creative and innovative. I think it's good that the government is seeing that and the government is promoting that.   Bharati: How do you think this can change on the ground though?   Lim: That is the parents' problem and the employers’ problem.   Bharati: How do you think that mindset can be nudged into positive change?   Lim: I think government, businesses, both the private and people sector would have to embrace the new philosophy. The government is taking the lead. Some government agencies already have an alternative path created for people without relevant academic qualifications, with relevant skills and expertise they would be considered. I think that's good.   I think in Singapore, unfortunately, people are always looking towards the government as a role model. I think that must change too. I think it's also timely that the private sector take the lead. I wish more private companies were willing to take the lead, do what is right, and pull the rest of the community along.   ZERO GOVT GRANTS   Bharati: While you’ve worked for MNCs, you have been helping turnaround SMEs as well.  What would you say are the biggest obstacles for SMEs today even with the numerous government schemes that we’ve been seeing recently?   Lim: I think SMEs have to learn to be resilient and not too dependent on handouts from the government. I think if anything at all, the government has been too generous and too kind in providing the subsidies and grants.   Bharati: But businesses’ concerns are legitimate. Among other things, they have to contend with high rentals, labour costs and now, rising water and energy prices. Why shouldn’t businesses expect some assistance?   Lim: There is some merit in the complaints from businesses about high costs. There is no long-term viability or growth to talk about if companies cannot get through the short-term. That said, there are at least 10 initiatives from the budget, which companies can tap, to offset indirectly or to neutralise the increased costs.    But also, the issue of high business costs in Singapore has been around for many years now. Companies should have taken steps early to manage and overcome this. For example, if I have one dollar left, where should I deploy it to generate more than one dollar of revenue. In other words, companies should not continue to do more of the same, as the outcome would be predictable. If companies cannot contain or lower costs, then they should relocate to the region to enjoy the comparative advantage.   In the companies that I am involved in, we planned on the basis that there are no government subsidies or grants. It compels you to rethink how you would want to manage, develop and grow your business.   If I can, I do not want to be dependent on government handouts.   You’ve got to work on the basis that you get zero grants. You’ve got to work on the basis that you don't get funding from government. You need to find your own sources of funding. Where are the sources of funding?   First, you can do equity financing, so shareholders, investors, but that has to start with a good business proposition. Do a good job in generating revenue. If you can't really get the revenue that you want, you’ve got to make sure the quality of your business is good. The growth margin should be very good. How do you make sure growth margin is very good? You’ve got to manage the cost of goods. That's where companies need to have a strong focus. Go through it with a fine-toothed comb. Spend when needed and save when needed. To me it's not about saving the dollar. It's about how you spend the next dollar wisely to generate more than a dollar of revenue.   SMEs need to look at their business model. If I continue with the business model, doing more of the same, my outcome will be predictable, but if I intend to have extraordinary growth, stretch my target, do more than what I set out to do, I must think through what else I need to do differently. What else do you need to do unconventionally?   That, to me, is important, but let me tell you what the biggest problem is right now. I have always said that businesses do not fail, people do. It doesn't matter what business we are in. We are ultimately in the business of managing people. The biggest asset of a company is always the human capital. Build an A-team. Recruit good people, train and develop them and you will get your returns most times.   So companies in Singapore, for some unknown reason, are not that keen to invest in people development. The company does not always have to have the most amazing and best product, but if you execute well, chances are that the company can even do better than another company with the best product, the most amazing product, but poor execution.   So it is in businesses’ interests to invest in people. Do all this and use the government schemes for the added advantage, as a bonus.   Bharati: Speaking of government schemes unveiled in this year’s Budget, some critics say it's more of the same. Also, for instance, we’ve seen productivity enhancement schemes in the past and they don’t seem to have worked.  So critics have been saying that the government can unveil one scheme after another, but whether they are going to have a real impact, a better result, is questionable. What do you think?   Lim: To be fair, I think this time round, there is more meat in the Budget. I see Budget 2017 as more broad- based, but broad-based in a T -shape, with the deliberate stem and discernible stem to develop and grow SMEs more extensively and intensively.   There are about 10-12 schemes available that SMEs can tap, so it's really up to them to take advantage of it, but the key thing is that if you take a look at the other things that are there, they are not more of the same.   The Industry Transformation Maps (ITMs) are a big thing.   But again, it will remain as an idea if the execution is bad. The industry must play a part, government must play a part, businesses must play a part, the associations must play a big part. We are such a small country that you cannot cover things broadly.   You have to be targeted, identify what I call the low-hanging fruit, focus on them, develop it, and then pull the rest of the industries along. Then you take a look at the startups and SMEs, the Global Innovation Alliance, trying to link up companies with companies elsewhere to take advantage of capabilities elsewhere, technologies elsewhere. But like everything else, it's not about the plan, it's about the execution.   ENTREPRENEURIAL CIVIL SERVANTS   Bharati: And the people.   Lim: Yes, and this is where I would like to encourage and appeal to our government, meaning our civil servants who are managing some of these schemes to be more entrepreneurial in terms of their mindset too. You cannot on the one hand, try to encourage companies to be innovative, to be creative, to be more productive, but on the other hand, you are not seen to be that way yourself.   What do I mean by that? With all the funds that they have, they should be more generous in wanting to provide grants and subsidies in the right way for maximum effect.  That means being less risk-averse, and not being constrained by the fact that this is taxpayers’ money.   Bharati: But you just said that the government is being too generous already?   Lim: Yes, from the businesses standpoint, they really shouldn’t demand or expect more. But if the government wants to be revolutionary, it also should be willing to invest in the right way and bet on more companies with potential even if those companies end up failing in the end. It is a reality that out of 20 companies, usually only one succeeds. That is the investment success rate. One shouldn't be too afraid of this because the one that really succeeds is going to cover all your losses in the other 19 companies. You have to have more multiples of 20 companies that you invest in, take the risk and bet on. That is really what I think we need to do. So it's not about having all the initiatives, not just about trying to push and promote productivity. It’s got to be smart investments that cover more entities so that you can get more companies that truly become big.   Bharati: You said this means being less risk-averse, and not being constrained by the fact that this is taxpayers’ money. But surely government can’t spend taxpayers’ money willy-nilly. So how do you suggest this be done? You could rationalise it by saying that if you are less risk-averse, you might end up making more companies successful and that would power the Singapore economy.   Lim:  I don't think we need to rationalise it.   Bharati: Why not? It’s taxpayers’ money.   Lim: Yeah I agree. I think there is that moral obligation to ensure that it's being spent wisely. I am not suggesting you give up money haphazardly. I would to be the last to not agree with you that we have to be prudent. We have to exercise responsibility in managing it and offering grants and subsidies, but what I am saying is that it’s an accepted fact in the investment community that the success rate is 1 out of 20. Therefore we need to be realistic to try to support those multiples of 20 companies. You can’t tell SME startups to be risk-taking and bold but on the other hand, you continue to be…  Bharati: …rigid?   Lim: I won't say rigid. “Rigid” is not the word, but I think you can’t allow yourself to be overly-guided by the fact that this is taxpayer's money. Then, you end up not helping to bring into being larger numbers of strong local companies.  - CNA/rw Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Connect Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2017 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

Image Credit: Drew Tarvin/Flickr Google today enhanced its Google Cloud Platform (GCP) public cloud infrastructure offering with new virtual machine (VM) instances that boast up to 64 virtual central processing unit (CPU) cores, effectively providing more computing power for applications. They’re available now in beta for all users and projects out of Google’s data center zones that run Intel’s Haswell and Broadwell chips. There are three available flavors in the Google Compute Engine (GCE): a standard instance called n1-standard-64, a high-memory instance called n1-highmem-64, and an instance with high CPU-to-memory ratio called n1-highcpu-64. They’re all available from Google’s web-based Cloud Console and in the command-line interface (CLI) with the Google Cloud SDK. Google has been taking many steps to become more competitive with other public clouds. The biggest one, Amazon Web Services (AWS), does offer machines with 64 vCPUs. There are even 128 vCPU machines available from AWS. Currently, Microsoft Azure, the second biggest cloud, does not have machines with more than 32 vCPUs. Google followed AWS and Azure and introduced a key management service in January. People with free trials will need to ask for a quota increase in order to spin up one of the new instances — if you try to create one with a free trial, you’ll receive an error saying you’ve reached a limit of 24 CPUs. “We’ll improve the way quotas work in the near future so that it will be possible to create a 32-core instance for new, free trial users, a Google spokesperson told VentureBeat in an email. Google’s prowess in getting big customers for its cloud was proven last month, when Snap, the newly public company behind Snapchat, revealed that it had a $2 billion contract with the Google Cloud.

Gaming? If your looking at running 1440p (if gaming), i'd suggest a gtx1060 or gtx1070. Otherwise, solid build. Could save some $ by getting 16Gb ram instead of 32. Do you really need 32Gb? Could add AIO cooler instead of Noctua NH D14 - Kraken x61 is below $200 au. I believe NH D14 is close to $100 au, Kraken is a great cooler - I've got one and it keeps everything nice and cool in a hot climate - increased room for OCing too. Just a thought.     nateluthje View Public Profile Find all posts by nateluthje   (#3) Geryboy Maha Guru     Videocard: 1080 GameRock 2088/11000 Processor: i7 6700k 4.6GHz @ 1.29V Mainboard: MSI Z170A M7 Memory: RipjawsV 3G 2x8 GB Soundcard: SBZ->TV_Adap.3.0->OPN1 PSU: Seasonic SS-1250XM 03-03-2017, 08:25 | posts: 2,153 | Location: Munich wait for reviews on 350 boards and see how much oc they can cope with and how much RAM Frequency they can handle     Geryboy View Public Profile Find all posts by Geryboy   (#4) eclap Ancient Guru     Videocard: Zotac AMP! 980ti Processor: i5 2500k @4.5 1.2v Mainboard: Asus P8Z77-V Pro Memory: 16GB GSkill RipjawsX 1600 Soundcard: AuneT1/AD700/DT880/HD650 PSU: XFX Black 750W 80+ Gold 03-03-2017, 12:49 | posts: 31,206 | Location: Hampshire, UK I wouldn't bother with the 1700x, the 1700 is cheaper, lower TDP and apparently runs cooler.

I'll certainly wait for the reviews on the 1700 and the B350 board. At face value the 1700x seems to be the sweet spot as far as cost and out of the box performance, but the 1700 may change that. It is exciting to see something new. As far as the 32Gb of RAM, that is purely for future proofing. If I have the bones new system for as long as my current system, it will be worth the cost to me. I already have the 970 video card, and I don't see a huge benefit for changing it out to a 1060 or 1070, considering the performance of the cards and their cost. I'm interested in Vega and Nvidia's answer to Vega. Perhaps we will get a modern version of the 6800GS or 8800GTS 512. As far as the Noctua cooler, I'm reusing it from my existing machine, so all I have to buy is the AM4 adaptor kit. The Noctua D15 does out perform it, and I am sure other AIO coolers do as well, but again I am not sure if the performance is worth me replacing a perfectly fine aircooler.     ProfBP View Public Profile Find all posts by ProfBP   (#6) jura11 Maha Guru     Videocard: Titan X SC GTX 1080 FE EK Processor: i7-5820k 4.4GHz EKWB Mainboard: ASRock X99 Extreme 6 Memory: 6x16GB DDR4 2133MHz LPX Soundcard: AVID Mbox 2 PSU: Seasonic X1250W 03-04-2017, 02:23 | posts: 1,126 | Location: London Hi there As above 1700 I would choose and looks like I will be going as well with 1700 as seems these chips runs cooler and OC bit better from reports which I've saw 32GB should be OK and air cooler,NH-D14 or D15 should be probably best there and in yours case I would stay with NH-D14,you still can attach there extra fan,I would have look on TY-143 or TY-147A fans which are probably best fans which I've run on NH-D15 and they should good as well on yours NH-D14 AM4 mounting bracket,I would contact Noctua they should be able send you for free bracket if you are willing to wait Hope this helps Thanks,Jura     jura11 View Public Profile Find all posts by jura11 « Previous Thread | Next Thread » Thread Tools Show Printable Version Display Modes Linear Mode Switch to Hybrid Mode Switch to Threaded Mode Posting Rules You may not post new threads You may not post replies You may not post attachments You may not edit your posts BB code is On Smilies are On [IMG] code is On HTML code is Off Forum Rules Forum Jump User Control Panel Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home General Chat     The Guru's Pub     Folding@Home - Join Team Guru3D !     Frontpage news     Digital Photography, Home and Portable Electronics     Tablets and Smart Phones     The HTPC, HDTV & Ultra High Definition section Videocards     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce Drivers Section     Videocards - AMD Radeon     Videocards - AMD Radeon Catalyst Drivers Section     Videocards - 3dfx     Videocards vs General Purpose - NVIDIA Ageia PhysX, GPGPU etc.     3D Stereo Gaming Section     Benchmark Mayhem Hardware     General Hardware     Die-hard Overclocking & Case Modifications      Computer Monitor Forum     Soundcards, Speakers HiFI & File formats     SSD and HDD storage     Processors and motherboards AMD     Processors and motherboards Intel     Network questions and troubleshooting     Laptops & Notebooks Affiliates     Rivatuner Generic Discussion forum         RivaTuner Advanced Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Overclock Application Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Private Beta access     Guru of 3D Clan General     Games, Gaming & Game-demos     Game Tweaks and Modifications     Consoles & console games     Operating Systems     General Software and Applications     Hardware Reviews and News     Programming/Html     Links Powered by vBulletin® Copyright ©2000 - 2017, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd. vBulletin Skin developed by: vBStyles.com Copyright (c) 1995-2014, All Rights Reserved.

Review: Lenovo ThinkPad E570 Posted on 4-Mar-2017 12:08 by Bill Bennett | Filed under: Articles : Bill Bennett Lenovo serves up a mid-price, not-so-small business laptop. The ThinkPad E570 is so traditional it borders on retro. It will please laptop conservatives. If you need greater mobility, look elsewhere. Lenovo ThinkPad E570 at a glance: For: Configurable Latest processor Against: Heavy Large Build quality Maybe: No touch screen Removable battery Verdict: Mid-price large screen laptop. Will appeal to small business owners. Price: From NZ$1100. Review model NZ$1300. Website: Lenovo NZBy 2017 standards, the Lenovo ThinkPad E570 is bulky. The review model weighs 2.4Kg. It measures 376 by 262 by 34 mm at its widest, broadest and deepest. Part of the heft is because the case includes a large, bright 15.6-inch display and a DVD drive. There’s a lot of plastic around the edge of the screen. Indeed, there’s a lot of black plastic full stop. It’s chunky and robust which adds protection but you’ll need a backpack to move it. Another reason for the bulk is the battery and studs rise the base a few millimetres off a desktop. This gives breathing room so air can flow through vents. There’s also a heavy-duty fan vent on the left side of the case too. Rough in placesAn E at the start of a product number indicates the E570 is from the lower-price ThinkPad range. That means you get a lower quality finish than you’d find on more expensive models. It’s a little rough in places and the matt black plastic picks up smudges with a vengeance. The front of the lid doesn’t sit flush with the bottom part of the computer. This makes it easier to open. The hinge has a small amount of give, but nothing to trouble anyone. While the case is not pretty, it does look like Lenovo made the computer to do business. If you like the red and black ThinkPad look, you’ll be happy with the effect. Desktop replacementGiven size and weight, you won’t want to carry the E570 all the time. If portability is important get something else. It makes a fine desktop replacement that can travel at a pinch. A big case means there’s room for a full-size keyboard and numeric keys. The layout takes getting used to. A week or two of reviewing was not enough time to master the keyboard idiosyncrasies. Among other things, having two backspace and one delete key in the top right corner is strange. Also odd is the off centre touchpad and the small space bar. TouchPadBecause there’s no touchscreen, you’ll use the touchpad a lot. It’s small by 2017 standards. The little red signature ThinkPad cursor joystick is some compensation. In practice the touchpad is erratic, that could be a Windows 10 driver problem. If you owned this computer and used it often, trackpad aside, all these things, would be no trouble after a few weeks. The lack of a keyboard backlight is disappointing. As already mentioned, there is no touchscreen. The display is 1366 by 768 HD format. There is a FHD 1920 by 1080 model that, at the moment, costs $100 more than the review computer. It comes with a faster processor and a better video card, that’s a lot of extra value for $100. One minor worry about the display is that the default setting is 100 percent brilliance. While that’s fine, there’s nothing extra for when you need a boost. Video and everyday Windows apps work fine with the display. It’s not state-of-the-art, but its good considering the price tag. Kaby LakeThe review model has an Intel i5 7200U processor running at 2.5GHz. That’s a Kaby Lake chip or the seventh generation of Core processors. Intel says they are faster than last year’s processors, enough for users to notice. They are video optimised and should be more power efficient. Lenovo says you can get eight hours on a single charge. As always, the manufacturer’s claim is pushing it. In practice, it works for a little over six hours before power supply nagging starts. Battery life isn’t so vital in a computer that will sit on a desk most of the time. There’s a DVD drive, which feels anachronistic, but will please many users. There are three USB ports  again, that pleases some users not others. Lenovo also includes HDMI, Ethernet, a multi-format card reader and an audio jack. Old fashionedDespite a state-of-the-art processor, the ThinkPad E570 is, in many ways, old-fashioned. It’s been a long time since a review non-touch Windows PC with a hard drive instead of SSD has turned up here. The question is how the specification trade-offs work with value for money. The biggest downside is the quality of finish. You can find better-made computers at the same price, although they may not have the same mix of features. At first sight it looks as if Lenovo charges a premium for its 15.6 inch display. On a more positive note, you get a lot of processor performance for your money. It would be a good choice if you crunch numbers on a spreadsheet all day. It’s clear the $1400 top of the line model with a Core i7 processor, higher resolution screen and better graphics card is better value. This is a promotional price and may not be available for long. You might want to swap the 1TB hard drive for a 256GB SSD, that would add around $170 to the list price. Not everyone prizes slim and light over big screens, full keyboards and processor power. The Lenovo ThinkPad E570 isn’t for the kind of person who works from cafés or airport lounges. There are many who still want DVD drives. This will hit the spot for some demographics.

The software giant has been on a roll with great hardware lately, but Porsche Design's newly-anounced Book One takes a good idea one step further. If you think the Book One looks like a Surface Book, you're not alone. Like that machine, the Book One's screen can be detached from the keyboard for use as a tablet. On top of that, though, it also sports a cog-style hinge that brings the same 360° rotation offered by Lenovo's Yoga line and other convertible devices. The Book One sports more ports than its close cousin, too. You'll find two USB 3.0 Type-A ports, two USB 3.1 Type-C connectors, and one Thunderbolt port. For user input, there's a digital stylus that sticks magnetically to the side of the book, a backlit keyboard, and a Microsoft-certified Precision Touchpad. Inside, you'll find a Intel Core i7-7500U CPU with 3.5GHz turbo speed, alongside 16GB of RAM. The system's storage comes by way of an Intel 512GB SSD. While the Surface Book's screen has a non-standard 3:2 ratio with its 3000x2000 resolution, Porsche Design's system goes a bit more traditional, with a 13.3" screen sporting a 3200x1800 resolution in a 16:9 aspect ratio. There are no options for discrete graphics cards, though. The Book One will retail for $2,495 when it releases in April. That's not a bad number when compared to the closest Surface Book in price and specs. The Surface Book model that retails for $2,699 offers roughly the same specs, but with a Core i7-6600U CPU and a Nvidia 940M graphics card instead. The Book One may be the first offering from Porsche Design Computing, but it certainly looks enticing.     Tags: Mobile computing Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Junko Yoshida, Chief International Correspondent 3/3/2017 04:28 PM EST  0 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet At this year's Mobile World Congress, the industry's 5G conversation not only kept drifting back to 4G, but also quietly shifted from 5G's "Core Network" to "New Radio (NR)." Last year, the Mobile World Congress (MWC) was all about the promise of 5G networks. Vendors then talked about how 5G will be nothing like 4G — opening up a world of new possibilities for operators. As elements like software defined network and network function virtualization come to the core network, they promised operators should be able to provide many types of differentiated network service over the same infrastructure. The MWC last year painted a picture of 5G that was both exciting and a little frightening. A year later, at this week’s Mobile World Congress, the conversation on the show floor kept drifting back to 4G. Tech vendors discussed how the industry can still milk the LTE network for years to come. Simultaneously, in conversations about the 5G standard, the industry’s focus had quietly shifted from “core network” to “new radio.” I noticed this trend when I saw the announcement of “non-standalone 5G” — jointly issued by a group of carriers and tech companies — just a day before the MWC opened. Okay, I asked myself, “What just happened?” In the name of “5G acceleration,” companies including Ericsson, Huawei, ZTE, Qualcomm, Intel and a host of network operators including AT&T, Deutsche Telekom, KDDI, KT Corp., NTT Docomo, SK Telecom, Sprint, Vodafone and many more, have announced their support for “non-standalone” 5G new radio (NR). This new proposal will be proposed at the 3GPP Radio Access Network Plenary meeting scheduled next week in Dubrovnik, Croatia. But really, what on earth is “non-standalone” 5G? How is it different from 5G? Is this something like 4G on steroids? More important, how does this detour affect all the market’s stampede toward 5G? As Qualcomm’s CTO Matt Grob explained in a one-on-one interview with us, “non-standalone 5G” is about a 4G-based “set-up” mode for 5G. By introducing the concept of an “intermediate” step, operators will be able to use the existing LTE radio and evolve packet core network under a configuration called “non-standalone 5G NR.” This would allow the carriers to begin trials and deployments of 5G NR in 2019, rather than 2020. Meanwhile, they can add a new 5G radio access carrier to support 5G use cases from 2019 onwards. Calling the tune before the band disassembled Perhaps, most significant about the notion of “non-standalone 5G NR” is that this “solidifies” the schedule for the complete standard, including standalone 5G NR in Release 15, at a time when some 5G versions, from carriers like Verizon and Korea Telecom, are outpacing the competition. In short, the companies who support the non-standalone 5G are calling the tune before the band is assembled. They want the 3GPP to completing the 5G NR specs in the biggest possible hurry, lest the divide among pre-5G specifications grows even wider. In their joint announcement, they stated: “Based on the current 3GPP Release 15 timeline the earliest 5G NR deployments based on standard-compliant 5G NR infrastructure and devices will likely not be possible until 2020.” While praising Verizon as a “catalyst” for 5G acceleration, Qualcomm’s Grob shared his concerns during the interview with EE Times: “There is an open question: Will Verizon come back to the [3GPP 5G] standard [after having pursued their own version of 5G specs]?” We don’t know that answer. It’s unclear whether the invention of non-standalone 5G can put the genie back in the bottle. Meanwhile, during the MWC, evidence piled up that the mobile industry is not unanimously gung-ho about non-standalone 5G. And why not? Nokia CEO announced a new comprehensive 5G solution at the Mobile World Congress. The company, however, didn't join the industry group supporting "Non-Standalone 5G." For example, Nokia was conspicuously absent from the list of companies joining the non-standalone 5G club. Nokia never gave a straight answer to the repeated question during the company’s press briefing. But the Finnish company seems worried that accelerating the NR standard might not synch with the development of a 5G packet core that will enable key features, such as network slicing. Similarly dubious voices on the show floor pointed out that the players rushing to close down the 5G NR spec today are focusing exclusively on 5G use cases, based on what they know about current 4G applications.  Every time the mobile industry start developing a new radio standard, vendors and carriers tend to get busy with political jockeying and the new-standard hype machine goes into overdrive. Predictably, the media goes along, handwringing along the way. We’ve seen this again and again as the cellular standard went from 2G to 3G, 3G to 4G. Distinctly different from the past is that 5G isn’t just about developing a new radio spec in pursuit of faster speeds and bigger bandwidth. Obviously, the importance of stabilizing the 5G NR spec — sooner rather than later — is a big deal. But what about the rest of the stuff that goes along with the 5G core network? Where are we?

(AP) — The largest U.S. electric company says its annual shareholders meeting in May will be its first without a physical gathering, with all business conducted and questions answered only online. Duke Energy Corp. said Friday the live video webcast on May 4 will make the meeting accessible to 1 million shareholders worldwide. Dozens of companies including Hewlett-Packard and Intel have replaced in-person conclaves with virtual meetings. Advocates say they allow more shareholders to participate at lower cost. Critics say the format allows corporations to select the topics its executives want to address and scrub out tough questions. Duke Energy's shareholders meetings have long involved protests ranging from tea party groups to environmentalists. CEO Lynn Good faced tough questioning about a massive coal ash spill during the Charlotte utility's 2014 meeting. Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

(Photo: Jim Lo Scalzo, AP) 97 CONNECTTWEET 34 LINKEDIN 63 COMMENTEMAILMORE President Trump heaped new praise Friday on Canada's immigration system, which has served as a model for countries around the world because it focuses more on immigrants who can contribute to the economy than those with little more than family ties. Trump sent out a Tweet after apparently watching a segment on Fox & Friends that featured Nick Adams, a conservative author who the book Green Card Warrior: My Quest for Legal Immigration in an Illegals' System. During the segment, Adams spoke against "multi-culturalism" and immigrants who enter the country to "milk us," which drew a salute from Trump who described Adams' book as a "must read." "The merit-based system is the way to go. Canada, Australia!" he wrote. Nick Adams new book, Green Card Warrior, is a must read. The merit-based system is the way to go. Canada, Australia! @foxandfriends— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2017 That tweet followed Trump's comments during his joint address to Congress on Tuesday, when he praised the system used by Canada, Australia and many other nations during a portion of his speech that called for reforming an "outdated" legal immigration system that hurts American workers. "Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, will have many benefits," Trump said. "It will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help struggling families — including immigrant families — enter the middle class." Canada has long used immigration as a way to drive its economic engine, and limits the relatives Canadian citizens can bring in. About 63% of those granted legal permanent residence in Canada — the final step before becoming citizens — are admitted for their economic skills, with only 24% admitted based on having family members living in the country. The U.S. system is reversed: 63% of green cards are given to immigrants with family connections, and only 13% given based on economic reasons. Canada was also the first country to use a point system to grade economic immigrants — a 100-point scale introduced in the 1960s that rewards foreigners with PhDs and extensive work experience in specialized fields. It became increasingly popular in the 2000s, as countries that included Australia, Denmark, Japan and the United Kingdom adopted versions of it. "It was very trendy," said Meghan Benton, a senior policy analyst at the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute. Applicants are given a score on a 100-point scale, with points awarded in six categories: • 28 maximum points for language skills. The more fluent they are in English and French, Canada's two official languages, the more points they get. • 25 points for education — 5 for a high school diploma, 19 for a two-year college degree, 25 for a PhD. • 15 maximum points for work experience — the more skilled the job, and the more years spent doing it, the more points. • 12 maximum points for age — the younger the applicant, the more points awarded. • 10 points maximum if they have a current job offer from a Canadian employer. • 10 points maximum for "adaptability," which includes things like family ties to Canadians or past visits to the country. Those who score 67 points or higher are eligible to immigrate. Immediate relatives of Canadian citizens do not go through the grading process.

Canada and others countries, she said, realized that simply admitting people with PhDs wasn't an economic cure-all, since many couldn't find jobs in their fields and were forced to do work far below their education levels. "You had scientists working as taxi drivers," she said. "Classic brain waste." The country also made a major revision in 2015, when it allowed Canadian provinces to sponsor immigrants based on labor shortages. The goal was to tie the system more closely to local demands. The question in the U.S. now is how much Trump wants to emulate Canada's system. "We've been discussing here exactly what he means," Benton said. Roy Beck, president of NumbersUSA, a group that advocates for lower levels of immigration, interpreted Trump's comments as a call to shift away from an immigration system that places such a high priority on family-linked migration — allowing U.S. citizens to sponsor not just spouses and children, but also extended family members.

That amounts to less than 5% of the 1.2 million immigrants admitted to the U.S. in 2015. "He's very clearly saying we should stop importing poverty," Beck said. "He didn't use that term. But he's saying that we're going to stop bringing in people who do not meet some criteria of merit." Clarissa Martínez-de-Castro, deputy vice president of the National Council of La Raza, a group that advocates for immigrants in the U.S., said Trump was clearly embracing a proposal by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., to cut all legal immigration in half. She said Cotton's proposal, and Trump's apparent embrace of that model, show what their true end goal is.

Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via Pinterest Courtesy Brawny Even though we totally have a crush on the Brawny Man who usually graces our paper-towel rolls, we have an even bigger crush on the badass women taking his place this month. The paper-towel company announced that in recognition of Women's History Month, Walmart stores will be selling Brawny towels with limited-edition commemorative packaging featuring a woman in place of the classic Brawny Man. Additionally, four different women who have made strides in a STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) field are each appearing as the subject of her own individual minute-long film on Brawny's website. Brawny is calling the initiative #StrengthHasNoGender. The four women featured are: Vernice Armour—the first African-American female combat pilot in the U.S. and first African-American female pilot in the U.S. Marine Corps. Dr. Anna Kornbrot—the first woman to graduate from Columbia College. She is an oral surgeon and clinical assistant professor of OMFS at Penn Dental School. Patty Lopez, Ph.D.—a platform applications engineer at Intel who has released more than 50 products across five business lines. She holds seven imaging patents. Brittany Wenger—a first-place recipient at the 2012 Google Science Fair. She developed the app Cloud4Cancer, a breast-cancer-diagnosis test. There is also a fifth short film called Breaking Barriers, which honors the accomplishments of legendary women including Harriet Tubman, Amelia Earhart, and Serena Williams. Share via Pinterest "There are women and girls everywhere who exhibit strength and resilience in their lives, and that's the inspiration behind the Brawny #StrengthHasNoGender campaign," Frances Morgan, senior brand manager at Georgia-Pacific (the company that owns Brawny), said in a statement shared with SELF. "STEM is among many areas of society that are underrepresented by females, and we felt this would be a powerful platform to address this issue. Our partnership with Girls Inc. will help promote girls' interest in these fields and empower them to break gender stereotypes." In addition to honoring Armour, Kornbrot, Lopez, and Wenger with the short films, Brawny has partnered with Girls Inc., an organization that "inspires all girls to be strong, smart, and bold through direct service and advocacy." Brawny is donating $75,000 to the group, which will use it for developing "girls' enthusiasm for STEM as part of its Operation SMART programming. As a national sponsor of the program, the maker of Brawny is helping fund STEM education opportunities for more than 46,000 girls across 76 Girls Inc. affiliates," reads Brawny's press release. We're gonna need some paper towels to help clean up all the glass that's falling from the ceiling. Related: Women of Color Share Details of Discrimination on the Job Are You a Woman in the U.S.?

The new AMD Ryzen 7 processors exceeded our expectations for content creation and workstation applications, but did fall a little short when it came to 1080P video game performance in our review. The underwhelming 1080P gaming performance has many folks spooked and we totally get that because it was a shock when we saw the numbers as well. How could Ryzen crush the multi-threaded applications, put up decent numbers in the single-threaded application tests, and then fall short on just game titles that weren’t GPU bound? John Taylor Speaking At The Ryzen Tech Day in February 2017 The good news is that AMD believes that the video game tests came up short because most all of them are games that have been optimized for Intel processors. AMD did believes that Ryzen CPU performance can be improved with a combination of driver and game engine optimizations, but those will take time for video game developers to figure out and they will likely need to introduce game patches when they are ready. AMD also expects motherboard BIOS (UEFI) updates and possibly some Windows driver updates to help things out as well. The take home message here is that the Ryzen 7 benchmark numbers today are the starting point and that they strongly believe that those numbers will get better as time goes on. Legit Reviews spoke with John Taylor, AMD’s vice president of worldwide marketing,and he believes that video game developers will be able to improve performance once they utilize the capabilities of Ryzen processors. “As we presented at Ryzen Tech Day, we are supporting 300+ developer kits with game development studios to optimize current and future game releases for the all-new Ryzen CPU. We are on track for 1000+ developer systems in 2017. For example, Bethesda at GDC yesterday announced its strategic relationship with AMD to optimize for Ryzen CPUs, primarily through Vulkan low-level API optimizations, for a new generation of games, DLC and VR experiences. Oxide Games also provided a public statement today on the significant performance uplift observed when optimizing for the 8-core, 16-thread Ryzen 7 CPU design – optimizations not yet reflected in Ashes of the Singularity benchmarking. Creative Assembly, developers of the Total War series, made a similar statement today related to upcoming Ryzen optimizations. CPU benchmarking deficits to the competition in certain games at 1080p resolution can be attributed to the development and optimization of the game uniquely to Intel platforms – until now. Even without optimizations in place, Ryzen delivers high, smooth frame rates on all “CPU-bound” games, as well as overall smooth frame rates and great experiences in GPU-bound gaming and VR. With developers taking advantage of Ryzen architecture and the extra cores and threads, we expect benchmarks to only get better, and enable Ryzen excel at next generation gaming experiences as well. Game performance will be optimized for Ryzen and continue to improve from at-launch frame rate scores.” – John Taylor, AMD My. Taylor also noted that AMD Ryzen 7 series processors win or tie at 1080P resolutions in these game titles (specific scenes are mentioned to be specific and in case someone wants to re-produce): Sniper Elite 4: Ultra (DX12) Sniper Elite 4: Ultra (DX11) Battlefield One: Ultra (DX12) Division: Ultra  (DX12) Call of Duty Infinite Warfare:  High (DX11) Dishonored2:  Ultra (DX11) Watch Dogs 2 Ultra (DX11) Deus Ex Mankind Divided: Ultra (DX12) Deus Ex Mankind Divided: Ultra (DX11) Battlefield Hardline Overwatch: Epic (Russia) Battlefield 4 (Airfield) Witcher 3: Ultra Hair Works On Witcher 3: Ultra Hair Works Off Witcher 3: Ultra Hair Works On (Horse) Witcher 3: Ultra Hair Works Off (Horse) Sniper Elite 3: Ultra Dragon Age Inquisition: Ultra Crysis 3 (Canyon) Tomb Raider Tomb Raider: Ultra Rocket League   Check out LegitReviews' Polls on LockerDome on LockerDome Tweets by @LegitReviews Explore Editorial Events Interviews News Forum Folding Shop Content Bluetooth Cooling Editorial Events Interviews Memory Misc Mobile Mods and Ends Motherboards News PC Cases Power Supply Press Releases Processors Reviews Storage Video Cards About Contact Us Disclaimer About Us Follow Us         Copyright © 2002-2017 LegitReviews.com - All Rights Reserved.

As President Trump spoke with such eloquence, logic and passion, he did not attack anyone. In fact, many Americans were so impressed with this new side of Trump that they are now actually supporting him. Some reporters, such as Democratic CNN commentator Van Jones, were so inspired by his speech that they now see him as presidential. Despite the reality that Trump’s speech was great, there was still a strong division in congress. The Republicans stood up and applauded as Trump spoke, but the democrats remained seated and did not applaud. Trump hopes to unify congress and wants all the parties to work together, despite their differences, to make America great again. Even though Trump did not have political experience prior to his presidency, many Americans voted for him because he certainly had knowledge in the politics of business. After all, he is a billionaire who has created a financial empire as those Trump Towers have become a symbol of New York. [Image by Jim Lo Scalzo – Pool/Getty Images] In his address, Trump gave examples of how the economy has already improved ever since he became president. He said that the stock market gained nearly three billion dollars since the election on November 8. Another victory for Trump, as outlined in his speech is that companies such as Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockhead, Intel, Walmart as well as many other business will put money into creating tens of thousands of jobs for Americans. The president also helped to lower the price of the F-35 jet fighter helping to save taxpayer money. Despite Trump’s economic victories as president so far, he admits that plenty of work still needs to be done to improve the economy that he describes as the worst financial recovery in 65 years. He also said that in the last eight years the past administration has acquired more debt than in all other presidencies. As he stated during his campaign and in his presidency, President Trump wants to get Americans back to work again. The statistics that he gave in his speech about unemployment are alarming. There are 94 million Americans that are unemployed. More than 43 million Americans are on food stamps. More than 20 percent of Americans in their prime working years are not working. According to his address, President Trump believes in free trade, but he also believes in fair trade. Trump said that American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates in the world. Trump explained how unfairly other nations treat American as far as free trade is concerned. “Currently when we ship products out of America, many countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes – – but when foreign companies ship their products into America we charge them almost nothing,” Trump said in his speech. When he met with members of the Harley-Davidson, the famous American company that makes the best motorcycles in the nation, they told Trump how hard it is for them to do businesses overseas. They said that another country taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent. As we observe towns and cities throughout the United States, we can see how our infrastructure is completely falling apart. There are potholes in some of our streets, damaged bridges, and dilapidated tunnels among many other places of the transportation system that need to be repaired. Trump said that he would fix the disintegrating infrastructure in America. He said that America spent roughly six trillion dollars in the Middle East while our infrastructure was in need of repair. Trump said that with those six trillion dollars we could have rebuilt our country twice. Trump wants to approve legislation that produces $1 trillion dollars in order to revamp our infrastructure. He plans to use both public and private funds to help reconstruct America, and he wants to hire American workers to rebuild their country. The brightest medical researchers are tirelessly working to find treatments and even possible cures for such debilitating diseases such as Parkinson’s, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis among many other diseases. Trump thinks that the tedious process of getting lifesaving drugs approved by the (FDA) Federal Drug Administration keeps too many patients away from the medical advances that could save or prolong their lives. He used the story of Megan Crowley, who was a guest at his presidential address, as an example of how a live saving drug can save a patient’s life. Trump said that Megan Crowley was diagnosed with Pompe Disease when she was just 15 months old. Even though the doctors told her dad that she would not live past the age of five, he did not give up hope. John, Megan’s dad, even created a company that developed a drug that saved Megan’s life. Today Megan is 20 years old and a sophomore at Notre Dame. Trump plans to change the FDA regulations as well as other government agencies so that drugs are approved and administered more expediently to the patients who really need them. These drugs may help to improve a patient’s quality of life and alleviate their suffering. Some of these drugs may even lead to treatments that may cure rare diseases. Widow of Fallen Navy Seal, Senior Chief William Owens and Ivanka Trump. [Image by Alex Wong/Getty Images] The highlight of Trump’s presidential speech was when he saluted Chief William Ryan Owens, who was a Navy Special Operator, who died while in a raid in Yemen last month. Carryn Owens, the widow of Chief William Ryan Owens, was truly moved as Trump saluted her husband who was a real American hero. While he praised Chief William Ryan Owens for his service to his country, you could see how much Trump loves America. Perhaps, the love for those who selflessly serve our country is more important than political experience. “The challenges we face as a nation are great. But our people are even greater. And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform,” Trump said in his speech as a moving tribute to Chief William Ryan Owens and all those who serve. After hearing and analyzing President Trump’s speech, do you think that he will make America great again?

Put all the available cores and threads to work, and the Ryzen 7 1800X proves to be a performance monster that has the beating of Intel chips costing twice as much. Multi-threaded performance is indeed excellent, but now that benchmarks are out we can see that Intel still holds a healthy lead in IPC (instructions per clock), making Ryzen something of a mixed bag. It's a topic we've discussed ad nauseam here at HEXUS HQ and now it's time to hear what you, as consumers and tech influencers, think about AMD's latest CPUs.

Register today! Posted by CAT-THE-FIFTH - Fri 03 Mar 2017 16:42 In non-gaming yep. Some of the Linux benchmarks are amazing. For gaming nope,with the severe SMT issues compared especially to Kaby Lake. Its probably less of an issue on the 8C model since you can disable SMT. The lower core models we will need to wait and see. But with AMD launching the CPU before proper windows scheduler updates,with buggy motherboards,etc,I hope review sites re-bench a few months from now since it will do better. Posted by Jowsey - Fri 03 Mar 2017 16:42 I would say more than so. Completely, from scratch new architecture. Beats current class leader in some tests, is competitive in the rest. And makes sound financial senses. I think if anyone is switching from a processor a couple generations old, AMD should have turned their head's for at least 5 minutes! What more could AMD, it's investors and the people in the market for these products want? AMD IS COMPETITIVE AGAIN! The important point, and it may be premature, but I'm now excited about Zen 2 and the following refinements, and AMD doesn't need to point them out to me. It is happy with it's product (with some exceptions/teething issues which will get worked out in time for the lower end products, hopefully) and will now let us, the consumers, be excited by ourselves for the next generation. This is ,IMHO, huge as we can all see that AMD really pushes the PR hype on it's products which often set's itself up for a massive fall. Congrats AMD, my next CPU purchase will 95% be from you. (Maybe the next iteration though. Also, ITX boards, anyone?) Posted by CAT-THE-FIFTH - Fri 03 Mar 2017 16:57 When Ryzen fires on all cylinders it can decimate the competition. It seems to have a bit of a two faced character currently,but Zen 2 or even the first version after a few months might be more rounded methinks. Posted by this_is_gav - Fri 03 Mar 2017 17:08 I was just hoping for it to be competitive with the 6700K multithreaded, but it wipes the floor with it, and most others too, in the areas I'd use it at. Gaming performance is obviously the weak point, but even that is very good. The only disappointment for me is the relatively high idle power draw. I'll get one at some point as an upgrade to my 4790K - either once this platform has matured in a couple of months or the next revision if I have the patience.

(HT File photo) The ministry of electronics and information technology is in the final stages of crafting a women-special startup programme in the information technology space. To be launched in ten cities by April 1, the initiative would aim at providing dedicated incubators, mentors and venture funds for aspiring women entrepreneurs. In talks with top industry bodies like Nasscom and Internet & Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), the ministry would partner with top information technology companies Facebook, Google, Sysco, Intel and others, the MoEIT secretary Aruna Sundarajan has said. The ministry contends that the aspiring women entrepreneurs planning startup ventures face a lot of barriers in terms of support and resources. When it comes to facilitation for women entrepreneurs, incubators are hardly industry friendly, and therefore ministry is trying to reorient them so that they will able to reach out to women with women orientation in their working, Sundarajan said on the sidelines of Facebook’s She Means Business event in New Delhi on Wednesday . “We are starting a separate programme to open up more space for the women in technology, young talented people where they will find the support groups, access the resources. We will roll it out before April 1,” she said. “We plan to partner with Facebook, Google, Sysco, Intel and others to specifically see how women and their livelihood programmes can be bettered through. Each one of these companies has their platforms and we will see how we can be bundled as part of this,” Sundarajan said. The proposed plan, which the IT secretary said, will be launched in 10 cities including all metros and non-metros such as Pune, Jaipur and others, would have dedicated start-up incubator for women entrepreneurs. “As current start up incubators are very women unfriendly, and they don’t feel comfortable here. Most of the incubators are in IITs or in engineering colleges, but we want to design special spaces for women,” she said. The programs also proposes to have dedicated venture fund for women where they will get people on the board who are more receptive and understand the kind of unique value the women bring to the table, Sundarajan said. tags Startups in India I-T industry Ministry of electronics and information technology Women entrepreneurs IITs more from india Assamese newborn airlifted to Delhi hospital after PMO’s intervention Mar 06, 2017 21:59 IST Assam police alerted over fear of Islamic State recruiting youth Mar 06, 2017 21:30 IST It’s time to be a sport, India Partnered feature Recommended for you India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Blogs Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Health & fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper HT Indepth Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

The latest example is an attack dubbed DNSMessenger, which was analyzed by researchers from Cisco Systems' Talos team. The attack starts with a malicious Microsoft Word document distributed through an email phishing campaign. When opened, the file masquerades as a "protected document" secured by McAfee, an antivirus brand now owned by Intel Security. The user is asked to click on the 'enable content' button in order to view the document's content, but doing so will actually execute malicious scripting embedded within. The script is written in PowerShell, a powerful scripting language built into Windows that allows for the automation of system administration tasks. What's interesting is that until this point, everything is done in memory, without writing any malicious files to disk. [ Further reading: Introduction to Windows PowerShell ] The second stage is also done in PowerShell and involves checking for several parameters of the environment, like the privileges of the logged-in user and the version of PowerShell installed on the system. This information is used to determine how to proceed to the next step and how to achieve persistence. Depending on the result of the stage-two checks, yet another PowerShell script will either be stored in an Alternate Data Stream (ADS) in the NTFS file system or directly inside the registry. The third-stage PowerShell script contains an additional obfuscated script that establishes a fairly sophisticated two-way communications channel over the Domain Name System (DNS). DNS is normally used to look up the Internet Protocol addresses associated with domain names, but it has support for different types of records. The TXT record in particular allows a DNS server to attach unformatted text to a response. "All C2 [command-and-control] communications associated with this malware are performed using DNS TXT queries and responses," the Cisco Talos researchers said in a blog post. This covert communication channel allows attackers to send commands to be executed on the system and to receive the output of those commands. Organizations typically go to great lengths to filter HTTP and HTTPS traffic that goes in and out of their networks, but not many of them monitor DNS. Attackers know this and are encapsulating other protocols inside DNS to remain undetected. The use of system tools like PowerShell and code that's executed directly in memory are also increasingly common techniques that makes the detection of compromises much harder. "This malware sample is a great example of the length attackers are willing to go to stay undetected while operating within the environments that they are targeting," the Cisco Talos researchers said. "It also illustrates the importance that in addition to inspecting and filtering network protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS, SMTP/POP3, etc. DNS traffic within corporate networks should also be considered a channel that an attacker can use to implement a fully functional, bidirectional C2 infrastructure."

The big telecoms companies jostle with each other to demonstrate their cutting-edge, often baffling new ways of squeezing out more bandwidth from existing mobile networks, and dazzle with thrilling new phones. Great stuff – it's the way to 5G super devices, after all – but aside from some notable displays on 5G, 8K and VR from the big companies, it's to the edges of the the industry that you must go to see what's coming next to your smartphone and beyond. Read on for a glimpse into your mobile future. Prev Page 1 of 11 Next Prev Page 1 of 11 Next Spectroscopy selfies How fresh is that strawberry? The H2, the world’s first smartphone with an integrated molecular sensor, called SCiO, uses infra-red to show you the chemical properties of everything from fruit and veg to meat and dairy. It shows you how much alcohol is in a drink, exactly what is in medication, and even tells you how much body fat you have.  Now that's a selfie many us don't want to see. Manufactured by Chinese electronics brand Changhong, the H2 contains a miniaturised spectrometer that uses near-infrared light to tell exactly what’s in almost anything.  “This is the next leap forward not just for mobile phones, but for all sorts of connected devices,” said Dror Sharon, CEO of Consumer Physics, which created SciO sensor. “Smartphones are only the beginning.”   Prev Page 2 of 11 Next Prev Page 2 of 11 Next Personal assistants with presence  Ultrasound is suddenly being used everywhere. Ultrahaptics recently demoed its 'touchless' haptic tech, and at MWC 2017 Elliptic Labs unveiled an intriguing technology called 'Inner Peace' that enables personal assistants like Amazon's Echo and Google Home to detect presence, or an absence of movement.  It can therefore detect both intruders, and if the occupants aren't moving at all – i.e have fallen and lay injured – possibly automatically alerting medical personnel. But it can also switch-off smart home appliances when there's nobody around. Unlike cameras or infrared, there's no blindspots.   Similar tech from Elliptic Labs was used to replace the hardware proximity sensor with ultrasound software on 2016's Xiaomi Mi Mix phone, thus creating an almost bezel-less display.   Prev Page 3 of 11 Next Prev Page 3 of 11 Next High-speed data by light waves We’ve reported on light fidelity, also known as LiFi before, but at MWC 2017 actual product surfaced from the technology’s chief proponent, Edinburgh-based company pureLiFi.  The most exciting was LiFi-X, a dongle for laptops and tablets that can transmit and receive high-speed data between devices using infrared light waves.  “The global mobile industry realises the potential of LiFi to complement existing wireless networks, and the world’s insatiable demand for higher internet connection speeds that will be integral to our wirelessly connected future,” said new CEO Alistair Banham, adding that pureLiFi would “unleash unprecedented data and bandwidth using LED light.”  The company announced Cisco and BT as partners.  Prev Page 4 of 11 Next Prev Page 4 of 11 Next Live 360 TV broadcasts Why go to the game when you can watch it from home in VR? From any seat in the stadium?  OK, any seat where a 360 camera just happens to reside...  That was the thinking behind a demo by BT and Nokia, which at MWC 2017 showcased a system that gave wearers of a VR headset a unique view of a recorded match between Tottenham Hotspur and CSK Moscow late in 2016.  Pretty simple stuff, but what if it was live streamed over 5G, in real-time, in higher resolutions, and you got to swap seats – perhaps to move from behind the goal to the half-way line to get a better view of an attack at the other end – whenever you wanted?  Now we're talking... Prev Page 5 of 11 Next Prev Page 5 of 11 Next Alexa on Bluetooth Amazon's Alexa personal assistant is appearing everywhere, spreading onto all kinds of Wi-Fi-enabled devices, but until now it hasn't been available on Bluetooth.  So Qualcomm's announcement that its Bluetooth Audio system-on-chips can now support the Alexa trigger word is big news. It means that Alexa can now be integrated into headphones, speakers, hearables and wearables that use Qualcomm's CSR8670 and CSR8675 chips.  The software, which has been developed by Sensory and Rubidium via Qualcomm's eXtension program, essentially takes a spoken request to Alexa from someone wearing headphones and routes it to the Alexa app on a phone – even when there's music playing – and routes the answer back through the headphones.   Prev Page 6 of 11 Next Prev Page 6 of 11 Next Real-time VR in 8K over 5G Future mobile networks are being planned to cope with the massive growth in video, but 5G? That's got a special place reserved for 8K Live VR, which was being seriously and successfully demonstrated by Intel.  Think 8K is too much resolution to notice? Strap-on a Samsung Gear VR – or any VR headset, for that matter – and its soft resolution means you won't ever think that again. Intel was showing how images filmed by Nokia's OZO 360-degree camera could be stitched together and streamed over 5G using high bandwidth and immense computing power but (crucially) in real-time. It's the future.   Prev Page 7 of 11 Next Prev Page 7 of 11 Next Software-defined radio Bringing the radio transceiver into the digital age, the world’s first all-digital radio transmitter was recently revealed by Cambridge Consultants.  By using new algorithms to convert between digital analogue, it makes possible radios built purely from computing power, essentially making networks built around high-frequency radio waves smaller and cheaper to build. That could have a lot of uses in the coming eras of 5G and the Internet of Things. The company used MWC 2017 to bolster its Pizzicato technology with a digital receiver to create a complete software-defined radio system.   Prev Page 8 of 11 Next Prev Page 8 of 11 Next Smart buttons for fingers Voice assistants like Alexa may be challenging our obsession with touchscreens, but one company thinks it’s put its finger on just how to revive touch by creating a ‘smart button’ that can be interacted with differently depending on which finger you use.  Linked using Bluetooth and equipped with vibration feedback, Tapdo is a smart button that lets you to control anything with personalised biometric interactions, acting as a shortcut and effectively replacing smart home apps on a phone. Clipping on to almost anything, the smart button contains a fingerprint sensor, while an app allows you to assign specific functions to different parts of your fingers. Post-MWC, Tapdo will be available on Kickstarter starting at US$99/UK£79/AUS$129, and shipping in September 2017.   Prev Page 9 of 11 Next Prev Page 9 of 11 Next Biggerpan’s AI browser From typos and awkward tabs to bad keyboards to copy-paste problems, smartphone web browsers are on borrowed time. French tech company Biggerpan used MWC to showcase Ulli, claiming that it’s the first smart web browser for phones.  Now available on iOS, Ulli is all about making web surfing on a phone a one-handed experience, keeping search results one tap away while also introducing an AI-powered ‘magic button’ that predicts what you’re searching for based on the context of the current page.  “The Internet and the smartphone are two revolutionary technologies that have radically changed our lives, yet they don’t work well together because the experience of the web is not suited for mobility,” says Biggerpan founder and CEO Eric Poindessault.  “Ulli is the first web browser that solves that problem.” If nothing else, Ulli should give Apple and Google’s browser boffins a wake-up call.   Prev Page 10 of 11 Next Prev Page 10 of 11 Next Gestures for AR & VR If the innovations at MWC 2017 are anything to go by, how we interact with mobile devices is undergoing something of a makeover.  Swedish software company Crunchfish reckons that gesture control is the most natural way to interact within AR and VR gear, demoing in Barcelona some AR smart glasses controlled by hand movements.  It also showed-off a 360-degree web browser in VR headsets that were navigated using only gestures. In February, Crunchfish successfully registered a patent for an active player of an AR game like Pokémon Go to discover and communicate with passive players nearby. Cue invites, sharing, and a generally more social dimension to AR games.   Prev Page 11 of 11 Next Prev Page 11 of 11 Next Shares Topics Nokia Related articles Samsung Galaxy S8 shown off in clearest photo yet The best free torrent client 2017 Windows 10 Creators Update will land on desktop PCs first, then mobiles The best free system utilities 2017 See more Mobile phones news Load Comments Tech deals, prizes and latest news Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!

That's according to Declan Ganley, the CEO of Rivada Networks, who says "it is hard to imagine the so-called 'FirstNet' contract not being an issue for the Federal Communications Commission." FirstNet is the authority, created by Congress, tasked with building the first high-speed wireless broadband network in the United States dedicated to public safety providers such as police and firefighters. Unlike other spectrum allocations, this is the first to allow one operator a uniform block in all 56 U.S. states and territories. Rivada Mercury, a consortium including Rivada, Intel and network giants Ericsson, Nokia and Fujitsu, had been in the bidding for the FirstNet contract against AT&T. But Rivada Mercury was excluded from the selection process leaving AT&T as the only company in the running for the contract at the end of 2016. Rivada has sued the U.S. government for what it says is its "wrongful exclusion." Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images The U.S. Court of Federal Claims in Washington will hear oral arguments in this case today. "I believe that we will end up winning the case and ultimately the FirstNet contract to roll out the nationwide public safety broadband network," Ganley said. The contract will give the winner 20 megahertz of spectrum in the low band space and is considered premium; often being described as the equivalent of "beachfront property" in real-estate terms. According to some expert analysts, including those at Wells Fargo and UBS, the value of the FirstNet contract in spectrum terms is about $8 billion based on current auction prices. This comes with up to $7 billion in funding from FirstNet to help deploy and operate the network. The spectrum for allocation is 13 percent of the total low band availability in the United States, which added to the 34 percent already owned by AT&T, would give it control of almost half the market. Analysts at Wells Fargo have said the contract would be "very positive" for AT&T's stock. At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai told CNBC "there is currently no reason for the AT&T-Time Warner deal to be reviewed." When asked whether the FirstNet contract could change his mind he said: "I couldn't comment on anything that could alter the analysis of a merger review." John Hodulik, a managing director at UBS and industry expert, said: "I don't think a FirstNet win would change that fact, despite the spectrum holding it would give AT&T." He added that if the Department of Justice decides to block the deal, the "spectrum holdings won't be the issue." The AT&T Entertainment Group CEO John Stankey told CNBC that the Time Warner acquisition would give the network giant an important holding of intellectual property. Stankey added that "content models were changing so rapidly that IP was essential to be able to innovate in the advertising space and innovate with monetization." Commenting on the FirstNet contract, Stankey said that AT&T was "anxious" to hear about the decision and said the company is "ready to go if we're fortunate enough to be awarded that business."

Tom Wolf (D) is asking the Justice Department to investigate a rash of incidents targeting Jewish institutions around the commonwealth. In a letter to Attorney General Jeff SessionsJeff SessionsTrump makes key changes to travel ban Grassley: 'Too soon' for decision on special prosecutor in Trump-Russia probe Overnight Cybersecurity: Comey, Trump at odds on wiretapping | Obama advisers press Trump to act on cyber MORE sent Thursday, Wolf pointed to desecration at a Jewish cemetery in Philadelphia, where more than 500 headstones were toppled and damaged. He also said bomb threats had forced evacuations at Jewish Community Centers in York and Harrisburg and at a school in Montgomery County, outside of Philadelphia. “The recent rash of terror inflicted on Jewish institutions in Pennsylvania and across the country is incredibly alarming,” Wolf wrote to Sessions. “Pennsylvania was founded to be a safe refuge from religious persecution and we owe those affected by these acts an answer as to whether they were targeted because they were Jewish institutions and whether these are part of a broader threat to Jewish residents.” ADVERTISEMENT More than 100 bomb threats have been called in to Jewish Community Centers and schools in 33 states across the country in recent weeks, according to the JCC Association of North America.  This week alone, about two-dozen Jewish centers and schools received bomb threats. A Jewish cemetery in St. Louis was vandalized days before the attack on the Philadelphia cemetery. In his address to Congress on Tuesday, President Trump cited the threats and condemned “hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms.” The FBI and the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division have been investigating the threats. On Friday, police arrested a St. Louis-area man for phoning in threats to eight Jewish facilities.

News Opinion Entertainment Taiwan Living Learn English E-Newsletter App International Edition Tuesday March, 7, 2017 About Us Subscribe Advertise Contact Us Business Company Focus Africa Middle East Europe Americas Asia Global Markets CEO Talks TSMC to maintain its high capex CNA  March 4, 2017, 12:05 am TWN SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     Tweet A- A+ TAIPEI -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC, 台積電), the world's largest contract chip maker, is expected to have the third largest capital expenditure in the global integrated circuit (IC) industry in 2017, according to US-based advisory IC Insights. In a research note, posted on its website on Thursday, IC Insights said that TSMC is expected to assign US$10 billion in capex for 2017, trailing only South Korea-based Samsung Electronics Co's forecast US$12.5 billion and U.S-based Intel Corp's estimated US$12 billion. The research showed that TSMC's capex for 2017 will be about 2 percent lower than the US$10.25 billion spent in 2016, which was up 27 percent from a year earlier. In late February, Mark Liu (劉德音), TSMC's president and co-chief executive officer, told the company's annual supplier forum that the chip maker will focus on high-end technology development, including sophisticated 7, 5 and even 3 nanometer processes this year, in a bid to maintain its lead over competitors. Currently, TSMC accounts for more than 50 percent of global wafer foundry operations business. United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC, 聯電), the second largest contract chip maker in Taiwan, is expected to assign US$2 billion in capex for 2017, about 30 percent lower than a year earlier, IC Insights said. The advisory firm said UMC could have the 7th largest capex tied with U.S-based contract chip maker GlobalFoundries Inc. The IC Insight report showed that South Korea's dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chip maker SK Hynix Inc. is fourth in the 2017 rankings with an expected US$6 billion in capex. After acquiring Taiwan's DRAM supplier Inotera Memories Inc. (華亞科) in 2016, U.S-based Micron Technology Inc. is expected to assign US$5 billion for capex to take fifth place in the 2017 rankings ahead of China's contract chip maker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC, 中芯), which is expected to have capex of US$2.3 billion, IC Insights said. The advisory firm predicted that aggregate capex for the global IC industry will total US$72.31 billion in 2017, up 6 percent from a year earlier.

Sergey Kislyak, Moscow's soft-spoken ambassador to the U.S. who assumed his post in 2008, is known to have had several conversations with President Trump's associates. Kislyak's name began appearing in the news early last month after revelations that, despite denials, Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, spoke with him about sanctions before Trump took office. Flynn resigned after reports emerged that he misled Vice President Pence about his conversations with the diplomat. Then it came to light Wednesday that Sessions, who as then a Republican Alabama senator, spoke twice with the Russian envoy during the presidential campaign. Sessions, who maintained Thursday that he didn't speak to the Russian official in his capacity as a surrogate of Trump's campaign but instead as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, announced that he would recuse himself from Department of Justice investigations into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election. Shortly after his press conference, The New York Times reported that Kislyak had met with Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, along with Flynn, in December. And USA Today reported that he had met with two other former Trump foreign policy campaign aides — J.D. Gordon and Carter Page — in Cleveland when that city hosted the Republican National Convention in July. In a Thursday press conference, Russian's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova described Kislyak's frequent meetings with Trump associates as just part of his job. "I will reveal a military secret: Diplomats work, and their work consists of making contacts within their assigned country," Zakharova said. "This is written everywhere. If they do not make contacts and do not participate in talks, then they are not diplomats."  Former U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Beyrle described Kislyak as a low-profile diplomat to ABC News. “He likes to operate behind the scenes,” Beyrle said. “He’s a professional diplomat, not a politician. I’m sure he’s surprised to have acquired such notoriety recently. I'm sure he’s probably not enjoying his time in the limelight." The Russian diplomat was born in 1950 and studied nuclear physics in Moscow before joining the Soviet foreign service in the 1970s. From 1981 to 2008, Kislyak held numerous high-ranking positions within the Soviet and Russian Foreign Ministry, including his post as ambassador to Belgium and Russia's representative to NATO. His term as the Russian ambassador reportedly ends this spring. "You're never confused about what country he's representing here. ... He does it fantastically well," said former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul while introducing Kislyak at a lecture event in November. McFaul described the Russian envoy as "effective and experienced," while noting that Kislyak had held "all the most important jobs in the Foreign Ministry — except one." The interactions between Trump allies and the Russian official have drawn intense scrutiny following the intelligence community's assessment earlier this year that Russia spearheaded a hacking and influence campaign intended to help Trump win the 2016 election. Reports have suggested Kislyak is actually a Russian spy, something the former U.S. ambassador to Russia described as nonsense. "It’s frankly not odd in the least for him to have met Jeff Sessions, a senior senator on the Armed Services Committee, up on Capitol Hill. ... To call him a spy is to misunderstand what a diplomat, even a Russian diplomat, does,"  Beyrle said. Kislyak has attended a number of Trump events, most recently his address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, where he was pictured on the House floor. An NBC News producer reported that there were nearly 100 seats reserved for the diplomatic corps. The Russian ambassador also attended one of Trump's foreign policy speeches in April 2016 and was slated to attend his inauguration in January, with a Russian embassy spokesman describing his invitation as common, according to The Daily Beast. As one would expect for an ambassador, Kislyak frequently comments on the state of relations between U.S. and Russia, urging for improvement in bilateral ties. "The quality of the relations today is very deplorable," Kislyak said while delivering a speech at The Economic Club in January. "The quality of these relations today, in my view, is the worst after the end of the Cold War." When asked about his conversation with Flynn, Kislyak said he was "disappointed" that they were intercepted by the U.S. intelligence, but added that he would not comment on the conversation. "We have a policy of not commenting on our daily conversations with our interlocutors, because if everything that we discuss is going to be discussed then publicly, who is then going to be interested in talking to me?" he said. Some Russian officials hope Trump's broader policy of seeking common ground with Moscow will survive the political storm in Washington. A top Russian legislator lauded Trump on Wednesday for not mentioning "vicious nonsense" about Russia during his speech to Congress.   "Trump's performance in Congress stood out due to self-restraint, balanced tone and absence of vicious nonsense toward Russia that was common for [former President] Obama," Alexey Pushkov said.

Sound familiar? Originally published March 3, 2017 at 6:30 am Updated March 3, 2017 at 2:56 pm Portland is seen from Pittock Mansion, west of downtown. As in other parts of the country, the economic recovery in Portland has been profoundly uneven. The fastest job growth is occurring among low- and high-wage jobs. (Ellen M. Banner/The Seattle Times) One of the nation’s hottest urban economies, Portland is struggling to stay "weird" as it becomes a hub for startups. But that powerful growth is contributing to an uneven recovery from the Great Recession. Share story By Hal Bernton Seattle Times staff reporter PORTLAND — Jordan Snider made the move here from Los Angeles in 2013 to join his girlfriend. He had no wish for a Portlandia-style life change to work as a barista. He had digital-production skills honed by motion-picture work. So he freelanced, then started his own firm, Chromacolor, in a century-old space shared with a bamboo-furniture maker and a “brew bar” where the espressos are served up with fresh-roasted beans. “I was afraid I might end up with a job in a coffee shop. Instead, I opened my own business above a coffee shop,” said Snider, whose small loft is reached by climbing the stairs at the back of the building. Snider, 31, is a bit player in the kaleidoscope of Portland startups that have helped turn this city into one of the nation’s hottest urban economies, with a job-growth rate second only to Miami from 2013 to 2015. But in Portland, as in other parts of the country, the recovery from the depths of the Great Recession has been profoundly uneven. The city’s surging fortunes have been a source of pride but also angst, familiar to Seattle residents, as soaring home prices and rents increasingly separate the haves from the have-nots. A state analyst notes the fastest employment growth in Portland has come at polar ends of the spectrum — low-wage jobs, such as those in the hospitality industry that average $21,000 a year, and high-wage jobs, such as those in tech manufacturing, of more than $130,000. There has been scant increase in middle-income jobs. “The cruel irony is that, in the shadow of this economic growth, there is crushing structural poverty,” wrote Christian Kaylor, of the Oregon Employment Department, which conducted an analysis of job growth. “It’s a classic tale of economic divide. And that divide is growing.”   People walk past the Right 2 Dream Too homeless camp in Portland. The yellow building under renovation at left is the old Grove Hotel, in which developers are investing $30 million. (Ellen M. Banner/The Seattle Times)   Artisan ethic Portland long has benefitted from two major employers situated to the west of the city: Nike and Intel. Within Portland proper, much of the recent growth in high-end wages has been driven by the tech startups. Though the urban core lacks a major anchor like Amazon, Portland still draws software talent from around the country. Josh Petty, 26, co-founded a software-design studio, Celluflora, with several fellow Purdue University graduates. Petty works sometimes from home, sometimes in cafes, and at other times, he rents space where other entrepreneurs work. (Ellen M. Banner/The Seattle Times) Josh Petty is a 26-year-old Purdue University graduate who co-founded a software-design studio, Celluflora, in his native Indiana and then decided to move to Portland a year ago. He sometimes works out of his apartment, other times opts to rent space. And he is constantly networking at events such as 1 Million Cups meeting, which last month featured a pitch for Chubstr, an online startup that showcases stylish clothes for big, young men. “There’s a lot of creativity here,” Petty said. “You can push out an idea, and you are not embarrassed. Even if it’s not yet as good as it can be, you are not going to be cut down.” In Portland, some software developers embrace a kind of artisan ethic that has carried over from woodworking and brewmasters to the world of computer coding. “You have this almost anarchist, against-the-system attitude,” said Alex Bilmes, chief executive officer of Reflect, a Portland-based startup focused on visualizing data. “It is anti-corporate and you end up getting developers who care much more about their craft than the business impact they are making. They like to write really amazing code.” Portland-Seattle snapshot Median family income Portland: $60,892 Seattle: $80,349 Median home price Portland $406,200 Seattle: $609,100 Median monthly rent Portland: $1,695 Seattle: $2,350 2016 venture-capital deals over $1 million Portland Metro region: 50 Seattle-Tacoma: 182 Sources: Census 2015; Zillow, year-end 2016; Oregon Angel Fund and Pitchbook Even as Portland tech leaders cherish a culture apart from the more corporate Seattle-area scene, they also look north to the Puget Sound region for financial support. Reflect, for example, received some of its $2.5 million investment from Seattle-based Founder’s Co-op, a fund that specializes in early-stage startups and backed Bilmes last year in a three-month incubator program. “Fundamentally, I feel there is a real strong collaboration between the Portland startup community and the Seattle community,” said Chris DeVore, a partner in Founder’s Co-op. When you walk into the century-old building where Snider works, collaboration also thrives, blurring the physical lines between businesses. Close by the street entrance, Coava Coffee showcases an expansive bar and tables crafted by Bamboo Revolution, which sells furniture and other bamboo offerings farther back in the room, and manufactures it in an adjacent industrial space reached through a massive bamboo door. “We wanted to show off what we could do — what bamboo could do — and I get 500 people walking through here every day who would not have been here otherwise. So everybody wins,” said Michael Pullen, who owns Bamboo Revolution and renovated the space. The coffee clientele includes lot of startup people, Snider said, and that helps his business. “The other day, I saw one of my old clients, so I invited him to up to my office to see my coloring process,” he said. In the Portland startup community, many are hoping for a big payoff that is still somewhere on the horizon. So far, Portland has yet to undergo the kind of tech cycle Seattle went through in which some companies matured and early stakeholders cashed in their shares. Still, deep pockets are investing in Portland. Back in September 2015, Amazon announced it was acquiring Elemental Technologies, a Portland-based video software startup, for a price Bloomberg reported to be more than $500 million. Portland is also attracting more satellite offices of Silicon Valley companies, where employees can find more affordable housing than in the Bay Area. “Three years ago, that was rare,” said Bilmes. “But companies are finding that if they create an office here, a significant portion of their workforce want to move.”   Alex Bilmes, CEO of Reflect, works in his Portland office with other software engineers as they all write code. The startup focuses on visualizing data. (Ellen M. Banner/The Seattle Times)   Priced out The migration from Silicon Valley, as well as Seattle, adds to the pressure on Portland real-estate prices. New arrivals flush with money from home sales in the higher-priced regions often bid up prices. Through most of last year, the monthly rate of increase in Portland home prices led the nation, according to the S&P Case-Schiller price index. Meanwhile, rapidly rising rents are straining tenants. Scott San Filippo, a software developer from the Bay Area, got a front-row seat to that process after he moved to Portland last year. His new home was just across the street from a four-plex that was sold to a new landlord. He then watched three of the tenants, a single father with his son, a couple and an older gentleman, vacate. “I was shocked how people could be forced out,” San Filippo said. “In San Francisco, there is rent control.” In Portland, there is a new push for rent control. That movement has gotten a boost from state House Speaker Tina Kotek, a Portland Democrat, who supports a bill in the Legislature that would remove a statewide ban on rent control. She also backs a temporary, one-year measure to limit rent increases to no more than 5 percent and forbid evictions without cause. “Too many property owners are taking advantage of the market conditions by evicting tenants, raising rents and finding new people who can pay more each month,” Kotek said in a September speech.

But there also is new momentum to increase building housing stock for moderate- and low-income residents. Voters in November approved a $258 million bond measure intended to help ease what the ballot question described as a 24,000-unit shortfall in affordable housing. Then in December, the Portland City Council approved a rule that will require developers building at least 20 units to set aside at least 20 percent of them for households making 80 percent or less than the median income. Earlier this year, the council passed law requiring landlords to pay relocation costs for tenants evicted without cause, a move that came about after one apartment owner in northeast Portland in January nearly doubled his tenants’ rent. Meanwhile, the Portland Development Commission, a public agency, wants private partners to commit to incorporating manufacturing spaces and affordable housing in their urban renewal projects. “We are looking for ways that harness and continue the growth — but to do it in a way that benefits all of the community,” said Kimberly Branam, the commission’s executive director. That can be a tough balancing act. For years, the commission has been trying to redevelop the Grove Hotel, a dilapidated structure at a key location in Portland near an ornate gate that marks the entrance to Old Town Chinatown. The commission sold the property to two private developers who have invested more than $30 million to transform the building — now under renovation — into a boutique hotel and retail stores. But just across the street is Right 2 Dream Too, an organized homeless camp that for the past five years has offered a “safe sleep zone” for the weary and received some city financial support. That property, too, is expected to be acquired by the commission and redeveloped. But so far, efforts to move the camp have been unsuccessful. Last month, the frustrated hotel developers sued the camp owners for damages. They argue that the patchwork of shelters violates zoning codes, reduces their property’s value, and will deter guests from coming to the hotel.   Colorist Jordan Snider’s office is above a coffee shop and bamboo-furniture manufacturer.

(AMZN) Isn’t Infallible After All View All Posts Shares of semiconductor giant Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) have been on a tear, soaring some 36% over the past month and punishing those who have bet against it. But if you’ve been waiting for a better entry point in AMD stock, don’t hold your breath. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr These shares, despite rising more than 24% this year, could climb another 15% to $17 per share. AMD stock closed Monday near $15, continuing to climb after the company affirmed investors’ confidence by entering a chip war with rival Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). AMD’s highly anticipated Ryzen chip, which boast better performance at a much lower price for the desktop PC and gaming market, is set to be released March 2. At an event in San Francisco last week, CEO Lisa Su said Advanced Micro Devices had only one goal in mind when developing the next-generation chips: “We wanted to disrupt the PC market, we wanted to bring innovation, choice and performance to as many people as possible.” Improved Prospects Su, in charge since January 2012, has orchestrated a remarkable turnaround at the company. AMD stock traded around $5.40 at the time of her appointment. And not only was Advanced Micro Devices nearly $2.5 billion in debt, revenue had grown only once in the company’s previous five years. Prospects, which looked bleak at the time of her appointment, now appear drastically different. Advanced Micro Devices shares have skyrocketed 161% since her appointment. And thanks to the company’s Ryzen architecture, there’s now no sign of slowing down, which should frighten Intel. For instance, the Ryzen 7 1800X — the highest-performing chip in AMD’s new arsenal — not only has eight core processors, but is also priced at $499, which is half the cost of Intel’s comparable model the $1,000 Core i7-6900K. “More performance, half the price,” Su said. And it doesn’t stop there.

USA TODAY NETWORK The rapidly unfolding saga of President Trump and the connections between the Russian government, Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and the Trump administration involves a series of political operatives, government officials and diplomats worthy of a John le Carré novel. Here are some of the key players. Paul Manafort Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager, represented the former leader of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, when the longtime ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin ran Ukraine. A longtime lobbyist in Washington and international political consultant, Manafort signed on to run Trump's campaign but left in August following disclosures that his name surfaced in secret ledgers kept by the Yanukovych government that showed he was paid $12.7 million. The New York Times reported Wednesday that Manafort spoke last year to Russian intelligence officials in telephone calls that were monitored by U.S. intelligence agencies. On Wednesday, Manafort denied any contact with Russian officials, either directly or indirectly. Michael Flynn The recently departed national security adviser worked for the state-owned Russia Today after he was fired by former president Barack Obama as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He advocated for closer relations with Russia. In 2015, Flynn traveled to Moscow to speak at the 10th anniversary gala for Russia Today in an event also attended by Putin. Flynn has acknowledged he was paid for the visit, which — if not approved by the secretaries of Defense and State — would violate federal law. He has not said how much he was paid or whether it was approved. His downfall started when U.S. intelligence agencies intercepted a telephone call from Flynn to Sergey Kislyak, Russia's ambassador to the United States, in which the two discussed new sanctions to be placed on Russia by the Obama administration. Russia Today was identified in an intelligence assessment as one of the Kremlin's top purveyors of propaganda and misinformation in the 2016 presidential election, leading to a heightened sensitivity over Flynn's participation in the event, which Flynn said was arranged by a speaker's bureau. House Democrats have called for an investigation into those connections. Former national security adviser Michael Flynn.  (Photo: Jim Lo Scalzo, European Pressphoto Agency) Carter Page Page, who runs an investment company called Global Energy Capital, was named as an early foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. He was accused last year by former Senate minority leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., of being a conduit between Trump and the Russian government, which Page denied. Last year, Page gave a speech in which he accused the U.S. government of having a “hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change” toward Russia and other former Soviet republics. Vladimir Putin The president of Russia has been the source of fascination for Trump for years. During the 2016 election, both Trump and Vice President Pence, then the governor of Indiana, praised Putin's leadership style in contrast to Obama's. The Kremlin has denied that Putin had anything to do with the Russian-led hacking of the Democratic National Committee emails, which spawned a series of leaks from the website WikiLeaks during the final weeks of the 2016 general election campaign. WikiLeaks published multiple emails from John Podesta, a longtime associate of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, that cast Clinton and the campaign in a negative light. Russian President Vladimir Putin in July 2014.  (Photo: Mikhail Klimentyev, AFP/Getty Images) Sergey Kislyak Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, received a telephone call from Flynn last December in which the two men discussed new sanctions that were to be placed on Russia by the Obama administration. The Obama administration also expelled 35 Russian diplomats from the United States for their alleged role in interfering with the U.S. elections, a move that was expected to bring a Russian response. Instead, Putin elected to do nothing. On March 1, the Washington Post reported that then-Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a Trump campaign surrogate and now attorney general, met twice with Kislyak in 2016 but told the Senate Judiciary Committee during his confirmation hearings that he had not. On March 2, Sessions recused himself from any involvement in whatever investigations the FBI and Justice Department were conducting into the Russian role in the elections.

The 2.4” curved screen and the battery life of 22 hours talk-time or 1 month in stand-by are among 3310’s best features. It comes with a 2 Megapixels camera with LED flash, 2G connectivity for voice and texts, FM Radio and MP3 play, as well as 16MB storage with up to 32GB support MicroSD. If there’s any success in store for Nokia’s most iconic feature phone though, this definitely will have to do with the return of the legendary Snake game on an updated version.     Galaxy Book by Samsung Samsung might have decided after many years to skip MWC for its flagship device announcement and schedule it for the end of March in New York, however the company did hold a launch event in Barcelona during which announced its new Galaxy Book portable PC line and a new model in the Galaxy Tab series. Galaxy Book comes available in 10.6-inch TFT LCD and 12-inch Super AMOLED models, equipped with an Intel Dual core processor at either 2.6 or 3.1 GHz and it’s built on Windows 10. Galaxy Tab S3 comes with a 9.7-inch Super AMOLED display, HDR video support and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor. Both models come with an S Pen and a detachable cover.       P10 Plus by Huawei With Samsung not playing the smartphone field this year, the spotlight on hand-sets was on Huawei and the Chinese company didn’t fail to meet the expectations with the launch of the new models of its flagship series; P10 and P10 Plus. Aiming at making P series the go-to smartphone when it comes to picture quality, Huawei partnered with Leica to equip P10 and P10 Plus with 12 Megapixels RGB and 20 Megapixels monochrome Dual-Camera 2.0, that captures detailed facial features. It features artistic imaging algorithms that deliver studio-like photography, while running on a HiSilicon Kirin 960 chipset.     KATIM Phone by DarkMatter DarkMatter is a cyber security firm based in Dubai. Developing applications for encrypted text- or voice-based enterprise and governmental communication, DarkMatter announced during MWC 2017 an entire suite of secure communication that includes KATIM Phone. Only silence is more secure, dares KATIM, offering a hardened version of Android’s Nougat to safeguard against vulnerabilities. It also features end-to-end data encryption and secure storage for keys in the phone.     G6 by LG Taglined as the smartphone with a big screen that actually fits in one hand, the new model of LG G series is a back to basics approach to premium smartphones, according to the company. G6 features a 5.7-inch QHD+ FullVision display. It’s the first smartphone to feature a 18:9 screen aspect ratio and Dolby Vision Technology. It runs on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor and features a 13 Megapixels wide-angle camera.     XZ by Sony Mobile The new Xperia XZ Premium is the first smartphone to feature super slow-motion capabilities, topping 4 times slower than any other device, according to Sony Mobile. Running on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chipset, it features a 5.2 inched Full 1080p HD display and a 19 Megapixels rear camera. Sony has incorporated imaging know-how from its ‘α’ and Cyber-shot camera series to create the new Motion Eye camera system, equivalent of professional compact cameras.   Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn + Load next: Ansip - Viola: The European Union can’t afford to lose the 5G race Related News News Putin’s party deals with Italy’s far-right Lega Nord By NEOnline | TB News Poland alone in bid to oust Tusk By Beata Stur News MEPs on defence By Beata Stur News Fillon remains the last candidate standing for the French center-right By NEOnline | IR COPYRIGHT 2016 NEW EUROPE.

By comparison, there were eight companies in 2013 with capital spending in excess of US$1 billion, IC Insights indicated. Three of the top-11 major capital spenders (Intel, Globalfoundries and ST) are forecast to increase their semiconductor spending outlays by 25% or more in 2017. The biggest percentage increase in spending by a major spender in 2016 came from China-based pure-play foundry SMIC, which ran its fabrication facilities at 95% or more than 95% utilization rate for much of the year, IC Insights said. SMIC initially set its 2016 capex budget at US$2.1 billion. However, in November, the company raised its spending budget to US$2.6 billion, which resulted in outlays that were 87% greater than in 2015. In contrast to the surge of spending at SMIC in 2016, the weak DRAM market spurred both Samsung and SK Hynix to reduce their total 2016 capital spending by 13% and 14%, respectively, IC Insights said. Although their total outlays declined, both companies increased their spending for 3D NAND flash in 2016. Micron is forecast to cut its spending by 13% in 2017, even after including Inotera, which was acquired by Micron in December 2016, IC Insights said. In 2016, Globalfoundries had plenty of capacity available. As a result, the company cut its capex by a steep 62%, IC Insights identified. Globalfoundries is forecast to increase its spending for 2017 by 33%, the second-largest increase expected among the major spenders (though its 2017 spending total is still expected to be about half of what the company spent in 2015). It is assumed that almost all of the spending increase will be targeted at installing advanced processing technology. Globalfoundries has disclosed it is focusing its efforts on developing 7nm technology and will skip the 10nm node. After spending about US$1.06 billion in 2016, Sony is expected to drop out of the major spender listing in 2017 as it winds down its outlays for capacity additions for its image sensor business and its spending drops below US$1 billion, IC Insights said. STMicroelectronics is expected to replace Sony in the major spender listing by increasing its spending by 73% to US$1.05 billion in 2017. It should be noted that ST has stated that this surge in outlays is expected to be a one year event, after which it will revert back to limiting its capital spending to 10% or less of its sales.

By: Reuters | Updated: March 3, 2017 3:10 pm ZTE is expected to plead guilty to conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, among other charges. ( Image for representation,Source: Reuters) Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp is nearing an agreement to plead guilty to US criminal charges and pay hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties over allegations it violated U.S. laws that restrict sale of US technology to Iran, a person familiar with the matter said. The company has not yet signed a deal with the US Department of Commerce, the US Department of Justice and the US Department of Treasury, cautioned the person, who declined to speak on the record because the negotiations are not public. Watch all our videos from Express Technology Others noted that with a new US administration prompting changes in personnel at government departments, a final deal may be delayed or even scuttled. But ZTE is expected to plead guilty to conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, among other charges, the source said, and pay penalties in the hundreds of millions. A ZTE spokesman declined to comment, as did spokesmen for the Justice and Treasury departments. A spokesman for the Department of Commerce did not respond to requests for comment. An agreement would cap a year of uncertainty for the Shenzhen-based company, which was placed on a list of entities March 2016 that U.S. suppliers could not work with without a license. ZTE acted contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests, the Commerce Department said at the time. One of the world’s biggest telecommunications gear makers and the No. 4 smartphone vendor in the United States, ZTE sells handset devices to US mobile carriers AT&T Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp. It relies on U.S. companies including Qualcomm, Microsoft and Intel for components. The listing could have severely disrupted the company’s supply chain, but the Commerce Department granted ZTE a temporary license so US companies could continue to do business with the Chinese firm while it cooperated with the investigation. The temporary license was extended several times, with the latest reprieve expiring on March 29. The last extension, a ZTE spokesman told Reuters in an email last week, was “a sign of the progress” made. ZTE was working with the U.S. government “toward permanent removal from the Entity List,” the company spokesman said at that time, and under new leadership was conducting business in a way that “meets and exceeds export compliance standards.” The spokesman’s comments followed a Feb. 14 filing by ZTE to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. The ZTE filing said it was negotiating with the U.S. Commerce, Treasury and Justice departments to conclude the investigation. ZTE said that the outcome remained uncertain, but that it would likely have a material impact on its financials. ZTE has annual sales of more than $15 billion. SCRUTINY CAN MEAN COMFORT The implications of a guilty plea are unclear. Experts said it can result in a denial order, which imposes a complete bar on the receipt of US origin goods and technology. But, as part of a settlement, the order could be suspended for years. Typically, the reputational taint of a guilty plea on U.S. suppliers or customers would be limited in duration, according to Washington attorney Douglas Jacobson, an export controls and sanctions expert. “In fact, a company that has faced the type of scrutiny that ZTE has … actually gives U.S. suppliers and customers a greater degree of comfort that they will be a compliant company in the future,” said Jacobson, who represents some US suppliers to ZTE. The Commerce Department released alleged internal documents last year, showing senior ZTE executives instructing the company to carry out a project for dodging export controls in Iran, North Korea, Syria, Sudan and Cuba. ZTE replaced the senior executives allegedly involved, including naming a new president, and also appointed a new, U.S.-based chief export compliance officer. The Shenzhen-based company has a US subsidiary in Richardson, Texas.

The uncertainty has already weighed on ZTE’s business. In January, company sources told Reuters that the equipment maker was cutting about 3,000 jobs, or 5 percent of its 60,000 global workforce. The Commerce Department investigation followed reports by Reuters in 2012 that the company had signed contracts to ship millions of dollars worth of hardware and software from some of America’s best-known technology companies to Iran’s largest telecoms carrier.

Behind closed doors at MWC 2017, Samsung was reportedly giving select partners a demonstration of prototype VR headsets, ones that don’t need a smartphone or a PC to function. These standalone headsets, instead, carried their own processing power and at the heart of that is Samsung’s brand new Exynos 9 chip. This isn’t the first time we’ve heard of standalone VR head-mounted displays or HMDs. Interestingly, news of those would come from chip makers like Intel and, more recently, Qualcomm. It is, after all, a prime opportunity to show off how a chip can provide the power needed by VR experiences yet, at the same time, still be as light and as cool (literally) as a phone. In that sense, the Exynos 9, which was just revealed last week, seems poised for that very purpose. While it is a natural fit for a smartphone, like, say, a Galaxy S8, it also has the features needed for a more mobile form of VR. In addition to raw processing power, provided by four custom cores and four Cortex-A53 cores, the Exynos 8895, the first of the Exynos 9 chips, also supports 4K displays and output rates of 120 fps. It has dedicated co-processors for motion sensors as well as computer vision. In short, everything needed for a VR headset that happens to also be good for smartphones. Samsung’s push for an Exynos-powered VR headset, however, will just be a part of an even bigger campaign. Samsung’s Exynos processors are rarely seen outside of the company’s own smartphones. Samsung admits it hasn’t exactly been good at pushing its application processors to other manufacturers, something it plans to rectify soon. Part of that new thrust is rebranding its processor along tiers, not unlike what Intel did for its Core i and Atom x processors. The Exynos 9, its latest, occupies the highest marks, followed by the Exynos 7, 5, and 3. This strategy will put its more directly at odds with other chip makers like Qualcomm and MediaTek. The dynamics between Samsung and Qualcomm will definitely be interesting to watch. After the failure of the Snapdragon 810, Qualcomm has turned to Samsung for help in fabricating its succeeding processors, including the latest Snapdragon 835. The success of those Qualcomm chips may have ironically given Samsung more confidence in trying its luck at becoming a mobile processor provider just like Qualcomm.

March 02, 2017 -- Survey results that will be posted in the March Update to the 20th anniversary 2017 edition of IC Insights’ McClean Report show that eleven companies are forecast to have semiconductor capital expenditure budgets greater than $1.0 billion in 2017, and account for 78% of total worldwide semiconductor industry capital spending this year (Figure 1). By comparison, there were eight companies in 2013 with capital spending in excess of $1.0 billion. As shown in the figure, three of the top 11 major capital spenders (Intel, GlobalFoundries, and ST) are forecast to increase their semiconductor spending outlays by 25% or more in 2017. The biggest percentage increase in spending by a major spender in 2016 came from the China-based pure-play foundry SMIC, which ran its fabrication facilities at ≥95% utilization rate for much of last year. SMIC initially set its 2016 capital expenditure budget at $2.1 billion. However, in November, the company raised its spending budget to $2.6 billion, which resulted in outlays that were 87% greater than in 2015. In contrast to the surge of spending at SMIC last year, the weak DRAM market spurred both Samsung and SK Hynix to reduce their total 2016 capital spending by 13% and 14%, respectively. Although their total outlays declined, both companies increased their spending for 3D NAND flash in 2016. As shown, Micron is forecast to cut its spending by 13% in 2017, even after including Inotera, which was acquired by Micron in December of last year. In 2016, GlobalFoundries had plenty of capacity available. As a result, the company cut its capital expenditures by a steep 62%. As shown, the company is forecast to increase its spending this year by 33%, the second-largest increase expected among the major spenders (though its 2017 spending total is still expected to be about half of what the company spent in 2015). It is assumed that almost all of the spending increase this year will be targeted at installing advanced processing technology (the company announced that it is focusing its efforts on developing 7nm technology and will skip the 10nm node). Figure 1 After spending about $1.06 billion last year, Sony is expected to drop out of the major spender listing in 2017 as it winds down its outlays for capacity additions for its image sensor business and its spending drops below $1.0 billion. As shown in Figure 1, ST is expected to replace Sony in the major spender listing this year by increasing its spending by 73% to $1.05 billion. It should be noted that ST has stated that this surge in outlays is expected to be a one year event, after which it will revert back to limiting its capital spending to ≤10% of its sales.

Sessions became the subject of controversy Wednesday night amid revelations that he had failed to disclose the two meetings with Kislyak in his Jan. 10 confirmation hearing to become attorney general. At the time, Sen. Al FrankenAl FrankenSessions on Russia testimony: 'My answer was correct' Dem threatens to block deputy attorney general nominee over special prosecutor Franken: Sessions should come back before the Judiciary Committee MORE (D-Minn.) asked Sessions how he would approach a potential case in which Trump’s campaign aides were found to have communicated with Russian officials. "I'm not aware of any of those activities,” Sessions told Franken. “I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign, and I did not have communications with the Russians." Sessions recused himself on Thursday from any investigations into Russian election meddling or potential ties between Trump and Moscow. But he insisted that the decision had nothing to do with improper talks with Kislyak. “When you evaluate the rules, I feel like I should not be involved in investigating a campaign I had a role in,” he said at a news conference. Speaking to Carlson Thursday night, Sessions said he was “attacked” by accusations of colluding with Russia, calling the outcry surrounding the reports of the meetings “sad.” “It was a sad thing to be attacked like that, but I think we explained it and we intend to move forward,” he said.

Reuters NEW YORK - Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp is nearing an agreement to plead guilty to U.S. criminal charges and pay hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties over allegations it violated U.S. laws that restrict sale of U.S. technology to Iran, a person familiar with the matter said. The company has not yet signed a deal with the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Treasury, cautioned the person, who declined to speak on the record because the negotiations are not public. Others noted that with a new U.S. administration prompting changes in personnel at government departments, a final deal may be delayed or even scuttled. But ZTE is expected to plead guilty to conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, among other charges, the source said, and pay penalties in the hundreds of millions. A ZTE spokesman declined to comment, as did spokesmen for the Justice and Treasury departments. A spokesman for the Department of Commerce did not respond to requests for comment. The Commerce Department investigation followed reports by Reuters in 2012 that the company had signed contracts to ship millions of dollars worth of hardware and software from some of America's best-known technology companies to Iran's largest telecoms carrier. FBI probes China's ZTE over Iran deals China hopes ZTE will be treated fairly in US probe An agreement would cap a year of uncertainty for the Shenzhen-based company, which was placed on a list of entities March 2016 that U.S. suppliers could not work with without a license. ZTE acted contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests, the Commerce Department said at the time. One of the world’s biggest telecommunications gear makers and the No. 4 smartphone vendor in the United States, ZTE sells handset devices to U.S. mobile carriers AT&T Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp. It relies on U.S. companies including Qualcomm, Microsoft and Intel for components. The listing could have severely disrupted the company's supply chain, but the Commerce Department granted ZTE a temporary license so U.S. companies could continue to do business with the Chinese firm while it cooperated with the investigation. The temporary license was extended several times, with the latest reprieve expiring on March 29. The last extension, a ZTE spokesman told Reuters in an email last week, was "a sign of the progress" made. ZTE was working with the U.S. government "toward permanent removal from the Entity List," the company spokesman said at that time, and under new leadership was conducting business in a way that "meets and exceeds export compliance standards." The spokesman’s comments followed a Feb. 14 filing by ZTE to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. The ZTE filing said it was negotiating with the U.S. Commerce, Treasury and Justice departments to conclude the investigation. ZTE said that the outcome remained uncertain, but that it would likely have a material impact on its financials. ZTE has annual sales of more than $15 billion. SCRUTINY CAN MEAN COMFORT The implications of a guilty plea are unclear. Experts said it can result in a denial order, which imposes a complete bar on the receipt of U.S. origin goods and technology. But, as part of a settlement, the order could be suspended for years. Typically, the reputational taint of a guilty plea on U.S. suppliers or customers would be limited in duration, according to Washington attorney Douglas Jacobson, an export controls and sanctions expert. “In fact, a company that has faced the type of scrutiny that ZTE has ... actually gives U.S. suppliers and customers a greater degree of comfort that they will be a compliant company in the future,” said Jacobson, who represents some U.S. suppliers to ZTE. The Commerce Department released alleged internal documents last year, showing senior ZTE executives instructing the company to carry out a project for dodging export controls in Iran, North Korea, Syria, Sudan and Cuba. ZTE replaced the senior executives allegedly involved, including naming a new president, and also appointed a new, U.S.-based chief export compliance officer. The Shenzhen-based company has a U.S. subsidiary in Richardson, Texas. A settlement also would likely include the imposition of a compliance monitor, experts have told Reuters. The uncertainty has already weighed on ZTE’s business. In January, company sources told Reuters that the equipment maker was cutting about 3,000 jobs, or 5 percent of its 60,000 global workforce.

ZTE replaced the senior executives allegedly involved, including naming a new president, and also appointed a new, US-based chief export compliance officer. The Shenzhen-based company has an American subsidiary in Richardson, Texas. ZTE shares face pressure after layoff reports A settlement also would likely include the imposition of a compliance monitor, experts said. The uncertainty has already weighed on ZTE’s business. In January, company sources said the equipment maker was cutting about 3,000 jobs, or five per cent of its 60,000 global workforce. The Commerce Department investigation followed reports by Reuters in 2012 that the company had signed contracts to ship millions of dollars worth of hardware and software from some of America’s best-known technology companies to Iran’s largest telecoms carrier.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Hong Kong the most expensive Asian city to build anything in, survey reveals 2 Malaysia’s PM says North Korea is holding citizens hostage 3 Cathay Pacific training flight makes emergency return to HK 4 Is murder of Kim Jong-nam forcing China’s hand against North Korea? 5 Death by a thousand job cuts: the human cost of China’s zombie firms Shared 1 Hong Kong the most expensive Asian city to build anything in, survey reveals 2 Banned shark fins ‘discovered’ in cargo of freight companies 3 How China’s Airbnb clones went from copycats to copied 4 Malaysia’s PM says North Korea is holding citizens hostage 5 Cathay Pacific training flight makes emergency return to HK Commented 1 Hong Kong chief executive sues lawmaker for defamation 2 Hong Kong the most expensive Asian city to build anything in, survey reveals 3 Three donations to jailed Hong Kong policemen’s fund rejected 4 Police urged to reject ‘questionable’ cash for jailed officers’ families 5 Police round up 11 thought to have helped mainlanders get UK visas       You may also like China Beijing pledges more tax cuts ... but can they jump-start China’s economy? 6 Mar 2017 - 11:23pm 5 Useful gadgets?

Twitter is teaming up with some of the world’s top eSports companies as it continues to ink more and more live-streaming deals. The company today announced a global partnership with three leading eSports event operators — ESL, DreamHack, and Intel Extreme Masters — to livestream more than 15 eSports events and 1,500 hours of programming, including a weekly 30-minute show exclusive to Twitter. The partnership will kick off Saturday with Intel’s Katowice tournament streamed on Twitter for free. “Esports is growing at a rapid pace and we see this collaboration as a way to tap into the engaged audience of gamers that are already using Twitter as a primary source of content,” Twitter COO Anthony Noto said in a statement. “By partnering with the leading esports companies like ESL and DreamHack, we look forward to bringing the best of esports live video and conversation together on Twitter.” Twitter, which first began streaming eSports events last year, said it will sell advertising packages with “TV style ad spots” and highlight/recap clips “that advertisers can sponsor and promote on Twitter.” You can watch the streams at esl.twitter.com, iem.twitter.com, and dreamhack.twitter.com, or on Twitter’s mobile app. Twitter is focusing heavily on live video content as it tries to add more monthly active users (it added just two million over the last quarter) and earn more revenue (it lost $400 million in 2016). The company live streamed 10 NFL games last season and partners with other top sports leagues like the NBA, MLB, and the PGA Tour; Twitter streamed 600 hours of live programming during Q4, with 50 percent of that sports-related. It also is looking at non sports-related content, as it has deals with media giants like Bloomberg and CBS. Other companies like Amazon and Facebook, which may start streaming MLB games, are also looking to ink streaming deals with major leagues. With Twitter now streaming eSports, which will have an estimated audience of nearly 400 million this year, it will compete with Amazon-owned game-streaming site Twitch.

Trump appeared to be referring to Sessions's statements before the Senate Judiciary Committee during his confirmation, when Sessions said he had not spoken to Russian officials. It was revealed this week that Sessions twice spoke with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. last year. "Jeff Sessions is an honest man. He did not say anything wrong," Trump said in a statement posted to social media. "He could have stated his response more accurately, but it was clearly not intentional." ADVERTISEMENT Sessions came under fire Wednesday night after it was revealed that he spoke with Russia's envoy to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak, during the campaign. The existence of the conversations appeared to contradict statements Sessions made during his Jan. 10 confirmation hearing. Responding to Sen. Al FrankenAl FrankenSessions on Russia testimony: 'My answer was correct' Dem threatens to block deputy attorney general nominee over special prosecutor Franken: Sessions should come back before the Judiciary Committee MORE (D-Minn.), who asked how he would handle possible contacts between Trump campaign aides and the Kremlin, Sessions told senators that he never communicated with Russian officials. "If there was any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what would you do?" Franken asked. "I'm not aware of any of those activities,” Sessions responded. “I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians." Bowing to bipartisan pressure on Thursday, Sessions recused himself from any federal investigation of Russia's intervention in the 2016 presidential election, though some Democrats maintain he should also resign. Sessions denied he intentionally misled senators and said he did not "recall any specific political discussions" during his conversations with Kislyak before the November election. Sessions's office has maintained that the talks were appropriate because Sessions sat on the Armed Services Committee while in the Senate. His recusal came shortly after Trump told reporters while touring an aircraft carrier that he had "total" confidence in his attorney general and that he didn't think Sessions needed to recuse himself. "The Democrats are overplaying their hand. They lost the election and now, they have lost their grip on reality," Trump said in his statement late Thursday. "The real story is all of the illegal leaks of classified and other information. It is a total witch hunt!" Updated: 8:54 p.m. Tags Jeff Sessions, Al Franken   View the discussion thread.
