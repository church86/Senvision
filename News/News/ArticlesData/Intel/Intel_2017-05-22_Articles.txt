Michael Flynn during the closing months of the 2016 presidential election refused to say whether he had been questioned or received a subpoena in connection with the ongoing investigation into the dealings of Trump associates during the campaign. “I cannot comment on that,” Ekim Alptekin told ABC News in an interview on Monday. Alptekin, who was in Washington, D.C. attending a Turkish-American business conference at the Trump International Hotel, founded a Dutch-based company called Inovo that paid the Flynn Intel Group more than $500,000 during the presidential campaign, according to papers Flynn filed with the Department of Justice. Flynn had previously registered as a lobbyist for the firm, but Flynn’s attorneys advised that he file additional documents with the Justice Department identifying himself as an agent for a foreign government. The attorneys believed the work could be construed as principally benefitting the Turkish government, a finding that would trigger the need for registration. “Because of the subject matter of Flynn Intel Group’s work for Inovo BV, which focused on Mr. Fethullah Gulen, whose extradition is sought by the Government of Turkey, the engagement could be construed to have principally benefitted the Republic of Turkey,” wrote a lawyer for the Flynn Intel Group in a letter to the Department of Justice. “To eliminate any potential doubt, the Flynn Intel Group therefore is electing to file a registration under FARA, in lieu of its prior LDA registration.” Alptekin disputed that assessment. “I’ve never represented the government of Turkey,” he said. “All of the reports that implicated or imply that I was in any way representing the government are simply not true.” Gulen is a Turkish cleric who lives in Pennsylvania who has been blamed by the Turkish government for orchestrating a failed military coup in July. In November, The Hill published an op-ed written by Flynn comparing Gulen to Osama bin Laden and urging the U.S. to “adjust our foreign policy to recognize Turkey as a priority.” “The forces of radical Islam derive their ideology from radical clerics like Gülen, who is running a scam,” Flynn wrote. “We should not provide him safe haven. In this crisis, it is imperative that we remember who our real friends are.” Flynn has long been a controversial figure. He served in the Obama administration but left government service in 2014 after being reportedly forced out of his position as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Flynn later took a prominent role in the Trump campaign, paving the way to his appointment as Donald Trump’s National Security Adviser. He was forced to resign, however, shortly after the inauguration, after the administration learned he misled Vice President Mike Pence about private discussions he had with the Russian ambassador. At the same time, Flynn’s private work for and speech fees from foreign sources also began attracting scrutiny. Alptekin said in an interview that it was unnerving to see his name and that of his company surface in connection with the unfolding scandal. “I think unfortunately there’s a highly politicized situation in the United States in which a lot of facts are being distorted — there’s a lot of misunderstanding and misperceptions,” Alptekin said. “I don’t think this is a very healthy environment unfortunately. I hope the United States will overcome this period as soon as possible so we can all move forward.” Earlier this month, sources told ABC News that associates of Flynn Intel Group received grand jury subpoenas in recent weeks, stemming from the FBI investigation being led out of the U.S. Attorney’s Office at the Eastern District of Virginia. Those associates have not been identified publicly. Flynn, meanwhile, has refused to honor a Senate committee’s subpoena request for documents relating to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. “He will not be producing the documents they sought,” a source close to Flynn told ABC News. “He is entitled to decline, pursuant to the Fifth Amendment.” Copyright © 2017, ABC Radio.

HP upgrades Envy and Spectre x2 laptop lineups by Wayne Manion  11:35 AM on May 22, 2017 By most accounts, Microsoft has done a pretty good job of iterating and expanding its Surface hybrid tablet machines since their introduction at the beginning of the Windows 8 era. One of the original purposes of the Surface line was likely to provoke other Windows PC builders to explore novel form factors. If that was the goal, HP's refreshed line of portable PCs makes it look like Microsoft's push was successful. The Envy x360 is built around a 15.6" touchscreen display compatible with Microsoft's Ink pen input technology. The panel is surrounded by a thin bezel that's part of a mission to keep the exterior dimensions small. The 360° hinge allows the machine to be used as a conventional laptop, a tent-style content-consumption screen, or as a tablet in a pinch. A grab-bag of internals specifications is available, with everything from AMD APUs to combinations of Intel Core i7 CPUs and Nvidia GeForce 940MX graphics cards in the mix. At least some models will be capable of supporting dual 4K screens through an HDMI 2.0 port and a USB 3.1 Type-C connector, though we suspect this capability is reserved for only the higher-spec versions. We must note that the AMD APUs on offer are last-generation FX affairs, and that HP calls the Intel chips "next-generation" units. HP's more conventional Envy laptops are available in 13.3" and 17.3" sizes. Either way, the machines sport Intel Core i5 and Core i7 processors with the same vague "next generation" description. Older Envy 13 machines were limited to members of Intel's substantially slower Core m CPU lineup. The 13.3" model is only 0.55" (14 mm) thick, and the Envy 17 is only a little thicker at 0.91" (23 mm). Both models have a lifted hinge design that uses the back of the laptop display panel as a foot to raise the rear of the machine for a higher angle for typing. The machine comes with Type-A USB ports and a Type-C connector that can be used for charging. Like the Envy x360, high-spec models with a Nvidia GeForce 940MX card can drive two 4K displays. The most Surface-like PC in HP's refresh roundup is the Spectre x2. The Spectre x2 has a tablet form factor with a keyboard and touchpad assembly that attaches with magnets for the times when touch input and the included pen are not enough. The 12.3" Ink-compatible touchscreen has a Surface-like 3:2 aspect ratio. HP doesn't say what's the resolution but mentions that the display has six megapixels—simple math says the resolution should be around 3000x2000. Intel seventh-generation Core i5 and i7 CPUs with Iris IGPs are on offer. A fast charge feature allows users to charge the battery for 30 minutes to net eight hours of cord-free use. All storage options are solid-state offerings, with a 1 TB PCIe SSD sitting atop the pile. The rest of the details are pretty thin, but we know that a pair of USB Type-C ports will be included. All four new machines are expected to start shipping in June, with starting prices ranging between $900 and $1050. Getting some of the fancier upgrades like large SSDs and discrete graphics cards will certainly add substantial bulk to the bottom line.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 23 May 2017 | MYT 9:30 AM Smart bangle delivers pregnancy tips to Asian wrists Coel (right), which is designed to withstand the rough and tumble of daily chores, delivers two wellness messages a week in the local language, including what to eat and when to see the doctor. — Grameen Intel MUMBAI: A high-tech bangle that alerts pregnant women to toxic fumes and issues audio tips promises to boost maternal health in South Asia, as smart devices deliver ever more services to remote communities.  The colourful, lightweight bangle also bypasses phone-owning men – feeding information directly to expectant mothers – and is built to withstand the rigours of village life.  "In rural areas, mobile connectivity – and mobile access for women – is an issue, as phones are controlled by men," said Pavel Hoq, chief operating officer at Grameen Intel Social Business, which developed the new device.  "While we had also developed mobile apps for maternal health, we realised a wearable device solely for women, something she would likely wear all the time, would be better to connect with women in rural areas," he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  Made of durable plastic, the bangle is water-resistant and has a long-lasting battery that does not require charging throughout the duration of a pregnancy.  Nor does it not need an internet connection to work.  Coel, or carbon monoxide exposure limiter, was created by Grameen Intel Social Business Ltd, a joint venture of Intel Corporation, and Bangladesh non-profit Grameen Trust.  The device can be recharged and reused many times, Hoq said.  New jewels  It will join a woman's regular array of bracelets, with most married women in South Asia wearing bangles made of glass, plastic or gold. The decorative finish differentiates the bangle from many other wrist-worn fitness devices or smart watches.  Coel, which is designed to withstand the rough and tumble of daily chores, delivers two wellness messages a week in the local language, including what to eat and when to see the doctor.  An alarm also sounds if high levels of carbon monoxide fumes are generated when cooking with firewood, charcoal or dung, warning the wearer to move away.  Every day, about 830 women worldwide die from pregnancy or childbirth-related complications, according to the World Health Organisation. Nearly a third of these deaths are in South Asia.  Maternal mortality is higher among women living in rural areas and poorer communities, where access to healthcare is often forbidden or curtailed due to a lack of female medics.  In Bangladesh, where more than 70% of babies are born at home, about 5,000 maternal deaths and nearly 77,000 neonatal deaths are reported annually, according to WHO.  In neighbouring India, where Coel has been tested in Uttar Pradesh – among the poorest states in the country – maternal and neonatal deaths are nearly 10 times higher.  At the same time, wearable devices including smart watches, shoes and glasses, are increasingly used for remote healthcare, such as to monitor a patient's cholesterol or insulin levels.  It is a growing market: about 2.5 million such wearable devices were sold in India last year, most priced under US$50 (RM215), according to research firm International Data Corporation.  Coel, which will be priced initially at about US$12-US$15 (RM51-RM65), will be sold in India and Bangladesh first, then in Nepal, said Hoq.  "Easy access to knowledge is crucial in these countries, particularly for first-time mothers," he said.  "We want this device to be a tool of empowerment for women." — Reuters Related Stories You May Be Interested China scrambles to tame bike chaos Texas lawmakers clear way for Uber, Lyft return to major cities The evolution of mobile phones Coway promotes a healthy lifestyle When the CEO is your mentor 10 after work habits for personal success Others Also Read Restaurant‘s first public Ramadan buffet offers 35 traditional Malay dishes Family forced to live under flyover Cricket: Australia board gambled on players' greed and lost - Chappell advertisement Latest News US top court tightens patent suit rules in blow to ‘patent trolls’ China’s troubled LeEco said to plan cutting most of US workers Apple, Visa face patent infringement lawsuit over Apple Pay Ford names Hackett as CEO to tackle car rivals, Silicon Valley Symantec says ‘highly likely’ North Korea group behind ransomware attacks Most Viewed in Tech Symantec says ‘highly likely’ North Korea group behind ransomware attacks Apple, Visa face patent infringement lawsuit over Apple Pay China’s troubled LeEco said to plan cutting most of US workers China scrambles to tame bike chaos China’s LeEco founder cedes control of listed unit amid cash crunch Ford names Hackett as CEO to tackle car rivals, Silicon Valley Google cosies up to China with AI secrets and a game of Go Sharkwatching: With more sharks and better tech, it’s the latest craze EU to conclude Google antitrust cases in next few months US top court tightens patent suit rules in blow to ‘patent trolls’ Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

By TheresePoletti Columnist Advanced Micro Devices Inc. stock continued on a volatile path Monday, as Chief Executive Lisa Su did her best to shoot down a rumor that just won’t seem to die. Su pretty much quashed any further chatter that AMD AMD, -3.24% would license some of its graphics chip designs to longtime rival Intel Corp. INTC, +1.05%  Monday at a tech conference hosted by J.P. Morgan. "We're not looking at enabling a competitor to compete with our products," $AMD CEO Lisa Su says at JPMorgan tech conference. #NotIntel— Aaron Pressman (@ampressman) May 22, 2017 Su’s comments were read as an emphatic statement that the company is not licensing any graphics designs to the world’s largest chip maker, and caused the stock to tumble about 4% on Monday after Su’s comments. It is just another in a series of swings related to expectations for a licensing deal between the two companies, which began even before Intel’s graphics deal with Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +2.13%  ended this past March. Shares originally jumped on speculation about a deal in February, then enjoyed another large leap after the chip-focused tech blog Fudzilla reported that the two companies had a deal. When AMD quietly shot down those rumors at its Financial Analysts Day later that same day, the stock plunged in response. Along with Su’s statements Monday, Intel has denied the rumors. And analysts say the entire episode was based on nothing, as Intel is under no pressure to license graphics technology after the end of its deal with Nvidia. Read also: Don’t expect AMD to get acquired, thanks to Intel deal “They don’t need a deal to do integrated graphics. They never had to have a license,” said Hans Mosesmann, managing director at Robenblatt Securities Inc., who has a buy rating on AMD. “The deal with Nvidia was basically a settlement on unrelated issues. This Intel/AMD license thing is fake news.” The licensing deal between Intel and Nvidia, in which Intel paid $1.5 billion over six years, provided a permanent license for patents filed before the deal concluded. Intel will need a license for any new graphics technology developed after March, but the chip giant has its own graphics IP and plenty of time to see if competitors come up with new approaches before striking any other deal. The volatility in AMD stock related to a silly rumor is another reminder of the tenuous nature of AMD’s investor equation, which helped its shares soar more than 300% in 2016 but has left them open to extreme volatility. AMD stock has now fallen 2.7% in 2017, while the S&P 500 index has gained 6.9% so far this year. As company executives noted last week at its analyst day, AMD has nothing to lose with its strategy of focusing on new markets such as the corporate server market and high-end personal computer segments, where its market share has dwindled to nearly nothing in those high-margin sectors in recent years. AMD will be competing with Intel in those markets, and the two companies have always enjoyed a fraught relationship, to put it mildly, which includes a previous licensing deal that does not exactly make life easy for AMD. Investors with a sense of the history between AMD and Intel would have known not to put much stock in the recent rumors, but it appears they are in for the same volatility as everyone else until we know for sure that the new product categories will help AMD rebound. If they don’t, expect another gigantic fall, this time due to actual news.

Cormac Larkin whose original research has won two awards at the Intel International Science & Engineering Fair. Picture: Denis Minihane The honour is being bestowed on Cork Leaving Certificate student Cormac Larkin, who picked up the top astronomy prize at last week’s Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) in Los Angeles. He has developed a new method to discover rare OB stars, the biggest and brightest types of star, in a galaxy over 50,000 light years from Earth. Their very bright ultraviolet light is blocked by our atmosphere, but his research combines observational and computational aspects of astronomy with data science to find new ones. The project won him the most prestigious award in his field, the $1,000 (around €900) joint award from the Astronomical Society of the Pacific and the American Astronomical Society. But it also scooped a $1,500 second prize in the ISEF physics and astronomy category, an accolade for which recipients also have an asteroid named in their honour. “It’s a fairly exclusive thing, there are hundreds of thousands of asteroids, but only 12,000 have been named after people,” said a delighted Cormac after he was honoured on his return to school at Coláiste an Spioraid Naoimh in Bishopstown. “My work is really a mix of observational and computational work, but there’s also a lot of computer science involved,” he explained. Cormac plans to publish his research in academic journals, but he is looking forward in the meantime to finishing his Leaving Certificate. He hopes to study astrophysics at third level after he gets his results in August. His will not be the only Irish name being added to the list of asteroids, however, as another Leaving Certificate student also won a second prize in her category at ISEF. Caolann Brady from St Wolstan’s Community College in Celbridge, Co Kildare, was honoured in the biomedical and health science category for her project which identified humming and breathing techniques to help treat asthma. She was at the event in LA, where 1,800 young scientists from 75 countries showcased their research after winning the top prize at Ireland’s SciFest last November. Cormac won first prize in the chemical, physical and mathematical science category at the BT Young Scientist & Technology Exhibition. His work has identified 26 candidate OB stars, a 10% increase in the known population in the Small Magellanic Cloud galaxy. Using a two-metre diameter telescope in Australia, all seven of those surveyed to date to within the instrument’s accuracy have been confirmed. His research will be furthered over the next year through work on the southern hemisphere’s largest telescope, after he was recently awarded time on the 10m Southern African Large Telescope.

Ryan McQueeney Zacks May 22, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Shares of Advanced Micro Devices AMD slipped more than 4.5% in morning trading Monday after a new report suggested that the company will not, in fact, strike a licensing deal with Intel INTC. Speculation about the possibility of a deal has inspired most of AMD’s price action over the past week, but it looks like the rumor is starting to fade. Nevertheless, Intel and AMD remain two of the most popular semiconductor stocks—a space that has continued to thrive this year. Increased demand from several upstart consumer trends—including the Internet of Things, PC gaming, and self-driving cars—has breathed new life into this classic investor-favorite industry (also read: How to Invest in the "Internet of Things"). So with an Intel-AMD deal presumably not materializing, the two chipmakers continue to be competitors with entirely different stories. Intel is still the industry behemoth looking to maintain its top-dog status, while AMD is a compelling growth story with tons of investor interest. But despite their differences, we can’t forget that AMD is basically the only significant rival to Intel in the market for x86-based microprocessors. And while their rivalry certainly doesn't preclude an investor from holding both stocks, it’s always interesting to put two competitors head-to-head. After all, some of us may want a more diversified portfolio. If you think you only have enough room for one of these stocks, let’s take a look at which one is the better buy right now. Head-to-Head As we jump into our head-to-head comparison of Intel and AMD, let’s check out a few key stats from both companies: As we can see right off the bat, Intel has the edge in our key Zacks metrics. Thanks to a whopping 14 positive revisions to its full-year EPS estimate within the past 30 days, Intel has earned a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The stock is also displaying solid fundamental strength, as displayed by its “A” grade in our overall VGM category. And while AMD has seen four positive full-year earnings estimate revision within the same timeframe, its Zacks Rank is being held down a bit by the one negative revision is has also seen. Furthermore, Intel has been a consistent overachiever recently, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of nearly 7% in each of the trailing four quarters. On the other hand, AMD—which is a loss-making company at the moment—has only matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the last two quarters. Still, it’s easy to see why AMD is a popular stock right now. Our current consensus estimates would represent full-year EPS growth of more than 85% on sales growth of nearly 12%. That’s the kind of impressive growth that gets investors excited. In contrast, Intel looks to be growing at a slower pace, which makes sense for a company of its size and stature. Heading forward, the success of each company will depend on the quality of their products and the demand of their customers. There are plenty of opportunities for semiconductor manufacturers, and there should be enough demand to go around, but growth will depend on producing and marketing the right tech at the right time.

Verizon, Ericsson and Intel are taking the opportunity to showcase consumer-facing entertainment aspects of ultra high capacity and ultra low latency network throughput including streaming virtual reality and 360-degree, 4K video. For the showcase in Speedway, Ind., Verizon deployed a 5G trial network using Ericsson network equipment and Intel’s in-home gateway device. The user experience involves using a headset, which provides a 4K, 360-degree view of the track that supplemented with virtual reality elements. Other use cases touted by the companies include crystal-clear security camera feeds that can be tapped through the cloud, other VR and AR interactions, and providing a platform for internet of things devices and services. The group also looked ahead to how full-blown commercial 5G will impact the user experience for major sporting events like the Indianapolis 500. From a statement, 5G and the video services being demoed can be coupled with in-car sensor data “allowing fans to virtually take the driver’s seat.” Beyond the viewer experience, real-time data analysis will allow pit crews to drive innovation around vehicle/driver performance and race safety. Beyond the smart home demo, Verizon will use the 5G network to connect to driver Will Power’s No. 12 Verizon Team Penske Dallara/Chevrolet IndyCar Series vehicle. Using Ericsson radio, antenna, processing and beam forming and tracking equipment, testing saw “sustained broadband speeds” of more than 6.4 Gbps between a base station and a car moving around 60 mph. Adam Koeppe, vice president of network planning for Verizon, said, “Mobile data networks will become the backbone of the 21st century, with Verizon and Ericsson going beyond 4G to support the internet of things to come. From autonomous vehicles to enhanced communication to passenger entertainment, we’re building performance and reliability into the core of this new network, just as it is the backbone of every Indianapolis 500 winner.” Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Related Posts Related Posts 5G augmented reality connected car Smart Home virtual reality About Author Sean Kinney Managing EditorSean Kinney focuses on multiple subject areas including DAS, small cells, cloud computing, 5G and Internet of Things vertical applications.

In addition, Rahul was one of the Best in Category winners that received a Grand Award, the Intel Indo-US Science & Technology Visit to India Award, a two-week, all expense paid trip to India to attend a science and technology immersion program. Rahul Subramaniam’s project is an Early Warning System for Zika Virus in Mosquito Populations Based on Real-Time Field Detection of Viral RNA in Mosquito Saliva – Rahul created an inexpensive and consumer-friendly mosquito trap with a food-source that would change color (in ~30min) if any of the (feeding) mosquitoes were infected with Zika. Rahul is the first known researcher in literature to detect mosquito saliva in a live trap; this enabled him to detect Zika virus in that saliva in a field trap, that can be used as the initial basis for quarantine of an area that contains Zika-infected mosquitoes, before anyone gets infected. This year, a GHS record seven students won awards to attend the Intel ISEF in Los Angeles, Calif., May 14-19 based on their standings at the 2017 Connecticut STEM Fair and the 2017 Connecticut Science and Engineering Fair. Luca Barceló received an Intel ISEF second place award in the Environmental Engineering category ($1500), and was awarded a $48,000 scholarship to the University of Arizona for his project — Crowd-Sourced Detection and Mapping of Nitrate Water Pollutants via a Mobile Web-Based Image Analysis System. Luca wrote a combined Smart-Phone — computer based app that can detect Nitrate pollutants in water, in real time, based on a Smartphone photograph.  This pollution data can then be posted, along with the GPS coordinates, to create a “crowd-sourcing” map of water pollution, so that avoidance and/or clean up can be planned.  Shobhita Sundaram received an Intel ISEF fourth place award in the Cellular and Molecular Biology category ($500), and also received a $1000 Special Award from NSA for her project — Detection of Premalignant Pancreatic Cancer via Computational Analysis of Serum Proteomic Profiles. Shobhita developed a software algorithm that can examine mass spectroscopy data of a patient’s blood, prior to the onset of any signs of pancreatic cancer, and based on inter-related presence of protein biomarkers, can predict whether that person will eventually develop pancreatic cancer.  The application of her algorithm for pre-diagnosis of this otherwise (often) deadly disease represents a major breakthrough for pre-testing of those with a family history or suspicion of the disease, as curative surgery in the disease’s early stages is often successful. Four additional Greenwich High School students were awarded the opportunity to participate in the 2017 Intel ISEF to present their projects: Agustina Stefani: Carbon Capture and Storage via Silver Nanoparticle Catalyzed Hydration of Carbon Dioxide. Connor Li: Optimization of Vertically Aligned Boron Nitride Nanotube Membranes via Magnetic Arrangement in a Lyotropic Precursor for Water Transport Applications. Michelle Xiong: Development of a CNT/ZnO/TiO2 Membrane for Visible-Light Induced Photocatalytic Filtration of Water-Borne Organic and Bacterial Pollutants. Ethan Novek: Novel Low-Temperature Carbon Capture Using Aqueous Ammonia and Organic Solvents. Each of the seven Greenwich High School 2017 Intel ISEF students is to be congratulated for their innovative, award-winning discoveries. They conduct their research as part of the Greenwich High School Science Research course led by teacher/advisor Andrew Bramante.

Related Oliver Stone Goes Face To Face With Putin: "You'll See A Different Point Of View" -- Deadline Disruptors Rather than turn over the records, the retired lieutenant general’s lawyers sent the committee a letter saying their client is invoking his Fifth Amendment rights because of the “escalating public frenzy against him” and DOJ’s naming former FBI Director Rob Mueller as special counsel, creating a “legally dangerous environment for [Flynn] to cooperate with a Senate investigation.” The Senate Intelligence Committee is conducting an investigation into Russian meddling in the presidential race and whether Trump campaign members colluded with Russia on that. Multiple intelligence agencies in this country agreed in January that Russia meddled in the race to hurt Hillary Clinton. Trump asked Flynn to resign in February, attributing the move to press revelations that he misled Veep Mike Pence about his conversations with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Subsequent press reports indicate Team Trump had known about that much sooner. Flynn asked for immunity in March, but the Senate Intel Committee was not receptive. Flynn’s attorney said his client wanted to talk in exchange for immunity, teasing, “General Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit.” Which brought to mind that gag of Flynn’s, which he tried out on NBC’s Sunday Beltway show Meet the Press a few months before that: “When you are given immunity, that means you probably committed a crime.” Of course, he was talking about Clinton, of whom Flynn led “Lock Her Up” chants at the RNC. And Trump, at a campaign rally back then, had echoed those thoughts on Clinton, telling fans and TV cameras, “If you’re not guilty of a crime, what do you need immunity for?” When Flynn sought immunity, Trump reacted via Twitter: Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 31, 2017 In addition to the Senate committee, the House and the FBI are also investigating Russian meddling in the election.

Damien • on May 22, 2017 10:25 am It doesn’t matter. Trump will not be re-elected with all of these FBI and congressional investigation clouds hanging over his administration. What goes around comes around. Reply smalltownqb • on May 22, 2017 11:03 am The only thing you need to pay attention to is the economy. If it is going well he will have. I problem getting reflected. Don’t underestimate the power of an individuals 401k plan at the voting booth. Reply • on May 22, 2017 1:16 pm Which is to say Americans only care about wealth, while morals and ethics be damned. Doesn’t it just make you want to wave that flag with pride…. Reply mdv • on May 22, 2017 11:15 am The ‘Trump won’t win because fill-in-the-blank reason’ has already proven to be a shockingly inaccurate once. Reply lsb • on May 22, 2017 11:35 am Just wait for it, it will come and maybe even before 2020, remember one very important thing, liberals are energized, the magic number is 24-4, Trump supporters need to remember that very important set of numbers. Reply • on May 22, 2017 1:17 pm The only underestimated was how gullible Americans are when a con man comes knocking. Reply Anton Forrest • on May 22, 2017 2:40 pm fool me once, shame on you. fool me twice, shame on me. Trump isn’t getting away with suckering the American people twice. Reply DE • on May 22, 2017 10:28 am Here comes the 5th, here comes the 5th, here comesss the 5thhhh, and hiding behind the dirt. There will be Oliver North moment, in full uniform. What is it with military men who are too loyal to a certain man or a cause, but never the constitution? Who trained them? False patriotism always ends in the 5th. Reply BK • on May 22, 2017 10:33 am Lock him up! Lock him up! Reply • on May 22, 2017 10:36 am Didn’t Trump once say if you’re innocent, why would you plead the Fifth? Flynn will now be charged and the dominoes will begin to fall. Reply • on May 22, 2017 10:43 am He can hide, but he cannot run with Mueller on this case. Flynn will talk sooner or later or go to jail for contempt among other possible violations. Plus, and this should bring some joy to those reading, the longer this goes the more it will deplete any funds Flynn may have. His legal costs will run into the millions. Reply Bob Dunn • on May 22, 2017 1:03 pm Republicans in the Senate deliberately refused Flynn immunity so that he’d plead the 5th and wouldn’t testify or turn over the records they “pretended” to want. Democrats who pushed for immunity should point out this baldfaced ploy to the American public, which is, quite frankly,i pretty gullible. Reply • on May 22, 2017 3:22 pm He’ll still be charged. And Stone and Manafort have just turned over documents. Ruh roh. Reply cadavra • 7 hours ago Dick Cheney famously said that “if there’s a 1% change you’re guilty, then you’re probably guilty.” I’d say the likelihood of Flynn’s guilt is a lot higher than 1%. Reply Jonathan Holland Becnel • 4 hours ago “Multiple Intelligence Agencies” Yeah, if by multiple u mean CIA, NSA, and FBI colluding to onfuscate the truth. Flynns a piece a shit. After him get Clinton.

In 2016 Intel employees devoted more than 213,000 volunteer hours within the Sacramento region. On May 2 Intel’s top volunteers were recognized at the Intel Involved Matching Grant Celebration. Representing the El Dorado Union High School District were Superintendent Stephen Wehr, Oak Ridge High School Assistant Principal Don Azevada and Intel’s 2016 Top Volunteer Awardee Deanne Barton, who spent hundreds of hours last year as Oak Ridge’s varsity football program coordinator. At the event the district received $24,250 in matching Intel grant funds that will be used toward creating a computer science pathway course for the students and purchasing science lab equipment and iPads for data collection and testing. The district thanks the Intel employees for their continued dedication to volunteering. • Forty-five students from El Dorado High School’s AVID 1, 2 and 3 classes recently had the opportunity to explore the campuses of California State University, San Francisco, and the University of San Francisco. AVID (Advancement Via Individual Determination) is a college readiness program designed to help students develop the skills to be successful in college and is in place at all four of the El Dorado Union High School District’s comprehensive high schools. A former El Dorado student, who now attends San Francisco State, met the group for lunch and answered questions the students had about applying and attending the university. She also shared her experiences coming from El Dorado High School and moving to the city. Guidance counselor Kari Fregoso said, “It was truly an amazing trip because of how well our students behaved and how overwhelmingly appreciative they were. They truly exemplified what an AVID student represents and I felt proud they belonged to the EDUHSD family.”   Announcements May Mixer time May 25: The El Dorado County Chamber of Commerce mixer is at Thompsons Family of Dealerships, Thompsons Buick GMC, 55 Placerville Drive in Placerville, on Thursday from 5:30-7:30 p.m. This is a grand opening and ribbon cutting and there will be prizes, no-host bar, appetizers and fun.

It’s a useful backdrop, as the frenzied adventure of the Indianapolis 500 will push the team to ensure a successful demonstration. Should the trio be fruitful in their venture, it would be a useful marketing platform to push the multi-gigabit per second speeds and ultra-low latency ambitions in the fast approaching 5G world. In another demonstration leading up to this trial, Verizon and Ericsson claim to have achieved sustained broadband speeds of 6.4 Gb/sec in a car moving at a speed of 60 mph; that’s certainly a good start but the Indianapolis 500 will be another beast. Scott Dixon, who will start on pole during the race, posted an average speed of 232.164 mph (373.632 kph) during the qualifications. “5G will bring new experiences and business opportunities like exciting virtual reality in 4K and ultra-fast wireless home broadband,” said Asha Keddy, GM of Next Generation and Standards in the Communication and Devices Group at Intel. “Intel, Verizon and Ericsson’s work in establishing early trials and testing is essential to deliver on our vision of making all devices smart and connected.” One of the residential demonstrations will showcase a live 360-degree view of the racetrack using VR and high-resolution 4K 360-degree video streaming live over the air. The demonstration will use an in-home gateway based on the Intel’s 5G Mobile Trial Platform and connected home technology, which the team ultimately hopes will deliver speeds up to 100 times faster than existing networks. Should the demonstration prove to be successful, it could certainly open the door to a very interesting and accessible use case for VR; live sporting events. Considering the price of tickets to attend some sporting events, as well the global nature of some teams fan bases, VR could be a gateway to open up live, in-venue experiences. For sports enthusiasts, it could be a game-changer for how sports are watched in the living room.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Laptops HP's revamped lineup gives you three new reasons to forget the Microsoft Surface David Nield May 22, 2017 HP has new devices rocking the latest Intel and AMD chips, including the Spectre x2 View gallery - 8 images HP has taken the opportunity of the Cannes Film Festival to refresh three of its laptop and 2-in-1 lines, unveiling a new Spectre x2, a new Envy x360 convertible, and two new Envy laptops. In other words: Watch your back, Microsoft. Starting with the Spectre x2 2-in-1, the second generation of this device, you get a choice of the latest Intel i7 Core processors, 8 GB of memory and 360 GB of solid-state storage. Perhaps the star of the show is a new 3,000 x 2,000 pixel touchscreen display, the same number of pixels as the Surface Book – though in this case on a 12.3-inch screen (293 PPI) rather than a 13.5-inch one (267 PPI). NEW ATLAS NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT Upgrade to a Plus subscription today, and read the site without ads. It's just US$19 a year.UPGRADE NOW This is, however, more of a Surface Pro 4 rival rather than a device designed to take on the Surface Book. It's worth noting that many are expecting Microsoft to announce the next successor in the Surface Pro line at a Shanghai event this week. The 13-inch Envy laptop combines a thin and light frame with impressive processing power Graphics performance should be decent for a 2-in-1 like this, as HP has opted for the Intel chips with Iris Plus embedded graphics. The company says you'll get around 8 hours of use between battery charges, though as usual don't automatically take that at face value. If a detachable screen doesn't really appeal, then the new Envy x360 model could be for you. It's a convertible laptop-tablet hybrid, letting you rotate the screen all the way back to lie flat over the base of the keyboard if you want to use it in tablet mode. Like the Spectre x2, it's a device we first saw in 2015. The upgraded model brings with it a full HD, 1,920 x 1,080 pixel 15.6-inch screen (141 PPI), your choice of Intel (i5 or i7) or AMD (A9, A12 or FX) processors, up to 16 GB of RAM and 1 TB of storage space. There's an HDMI out port built-in, so it's easy to get your work up on a bigger display. The 17-inch Envy laptop gives you more power and more screen space, though less battery life These devices are in a separate category of 2-in-1s to the Spectre x2, sharing shelf space with the likes of the Lenovo Yoga range. Battery life tops out at 10 hours, HP says, though it depends on the model you buy. Finally, if you're in the market for a laptop with a screen that doesn't detach, bend over or do any other kind of trick, both the 13-inch and 17-inch Envy laptops get a refresh, with tweaks to the external design and more power under the hood. Both laptops come with 1,920 x 1,080 pixel resolution and offer an optional fingerprint sensor, and for the 17-inch model there's the option to up that resolution to 4K. The smaller model gives you one of the latest Intel i5 processors, 8 GB of memory, and 128 GB of solid-state storage, all crammed into a 0.55-inch thin frame that gives you an impressive 14 hours of battery life (HP says). The larger model ups the processor to an Intel i7 model and the RAM to 16 GB, but sticks with a mechanical hard drive offering 1 TB of room. An Nvidia GeForce GRX 940MX graphics chip is built in too, so that's the one to get if you value performance over portability. The Envy x360 convertible does double-duty as a laptop and tablet Notably, all these new devices are using the new seventh-generation processors from Intel or AMD, which means they should get closer than ever to the goal of desktop-level performance in a computer you can carry around with you. As with any laptop or 2-in-1, what matters is the bang for buck, and HP seems to have found a good balance here too: Prices start at US$999.99 for the Spectre x2, $899.99 for the Envy x360, $1,049.99 for the 13-inch Envy and, $999.99 for the 17-inch Envy. That last laptop is on sale now, with the others to follow in June. Press releases and spec sheets can only tell you so much, but on paper at least, this is a refreshed line-up that could well do enough to tempt buyers away from the Surface range.

By Gordon Mah Ung Executive Editor, PCWorld | May 22, 2017 5:45 AM PT Credit: Melissa Riofrio More like this HP's Elite x2 is the Surface Pro 4 update we wish Microsoft would make The best laptops of 2017: Ultrabooks, budget PCs, 2-in-1s, and more Surface Laptop: Everything you need to know Video Surface Pro 4 vs. Surface Book: How to decide HP's second-generation Spectre x2 is here to distract us from the rumored Microsoft Surface Pro 5 that may never appear, no matter how hard we wish. Announced Monday, the new Spectre x2 beats the aging Surface Pro 4 with much better features for the price, plus it corrects many of the sins of its own original version. The new Spectre x2 is expected to go on sale in June. Why this matters: The 2-in-1 laptop category is starving for innovation, especially while Microsoft can't or won't upgrade its flagship hardware. HP, with this Spectre x2 and its corporate cousin, the Elite x2, seems to be leading the charge. The better news for consumers: HP tends to stuff a lot into these higher-end PCs.   It's what's inside The biggest change internally to the Spectre x2 is skipping the low-power, somewhat slower Core M-based chips for Intel's latest 7th-gen Kaby Lake CPUs. To boost the performance even more, HP has opted for Iris Plus graphics versions of the Core i5 and Core i7. With its 64MB of embedded DRAM, Iris Plus should offer a very decent graphics advantage compared to standard HD graphics devices. RAM options will range up to 16GB of LPDDR3,  while the SSD will include options up to a 1TB PCIe. [ Further reading: Our picks for best PC laptops ] HP The updated HP Spectre x2 goes to a 3:2 aspect ratio screen and switches from Wacom to N-trig for the included pen. Going outside the box, HP has seriously revamped the Spectre x2's screen to 12.3-inch diagonal size and 3000x2000 resolution screen. Compared to the first gen Spectre x2's 16:9, 1920x1080 panel, this new model has the same aspect ratio as MIcrosoft's Surface Pro 4. The newer screen is IPS and brighter, too, with a maximum of 450 nits, slightly better than the Surface Pro 4 panel's spec. HP has also cloned the Surface Pro 4's pen tech. The original Spectre x2 used a Wacom-based pen, while the 2nd gen replaces Wacom for N-trig, which Microsoft uses for its own Surface Pen. Microsoft even bought N-trig. The N-trig pen's main appeal to PC makers is its ability to use the capacitive touch layer to sense the pen. Wacom-based devices require a separate digitizer, which adds thickness to the screen. HP also made some major changes to the Spectre x2's camera setup. The first gen gave you an actual Intel RealSense camera mounted on the rear, but it had no IR camera for  use with Microsoft's nifty Windows Hello authentication feature. While the rear-mounted depth-sensing RealSense camera was neat for making 3D scans of objects and people, Windows Hello is far more useful to most people. The new Spectre x2 places an IR camera in front so you can take advantage of Windows Hello. HP If you look closely, you can see HP removed the clumsy release for the kickstand. One annoying "feature" of the original Spectre x2 was its slide switch for popping out the kickstand. With the updated model, you just pull it out manually, like the Surface Pro 4. HP said it also increased the strength of the magnets used to keep the keyboard attached to the device to help with "lapability." Another physical change on the second-generation device that mimicks the Surface Pro 4 are the new Spectre x2's front-firing speakers. The previous gen had side-firing speakers.  For ports, HP goes with a pair of USB-C's, one each on the left and right sides. The ports don't support Thunderbolt 3 and max out at 5Gbps (half that of USB 3.1's full-throttle 10Gbps), but you do get DisplayPort out of both and USB-PD charging. Not having a USB Type A is painful, but HP does at least give you a free dongle in the box (looking at you, Apple.) HP says battery life is rated at about 7 for video playback on the 41-watt-hour battery. That battery is slightly larger than the 38-watt-hour battery used in the Surface Pro 4. HP The color's called Ash Silver, but whatever that means, the look is quite striking. HP doesn't say whether the updated Spectre s2 supports third-party USB-C chargers, but we suspect HP's newfound embrace of USB-C charging means it'll work. The original Spectre x2 was infamous for not supporting USB-C chargers not made by HP. HP also includes a standard combo analog audio jack and microSD. Gone, it looks like, is the standard LTE modem the previous model had. The makings of a Surface Pro killer What really makes the updated Spectre x2 a Surface Pro 4 killer is the price. HP says a Spectre x2 with Core i5 (and Iris Plus graphics, we believe), 8GB of LPDDR3 RAM, and 128GB SSD will be $999 when it goes on sale in June. A Core i7 version with Iris Plus graphics, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD will hit $1,280. For $999, Microsoft gives you a Core i5 Skylake-based CPU, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB SSD—and no freaking keyboard. With the keyboard, that Surface Pro 4 will set you back $1,129. Mind you, this is at the end of life for the Surface Pro 4. Last year, it would have cost you closer to $1,400 for a Surface Pro 4 with somewhat comparable hardware. Let's just say that I don't expect a new Surface Pro 5 to be as cheap as the current Surface Pro 4.  To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

Ron Amadeo - May 22, 2017 3:38 pm UTC Enlarge Valentina Palladino reader comments 47 Share this story The Samsung Chromebook Pro is finally going to be a real device. Lost in the hubbub of Google I/O Friday, Samsung quietly dropped a press release pegging the device for a May 28 release date. With the Chromebook Pixel off the market, the all-aluminum, touch-and-pen enabled, Android app-packing Samsung "Chromebook" models were immediately looked to as the flagships of the Chromebook universe. Samsung announced the ARM-powered Chromebook Plus and Intel-powered Chromebook Pro at CES in January, and the Plus saw a reasonable release date the next month. Review units for the faster, Intel-powered Chromebook Pro went out in February, too, but the actual release date remained a mystery. Further ReadingSamsung’s Chromebook Pro gives me hope in Chrome OS—thanks to Android’s helpNow it's May, and almost five months after the announcement, the Chromebook Pro will finally hit the streets. The reason for the delay is the Android apps on Chrome OS feature. It has been around as a "beta" for some time, but wrapping things up apparently took much longer than Google expected. According to a report from The Verge, the Android on Chrome OS beta will continue into the summer. And while the Chromebook Pro's Android container will be running Android 7.0, it still won't support window resizing at launch. The Plus made it to market because the ARM-based device better matches what typical Android hardware looks like. A tiny handful of Intel-based Android phones is released every year, but apparently Chrome OS made things a little more complicated. The Intel Chromebook actually had worse Android performance than the ARM one, despite packing a faster processor. With more time to cook, hopefully the bugs have been worked out. The Chromebook Pro will be available for purchase at BestBuy.com, Amazon.com, Samsung.com, and the ShopSamsung app for $549.99.

Earlier in the week, IT news website Fudzilla had reported that Intel had signed a licensing deal with AMD after a prior deal with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) expired in March. Weighing The Probability Not only did AMD fail to mention an Intel deal at its Analyst Day on Tuesday afternoon, Citi analyst Christopher Danely said the AMD and Intel are unlikely to agree to any such GPU licensing deal in the future. A deal with AMD simply wouldn’t make sense for Intel, Danely said. Intel’s deal with Nvidia grants Intel access in perpetuity to all Nvidia patents filed prior to the deal’s expiration on March 31. The only Nvidia patents Intel will no longer have access to are the patents Nvidia filed/files after March 31. “In our view, the obligation to Nvidia is over and done, with no compelling need for Intel to license patents from wither Nvidia or AMD for legal protection,” Danely said. Related Link: The Sell-Side View On Advanced Micro Devices' Analyst Day A deal with AMD would also fail to protect Intel from potential patent disputes with Nvidia as well. AMD and Nvidia shares have been headed in opposite directions after both companies reported their first quarter earnings. In the past three months, Nvidia shares have surged higher by 24.9 percent, while AMD shares have plummeted 19.1 percent. Even after the selloff, there may be more downside ahead for AMD shareholders, Danely said. Citi maintains a Sell rating for AMD stock.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 22 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Green flag waves on 5G in Indianapolis NEW YORK, May 22, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Verizon and Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC) will use the backdrop of the 2017 Indianapolis 500, to validate how 5G will transform the lives of families and sports fans in the future. The home, located in Speedway, IN, close to the famed Indianapolis Motor Speedway, is part of Verizon’s latest pre-commercial 5G trial deployment. Inside, Verizon, Ericsson and Intel Corporation will demonstrate the many ways consumers can make the most of multi-gigabit per-second network speeds with low latency, giving consumers access to capabilities such as watching live sporting events in 360-degree Virtual Reality streamed in 4K. A live demo of the home will be streamed on Facebook on May 24 at 1:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time and can be accessed here. Intel provided the in-home gateway, based on the Intel 5G Mobile Trial Platform and Intel connected home technology, which delivers the 5G connectivity to the home. The Intel-powered network enables 360 degree video to be live streamed from the action on the track to head mounted displays, highlighting the benefits 5G will deliver to new consumer VR experiences.   With speeds up to 100 times faster than existing networks, customers in 5G- connected homes will have access to features such as gigabit fixed wireless and high bandwidth uploads. These uploads can enable applications such as cloud-based security cameras and result in smoother virtual and augmented reality experiences, not to mention allow for a myriad of other Internet of Things devices to connect to the network, creating a new level of convenience and security in customers’ daily lives. In the future, 5G will change the racing experience for Verizon IndyCar Series drivers, pit crews and spectators. With a 5G system in place, the network will be able to stream live, 360-degree video along with data from hundreds of sensors from every car and driver on the track, allowing fans to virtually take the driver’s seat. The service will also benefit race teams who will be able to react in real time, improving safety and performance. While 5G is not available outside this trial at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, demonstrating the technology during the lead up to the greatest spectacle in racing is fitting.  „From keeping my car connected during the race to staying connected while I’m on the road, Verizon is on the leading edge of technology. It’s exciting to have them test their new 5G wireless service during the Indianapolis 500,” explained Will Power, driver of the No. 12 Verizon Team Penske Dallara/Chevrolet in the Verizon IndyCar Series. „Indianapolis is the birthplace of speed and innovation for INDYCAR racing, making it a fitting place to experience the increased speed of 5G technology on the eve of the 101st running of the Indianapolis 500.” „Mobile data networks will become the backbone of the 21st century, with Verizon and Ericsson going beyond 4G to support the Internet of Things to come,” said Adam Koeppe, Vice President of Network Planning at Verizon. „From autonomous vehicles to enhanced communication to passenger entertainment, we’re building performance and reliability into the core of this new network, just as it is the backbone of every Indianapolis 500 winner.” Verizon and Ericsson also recorded a demonstration of 5G at speed, proving that this technology will reach beyond fixed connections to include smartphones, automobiles and other connected devices. During this mobility test, sustained broadband speeds of over 6.4 Gb/sec were reached in a car moving at speeds in excess of 60 mph. These results are made possible through Ericsson advanced radio, antenna and processing technology, including beam forming and beam tracking. The video – filmed at Indianapolis Motor Speedway – demonstrates to viewers 5G features like smart antenna technology. Instead of transmitting information scattered across multiple locations, 5G uses beam tracking, which beams information at a specific user even if the user is moving at highway speed, providing uninterrupted connectivity. Per Narvinger, Head of Product Area Network Systems, Ericsson says: „Ericsson is working with Verizon to push the 5G envelope and bring 5G to market with commercially ready networks. 5G will enable new use cases for people and businesses, which will make our world safer, more efficient and more environmentally sustainable.”  Asha Keddy, Vice President and General Manager of Next Generation Standards, Intel Communications and Devices Group, says: „5G will bring new experiences and business opportunities like exciting virtual reality in 4K and ultra-fast wireless home broadband. Intel, Verizon and Ericsson’s work in establishing early trials and testing is essential to deliver on our vision of making all devices smart and connected.” As the fifth generation of wireless technology, 5G will deliver enhanced fixed and mobile broadband, low-latency services and massive scale for the Internet of Things (IoT), which will transform all industries.

The new HGST Ultrastar SS300 SSDs are designed for SAS applications with mixed workloads that demand drives with endurance but are not the highest performance possible. The new drives were co-developed with Intel, so they do not have various proprietary SanDisk technologies, such as the Guardian (as some previous-gen Ultrastar SS), but support numerous new features instead. The Ultrastar SS300 drives use Western Digital’s 64-layer 512/384 Gb 3D TLC/MLC NAND memory as well as a proprietary controller that was presumably co-designed with Intel. HGST does not disclose many details regarding the chip, but it might be the same controller that powers the recently launched Intel SSD DC P4500 and P4600 drives, albeit featuring a different configuration and a different firmware. From the feature set, the Ultrastar SS300 controller supports extended error correction code (ECC with a 1x10^-17 bit error rate) to enable higher performance and data integrity, exclusive-OR (XOR) parity (in case a whole NAND die fails) as well as parity-checked internal data paths. In addition, the Ultrastar SS300 complies with the T10 Data Integrity Field (DIF) standard, which requires all interconnect buses to have parity protection (on the system level), as well as a special power loss data management feature that does not use supercapacitors. Western Digital will offer various Ultrastar SS300 models with features like TCG encryption, TCG+FIPS, and instant secure erase to comply with different security requirements. The HGST Ultrastar SS300 SSDs are aimed at various market segments, including financial transactions, e-commerce, virtualization, database analytics, etc. that generate read-intensive and mixed-use workloads and thus need both performance and reliability. The new SSDs come in a 2.5”/15 mm form-factor with SAS 12 Gb/s interface and are drop-in compatible with existing servers. Meanwhile, when compared to direct predecessors, the Ultrastar SS200, the new SS300 offer similar capacities — from 400 GB to 7.68 TB, but the new drives excel the ancestors in most possible metrics (endurance, performance, power, etc.). When it comes to performance, the HGST Ultrastar SS300 features sequential read speeds of up to 2100 MB/s (+20% vs. the SS200) as well as sequential write speeds of up to 2050 MB/s (3D MLC, +105%) or 1250 MB/s (3D TLC, +25%). Random read performance of the Ultrastar SS300 is up to 400K (+60%), while random write performance is rated at 170-200K for 3D MLC-based performance/endurance-optimized models as well as 115K-130K for capacity-optimized 3D TLC-powered drives. Interestingly, in addition to 9 W and 11 W power envelopes supported by the predecessor, the SS300 also supports a 14 W mode that unlocks “additional performance capabilities” (i.e., IOPS) as well as an ultra-low power setting.

All the Ultrastar SS300 SSDs are rated for 2.5 million hours MTBF and are covered with a five-year limited warranty (or the max PB written, whichever occurs first). Western Digital has already started to ship its SS300 SSDs to select OEM partners, including Oracle. The company does not announce pricing of the drives since they depend on configurations, volume purchasing and other factors.

Why disallow super-capacitors? Reply DanNeely - Monday, May 22, 2017 - link The linked spec doesn't talk about power loss, and I don't have time to read it all. But the way this article is written I read it as the spec requires handling it somewhere other than on the drive. Or phrased differently, the drive doesn't need caps to meet the standard; not that having caps is forbidden by it. That said I am curious what the standard is myself; is it just some sort of super journaling/etc, or moving power loss control up from individual drives to the drive array (eg the enclosure) as a whole.

(CIC) has partnered with chip maker Intel to invest in technology innovation, Intel said. CIC and Intel's investment management arm Intel Capital, will invest "in pioneering companies across a wide array of technology sectors including cleantech, software and services, mobility and digital home", Intel said in a release. The two investors will target companies outside of China, but Intel did not provide details regarding the amount of capital to be invested. President and chief investment officer of CIC Gao Xiqing said: "China Investment Corporation believes that technology is critical to economic and societal growth. We look forward to working with Intel Capital to identify the next generation of ground breaking technologies." The CIC provided a glimpse into its investments last week when it revealed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it invests about a quarter of its US-listed assets in exchange traded funds.

L2 vs. L3 cache: What’s the Difference? By Joel Hruska on May 18, 2017 at 3:17 pm Comment Yesterday we discussed how caches work, what the difference is between L1 and L2, and the various design elements that determine how fast (and how effective) a CPU’s cache is. Today, we’re going to take one step further and explore the difference between L2 and L3 caches. At its simplest level, an L3 cache is just a larger, slower version of the L2 cache. Back when most chips were single-core processors, this was generally true. The first L3 caches were actually built on the motherboard itself, connected to the CPU via the backside bus. When AMD launched its K6-III processor family, many existing K6/K-2 motherboards could accept a K6-III as well. Typically these boards had 512K-2MB of L2 cache — when a K6-III, with its integrated L2 cache was inserted, these slower, motherboard-based caches became L3 instead. By the turn of the century, slapping an additional L3 cache on a chip had become an easy way to improve performance — Intel’s first consumer-oriented Pentium 4 “Extreme Edition” was a repurposed Gallatin Xeon with a 2MB L3 on-die. Adding that cache was sufficient to buy the Pentium 4 EE a 10-20 percent performance boost over the standard Northwood line. Cache and the multi-core curveball As multicore processors became more common, L3 cache started appearing more frequently on consumer hardware. These chips, like Intel’s Nehalem and AMD’s K10 (Barcelona) used L3 as more than just a larger, slower backstop for L2. In addition to this function, the L3 cache is often shared between all of the processors on a single piece of silicon. That’s in contrast to the L1 and L2 caches, both of which tend to be private and dedicated to the needs of each particular core. (AMD’s Bulldozer design is an exception to this — Bulldozer, Piledriver, and Steamroller all share a common L1 instruction cache between the two cores in each module). Intel’s Haswell-E, for example, has eight separate cores that all back up to a common L3 cache. Private L1/L2 caches and a shared L3 is hardly the only way to design a cache hierarchy, but it’s a common approach that multiple vendors have adopted. Giving each individual core a dedicated L1 and L2 cuts access latencies and reduces the chance of cache contention — meaning two different cores won’t overwrite vital data that the other put in a location in favor of their own workload. The common L3 cache is slower but much larger, which means it can store data for all the cores at once. Sophisticated algorithms are used to ensure that Core 0 tends to store information closest to itself, while Core 7 across the die also puts necessary data closer to itself. Unlike the L1 and L2, which are nearly always CPU-focused and private, the L3 can also be shared with other devices or capabilities. Intel’s Sandy Bridge CPUs shared an 8MB L3 cache with the on-die graphics core (Ivy Bridge gave the GPU its own dedicated slice of L3 cache in lieu of sharing the entire 8MB). In contrast to the L1 and L2 caches, both of which are typically fixed and vary only very slightly (and mostly for budget parts) both AMD and Intel offer different chips with significantly different amounts of L3. Intel typically sells at least a few Xeons with lower core counts, higher frequencies, and a higher L3 cache-per-CPU ratio. Intel’s Core i7 processors have maintained an 8MB L3 since the debut of Nehalem in 2008 (roughly 2MB of L3 for every CPU core) but the highest-end parts are typically pegged at 2.5MB of cache per CPU core. Today, the L3 is characterized as a pool of fast memory common to all the CPUs on an SoC. It’s often gated independently from the rest of the CPU core and can be dynamically partitioned to balance access speed, power consumption, and storage capacity. While not nearly as fast as L1 or L2, it’s often more flexible and plays a vital role in managing inter-core communication. With Intel having already added L4 to its Skylake chips, it’s possible we’ll see the L3 take a more simplified role — with some of its functions and capabilities shifting over to the newer, larger pool of cache. Tagged In intel amd cpus memory processors xeon cache caching L2 cache L2 L1 L3 L4 Post a Comment Comment ExtremeTech Staff yes uhuh very good ExtremeTech Staff yes uhuh very nice Frank Johnson I thought Intel’s L4 cache was just for the gpu side of the processor pelov lov It can be used by the CPU as well, though I believe it’s still independent with respect to the GPU or CPU accessing it. http://www.anandtech.com/show/6993/intel-iris-pro-5200-graphics-review-core-i74950hq-tested/18 Joel Hruska It is not. A cache that was specific only to the GPU would be a frame buffer. Crystal Well can act like a frame buffer, but is not limited to such. Guest Unlike previous eDRAM implementations in game consoles, Crystalwell is true 4th level cache in the memory hierarchy. It acts as a victim buffer to the L3 cache, meaning anything evicted from L3 cache immediately goes into the L4 cache. Both CPU and GPU requests are cached. The cache can dynamically allocate its partitioning between CPU and GPU use. If you don’t use the GPU at all (e.g. discrete GPU installed), Crystalwell will still work on caching CPU requests. That’s right, Haswell CPUs equipped with Crystalwell effectively have a 128MB L4 cache. Joel Hruska In the tests I’ve been able to run, the performance difference between L4 and not-L4 wasn’t particularly large, but it’s difficult to say for certain — platform-level differences tend to intrudde and could crowd out other metrics. realtebo I love this kind of articles, please go on ! Dozerman Up next, the difference between L1 and registers! http://www.mrseb.co.uk/ Sebastian Anthony Ha. We weren’t planning to. But maybe… *gets out his notebook* Dozerman Heh massau or maybe we go to the power side of the story clock gating vs power gating etc. Dozerman That would be cool. I think I’d like a comparison of CPU cores and GPU cores, too. massau that is also a possibilety if you want to know more abouth it look up vliw and now the modern GPGPU is SIMD. its just a huge pool of small simple in order processors . while a cpu is a huge complex core. a very good article would combine cpu vs gpu while putting the chip size, chips per wafer and yields into the consideration. so people would finally know why cpus have smaller die sizes than a gpu and the cost isn’t linear for larger chips. massau i wonder what those Sophisticated algorithms are, don’t they just slit up the cache addresses by the number of cores and give each a preferred address block. so with 8MB L3 and 4 cores the 0 core will prefere the first 2MB while the last core will prefere to use the last part. these adresses will be cache close to the core. FG11 Much Better to put all 128MB on L2 Cache rather than to put 128MB on L4 Cache. LOL. its like the higher the Lcache. the slower the speed. jdwii I for one would like to meet the idiots at Amd who thought sharing L1 cache was a great idea!

Valentina Palladino - May 22, 2017 12:45 pm UTC Enlarge Valentina Palladino reader comments 34 Share this story HP announced a slew of updates to its Envy laptop line today, in addition to a mildly revamped Spectre x2. Many of these changes focus on elevating overall design, but in a practical way that doesn't impede the power and efficiency of each device. Slimmer bezels, bold edges, and USB Type-C abound, giving way to a more modern-looking Envy family and Spectre x2. Envy’s new edges Envy laptops and convertibles are getting welcome improvements: in particular, the Envy 13 looks quite different now than when Ars' Andrew Cunningham reviewed it last year. The most striking difference is the hinge, which now sports a shiny, sharp edge branded with the Envy name. Compared to the previous model's rounded hinge, this looks and feels more premium, and it still lifts the laptop slightly off its surface to allow better airflow. Although it maintains that lift-hinge and tapered design, the new Envy 13 is thinner and lighter than its predecessor, measuring .55-inches thick and weighing 2.7 pounds. Combine its new edginess with its all-metal construction and you have a laptop that appears better positioned to take on devices like the Dell XPS 13. HP's updated Spectre x2.

Valentina Palladino Further ReadingReview: Battery life and keyboard problems hinder HP Envy 13 Ultrabook The side bezels hugging the Envy 13's display are smaller now as well, measuring just 5.5mm. While the top bezel isn't quite that thin, HP still managed to put the webcam at its ideal location right above the display. The two top speakers have a new home at the top of the keyboard, close to the hinge, rather than on either side of the keys as in the previous model. This let HP extend the keys to nearly the full width of the keyboard deck, giving the 13 the appearance of a larger keyboard on a smaller frame. Many PC companies are going with this keyboard deck layout now, and it seems to be a better use of space, particularly on Ultrabooks like the Envy 13. HP added USB Type-C to this Envy 13, which is a much-needed update considering the previous model only has USB 3.0 ports. The new Envy 13 has two USB Type-C ports that support data transfer up to 5Gb/s, DisplayPort 1.2, and HP Sleep and Charge, and the device still squeezes in two USB 3.1 ports. The laptop's internals have been subtly upgraded, too: now it has a dual-core Core i7 CPU, Intel HD 620 graphics, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB PCIe SSD. The 17-inch Envy laptop also got the same new design treatment plus a few new internals. Now you can choose between an FHD or 4K display, and it supports dual drives as well. However, the Envy x360 15 is a slightly different story: it doesn't have the newfound edginess of its laptop counterparts since it has to rotate 360 degrees, but HP did update its design as well. The new model has narrower bezels on the sides and top of its FHD IPS display, and now the 15-inch convertible supports inking so you can use a stylus to write notes with Windows Ink and other apps. HP also added Intel and AMD processor support so you can choose which you prefer for this two-in-one; it supports up to Intel Core i5 CPUs and AMD FX 9800P APUs. Spectre’s updated kick Further ReadingHP Spectre x2 review: All the quality of the Surface Pro, hundreds of dollars less The second-generation Spectre x2 shows small improvements in both design and internals. The most notable visual differences are the elimination of the kickstand latch and the inclusion of a thumb notch. Instead of pressing the latch down to unlock the kickstand to put the device in laptop mode, now you can simply push the kickstand out on your own and adjust the angle to your liking. This is a less fussy way to maneuver the device and a welcome design change that makes using a convertible like this more convenient. At 7.7mm, the new Spectre x2 is also slightly thinner than the previous model, and now the included keyboard dock has a plastic back instead of a fabric one to make cleaning easier. Instead of the FHD display the device originally had, this new model has a 12.3-inch, 3000x2000-pixel IPS WLED display that supports Windows Ink. As far as internals go, HP updated the x2 to support up to Core i7 processors, moving away from the low-power Core M CPUs in the original model. It'll also have 8GB of RAM onboard, a 360GB PCIe SSD, and Intel Iris Plus 650 graphics. According to HP's estimates, the new x2 will get up to eight hours of battery life with mixed use, meaning the higher-powered processor won't affect the device's battery life. The previous, Core M-powered Spectre x2 lasted about seven hours in our testing, so we'll have to test the new model fully to see if that claim holds up. The HP Spectre x2 will be available in June starting at $999. The Envy 13 and Envy x360 15 will also be available in June starting at $1,049 and $899, respectively. The Envy 17 is available now on HP's website starting at $999.

The first is an upgrade of HP’s Spectre x2, making it into a more capable Surface Pro competitor. And the second is a slimmed down Envy 13 that makes the laptop look like it could be a better MacBook Air alternative than the Surface Laptop. The Spectre x2 — a tablet with a detachable keyboard case — was pretty well received when it was introduced two years ago, but it had one big drawback: it could only be configured with Intel’s Core m processors. That made the Spectre x2 a far less powerful device than the Surface Pro, or really just a typical laptop, and HP says it heard that customers wanted more. So it’s updated the machine this year to use Core i processors — real ones, not the Core m-style processors that Intel decided to rename Core i last year. Grid View Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge The upside of this is that the Spectre x2 should be capable of doing more than just casual web browsing. The downside is that it might run a bit hotter (though it remains fanless), and it’s going to have shorter battery life. HP is estimating just eight hours this year, down from 10 hours on the original model. The tablet has also gotten a little bit thicker, but HP has cut down its bezels so it looks better overall. HP is also updating a few other specs. The tablet still has a 12-inch display, but now it has a 3000 x 2000 resolution, up from 1920 x 1280 on the original. This model comes with a 360GB SSD, instead of a 128GB SSD. And the tablet’s two USB ports have been switched to USB-C. While there’s no one game-changing upgrade here, these all add up to put the Spectre x2 into a much more premium space, where it’ll have an easier time going head to head with the Surface Pro. It’ll go on sale next month with a starting price of $999.99. Grid View Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge The other big release from HP today is a new Envy 13 laptop. It’s a metal laptop that’s essentially HP’s answer to the MacBook Air. This year, its bezels have been narrowed down quite a bit so that the whole laptop is about 0.8 inches narrower and 0.4 inches shorter. At it actually looks a bit like Dell’s XPS 13, which makes sense since it’s competing in the same space. HP had already refreshed the Envy 13 with Kaby Lake processors, so the rest of the specs are staying pretty much the same here. It has a 13.3-inch 1080p display, a 128GB SSD (the old model started at 256GB), 8GB of RAM, and an estimated 14 hours of battery life. The new model also ditches HDMI to add an extra USB-C port, so there are now two USB-C ports and two traditional USB 3 ports. The laptop looks nice and feels sturdy. And while it isn’t as immediately catchy as the Surface Laptop, it feels like HP has a solid answer to Microsoft’s latest challenger. The Envy 13 starts at $1,049.99 and includes full Windows 10. Those are the two big changes to HP’s lineup today, but it actually has two other laptops that it’s updating as well. The Envy 17 is now a little bit thinner and comes with discrete graphics, Nvidia’s GeForce 940MX, by default. And the Envy x360 15 is getting updated with slimmer bezels, making the whole machine a little bit smaller.

By Gordon Mah Ung Executive Editor, PCWorld | May 22, 2017 3:00 AM PT AMD's Ryzen Threadripper could very well be the most powerful consumer CPU ever introduced. With 16 cores and 32 threads, it gives the high-performance Intel products currently dominating the same space something to worry about.   The CPU is so new, hard information is scant, but we've gathered the most solid stuff here. Check back as we update this story with firmer details The specs we know Core count: 16 Thread count: 32 Release date: Summer of 2017 Yup, that's it. If you've read anything else on Threadripper or "Ryzen 9," it's nothing but rumor and speculation at this point. You may say the leaks look good, but we'll point out that they didn't even seem to get the name right, so you gotta wonder. What will it be called? AMD's Jim Anderson introduced the new CPU as "Ryzen Threadripper" instead of the "Ryzen 9" moniker that had been rumored. Yes, Anderson did speak of "beyond Ryzen 7," but the lack of a 9 was glaring.  Even more telling, AMD's James Prior scolded one person on Twitter who used the number, writing: "There was no '9' in the name—it's just Ryzen Threadripper. Accuracy matters."  IDG If you thought AMD's new 16-core CPU would be Ryzen 9, think again. What can previous Ryzen reviews tell us about what to expect from Threadripper performance? We won't know the full effect of Ryzen Threadripper's 16 cores and 32 threads until we test it. Meanwhile, our reviews of Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 can give you insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the Ryzen family. Threadripper could perform quite differently, however, if it does indeed have increased memory bandwidth from the rumored quad-channel controller. We also don't know the final clock speeds. For the most part, the core performance shouldn't change much, but stay tuned for our review. What about the 14, 12, and 10-core versions? The only Threadripper AMD formally announced was the 16-core part. Yes, we know you've seen reports of 14, 12, and 10-core versions. We think that would make a lot of sense, as it matches up with previous CPU introductions. Gordon Mah Ung AMD's long-awaited Ryzen 7 1800X is a multi-threaded monster. What about the chipset and other specs? Again, there is no official news on this front, but the rumor mills have been active, saying all versions of the "Ryzen 9" would feature 44 PCIe lanes and quad-channel RAM support on the X390 and X399 chipset and the SP3 socket using 4,094 pins.The model numbers would predictably run in the 1900s, with the 10-core being the "Ryzen 9 1955" and the top end 16-core labeled as the "Ryzen 9 1998X." The same rumor mills put the thermals at 155 watts at the top down to 125 watts at the bottom. Again, these are rumors, but with Computex  and E3 just around the corner we should get firmer information soon. What will Threadripper go up against? Threadripper will immediately go head-to-head with Intel's top consumer processor, the Core i7-6950X. As we found in our review of that 10-core Broadwell CPU, it's a beast in its own right. One cool feature introduced in the Core i7-6950X is TurboBoost Max, which grades every CPU at the factory on how high it will clock up to.  Intel At one point, people believed the Core i7-980X would be called Core i9, but generations have passed with no such name. What about "Core i9?" AMD isn't the only company working on a monster CPU for consumers. Intel is also rumored to be planning a 12-core CPU using Skylake cores. While Broadwell-E and Haswell-E chips have been nearly identical to the the desktop cores they're based on, the so-called "Skylake-X" is expected to feature support for AVX-512 instructions, which could boost performance in apps that support it. The CPU would use a new X299 chipset, feature 44 PCIe lanes and quad-channel memory support. The CPU would adopt a new "Core i9" naming scheme. Intel has never publicly confirmed the new chip, but the rumors appear to be pretty solid. Of course, this isn't the first time we were supposed to see a Core i9. In 2009 PCWorld reported that the 6-core Gulftown CPU from Intel was supposed to be "Core i9," so who knows what will happen. IDG Even Handbrake can't use all the resources of an 18-core, 36-thread CPU, so buy a mega-core CPU only if you can really use it properly. Will you really benefit from that many cores? With Intel and AMD playing a core war this summer, you'd assume that more cores means better performance. The truth is more nuanced. How many cores you need really depends on what you do. If you primarily play games, a mega-core PC isn't likely to yield the performance you'd expect. If, however, you edit video, render 3D, and run other intensive workstation-like tasks, more cores generally means less waiting. Having an embarrassing number of cores can also aid in heavy-duty multitasking. You know, like simultaneously rendering 3D, video, audio, and playing games.  How much will it cost? The fact that AMD is planning to introduce new CPUs with crazy core and thread counts isn't the big deal. What's more important is how much it will cost. Intel's 8-core CPUs have never cost less than $1,000. The 10-core Core i7-6950X cost $1,723. Does that mean a 16-core CPU will cost $2,000? Perhaps AMD anticipates Intel will reset its prices this summer, and it's trying to head off Intel at the pass. No one knows, and even the rumor-mongering press haven't placed any bets.

Ireland saw two of its brightest students land prizes at the recent Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF), with Caolann Brady and Cormac Larkin doing the business in the US last week. Following on from Larkin’s earlier success, garnering $1,000 for his for his data mining astronomy project, Brady’s investigation into the effect of humming on human health won her a separate award for $1,500. Brady qualified for the international event through winning SciFest 2016, thanks to her project’s focus on the natural treatment of asthma through humming and breathing techniques, as opposed to using inhalers and nebulisers. She took the second award spot in the Biomedical and Health Sciences strand of ISEF, a category won by US student Daniel Zhang, whose project looked at the genomic sequence of cancer. Brady is sitting her Leaving Certificate this year at St Wolstan’s Community School in Celbridge, using her own experience with asthma as inspiration for this award-winning project. #Caolann #intelisef talks about her project @Intel_IRL @scienceirel @stwolstans @IrishSciTeach @DruryPN @MorwennaRice @siliconrepublic pic.twitter.com/QFrU3YVgxg — SciFest (@SciFest4STEM) May 18, 2017 Research has hinted that the ventilation of the paranasal sinuses (inhaling and exhaling) increases greatly when a person practises specifically defined humming techniques, so Brady examined this using 175 test subjects. The results, she found, showed that the prescribed humming technique improves lung function across a range of ages, genders and breathing capabilities by an average of 10pc, with 99.9pc statistical confidence.

Last Thursday (18 May), Larkin was named as winner of the Priscilla and Bart Bok First Award. Larkin is a sixth-year student from Coláiste An Spioraid Naoimh in Bishopstown, Co Cork, who showcased his project entitled: ‘Case study of Data Mining in Observational Astronomy: The search for new OB stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud’. Larkin’s research led to the development of a new approach to identify massive stars rapidly, even in the midst of a heavily populated part of the universe known as the Small Magellanic Cloud.

Via cloud, it tells you Want to know if your package got dropped on its way to you? Intel is working on a system that can monitor vibration, temperature, unauthorised openings, and a host of other things on pallets of goods or even individual packages. — Bloomberg After Intel Corp couldn’t find a device that indicated when sensitive chip-making machines tilted too much during shipping, the company decided to build one itself.  The maker of microprocessors teamed up with Honeywell International Inc, which makes hand-held warehouse computers, to create a system that can monitor vibration, temperature, unauthorised openings, and a host of other things on pallets of goods or even individual packages. It is being tested by shippers including Kuehne & Nagel International AG, DHL Worldwide Express and Bertelsmann SE.  The many freight-tracking products now in the US$8tril (RM34.46tril) worldwide logistics market usually only trace a large container or truck. The devices don’t have an on-board computer that gives detailed information and on which new applications can be created, said Martin Kolbe, chief information officer at Switzerland’s Keuhne & Nagel.  “It’s real-time monitoring on the one hand, but you can do much more with the data,” Kolbe said in a telephone interview. “This is creating a new eco-environment where over the next years more solutions will come in.”  The tracking system is part of Intel and Honeywell’s effort to introduce products that use sensors linked to the Internet to collect data on machinery, office buildings, aircraft, and freight to make them operate more efficiently or to spot maintenance problems before a breakdown.  US$10 Price  The Honeywell-Intel product consists of sensors linked to one transponder that relays data to cloud-computing networks where it can be monitored and processed. The sensors, which now cost more than US$10 (RM43) a piece, can be placed on pallets or individual packages while the transponder can be placed among the packages or on the vessel.  Honeywell wants to drive down the price of the sensors to as low as US$2 (RM9), said Taylor Smith president of Honeywell’s workflow solutions business.  Reducing the cost of the system will help gin up demand beyond goods such as medicines, fresh food and high-tech equipment that require close monitoring and have high value. The market for monitoring freight is about US$4bil (RM17.22bil), Smith said.  “We think this could open that market even more,” Smith said.  Insurance companies are keen on the technology’s ability to pinpoint when an incident occurred and what happened to insured cargo, which may speed up claims and settle disputes more clearly regarding who was at fault, Smith said.  Many transportation companies provide tracking services, but it’s a patchwork system with some working better than others, Kolbe said. The ability to track a package that’s handed off among different carriers is appealing, and decisions to reroute or even adjust variables such as temperature could be made on the fly, he said.  “There’s like a mini-PC on board so we can start in the future to think about small algorithms to take local decisions for local conditions,” he said. — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested China scrambles to tame bike chaos Texas lawmakers clear way for Uber, Lyft return to major cities The evolution of mobile phones Coway promotes a healthy lifestyle When the CEO is your mentor 10 after work habits for personal success Others Also Read Restaurant‘s first public Ramadan buffet offers 35 traditional Malay dishes Family forced to live under flyover Cricket: Australia board gambled on players' greed and lost - Chappell advertisement Latest News US top court tightens patent suit rules in blow to ‘patent trolls’ China’s troubled LeEco said to plan cutting most of US workers Apple, Visa face patent infringement lawsuit over Apple Pay Ford names Hackett as CEO to tackle car rivals, Silicon Valley Symantec says ‘highly likely’ North Korea group behind ransomware attacks Most Viewed in Tech Symantec says ‘highly likely’ North Korea group behind ransomware attacks Apple, Visa face patent infringement lawsuit over Apple Pay China’s troubled LeEco said to plan cutting most of US workers China scrambles to tame bike chaos China’s LeEco founder cedes control of listed unit amid cash crunch Ford names Hackett as CEO to tackle car rivals, Silicon Valley Google cosies up to China with AI secrets and a game of Go Sharkwatching: With more sharks and better tech, it’s the latest craze EU to conclude Google antitrust cases in next few months US top court tightens patent suit rules in blow to ‘patent trolls’ Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

When Intel demonstrated its Intel Euclid robotics controller at last August’s Intel Developer Conference, the company gave no indication of its release date or even if it would be more than a proof of concept. The candy-bar sized module is now available for order as part of a $399 Intel Euclid Development Kit, with shipments due by the end of the month. A Euclid community site has gone live with tutorials and documentation. Intel Euclid from both sides (click image to enlarge) The Euclid module appears little changed from the prototype, although we now have full specifications, including the identification of the mystery processor. The device runs Ubuntu 16.04 and Robot Operating System (ROS) “Kinetic Kame” on a quad-core, up to 2.4GHz Atom x7-Z8700 of the 14nm “Cherry Trail” family. The x7-Z8700 also powers Intel’s RealSense Smartphone Developer Kit, which uses Google’s Project Tango technology, as well as Intel’s Yocto Project based Aero Compute Board for drones. Euclid software stack (click image to enlarge) The other key component is the Intel RealSense depth camera. The camera features a wide-FoV 640 x 480-pixel RGB camera element, along with depth and accelerometer-gyroscope motion sensors. Euclid details (click image to enlarge) Euclid can be used as a full, autonomous “Brain” with sensing capabilities, or as a smart sensor controlled by a more powerful computer. In the second configuration, you can offload vision processing onto Euclid or access raw data from the sensors. IDF 2016 demo of a robot holding its Euclid “brain” in its outstretched arms, while performing a collision avoidance scenario (click images to enlarge) You can also transfer Arduino sketches or ROS code to Euclid over the WiFi connection. In the case of Arduino sketches, Euclid passes them on, over USB, to an Arduino controller embedded in the robotic target. Euclid can be accessed and controlled by a web app from a desktop or Android and iOS mobile devices (see screenshot below). Additional details regarding the Euclid’s control functions are available in the “Using Euclid” section of our IDF 2016 Euclid coverage, as well in these Euclid videos at Vimeo.

Semiconductor chip maker Intel has insights on the top five most impressive game explosions. Power drink maker Red Bull wants you to know about three generations of a high-flying family and its “skytyping” business. All three are examples of a trend that has accelerated in the past six years: brand journalism sites. Recently, I was asked for stellar examples. After hitting up several experts, I offer the list below. Why practice brand journalism? Ragan Communications chief executive Mark Ragan, a former national political reporter and an early advocate of brand journalism, offers his philosophy: Stop begging the media, and become the media yourself. “Newsrooms have been decimated,” Ragan says. “If you want your company’s story told, you’d better write it or shoot it yourself. “But brand journalism works only if your story is credible, is helpful to the reader and eschews all corporate-speak and jargon. If the story is self-serving or it is designed to sell, it’s not brand journalism. It’s marketing.” (Ragan heads Ragan Consulting Group, which works with businesses to establish brand journalism sites.) From videos to white papers David Meerman Scott , another early advocate, defines brand journalism as the creation of web content—videos, blog posts, photos, charts, graphs, essays, e-books, white papers—that deliver value to the marketplace and position organizations as worthy of doing business with. “Brand journalism is not a product pitch,” he says. “It is not an advertorial. It is not an egotistical spewing of gobbledygook-laden corporate drivel.” He adds that those with the traditional skills of marketing, public relations, advertising and copywriting are not the right people to create brand journalism content. “Instead, you need the skills of a journalist,” he says. [RELATED: Learn how to infuse storytelling and great writing into all your communications at the Business Writing Summit.] Here are the sites we came up with: B2B brand journalism The good news, for a B2B company, is that you needn’t sit out this trend as flashy B2C companies like Red Bull hog the limelight. Consider the following. Cisco Systems, the networking hardware company, covers everything from innovative technology hitting the theater stage to IT that skills offer opportunities for Jordanian women.

Reuters/Steve Marcus Since Microsoft has claimed that there will be no Microsoft Surface Pro 5 in the near future, rival brands have been offered the opportunity to take the spotlight. The HP Spectre x2 tries to fill in the gap, a second-generation laptop that ups the specs the Surface Pro 4 currently has to offer.  For the record, HP is a familiar name in the laptop segment. It has its own share of hybrids, and the 2-in-1 device may just steal the thunder from the Surface Pro series. With Microsoft believing that the Surface Pro 4 is good for a couple of more years, the smalls steps the HP Spectre x2 in terms of features and specs could sway some buyers on their end.  The HP Spectre x2 ups the stakes a bit by pinning its hopes on the 7th generation Kaby Lake CPUs. Aside from that, it will come with Iris Plus graphics versions for the Core i5 and i7, embedded with 64 GB of DRAM. Both should ramp up the expectations as far as delivering high-resolution graphics – both for gaming and media viewing entertainment.  Other key features the HP Spectre x2 will carry include 16 GB of LPDDR3 RAM and SSD options of up to 1 TB PCIe. For the display, the HP Spectre x2 will offer a 12.3-inch screen (1920x1080 pixels), brighter which can accommodate up to 450 nits.  The HP Spectre x2 will also come with a pen technology plus a new IR camera in front, which should work well with Windows Hello authentication feature, PC World reports. For connectivity, the HP Spectre x2 comes with a pair of USB-C ports, DisplayPort and USB-PD charging. A 41-watt battery will be tasked to keep the 2-in-1 juiced up. The HP Spectre x2 specs do offer a slight upgrade from the celebrated Microsoft Surface Pro 4, but the kicker is really in the price. The Core i5 base model of the HP Spectre x2 is priced at US$999 (AU$1,333). This would include 8GB of LPDDR3 RAM and 128GB SSD.  For those who want to move up a bit, there is the Core i7 model to consider. Priced at US$1,280 (AU$1,708), included are the Iris Plus graphics, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. Both models are expected to go on sale this June.  The flexible HP Spectre x2 hybrid should be worth checking out, especially for the ones yearning for a new 2-in-1 to use. With the Surface Pro 4 slowly aging, the HP Spectre x2 should be a keen alternative for folks hoping to see a new hybrid to get in the market.

By Corinne Reichert | May 23, 2017 -- 04:46 GMT (21:46 PDT) | Topic: Mobility (Image: Screenshot by Corinne Reichert/ZDNet) Ericsson has announced a trial of 5G network technology and virtual reality (VR) during the lead-up to the Indianapolis 500 motor race in partnership with Intel and telecommunications carrier Verizon. The companies made use of 5G technologies such as beam forming and beam tracking, wherein antenna arrays steer a beam to where a user is with less radio interference, attaining speeds in excess of 6Gbps across Verizon's 5G trial network. "We have to deliver the fastest 5G connection possible," said Dan Huffman, principle engineer for Verizon Wireless, in a video of the trial. "As our vehicles get smarter, our network also has to get smarter, and we're doing exactly that with a 5G network capable of pinpointing your device and maximising your bandwidth at all times." More than 180 beams were targeted at the car on the Indy 500 racetrack, Ericsson said in a blog post, with a prototype 5G antenna installed on the roof of the vehicle. "We're pushing beyond today's technology -- with multi-gigabit speeds and super low latency, we're enabling new applications and the Internet of Things," said Bill Goodman, lead engineer on Ericsson's Technology Team. Ericsson took the test further by blacking out the windows of a racing car, installing a camera on the roof of the vehicle, and fitting the driver with a 5G-enabled VR headset showing a 4K video stream of the track from the camera. "To really kind of push the envelope and showcase the low latency, we added in this virtual-reality driving where we'll black out the windows, virtual reality glasses will be worn by the driver, and the camera will take a feed and uplink through 5G into the network, turn it around and send it back over 5G, and do that quickly enough so the driver can react appropriately as he's running around this track at speed," Goodman explained. During the trials, Ericsson and Verizon attained downlink speeds of 6.4Gbps in a vehicle travelling at 60 miles per hour (100km/h). Ericsson saw similar speeds during a 5G trial in a moving vehicle in Australia last year using the Telstra network. Ericsson added that in future, sensors and cameras will be fitted to racing cars and racetracks in order to enable viewers and pit crews to see the race from several vantage points, as well as seeing information on each driver's speed, RPM, and tyre pressure in real time.

Verizon is currently rolling out 11 5G trial networks across the United States, with the first deployed in Ann Arbor, Michigan, earlier this month. The networks are being built by Samsung and Cisco using the former's 5G radio base stations and 5G routers alongside a Cisco Ultra Services Platform 5G virtualised packet core with Cisco Advanced Services and Samsung's virtual RAN (vRAN) solutions. The companies are also set to deploy pre-commercial 5G trial networks with partners Ericsson, Intel, LG, Nokia, and Qualcomm by mid-2017 in Atlanta, Georgia; Bernardsville, New Jersey; Brockton, Massachusetts; Dallas, Texas; Denver, Colorado; Houston, Texas; Miami, Florida; Sacramento, California; Seattle, Washington; and Washington DC. Ericsson has estimated 5G to be worth $1.2 trillion by 2026, with 20 percent of this market to be made up by energy utilities; 19 percent by manufacturing; 13 percent by public safety; 13 percent by healthcare; 10 percent by media and entertainment; 10 percent by public transport; 8 percent by automotive; and 6 percent by financial services. In February, Ericsson announced partnering with Telstra, Japanese telecommunications provider NTT DoCoMo, and European giant Vodafone on additional 5G trials. The 5G new radio (NR) trial with Telstra will see the two conduct interoperability testing and an over-the-air field trial using the current 5G NR specifications provided by 3GPP during the second half of 2017 in partnership with Qualcomm. For the trial, Ericsson will make use of millimetre-wave spectrum technologies at higher-frequency bands to increase network capacity and allow for multi-gigabit speeds across the 28GHz, 39GHz and sub-6GHz spectrum bands, as well as Multiple-Input Multiple-Output antenna technology along with beam forming and beam tracking. The two will trial Telstra's 5G network during the Commonwealth Games in 2018 ahead of a commercial launch by 2020.

Why it's never a good time to invest in the stock market Here are the constitutional crises worrying Wall Street Thompson’s days were numbered at the Census Bureau Who or what is keeping stock prices up even as there is continuous economic and political turmoil around the world? Could it be Switzerland? Stock prices fell sharply last Wednesday when the latest “scandal” — and I don’t even remember what it was — struck the Trump administration. I mentioned in a column on Thursday my Top 10 reasons US investors should be wary of ever-rising stock prices. One of the 10 things was the manipulation of equities markets by countries like China and Japan, which proudly admit to doing so. And then there’s the mysterious case of Switzerland, which has an enormous portfolio of US stocks — and no obvious reason that it keeps buying. According to its last filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Swiss National Bank owned more than $63 billion worth of stock — most of it in US companies. In fact, that amount was $1 billion higher than it was in the previous quarterly filing with the SEC. Since large shareholders are only required to make quarterly reports to the SEC, there’s no telling how active the Swiss National Bank is on a given day or whether it jumps in to support weak markets. The latest filing included more than 15 million shares of Apple, 13 million Intel, 25 million General Electric, 6.6 million Facebook, 10 million Ford, 13 million Intel and on and on and… In fact, a printed list of all the stocks is 66 pages long. No matter what the motive is for the purchase of all that stock, the end result is the same — it’s helping to prop up stock prices. And, I admit, the reason for the Swiss appetite for stocks could be nothing more than investment purposes. Like everyone else, the Swiss National Bank could be buying simply because the returns elsewhere — like in the bond market — are so abysmal. But is it possible that the Swiss are acting as an agent of US financial authorities who fear that a big decline in stock prices would be against America’s national interest? OK, I hear people shouting “conspiracy theory” already. So let’s get a little deeper into history. Central banks around the world have always come to one another’s rescue in currency markets. If America, for instance, wanted the US dollar to be stronger than it is, a foreign central bank like Switzerland’s would purchase dollars on behalf of the US. Mission accomplished. And nobody is the wiser that the US was behind the propping up of the dollar. Here’s another fact. A guy named Robert Heller, who had been a governor on the Federal Reserve Board, proposed in 1989 that the Fed rig the US stock market in the event of an emergency. Heller said this should be done only in dire situations, like the stock market crash of 1987 and the near crash just a month before he proposed this. Heller argued that rigging stocks — through the purchase by the Federal Reserve of stock index futures contracts — would be no harder than manipulating the currency markets. Why is this one of the things investors should worry about? Because there’s no telling why the Swiss National Bank is buying all that stock and when it will stop. As so with other investors, if interest rates rise high enough, the Swiss may decide that stocks aren’t worth the risk. So, all I have to say is: Go, Switzerland! You buy our stocks , and we’ll eat your chocolate. It seems like a fair deal.

Reuters/Steve Marcus Since Microsoft has claimed that there will be no Microsoft Surface Pro 5 in the near future, rival brands have been offered the opportunity to take the spotlight. The HP Spectre x2 tries to fill in the gap, a second-generation laptop that ups the specs the Surface Pro 4 currently has to offer.  For the record, HP is a familiar name in the laptop segment. It has its own share of hybrids, and the 2-in-1 device may just steal the thunder from the Surface Pro series. With Microsoft believing that the Surface Pro 4 is good for a couple of more years, the smalls steps the HP Spectre x2 in terms of features and specs could sway some buyers on their end.  The HP Spectre x2 ups the stakes a bit by pinning its hopes on the 7th generation Kaby Lake CPUs. Aside from that, it will come with Iris Plus graphics versions for the Core i5 and i7, embedded with 64 GB of DRAM. Both should ramp up the expectations as far as delivering high-resolution graphics – both for gaming and media viewing entertainment.  Other key features the HP Spectre x2 will carry include 16 GB of LPDDR3 RAM and SSD options of up to 1 TB PCIe. For the display, the HP Spectre x2 will offer a 12.3-inch screen (1920x1080 pixels), brighter which can accommodate up to 450 nits.  The HP Spectre x2 will also come with a pen technology plus a new IR camera in front, which should work well with Windows Hello authentication feature, PC World reports. For connectivity, the HP Spectre x2 comes with a pair of USB-C ports, DisplayPort and USB-PD charging. A 41-watt battery will be tasked to keep the 2-in-1 juiced up. The HP Spectre x2 specs do offer a slight upgrade from the celebrated Microsoft Surface Pro 4, but the kicker is really in the price. The Core i5 base model of the HP Spectre x2 is priced at US$999 (AU$1,333). This would include 8GB of LPDDR3 RAM and 128GB SSD.  For those who want to move up a bit, there is the Core i7 model to consider. Priced at US$1,280 (AU$1,708), included are the Iris Plus graphics, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. Both models are expected to go on sale this June.  The flexible HP Spectre x2 hybrid should be worth checking out, especially for the ones yearning for a new 2-in-1 to use. With the Surface Pro 4 slowly aging, the HP Spectre x2 should be a keen alternative for folks hoping to see a new hybrid to get in the market.

Donald Trump (Getty Images) According to WaPo’s sources — “two current and two former officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity” — Trump reached out to both Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coates and National Security Agency Director Michael Rogers “to publicly deny the existence” of collusion. Both Coates and Rogers rejected the requests. “The problem wasn’t so much asking them to issue statements, it was asking them to issue false statements about an ongoing investigation,” one source explained to the Post. Despite the Post’s sourcing, its report did not provide documented evidence of Trump’s requests. Still, his communication with Rogers was allegedly documented in a memo that “could be made available to both the special counsel now overseeing the Russia investigation and congressional investigators.” Trump has maintained that there was no collusion between his campaign and Russian officials, despite the separate investigations being conducted by the House, Senate and FBI. The White House reiterated the same rhetoric Monday. Donald Trump (Getty Images) “The White House does not confirm or deny unsubstantiated claims based on illegal leaks from anonymous individuals,” a Trump administration spokesman told WaPo. “The president will continue to focus on his agenda that he was elected to pursue by the American people.” Trump is currently in Israel on the second leg of his first foreign trip as president. He is scheduled to make additional stops in Brussels, Rome and Sicily before returning to Washington, D.C. next week.

Basic and diluted loss per American Depositary Share („ADS”) were RMB0.44. Non-GAAP basic and non-GAAP diluted loss per ADS, which excluded share-based compensation expenses and loss on foreign currency forward contract, were RMB0.24. Each ADS represents one Class A ordinary share. Net cash inflow from operating activities for the first quarter of 2017 was approximately RMB177.5 million. Cash and time deposits totaled RMB1,450.2 million as of March 31, 2017, compared to RMB1,286.1 million as of December 31, 2016.

Top line growth for the first quarter was 23.5%, exceeding the high end of our expected range and driven largely by a healthy 20.6% increase in student enrollments. Our professional education business continued its strong momentum during the quarter, despite the seasonal fluctuations created by Chinese New Year. We are especially proud that we continued to deliver excellent education quality and outcomes, achieving once again the 6-month post-course job placement rate of above 95%. Our new collaborations recently with globally renowned IT companies such as Microsoft, HP and Intel will also help build our brand recognition and solidify our leading position in China’s professional education industry. Such results are strong validation of the market demand for our high quality professional education services in both IT and non-IT verticals,” said Mr. Shaoyun Han, Tarena’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. „As we look ahead, well-paced expansion of our learning center network will remain a key strategic way to drive long term growth. In the first quarter, we entered into 5 new cities and added a net of 15 learning centers, achieving a total of 52,822 seat capacity which represents 20.0% year-over-year growth. We are also committed to investing in new courses and contents development in existing courses to advance curriculum system. Our new initiatives in kid education programs has started to bear fruit and we successfully enrolled 994 students in our kid education programs in the first quarter. We believe solid business execution in the first quarter 2017 lays good foundation for us to continue performance and deliver long-term value for all our shareholders,” Mr. Han concluded. Mr.Yuduo Yang, Tarena’s Chief Financial Officer, said, „As we mentioned before, we experienced seasonal fluctuation due to Chinese New Year in the first quarter of each year. Our costs associated with the new centers and new courses were incurred ahead of the enrollment and revenue ramp, which contributed to the net loss of RMB24.6 million in the first quarter 2017, compared with a net loss of RMB 24.5 million in the same period last year. However, given the strong enrollment result in the first quarter and the healthy business fundamentals, we are confident in our overall revenue growth outlook for the full year of 2017.” First Quarter2017 Results Net Revenues Net revenues increased by 23.5% to RMB332.7 million in the first quarter of 2017, from RMB269.5 million in the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased course enrollments and to a lesser extent, an increase in the standard tuition fees. Total course enrollments[5] in the first quarter of 2017 increased by 16.0% to 24,500 from 21,121 in the same period in 2016, which was driven mainly by the number and the popularity of our course offerings. The number of our course offerings increased to 18 from 16 in the first quarter year-over-year, while the total seat capacity in our learning centers[6] increased by 20.0% to 52,822 as of March 31,2017 from 44,004 as of March 31, 2016 to cater to the increased demand for our courses. Beginning in the second quarter of 2016, we raised the standard tuition fees on most of our courses by RMB1,000 to RMB 2000 per course. We charge students enrolled through the retail channel our standard tuition fee and provide students enrolled through the university channel a discount of approximately RMB4,000 per person per course. Our student enrollment mix from retail and university channel was 91%/9% and 93%/7% in the first quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues increased by 33.2% to RMB127.8 million in the first quarter of 2017, from RMB95.9 million in the same period in 2016. The increase was mainly due to an increase in personnel cost and welfare expenses resulting from growing number of teaching and advisory staff at our learning centers, rental cost resulting from higher seat capacity, as well as depreciation expenses for the growing number of learning centers. Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit increased by 18.1% to RMB204.9 million in the first quarter of 2017, from RMB173.5 million in the same period in 2016. Gross margin was 61.6% in the first quarter of 2017, compared with 64.4% in the same period in 2016.The decrease in gross margin was mainly due to expansion of our learning centers and course offerings. Our overall center utilization rate in the first quarter of 2017 was 69%, compared with 71% in the same period in 2016, mainly due to increased seat capacity. Operating Expenses Total operating expenses increased by 23.7% to RMB239.1 million in the first quarter of 2017, from RMB193.2 million in the same period in 2016. Total non-GAAP operating expenses, which excluded share-based compensation expenses, increased by 28.2% to RMB228.1 million in the first quarter of 2017, from RMB177.9 million in the same period in 2016.

Selling and marketing expenses increased by 24.9% to RMB141.1 million in the first quarter of 2017, from RMB112.9 million in the same period in 2016. The increase was due to an increase in personnel cost and welfare expenses related to the growth in our selling and marketing headcount, and expanded marketing efforts as we expanded our course offerings and network of learning centers. General and administrative expenses increased by 23.7% to RMB79.8 million in the first quarter of 2017, from RMB64.5 million in the same period in 2016. The increase was mainly due to an increase in personnel cost and welfare expenses for our increased number of general and administrative personnel to support our growing operations. Non-GAAP general and administrative expenses, which excluded share-based compensation expenses, increased by 35.3% to RMB70.8 million, from RMB52.3 million in the same period in 2016. Research and development expenses increased by 15.3% to RMB18.2 million in the first quarter of 2017, from RMB15.8 million in the same period in 2016. The increase was mainly due to an increase in personnel cost and welfare expenses of our instructors allocated to their content development activities for our courses, as well as growing number of research and development staff as we expanded our course offerings and operations. Operating Loss Operating loss was RMB34.1 million for the first quarter of 2017, compared to an operating loss of RMB19.7 million in the same period in 2016.Non-GAAP operating loss, which excluded share-based compensation expenses, was RMB23.0 million, compared to a non-GAAP operating loss of RMB3.9 million in the same period in 2016. Interest Income Interest income was RMB3.5 million in the first quarter of 2017, compared to RMB9.2 million in the same period in 2016. Interest income in both periods consisted of interest earned on our cash and time deposits in commercial banks and interest income recognized in relation to our installment payment plan for students. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower bank deposits and interest rate, as well as lower tuition interest income in relation to our installment payment plan for students. Foreign Exchange (Loss) Gain Foreign exchange loss was RMB0.5 million in the first quarter of 2017, compared to RMB2.8 million foreign exchange gain in the same period in 2016. The loss was attributable to the appreciation of China’s RMB against U.S. Dollar as the Company had converted its offshore bank deposits previously in RMB into US dollars under a foreign currency forward contract. The contract had been settled in May 2016. Income Tax Expense The Company recorded an income tax expense of RMB0.5 million in the first quarter of 2017, compared to RMB0.1 million in the same period in 2016. The change was mainly due to an increase in the effective income tax rate from recognition of valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets of certain subsidiaries. Net Loss (income) As a result of the foregoing, net loss was RMB24.6 million in the first quarter of 2017, compared to RMB24.5 million in the same period in 2016. Non-GAAP net loss, which excluded share-based compensation expenses and loss on foreign currency forward contract, was RMB13.5 million, compared to a non-GAAP net income of RMB10.9 million in the same period in 2016. Basic and Diluted Earnings (Loss) per ADS Basic and diluted loss per ADS were RMB0.44 in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP basic and non-GAAP diluted loss per ADS, which excluded share-based compensation expenses, were RMB0.24. Cash Flow Net cash inflow from operating activities for the first quarter of 2017 was approximately RMB177.5 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were RMB28.0 million. Shares Issued and Outstanding As of March 31, 2017, the Company had 50,108,451 Class A and 7,206,059 Class B ordinary shares outstanding. Each ADS represents one Class A ordinary share. Business Outlook Based on the Company’s current estimates, total net revenues for the second quarter of 2017 are expected to be between RMB443.5 million and RMB 456.5 million, representing an increase of 21.4% to 25.0% on a year-over-year basis. The Company also expects its total net revenues for the full year of 2017 to be between RMB1,990.0 million and RMB2,070.0 million, representing an increase of 26.0% to 31.0% on a year-over-year basis.

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, the Company revised its non-GAAP financial measures to exclude gain or loss on derivative instruments, goodwill impairment, impairment of intangibles via acquisitions of businesses and the related tax impact, in addition to its historical practice of excluding share-based compensation expenses for non-GAAP results. To supplement Tarena’s consolidated financial results presented in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles („GAAP”), Tarena’s management uses non-GAAP measures of cost of revenues, operating expenses, operating income (loss), net income (loss), and basic and diluted net income (loss) per ADS, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude the share-based compensation expenses, gain or loss on derivative instruments, goodwill impairment, impairment of intangibles via acquisitions of businesses and the related tax impact. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. In addition, calculation of the non-GAAP financial measures may be different from the calculation used by other companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Tarena’s management believes that excluding the share-based compensation expenses, gain or loss on derivative instruments, goodwill impairment, impairment of intangibles via acquisitions of businesses and the related tax impact provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items identified as non-recurring and infrequent in nature, and non-cash charges. The amount of share-based compensation expenses, gain or loss on derivative instruments, goodwill impairment, impairment of intangibles via acquisitions of businesses and the related tax impact are not built into the Company’s annual budgets and quarterly forecasts, which generally will be the basis for information Tarena provides to analysts and investors as guidance for future operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance investors’ overall understanding of Tarena’s current financial performance and prospects for the future. A limitation of using non-GAAP cost of revenues, operating expenses, operating income (loss) and net income (loss), excluding the share-based compensation expenses, gain or loss on derivative instruments, goodwill impairment, impairment of intangibles via acquisitions of businesses and the related tax impact is that the share-based compensation charge has been and will continue to be a recurring expense in the Company’s business for the foreseeable future, and gain or loss on derivative instruments, goodwill impairment, impairment of intangibles via acquisitions of businesses and the related tax impact may recur in the future. In order to mitigate these limitations the Company has provided specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The accompanying tables include details on the reconciliation between GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to the non-GAAP financial measures the Company has presented.

Top line growth for the first quarter was 23.5%, exceeding the high end of our expected range and driven largely by a healthy 20.6% increase in student enrollments. Our professional education business continued its strong momentum during the quarter, despite the seasonal fluctuations created by Chinese New Year. We are especially proud that we continued to deliver excellent education quality and outcomes, achieving once again the 6-month post-course job placement rate of above 95%. Our new collaborations recently with globally renowned IT companies such as Microsoft, HP and Intel will also help build our brand recognition and solidify our leading position in China’s professional education industry. Such results are strong validation of the market demand for our high quality professional education services in both IT and non-IT verticals,” said Mr. Shaoyun Han, Tarena’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. „As we look ahead, well-paced expansion of our learning center network will remain a key strategic way to drive long term growth.

Our new initiatives in kid education programs has started to bear fruit and we successfully enrolled 994 students in our kid education programs in the first quarter. We believe solid business execution in the first quarter 2017 lays good foundation for us to continue performance and deliver long-term value for all our shareholders,” Mr. Han concluded. Mr.Yuduo Yang, Tarena’s Chief Financial Officer, said, „As we mentioned before, we experienced seasonal fluctuation due to Chinese New Year in the first quarter of each year. Our costs associated with the new centers and new courses were incurred ahead of the enrollment and revenue ramp, which contributed to the net loss of RMB24.6 million in the first quarter 2017, compared with a net loss of RMB 24.5 million in the same period last year. However, given the strong enrollment result in the first quarter and the healthy business fundamentals, we are confident in our overall revenue growth outlook for the full year of 2017.” First Quarter2017 Results Net Revenues Net revenues increased by 23.5% to RMB332.7 million in the first quarter of 2017, from RMB269.5 million in the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased course enrollments and to a lesser extent, an increase in the standard tuition fees. Total course enrollments[5] in the first quarter of 2017 increased by 16.0% to 24,500 from 21,121 in the same period in 2016, which was driven mainly by the number and the popularity of our course offerings. The number of our course offerings increased to 18 from 16 in the first quarter year-over-year, while the total seat capacity in our learning centers[6] increased by 20.0% to 52,822 as of March 31,2017 from 44,004 as of March 31, 2016 to cater to the increased demand for our courses. Beginning in the second quarter of 2016, we raised the standard tuition fees on most of our courses by RMB1,000 to RMB 2000 per course. We charge students enrolled through the retail channel our standard tuition fee and provide students enrolled through the university channel a discount of approximately RMB4,000 per person per course. Our student enrollment mix from retail and university channel was 91%/9% and 93%/7% in the first quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues increased by 33.2% to RMB127.8 million in the first quarter of 2017, from RMB95.9 million in the same period in 2016. The increase was mainly due to an increase in personnel cost and welfare expenses resulting from growing number of teaching and advisory staff at our learning centers, rental cost resulting from higher seat capacity, as well as depreciation expenses for the growing number of learning centers. Gross Profit and Gross Margin Gross profit increased by 18.1% to RMB204.9 million in the first quarter of 2017, from RMB173.5 million in the same period in 2016. Gross margin was 61.6% in the first quarter of 2017, compared with 64.4% in the same period in 2016.The decrease in gross margin was mainly due to expansion of our learning centers and course offerings. Our overall center utilization rate in the first quarter of 2017 was 69%, compared with 71% in the same period in 2016, mainly due to increased seat capacity. Operating Expenses Total operating expenses increased by 23.7% to RMB239.1 million in the first quarter of 2017, from RMB193.2 million in the same period in 2016. Total non-GAAP operating expenses, which excluded share-based compensation expenses, increased by 28.2% to RMB228.1 million in the first quarter of 2017, from RMB177.9 million in the same period in 2016. Total share-based compensation expenses allocated to the related operating expenses reduced by 28.6% to RMB10.9 million in the first quarter of 2017, from RMB15.3 million in the same period in 2016. Selling and marketing expenses increased by 24.9% to RMB141.1 million in the first quarter of 2017, from RMB112.9 million in the same period in 2016. The increase was due to an increase in personnel cost and welfare expenses related to the growth in our selling and marketing headcount, and expanded marketing efforts as we expanded our course offerings and network of learning centers. General and administrative expenses increased by 23.7% to RMB79.8 million in the first quarter of 2017, from RMB64.5 million in the same period in 2016. The increase was mainly due to an increase in personnel cost and welfare expenses for our increased number of general and administrative personnel to support our growing operations. Non-GAAP general and administrative expenses, which excluded share-based compensation expenses, increased by 35.3% to RMB70.8 million, from RMB52.3 million in the same period in 2016. Research and development expenses increased by 15.3% to RMB18.2 million in the first quarter of 2017, from RMB15.8 million in the same period in 2016. The increase was mainly due to an increase in personnel cost and welfare expenses of our instructors allocated to their content development activities for our courses, as well as growing number of research and development staff as we expanded our course offerings and operations. Operating Loss Operating loss was RMB34.1 million for the first quarter of 2017, compared to an operating loss of RMB19.7 million in the same period in 2016.Non-GAAP operating loss, which excluded share-based compensation expenses, was RMB23.0 million, compared to a non-GAAP operating loss of RMB3.9 million in the same period in 2016. Interest Income Interest income was RMB3.5 million in the first quarter of 2017, compared to RMB9.2 million in the same period in 2016. Interest income in both periods consisted of interest earned on our cash and time deposits in commercial banks and interest income recognized in relation to our installment payment plan for students. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower bank deposits and interest rate, as well as lower tuition interest income in relation to our installment payment plan for students. Foreign Exchange (Loss) Gain Foreign exchange loss was RMB0.5 million in the first quarter of 2017, compared to RMB2.8 million foreign exchange gain in the same period in 2016. The loss was attributable to the appreciation of China’s RMB against U.S. Dollar as the Company had converted its offshore bank deposits previously in RMB into US dollars under a foreign currency forward contract. The contract had been settled in May 2016. Income Tax Expense The Company recorded an income tax expense of RMB0.5 million in the first quarter of 2017, compared to RMB0.1 million in the same period in 2016. The change was mainly due to an increase in the effective income tax rate from recognition of valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets of certain subsidiaries. Net Loss (income) As a result of the foregoing, net loss was RMB24.6 million in the first quarter of 2017, compared to RMB24.5 million in the same period in 2016. Non-GAAP net loss, which excluded share-based compensation expenses and loss on foreign currency forward contract, was RMB13.5 million, compared to a non-GAAP net income of RMB10.9 million in the same period in 2016. Basic and Diluted Earnings (Loss) per ADS Basic and diluted loss per ADS were RMB0.44 in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP basic and non-GAAP diluted loss per ADS, which excluded share-based compensation expenses, were RMB0.24. Cash Flow Net cash inflow from operating activities for the first quarter of 2017 was approximately RMB177.5 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were RMB28.0 million. Shares Issued and Outstanding As of March 31, 2017, the Company had 50,108,451 Class A and 7,206,059 Class B ordinary shares outstanding. Each ADS represents one Class A ordinary share. Business Outlook Based on the Company’s current estimates, total net revenues for the second quarter of 2017 are expected to be between RMB443.5 million and RMB 456.5 million, representing an increase of 21.4% to 25.0% on a year-over-year basis. The Company also expects its total net revenues for the full year of 2017 to be between RMB1,990.0 million and RMB2,070.0 million, representing an increase of 26.0% to 31.0% on a year-over-year basis. This guidance is based on the current market conditions and reflects the Company’s current and preliminary estimates of market and operating conditions, which are subject to change.

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, the Company revised its non-GAAP financial measures to exclude gain or loss on derivative instruments, goodwill impairment, impairment of intangibles via acquisitions of businesses and the related tax impact, in addition to its historical practice of excluding share-based compensation expenses for non-GAAP results. To supplement Tarena’s consolidated financial results presented in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles („GAAP”), Tarena’s management uses non-GAAP measures of cost of revenues, operating expenses, operating income (loss), net income (loss), and basic and diluted net income (loss) per ADS, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude the share-based compensation expenses, gain or loss on derivative instruments, goodwill impairment, impairment of intangibles via acquisitions of businesses and the related tax impact. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. In addition, calculation of the non-GAAP financial measures may be different from the calculation used by other companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Tarena’s management believes that excluding the share-based compensation expenses, gain or loss on derivative instruments, goodwill impairment, impairment of intangibles via acquisitions of businesses and the related tax impact provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items identified as non-recurring and infrequent in nature, and non-cash charges. The amount of share-based compensation expenses, gain or loss on derivative instruments, goodwill impairment, impairment of intangibles via acquisitions of businesses and the related tax impact are not built into the Company’s annual budgets and quarterly forecasts, which generally will be the basis for information Tarena provides to analysts and investors as guidance for future operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance investors’ overall understanding of Tarena’s current financial performance and prospects for the future. A limitation of using non-GAAP cost of revenues, operating expenses, operating income (loss) and net income (loss), excluding the share-based compensation expenses, gain or loss on derivative instruments, goodwill impairment, impairment of intangibles via acquisitions of businesses and the related tax impact is that the share-based compensation charge has been and will continue to be a recurring expense in the Company’s business for the foreseeable future, and gain or loss on derivative instruments, goodwill impairment, impairment of intangibles via acquisitions of businesses and the related tax impact may recur in the future. In order to mitigate these limitations the Company has provided specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The accompanying tables include details on the reconciliation between GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to the non-GAAP financial measures the Company has presented.

(KABC) AP Monday, May 22, 2017 02:13PM WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, invoked his constitutional right against self-incrimination on Monday and declined to hand over documents sought under subpoena by a Senate panel investigating Russia's meddling in the 2016 election. In a letter to the Senate intelligence committee , Flynn's attorneys justified the decision by citing an "escalating public frenzy against him" and saying the Justice Department's recent appointment of a special counsel has created a legally dangerous environment for him to cooperate with the panel's investigation. "The context in which the committee has called for General Flynn's testimonial production of documents makes clear that he has more than a reasonable apprehension that any testimony he provides could be used against him," the attorneys wrote in the letter, which was obtained by the AP. Flynn's decision not to cooperate with the Senate committee represents a new legal complication for the expanding government and congressional inquiries into Russian interference in the presidential campaign and contacts between Trump advisers and Russian officials and representatives. Flynn is a key figure in both the FBI investigation headed by special counsel Robert Mueller and in separate Senate and House inquiries. MORE: Current White House staffer caught up in Russia probe, source says Trump appointed Flynn, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general and top military intelligence chief, as his top national security aide in January, only to fire him less than a month later. The White House said that Flynn had misled top U.S. officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, about his contacts with Russian officials, including Russia's ambassador to the U.S. The Senate committee's subpoena to Flynn dealt heavily with his interactions with Russian officials. It asked for a wide range of information and documents about his and the Trump campaign's contacts with Russians dating back to June 2015. Flynn's letter to the Senate committee stressed that his decision to invoke his constitutional protection is not an admission of wrongdoing but rather a response to the current political climate in which Democratic members of Congress are calling for his prosecution. Even "truthful responses of an innocent witness" can give the government ammunition that could be used against Flynn, the attorneys noted, quoting a 2001 Supreme Court ruling. Legal experts had said Flynn was unlikely to turn over the documents without a grant of immunity because doing so might compel him to waive some of his constitutional protections. The attorneys noted that if Flynn complied with the committee's request, he could be confirming the existence of documents, an act that itself could be used against him. Trump himself walked back into the Russia controversy during his visit to Israel after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, standing beside him, was asked Monday if he had any concerns about intelligence sharing with the U.S. After Netanyahu responded - he said the cooperation was terrific - Trump volunteered that he "never mentioned the word or the name Israel" during his recent Oval Office conversation with top Russian diplomats. That comment referred to revelations that he divulged classified information about an Islamic State threat in his May 10 meeting in the Oval Office with Russia's foreign minister and ambassador. U.S. officials have said the information originated with Israel. However, it has not been alleged that Trump told the Russians that Israel was the source. MORE: DOJ appoints former FBI director as special counsel in Russia probe Trump has defended Flynn since his ouster and called on him to strike an immunity deal because Flynn is facing a "witch hunt." The president's comments are in stark contrast to his harsh words during the 2016 campaign for people who received immunity or invoked the Fifth Amendment in the probe of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. "You see, the mob takes the Fifth. If you're innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?" Trump said during a September campaign rally in Iowa. On Monday, one of Trump's top GOP supporters, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, told reporters during a news conference in Trenton that he had expressed concerns about Flynn during the presidential transition. "If I were president-elect of the United States, I wouldn't let General Flynn in the White House," Christie said. Flynn's decision does not fully close the door on future cooperation with the committee. Attorney Robert Kelner said in March that Flynn wants to tell his story "should the circumstances permit." He noted it would be unreasonable for Flynn to agree to be questioned by the committee "without assurances against unfair prosecution. Flynn's letter comes less than two weeks after the committee issued a subpoena for his documents as part of its ongoing investigation into possible collusion between Russia and Trump's campaign. In addition to the Senate investigation, Flynn is also being investigated by other congressional committees, as well as the ongoing FBI counterintelligence probe and a separate federal criminal investigation in northern Virginia. Washington lawyer Nina Ginsberg, who has extensive national security law experience, said that if Flynn turned over any personal records in response to the committee's subpoena, he would waive his Fifth amendment rights regarding those documents and have to testify about them. Ginsberg also noted that the committee faces new complications from the Justice Department's move last week to appoint Mueller as special counsel in the Russia inquiry. If the intelligence committee wants to give Flynn immunity, it will likely have to enter into discussions with Mueller to determine whether the move could impede the FBI's case. Lawmakers of other key congressional committees are pledging a full public airing as to why former FBI Director James Comey was ousted amid the intensifying investigations into Russia's interference with the U.S. election. In Sunday TV appearances, both Republican and Democratic lawmakers said they will press Comey in hearings as to whether he ever felt that Trump tried to interfere with his FBI work. Some lawmakers are insisting on seeing any White House or FBI documents that detail conversations between the two, following a spate of news reports that Comey had kept careful records. Comey was fired by Trump earlier this month. The former FBI director agreed to testify before the Senate intelligence committee after the Memorial Day holiday. Former CIA Director John Brennan is to testify in open and closed hearings Tuesday before the House intelligence committee, which is conducting its own investigation.

A number of “generalist” requirements also exist that are open to any officer Air Force Specialty Code. “The AFPAK Hands mission has become even more essential to our long-term regional objectives with the dissolution of the International Security Assistance Force, the stand up of Headquarters, RESOLUTE SUPPORT and transition to an Advise and Assist mission,” said Jeff Gatcomb, AFPAK Hands program manager. AFPAK Hands personnel rotate between positions in and out of theater at the strategic level for about four years. They serve in key advisor assignments to facilitate unity of command and effort, directly influencing operations in the region. Interested officers have opportunities to enter the program as early as this August and can expect to deploy between February and October 2018, depending on their training dates. “Air Force leadership stresses that properly organized, trained and equipped Airmen are the lifeblood of security cooperation,” Gatcomb said. “U.S. Airmen with language, cultural awareness, and regional and political-military skills are the face of the U.S. Air Force to international partners.” Officers may have the opportunity to attend the National Defense University or the National Intelligence University while in the program. They will also earn joint credit under the experience-based Joint Duty Assignment program upon completion of their first deployment in the AFPAK theater, and learn critical language skills that are eligible for language proficiency pay. Field grade officers can apply to attend Joint Professional Military Education II during their AFPAK Hand tour and will be eligible for designation as a Joint Qualified Officer upon completion of the program. The AFPAK Hands program was established in 2009 to create greater continuity, focus and persistent engagement on Afghanistan and Pakistan. The program is modeled after the World War II era “China Hands,” where regional experts focused on one area of expertise for extended assignments. Volunteers should contact their respective assignment teams and update their Airman Development Plans to volunteer. Additional information can be found on myPers (https://mypers.af.mil/). Select “Active Duty Officer” from the dropdown menu and search “AFPAK Hands.” For more information about Air Force personnel programs, go to myPers (https://mypers.af.mil/).

On June 5, Apple will kick off its annual developer conference, and it looks as if it might launch some new products in addition to announcing software updates for iPhones, Macs, and Apple Watches. Apple is planning to release three new laptops next month, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. Apple may update its MacBook Pro, MacBook, and MacBook Air with new Intel chips, according to the report. It most likely won't be a groundbreaking update, but the new models should be faster than the current ones. The MacBook Air, for example, hasn't been updated since 2015. Apple's other laptops have been updated more recently, but none uses the latest Intel chip. While the new laptops Apple is rumored to launch probably won't sport a redesign, the latest chips would help them last longer before they feel sluggish. And when Apple launches laptops with new chips, the older models often are discounted. So if you're in the market for a new Apple laptop, wait two more weeks — there's a chance it could save you some money. There are also rumors that Apple could launch a new iPad or voice-activated speaker next month, although it's unclear whether Apple plans to do so.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement HP Spectre x2 tablet with 3000 x 2000 display coming in June for $1000 and up 05/22/2017 at 10:32 AM by Brad Linder 5 Comments HP is refreshing its Spectre x2 line of premium 2-in-1 tablets with a new model sporting a 12.3 inch, 3000 x 2000 pixel display, pen input, and a detachable keyboard. The new HP Spectre x2 should be available in June with prices starting at $1000, putting the new tablet squarely in Microsoft Surface Pro territory… but HP’s tablet has a higher-resolution display, USB Type-C ports, and a few other features to help set it apart from Microsoft’s tablets. HP’s new tablets feature Intel Core i5 and Core i7 Kaby Lake processor options with Intel Iris Plus graphics, up to 16GB of LPDDR3 memory, up to 1TB of solid state storage, and a battery that HP says should last for up to 8 hours of run time. Thanks to fast charge technology, you can also get a 50 percent charge in 30 minutes. Other features include Bang & Olufsen tuned audio, an adjustable kickstand with support for angles up to 165 degrees, a headset jack, a microSD card slot, and two USB Type-C ports (plus a USB-C to USB-A dongle adapter in case you need one). The tablet features two fans under the hood, so don’t expect silent operation. But HP says the tablet + keyboard measure just over half an inch thick and weigh about 2.5 pounds, so the system is pretty compact for a 12.3 inch 2-in-1. The keyboard features full-sized keys with 1.5mm travel, a magnetic connector for attaching to the tablet, and glass trackpad. And the tablet comes with a pressure-sensitive HP Active Pen for writing or drawing with Windows Ink. There’s a 13MP rear camera and a 5MP front-facing camera as well as an IR camera for WIndows Hello facial recognition. via HP Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 5 Comments on "HP Spectre x2 tablet with 3000 x 2000 display coming in June for $1000 and up" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Guest TVOrZ6dw Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

And please don't worry, your report will be anonymous. It depends on how you define “use it as a laptop.” I pretty consistently refer to tablets with a built-in keyboard but a hinge that lets you use it like a tablet as a “convertible,” and a tablet with a detachable keyboard as a “2-in-1,” although “detachable” is probably a more accurate description. It just makes less sense in headlines “HP introduces a new detachable tablet” = detachable from what? Device makers have been a lot less consistent in their use of these terms though. *shrugs* Vote Up2Vote Down  Reply 15 hours 7 minutes ago Guest Michaeld Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

Morgan analysts Rod Hall raises his rating on Qualcomm's stock to the equivalent of a Buy, arguing that investors should look past the company's legal battle with Apple because the shares are too cheap given the potential payoff from its acquisition of NXP Semiconductors later this year. By Tiernan Ray May 22, 2017 11:14 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Shares of wireless chip giant Qualcomm (QCOM) are up $1.46, or 2.5%, at $59.14, after J.P. Morgan’s Rod Hall this morning raised his rating on the shares to Overweight from Neutral, with a $68 price target, writing that there is “fundamental upside given the expected closure of the NXPI acquisition by the end of this year," referring to the pending acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Despite the company’s ongoing tussle with Apple (AAPL), which has compelled its own contract manufacturers to stop paying royalties owed to Qualcomm, Hall thinks that the “valuation gap is too large” given the NXP deal. Regarding the dispute, it’s likely to result in “incremental discounting” of Qualcomm’s royalty rate, but that alone shouldn’t deter investing in the stock: While we acknowledge that Apple’s attack has been broader than we have seen with other disputes we believe it is ultimately in Apple’s interest to complete a new deal with Qualcomm. We would expect the deal to involve incremental discounting but we believe our valuation of Qualcomm in the next section adequately accounts for this. Hall thinks that the battle with Apple will be "resolved by 2018, with royalties coming back to normal levels in 2019." That leads him to present his sum-of-the-parts analysis of Qualcomm’s valuation, justifying his $68 target. He notes, "We also use a 2018 PE multiple of 11.9x for the QCT business, in-line with Intel." "We note that this feels conservative to us considering current market sentiment around Intel and what we believe are solid growth prospects for Qualcomm in automotive and IoT oriented applications for their silicon." Underlying that is his assumption that there will be "well over 50% earnings accretion due to the NXPI deal and we believe this deal could close as early at CQ3 though Qualcomm has simply said that closure is expected by the end of the year." Here's his model: In case you were wondering about competition from Intel (INTC) for Apple’s baseband, Hall writes, "We also believe that loss of further baseband share in the iPhone to Intel is a possibility later this year as the dispute wears on." Interestingly, Hall provides some historical insight into the Apple dispute. It all goes back to an IEEE decision in 2015, one that’s not exactly “workable” for anyone, he writes: We believe the story dates back to February of 2015, when the IEEE issued a new patent policy whereby it explicitly spelled out that royalties may be charged based on the value of the smallest salable component of the overall product. Given that Qualcomm has been charging royalties based on the value of the smartphone, this opened up the company to a number of litigations claiming that Qualcomm should instead charge royalties based on the value of its chips among other things. We do not believe this structure is workable for either the chip makers or the industry as a whole but, nevertheless, the press around this IEEE recommendation has increased public pressure on Qualcomm and been included in multiple global trade disputes.

Intel Inside®. Powerful Productivity Outside. Learn more at delltechnologies.com.  People could figure out how to play immediately.Getty The $100 billion video game industry is witnessing a fierce fight for the minds and wallets of millennials, the generation of digital natives who grew up with video games. But it all began well before their time, in the summer of 1972, when an arcade in California installed a new game called "Pong."  Trailblazers Sidebar What is Trailblazers? Technology is rapidly rewriting the rule book for every business in every industry, presenting an immense opportunity for those that lead the change. Join host Walter Isaacson in this original podcast as he journeys through some of the world’s biggest digital disruptions and uncovers valuable business insights along the way. Subscribe to Trailblazers The birth of the video game "Pong" is a game similar to ping pong, where a blip on the screen gets bounced back and forth by two paddle-like lines. It was born from an idea seen at a trade show by Nolan Bushnell, the founder of Atari.  By today’s standards, it’s something that looks incredibly primitive. But when that original Pong machine became so clogged with quarters it broke,  Atari had the first sign it was onto something. Before long, the company would discover that where a normal arcade machine might take in $10 a day, the Pong machine made $40. Simplicity is key Bushnell quickly grasped the key to its breakthrough success. “'Pong' worked because it was amazingly simple. No rules, really, and people could figure out how to do it almost immediately,” he said. Bushnell understood that to bring video games to the masses, he had to get games out of the arcades and beer parlors and into American homes. Strange as it seems in hindsight, when he sought to take Pong into production, investors were hard to find. But he succeeded in launching the Atari home console in 1975 in a deal with Sears. Its first cartridge system was introduced a couple of years later, and it created an entire market. In a business governed by the phrase “what’s next?” Atari must have known it wouldn’t last — the console wars were about to begin. In “Trailblazers,” former CNN chairman Walter Isaacson explores the history of the video game and the evolution of the incredibly competitive industry it helped to create.   This post is sponsored by Dell Technologies and Intel®.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS US Edition Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending Buying Guides iPhone 8 Samsung Galaxy S8 HTC U11 Project Scorpio Samsung Galaxy Note 8 News HP Spectre x2 leads refreshed line of high-end HP laptops HP Spectre x2 leads refreshed line of high-end HP laptops By Joe Osborne Laptops   Just in time for school, HP’s Envy line joins suit Shares Debuting in France at the Cannes Film Festival, HP has pulled the curtain back on not one, but three refreshed lines up laptops and 2-in-1 devices. The goal for these newly upgraded devices is to empower media creators both professional and enthusiast. Leading the pack is the HP Spectre x2, with just one model asking for $999 (about £769, AU$1,342) this June. The upgraded Spectre x2 adopts much of HP’s new Spectre aesthetic found in its recent high-end laptops, but more importantly an entirely new screen. This time, the firm has dipped even deeper into Microsoft’s font of inspiration, fitting its latest Spectre x2 with a 3,000 x 2,000-pixel touch display in a 3:2 aspect ratio. That should sound mighty familiar to anyone following Microsoft’s leader in the 2-in-1 space, the Surface Pro 4. HP also managed to improve the kickstand on this tablet hybrid with magnets, all while housing one of the latest Intel Core i7 processors, 360GB of solid-state drive (SSD) and 8GB of memory. Oh, and HP’s dropped its proprietary stylus, adopting Microsoft’s recommended, more generic solution that’s nevertheless fine for creators. Finally, HP promises up to 8 hours of juice from a battery that can fast charge from zero to 50% in just 30 minutes. Apple may have a new MacBook, MacBook Air and MacBook Pro on the way HP likes a lot of Envy Also available in June, HP has upgraded both its 13- and- 17-inch Envy laptops with a slightly new design and lots of new internal upgrades. For starters, the two laptops still come in HP’s natural silver color (and now “silk gold!”) aluminum shells, but the firm’s lift hinge takes on a more angular design from last year. HP’s taking a similarly focused approach in positioning the 13-inch and 17-inch in regards to models available, with just one version of each device. But, before getting into the differences, note that each model comes packing a full HD (1,920 x 1,080) screen with an optional HP Secure Pad that embeds a fingerprint scanner right into the trackpad, powered by Synaptics. For $1,049 (about £805, AU$1,403), the HP Envy 13 offers the above plus a 128GB M.2 SSD and 8GB of memory powered the one of the latest Intel Core i5 processors. With those parts, HP promises up to 14 hours and 15 minutes of mixed use on a charge. All of that comes within a 2.72-pound frame that’s just 0.55 inches thin housing two USB-C and two USB 3.1 ports. The 17-inch model goes for a bit cheaper at $999 (about £769, AU$1,342), and offers the above screen (though with multitouch support) with a 1TB, 7,200 rpm spinning hard drive, 16GB of memory powered by one of the latest Intel Core i7 processors and an Nvidia GeForce GRX 940MX graphics chip. With those parts, HP sadly hasn’t made any promises regarding battery life. Last but not least we have the also June-bound Envy x360 convertible, a newly refreshed 15.6-inch hybrid for the next school season. The new Envy x360 starts at $899 (about £690, AU$1,202), not changing much year over year beyond internals and updating the color choices. Now available in HP’s newer “Ash Silver” or a natural silver color, the Envy x360 is apparently optimized for inking, including an N-Trig stylus in the box. Behind that full HD touch display is your choice of either the latest Intel or AMD processors (Intel Core i5 and i7 or AMD A9, A12 or FX) 12 to 16GB of memory and a 1TB HDD at 7,200 rpm. One USB-C, two USB 3.1 and an HDMI port round out this laptop’s varied offerings. HP’s refreshes are smart upgrades that, in some cases, may be a little less inspired, but nevertheless put the firm in an incredibly competitive position with some strong pricing.

(AMD) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons View All Posts Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has given investors quite the ride lately. After running up almost continuously from $2 to $10 in 2016, AMD stock appeared set to continue its winning ways this year. AMD moved up above $15 at one point in March. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr However, things have gotten messy since then. A lousy earnings report caused investors to dump AMD stock in droves. After sinking to $10, it recovered, seemingly, last week. The stock shot up almost 10% on reports of a crucial new partnership. But that report appears to have been what you could call fake news. After Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) flatly denied the report, AMD shares crumbled, losing 10% of their value the next day. Given the recent gyrations, is Advanced Micro Devices worth buying here? AMD Stock Cons Lots of Rumors, Few Facts: AMD stock produces all sorts of rumors. It can be a difficult company to keep track of, since so much stuff is reported without confirmation. The latest, and one of the most damaging, of these unfounded reports came last week. Several prominent blogs and authors suggested that Intel and AMD had reached a licensing deal. This supposedly came on the heels of Intel’s deal with Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) expiring. However, it appears this simply wasn’t so. Intel unequivocally denied the reports, saying: “The recent rumors that Intel has licensed AMD’s graphics technology are untrue.” Hard to argue with a statement like that. This is just the latest in a series of reports suggesting AMD has achieved something great, such as Intel-beating specs on new products, that turns out to be something else later. AMD’s PR department doesn’t do much to squelch these errant reports, leaving investors to potentially get an overly rosy view of the company. Analysts Are Skeptical: Analysts are one important group of people skeptical on AMD. And this group of skeptics grew last week, following AMD’s investor day. One would hope that AMD could win over some of its doubters. Instead, Loop Capital cut the company to “hold” following investor day. That brings the total count of analyst shops with hold ratings up to almost a dozen now. Wall Street isn’t generally known for skepticism; they tend to mostly throw buy ratings around. AMD stock dropped 10% on investor’s day, though it was also the day the Intel partnership news was debunked. So it can be hard to sort out why exactly the stock dropped. Regardless, the lack of analyst enthusiasm didn’t help matters. Still Deeply Unprofitable: AMD’s last quarter underwhelmed the market. And it’s not hard to see why. Despite the company’s rapid revenue growth, it still struggling to get anywhere close to profitability. Its weak profit margins are to blame. The company earned only a 34% gross profit margin; quite low by tech standards. The company’s SG&A expenses of almost $400 million more than ate up the $331 million of gross margin for the quarter. And the company’s more than $250 million outlay for research and development spending also almost equals its gross profit. Simply put, incremental revenue growth won’t be enough to make this company profitable.

Home News india world sports weird Technology News Apps Science And Future Lifestyle self style who we are travel food Entertainment bollywood celebscoop hollywood Health Healthy Living Recipes Inspire Tips & Tricks Buzz Sports Videos Trending Home > Technology > Gadgets Chip Maker Qualcomm Is Patenting The 'Internet Of Shoes' To Build Smart Footwear Of Our Future Gwyn D'Mello May 22, 2017 It’s only expected that chip-makers like Intel and Qualcomm are now shifting some of their focus to the Internet of Things, in an attempt to cash in on the coming technology wave within the next few years. However, it seems Qualcomm’s ideas are a bit quirkier than your average smart light or IoT hub. The company has just filed an application with the US Patent and Trademark Office for something it’s calling the “Internet of Shoes”. Basically, it wants your footwear to be connected to, well… everything. The application describes the blueprints as a connected shoe apparatus, comprising of a processor, memory, radio, antenna, and a magnetometer. The idea is that it should be a shoe you can wear like normal, with the processor being able to determine which direction the shoes are facing, and transmitting that to a secondary device. It also talks about haptic feedback motors to “provide tactile navigation”, as well as a built-in battery that recharges when you walk. Theoretically, Qualcomm sees the shoes as not just another fitness device that counts your steps and helps navigate, but also to analyse your pace, gait, as well as tracking your blood pressure and heart rate. And as ridiculous as Internet of Shoes may sound, it’s likely a device of this kind could actually see plenty of users.  However, this is just a patent, so there’s no guarantee  we may ever actually see a device of this kind in the market. However, it does point out the direction in which Qualcomm is thinking, and that it’s looking to definitively expand into the IoT sector.

Because of their popularity, the pace of development is rapid and the choice is vast What's the Best Chromebook for Performance in 2017? What's the Best Chromebook for Performance in 2017? What's the best Chromebook for performance in 2017? We've rounded up some of the fastest Chromebooks around for professionals, ranging in price from $395-840. Read More . As such, it can be confusing if you want to upgrade your old machine or dive into the operating system for the first time. How do you know what to look out for? What are the key specs and features? If you’re about to hit the shops, read this article first. I’m going to introduce you to seven features your next Chromebook must have. 1. Android Apps Compatibility Google had been talking about bringing Android apps to Chromebooks for a long time, and in early 2017, we finally saw the dream become a reality All New Chromebooks Will Run Android Apps All New Chromebooks Will Run Android Apps Any new Chromebooks launched in 2017 and beyond will ship with access to the Google Play Store included as standard without the need for an update. Read More . The first Chromebook that supported Android apps fresh “out of the box” was the Samsung Chromebook Plus, but an increasing number of pre-existing models are now being brought onboard. They include popular machines such as the Dell Chromebook 13 (7310), the HP Chromebook 14 G4, and the Lenovo N23 Chromebook. On its website, Google lists more than 80 devices that’ll eventually be able to install the Google Play Store. Android apps on Chromebooks bring a lot of benefits. You can access more productivity tools, more offline content, and more games. At the moment, a lot of the developers still haven’t optimized their apps for the platform, but it’s clear the momentum is building. Samsung Chromebook Plus Convertible Touch Laptop (XE513C24-K01US) Samsung Chromebook Plus Convertible Touch Laptop (XE513C24-K01US) Flexible 360° profile. Enables you to use upright as a computer to reply to emails or finish a paper and recline for a tablet view ideal for surfing and viewing Buy Now At Amazon $437.90 2. 32 GB of Storage I’ll confess, my Chromebook is three and a half years old. And guess how much storage it has? That’s right, 16 GB. It confuses me, therefore, why some expensive models are still shipping with only 16 GB all this time later. I appreciate Chromebooks are “online” devices Chromebooks Don't Work Offline? Debunking the Myths Chromebooks Don't Work Offline? Debunking the Myths One of the biggest criticisms aimed at Google's Chromebooks is that they are online-only machines – ergo, no Internet, no point. How true is this statement? Read More and integrate seamlessly with Google Drive, but saving files in the cloud isn’t always practical or desirable. In 2017, you shouldn’t settle for less than 32 GB of storage capacity. The HP Chromebook 13 G1 comes with 32 GB, as does the Acer Chromebook 14. The ASUS Chromebook Flip comes with a mammoth 64 GB. At the other end of the scale, the Lenovo N22 only comes with 16 GB. Avoid it. ASUS Chromebook Flip C302CA-DHM4 12.5-Inch Touchscreen Intel Core m3 with 64GB storage and 4GB RAM ASUS Chromebook Flip C302CA-DHM4 12.5-Inch Touchscreen Intel Core m3 with 64GB storage and 4GB RAM The flexible 360 degree hinge and 12.5" Full-HD touchscreen lets you use the C302 in tablet or laptop mode. Buy Now At Amazon $499.00 3. Tablet Mode Tablets are another category of device that have been losing market share to Chromebooks in the last 18 months. It seems consumers prefer a lightweight fully-fledged browser rather than locked-down ecosystem and range of apps. However, their shape has always put them at a slight disadvantage. It’s simply not as comfortable to sit with a laptop on your knee as it is to hold a 10-inch display. Image Credit: 1stockphotopro via Shutterstock But all that’s about to change. The latest class of Chromebooks now offer 180-degree barrel hinges. They allow the screen to fold back on itself, giving you a tablet-esque user experience. The Samsung Chromebook Pro (and its little brother, the Plus) both offer tablet screens. If the $450 price tag is too steep for you, check out the Dell Chromebook 11 for $225. 4. 4 GB of RAM I’m going to refer back to my three-and-a-half-year-old HP Chromebook. It has 2 GB of RAM, and while it still performs most tasks with aplomb, it definitely struggles when several browser tabs are open The 10 Best Extensions For Chrome Tab Management The 10 Best Extensions For Chrome Tab Management If you’re a multi-tasker like me, you love tabs. Perhaps a little bit too much, as it’s easy to suddenly find you have a buffet of tabs available, but you’re no longer quite sure what... Read More at the same time. It even lags when I’m using TweetDeck and have a few live searches running at once. Therefore, it raises the question: Why are we still seeing some manufacturers release 2 GB models in 2017? Avoid them like the plague. You need a machine with 4 GB of RAM, especially now using your Chromebook is about to get even more resource intensive with the arrival of Android apps. Once again, the current best-in-class Samsung Chromebook Pro has 4 GB, as do the Acer Chromebook R11, the HP Chromebook 14, and the Toshiba Chromebook 2. Depending how much you’re willing to spend, you can even bump the HP Chromebook 13 as high as 16 GB. Toshiba Chromebook 2, 13.3", Intel Celeron 3215U, 4GB RAM, 16GB SSD (Certified Refurbished) Toshiba Chromebook 2, 13.3", Intel Celeron 3215U, 4GB RAM, 16GB SSD (Certified Refurbished) This Certified Refurbished product is tested & certified by Toshiba to look and work like-new. The product includes all original accessories, and is backed by a 90-day warranty. Buy Now At Amazon 5. Lightweight Chromebooks are durable and portable. Ideally, therefore, they should also be lightweight. You want to be able to throw it in your bag and forget it’s there, not feel like you’ve done a gym workout How To Workout Without Going To The Gym How To Workout Without Going To The Gym It's hard enough setting aside time for actual exercise, but throw in your commute and it can add up to a lot of wasted time. Try these effective workouts without ever leaving your home. Read More by the time you get home. The weights of the different models vary wildly. For example, the Acer Chromebook 15 tips the scales at a porky 4.85 pounds (2.2 kg). Sure, it boasts a larger-than-most 15.6-inch HD screen, but such high-end specs almost defeat the purpose of a Chromebook. Several models weigh less than 2.5 pounds (1.1 kg). They include the ASUS Chromebook Flip, HP Chromebook 11, and ASUS Chromebook 11. 6. Ports Not all Chromebooks are created equal — some have a wider selection of ports. Sure, you’ll always have a couple of USBs ports and an HDMI point, but what else is available? When you’re looking for your next device, you need to make sure it has either USB Type-C connections What Can You Shove In a USB C Port? What Can You Shove In a USB C Port? Look closely at the ports on your laptop. If you bought one in the past year, you'll notice a tiny, rectangular port you've probably never used. That's the USB C port. Read More or an SD card slot. SD card compatibility is the more common of the two. The ASUS Chromebook Flip has two USB-C ports and an SD card slot, while the HP Chromebook 13 G1 only has one USB-C port to accompany its SD card slot. The Acer Chromebook 15 and Dell 7310 Chromebook only have SD card compatibility. Don’t worry about the headphone jack. All Chromebooks have one! HP W0S99UT 13 -Inch G1 Chromebook (Intel Pentium processor, 4 GB SDRAM, 32 GB eMMC, Chrome OS 64), Silver HP W0S99UT 13 -Inch G1 Chromebook (Intel Pentium processor, 4 GB SDRAM, 32 GB eMMC, Chrome OS 64), Silver HP Smart Buy Chromebook 13 G1, Pentium Processor 4405Y (1 Buy Now At Amazon $489.70 7. Battery Life Google touts Chromebooks as being perfect for students and people on-the-go. Therefore, a long battery life is an essential feature. To be fair to ChromeOS, it’s always been quite light on battery consumption. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t some laptops that are better than others. The aforementioned Samsung Chromebook Pro and Plus both come with a 5,140 mAh battery that the company claims will last up to seven hours of continuous usage. ASUS goes one better with its Flip model, boasting nine hours. On the other hand, the HP Chromebook 13‘s QHD+ display eats through power. You’ll be lucky to see more than four hours. Which Features Are Important to You? I’ve shown you seven essential features and specs you need to pay attention to if you’re about to hit the shops for a new Chromebook. However, these might not be the most important things you consider. I want to know what you’re going to be looking in your next Chromebook. What features are must-have and which features don’t matter to you?

Required fields are marked * Comment Name * Email * Gareth May 22, 2017 at 5:40 pm I have bought the Asus Chromebook Flip C302A. It has replaced a 15 inch MacBook Pro, and I have to admit I was a little worried. However, having the Android and Chrome OS has made it an easy transfer. I would agree with all the points in this article, this combo is the way forward and if you're not requiring full professional use design, photo/video suites you're going to be fine. I plumped for the 8gb RAM just to be safe and have a 128gb stick that has USB-C and typical type A, and I have everything I could need. I love it and am a total convert. Reply Jerry Suppan May 22, 2017 at 1:11 pm Even 32GB storage is insufficient IMHO. Since we now deal with the era of Android apps compatibility on a Chromebook, that means Android apps are also downloadable and usable locally. That converts to storage space requirement. 32GB storage will just fill up too quickly for my comfort. (I have both a 64GB and 256GB storage capacity smartphone, so, I know the space will be appreciated). There should be minimally 64GB of storage, preferably 128GB with this in mind. And for related reasons, RAM should also be at least 4GB and perhaps 8GB or 16GB is not so far-fetched either. I am thinking in terms of using the Chromebook as a convertible, tablet-type Android device and not just only a Chromebook function. Reply Frank John May 22, 2017 at 1:04 pm Screen size. Miracast.

A reader writes to ask if it's worth paying $70 a year for anti-virus protection, or should he use Windows' own built-in support? A large surge in so-called ransomware infections has exacerbated the problem. Ransomware locks up your files, and the sender, naturally, demands a ransom to unlock them. Typical demand is $300. This can be blocked. Microsoft says its own free program, Windows Defender, offers enough protection for Windows 8 and Windows 10 users. Perhaps so. Research on the web found that Microsoft Defender caught 94.5 percent of threats. But the sample size was 1,517 threats, which meant that 83 went through. It's that extra 5.5 percent that gets ya. The answer, says our favorite guru, Kenny S. from HelpHelpNow.com, is to use the Windows Defender anti-virus program along with the free version of an anti-malware program from MalwareBytes.org. This works well if you have an older computer. Otherwise, adding a second anti-virus program can slow an already slow computer another 20 percent. If you have a faster computer, we recommend the free Avast from Avast.com, in addition to MalwareBytes. "Faster" is defined as an Intel i5 processor or better and 8 gigabytes or more of RAM. You can find out what processor you have by typing "system info" into the Windows search box. Our main computer falls into the slow category, having an outmoded AMD e2-1800 processor, instead of a faster i5 or i7 from Intel. We tried Avast anyway. (We're used to slow.) It updated our out-of-date programs, removed an add-on with a bad reputation, and noted that an extension had tampered with our default search engine, Google, and fixed that. It said we had a weak password for our Internet connection, so we changed it. (Even though our previous password had been in Sanskrit.) It offered to install the free Avast Safe Price, which lets you know if a lower price is available whenever you're shopping online. We went shopping online and immediately found 22 coupons giving us discounts on stuff we didn't want. What if you have a Mac? Since it's based, ultimately, on the Unix operating system that has been used to control huge mainframe computers, a virus can't get in deep. You might get some spyware if you add suspicious extensions to your web browser, but you can remove those by running the free MalwareBytes program. Your biggest danger is passing on an infected email to someone, though it failed to harm your Mac. Avast for the Mac can prevent that. If you have a Google Chromebook -- an inexpensive laptop used mainly for the Internet -- you don't need anti-virus software. It comes with built-in malware and virus protection, with multiple layers of security. Every time you boot the system, the software goes out there to the great beyond and fixes any problems. Beware the Pop-Up We've been warning others about pop-up ads for decades. We should have warned ourselves. On American Airlines' website, we were asked if we wanted travel insurance for $24. Sure! We thought we could get our money back if we had to cancel our flight for any reason. A friend of ours fell for the same thing. But she was savvier. She called American Airlines and was told they don't offer travel insurance. The insurance, it turned out, came from Allianz, a 100-year-old company. It's legit all right, but it will take a medical emergency, an act of terrorism, or the failure of the airline to get them to pay up. It says so right on their website. Our friend had just gotten out of the hospital and needed to cancel her trip. Allianz told her to fill out a form online. But since she needed her doctor's signature-- and he wasn't sitting beside her at the computer-- she sent it all in by mail, getting the P.O. box address (unlisted, by the way) from an agent on the phone. Even fishier A reader wrote us he couldn't get on the Internet, so he Googled the phone numbers for Avast, the anti-virus company. None of those phone numbers worked, so he went to Avast.com. From there, he got a company called Nanoheal, but it's unclear whether he clicked on a suspicious link or Avast has now outsourced its tech support. Nanoheal didn't give him a virus, but it charged him $119 for installing a free program. The Nanoheal tech installed the free MalwareBytes program, AdwCleaner, which stands for "adware cleaner." (MalwareBytes has a great reputation and we've used their other free products.) It fixed everything, including the Internet problem. Learning this -- we're always learning -- we installed it on our test computer. (That's our regular computer, but we think it sounds more professional if we call it our test computer.) It found 54 threats after we clicked "scan." When we clicked "clean" all was well and we rebooted. Rebooting, by the way, will fix many problems all by itself. In general, it's worth doing that before panicking. Remember: there's always time to panic. Cutting the cord We're constantly asked (OK, once in a while) about the best way to "cut the cord," or dump your cable TV service. The new Hulu service for $40 a month is getting the buzz lately. Instead of the usual channel listing, it shows you what you probably want to watch. But there are cheaper solutions out there. One way to go is to use Amazon, Netflix and YouTube, plus an antenna. Amazon gives you free movies for $99 a year as well as other perks like free two-day shipping. Netflix costs $8 a month and is better than we initially thought: We're currently hooked on a defunct series called White Collar. Use an antenna for local TV channels and get classic shows like Perry Mason as well as old movies from YouTube or your local library. It all works out to about $16 a month. The big complaint with cord-cutting however, is the cost of getting on the Internet. Companies like Comcast, Verizon and AT&T bundle everything. It can cost so much to get Internet service that you find you might as well add TV. However, after noticing that new subscribers were being offered Internet-only service for about $40 a month, we went on AT&T's website for a bit of a chat. We asked what our bill would be without TV service. The chat guy on the other end immediately offered to slice $55 a month off our bill. So we now pay $115 per month for TV and Internet instead of $170. Hey, that's $660 a year back in our pocket. And he was friendly, too.

By Ben Levisohn Updated May 22, 2017 9:22 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) tumbled to the bottom of the S&P 500 today, continuing recent volatility that saw it gain 12% last Tuesday and drop 12% on Wednesday. Illustration: Getty Images Advanced Micro Devices dropped 3.3% to $11.04 today, while the S&P 500 rose 0.5% to 2,394.02. Last Wednesday's big drop came after the firm said that it would earn 75 cents a share by 2020, a number that appears to have disappointed some investors. At a JPMorgan conference today, Advanced Micro Devices CEO Lisa Su commented on the company's "licensing objectives" but did not address recent Intel (INTC) rumors: So we don’t comment on rumors of any specific company or any specific deal. What I will talk generally about what we’re trying to do with licensing. I think AMD has one of the strongest portfolios in the industry around high-performance CPUs and high-performance GPUs. And we think that portfolio is very valuable. Our number one focus in the company though is around products. And so if you look at the financial model that we just put out for $0.75 EPS, it doesn’t assume that we have any new licensing deals other than our server joint venture, which has already been previously announced. Advanced Micro Devices' market capitalization fell to $10.4 billion today from $10.8 billion on Friday. It reported a net loss of $497 million on sales of $4.3 billion in 2016.

Asus ROG Strix X370-F and B350-F mobos take wing by Eric Born  10:02 AM on May 22, 2017 AMD launched its high-end Ryzen processors first and saved the lineup's mid-range offerings for later. Now that Ryzen 5 processors have been out on the market and Ryzen 3 processors are getting closer, it appears that Asus thought it was a good time to announce a pair of upper-midrange AM4 motherboards. These new offerings are the ROG Strix X370-F Gaming and ROG Strix B350-F Gaming. The ROG motherboards from Asus are known for their premium components, RGB LED bling, and gamer-friendly features. The ROG Strix X370-F Gaming checks all of these boxes. It's a big ATX board with dual, steel-reinforced PCI-e slots, one M.2 slot, and support for DDR4 RAM at 3200 MT/s. There's an onboard Intel I211-AT Gigabit Ethernet controller and a Realtek S1220A audio codec. The board includes one DisplayPort and one HDMI connector, even though AMD doesn't have a socket AM4 APU out on the market yet. The high-end X370 chipset offers a lot of connectivity, so accordingly there's a total of 10 USB ports in various flavors on the back panel, including USB 3.1 ports in Type-A and Type-C flavors. The board includes more than a few features for those inclined to overclock. A base clock generator headlines the list, and it could allow intrepid tweakers to push their CPUs' BCLK frequencies above 100 MHz for extreme memory overclocking. Asus claims users can push this frequency up to or beyond 158MHz on the X370-F. A ROG board just wouldn't look right without a few visual touches. The ROG Strix X370-F Gaming incorporates RGB LEDs (notably on the large I/O cover) and extra connectors with Aura Sync support. In many ways, the ROG Strix B350-F Gaming motherboard is the little cousin of the ROG Strix X370-F. The most important difference is the chipset, as the board employs AMD's mid-range B350 offering. Accordingly, the board has a couple fewer USB ports on the back and fewer PCIe lanes. The two USB 3.1 ports are of Type-A. Additionally, the B350-F doesn't use the standalone base clock generator. However, the board still includes the Intel I211-AT Ethernet controller, S1220A audio codec, and steel-reinforced PCI-e slots. While details on both boards are up on Asus' website, they haven't yet made it to online retailers. Asus hasn't yet revealed pricing or availability.

Samsung's high-end Chromebook Pro will be available May 28 by Zak Killian  2:38 PM on May 22, 2017 Back at CES, Samsung announced the Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro. The two machines are externally-identical magnesium-cased convertibles poised to fill the curious market niche of "high-end Chromebook." The only difference between them is the choice of processor. The Chromebook Plus uses a Rockchip-manufactured and Google-approved OP1 ARM-based SoC, while the Pro taps Intel for its processing power. The Plus model came out in February, but the Pro is only just hitting the market. In case you haven't seen these machines before, here's what they look like: folding-type convertible laptops packing a 12.3" touchscreen with a resolution of 2400x1600 and pen input support. You get 4GB of LP-DDR3 shared memory and 32GB of eMMC storage—both considerable amounts for a Chromebook. Another unusual high-end feature is the presence of a 802.11ac Wi-Fi adapter with 2x2 MIMO support. The soon-to-be-available Pro model uses a Core m3-6Y30 CPU, a dual-core Skylake chip that starts out at 900 MHz and can turbo to 2.2 GHz. This processor should offer better single-threaded performance than the ARM-based OP1 SoC in the Chromebook Plus, though that characteristic might not necessarily translate into better application performance. However, it's possible that some apps may only support an x86 CPU. The choice of an Intel chip could also make the Chromebook Pro more attractive to hackers looking to install an alternative OS on the little laptop. While the Chromebook Plus and its ARM SoC go for $450 as of this writing, the privilege of having Intel inside will cost you an extra $100. Samsung says the Chromebook Pro will be available for $550 on May 28 at Best Buy, Amazon, and Samsung.com. Tags: Mobile computing Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Doug Ducey shakes hands with Arizona State University President Michael Crow during his signing of a $1 billion bonding authority for the state's public universities in the Governor's office in Phoenix, Ariz., Monday, May 22, 2017. Ducey on Monday signed legislation that allows the state's three public universities to borrow up to $1 billion and puts the state on the hook for $27 million a year to help cover the payments. The Arizona Republic via AP Patrick Breen Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey shakes hands with Arizona State University President Michael Crow during his signing of a $1 billion bonding authority for the state's public universities in the Governor's office in Phoenix, Ariz., Monday, May 22, 2017. Ducey on Monday signed legislation that allows the state's three public universities to borrow up to $1 billion and puts the state on the hook for $27 million a year to help cover the payments. The Arizona Republic via AP Patrick Breen Business May 22, 2017 10:55 PM A glance at bills signed Monday by Gov. Doug Ducey The Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Gov. Doug Ducey on Monday finished up work on the 2017 legislative session by acting on 33 remaining bills, including signing legislation creating a $1 billion university loan program and 26 other bills. But he also vetoed six bills, including one legalizing the growing of hemp. A look at some of the bills signed and vetoed by the Republican governor: SIGNINGS: TAX INCENTIVES Ducey signed three bills that boost tax incentives for big and small business. One bill is a new $10 million "angel investor" tax credit program for capital infusions into small businesses, and the second one expands eligibility for a state jobs creations tax fund to smaller businesses. The third bill extends until 2025 a job-creation tax credit for big companies. It includes new lower property taxes for Intel and other manufacturers in special trade zones that already pay an ultra-low tax rate on new equipment and a tax break pushed by corporate jet seller NetJets exempting it from sales taxes that Ducey vetoed earlier in the session. WORKERS' COMPENSATION Ducey signed legislation allowing current or retired firefighters with certain cancers to presumptively qualify for workers compensation coverage. A second bill he signed requires coverage if a firefighter has a fatal or disabling heart attack within 24 hours of being exposed to smoke from a fire. LEGAL TENDER Ducey signed a proposal exempting the sale of U.S. gold coins from state capital gains taxes after vetoing two previous version of the bill. LAWMAKER MILEAGE Ducey also signed legislation boosting mileage payments for state lawmakers above what it paid to other state employees. House Speaker J.D. Mesnard has said lawmakers who travel long distances in their own cars need an increase from the current state rate of 44.5 cents per mile to the federal rate of 53.5 cents a mile. ELECTION DATES Elections for sales-tax increases by counties, cities and towns must be placed only on November general election year ballots under legislation signed by Ducey. It was pushed by conservative Republican lawmakers who believed higher turnout will make tax-increase elections more representative. Opponents said it handcuffs cities from asking for tax increases when they need the money. WELFARE Welfare recipients will again be eligible for two years of cash payments but be required to work or be enrolled in job training and ensure their children are attending school. The measure partially restores cuts the Republican governor pushed through in a measure in 2015 that limited lifetime welfare payments to one year, the shortest in the nation. Payments would be reduced or eliminated if a participant is caught with a controlled substance or quits a job. SCHOOL SUBSTANCE ABUSE School districts will be required to report the amount of suspensions and expulsions involving the sale and use of drugs under a measure signed by the governor. The annual reports to the Arizona Department of Education must include statistics on the possession, use, sale, and type of drug involved in each case and be posted online by the state agency. VETOES: INDUSTRIAL HEMP The governor vetoed legislation allowing the growing, processing, marketing and sales of industrial hemp. Sponsor Sen. Sonny Borrelli said the measure is needed to boost the state's agricultural economy. Ducey said lawmakers didn't include funding for Department of Agriculture to set up and oversee the needed licensing program. A $250,000 per year appropriation was removed by an amendment. STUDENT JOURNALISTS The governor refused to grant greater protections to high school and college journalists from administrative censorship. The measure would have limited restrictions to content that is libelous, invades personal privacy, violates federal or state law, or "materially and substantially disrupts the orderly operation of the school." Ducey said it might have unintended consequences, especially on high school campuses where adult supervision is especially important. OTHER VETOES Ducey also vetoed bills changing how teachers and principals are evaluated, easing rulemaking for charter schools, eliminating a waiting period before state employees start earning pensions and setting up a voluntary payment system for conservation easements that Ducey called a "slippery slope" for tax policy and a possible threat to military installations.

VETOES: INDUSTRIAL HEMP The governor vetoed legislation allowing the growing, processing, marketing and sales of industrial hemp. Sponsor Sen. Sonny Borrelli said the measure is needed to boost the state's agricultural economy. Ducey said lawmakers didn't include funding for Department of Agriculture to set up and oversee the needed licensing program. A $250,000 per year appropriation was removed by an amendment. STUDENT JOURNALISTS The governor refused to grant greater protections to high school and college journalists from administrative censorship. The measure would have limited restrictions to content that is libelous, invades personal privacy, violates federal or state law, or "materially and substantially disrupts the orderly operation of the school." Ducey said it might have unintended consequences, especially on high school campuses where adult supervision is especially important. OTHER VETOES Ducey also vetoed bills changing how teachers and principals are evaluated, easing rulemaking for charter schools, eliminating a waiting period before state employees start earning pensions and setting up a voluntary payment system for conservation easements that Ducey called a "slippery slope" for tax policy and a possible threat to military installations.

Here's how to breathe new life into your old desktop system. By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | May 22, 2017 -- 12:19 GMT (05:19 PDT) | Topic: PCs It's a fact of life that PCs get slower and more sluggish over time, as we expect aging hardware to rise to the challenges of newer operating systems and applications. Cyberwar and the Future of Cybersecurity A spotter's guide to the groups that are out to get you Ransomware attack: How a nuisance became a global threat Devastating attacks to public infrastructure 'a matter of when' in the US The Internet of Insecure Things, and why we're still in denial But eventually, PCs get to the point where they need some care and feeding. The method of rejuvenation I used to recommend was to add more RAM. But not any more. See also: Stop disabling automatic updates, people! Over the past few weeks I've been working on upgrading some of the aging systems here at the PC Doc HQ. These systems average about five years old, but all were already kitted out with lots of RAM -- ranging from 8GB all the way to 32GB -- and what would have at the time of purchase been considered high-end processors. But these systems had grown to the point where they were slow and sluggish. So where was the speed bump? I figured it would be the hard drives. And I was right. I just happened to have some old solid state drive laying about the place -- some a 256GB Integral drive, a couple of 460GB Intel drives, and a really tasty terabyte OWC Mercury Electra 6G drive -- so I decided to see what effect upgrading the primary drive would have on the systems. It was like night and day. Doing nothing other than migrating the operating system over from the hard drive to the SSD unit -- more on how I did this in a moment -- boot times went from the 30 to 60 second mark to under 10 seconds, and the responsiveness of Windows 10 on initially logging into the system went from awful to awesome, with the systems being immediately usable. And all this was accomplished without removing a megabyte of cruft or detritus that had accumulated on the systems. High-performance storage for PC and Mac (August... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 16 NEXT PREV So you want to try this at home? If you want to do this yourself you'll need the following: An SSD. Depending on your PC, you may need a 5.25-inch or 3.5-inch tray to fit in a bay designed for a hard drive or optical drive (some SSD kits come with these parts). A #1 Phillips screwdriver. A tool for carrying out the migration (I used the free MiniTool PartitionWizard Free Edition, which performed flawlessly). A basic understanding of how to fit and remove storage drives. A knowledge of how your BIOS works, specifically setting which drive the system boots up from (there are so many different kinds that I can't help, so find do a web search for the manual for your motherboard). Tip: A quick way to find out what your motherboard is to fire up a Command Prompt and use the Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line tool. To do that, type: wmic baseboard get product,manufacturer,version The process is pretty simple: Open up the PC and fit the new drive. Fire up the Windows Disk Management tool (press Windows Key+R on your keyboard to launch the Run dialog box and then type diskmgmt.msc and press Enter). Find the new drive, which will be marked as "unknown" and "Not initialized" in the listing of drives at the bottom of the Disk Management window, and then right-click on where it says "unknown" and choose Initialize Disk and then follow the prompts. Download, install, and then launch MiniTool Partition Wizard Free Edition. Click on Migrate OS to SSD/HD in toolbar and follow the prompts. When the migration process is done -- this will take some time, maybe as much as a few hours -- then you will need to set the system BIOS to boot up off the SSD. You can, if you want, remove the old drive, or keep it in the system, wipe it, and use it for storage. Tip: Swapping a drive will not trigger a Windows reactivation. So will this work for you? Having tried it with a range of SSDs (ranging in performance from basic to high-end), and across a range of systems (from dual-core to dual-socket), I'm pretty confident that anyone moving from a hard drive to an SSD will see serious performance gains, even when RAM is down at the 2GB levels (below that and RAM does become quite a limiting factor, but if you're running Windows 10 then you ideally need 2GB).

Digital doodlers have a new object of desire. HP's refreshed Spectre X2 packs one of Intel's latest Core i7 CPUs behind a mammoth 12.3in, 3000x2000 display that's good for sketching, scribbling and general note-taking thanks to a Windows Ink-friendly stylus. The U-shaped copper kickstand around the back does more than look fantastic, too - it'll adjust to almost any angle, so you can get comfy while you create. Throw in a magnetic keyboard for when you need to get some writing done, a battery that'll get you eight hours between charges, and a Windows Hello-ready IR camera for a password-free lockscreen, and you've got one hot hybrid that'll easily give the Surface Pro a run for it's money. It'll be on sale from June, with prices starting from $US999.

Fortune Insiders Search Search VolkswagenVolkswagen’s CEO Says Changing the Automaker’s Corporate Culture Is ‘Not an Easy Undertaking’ GreeceThe French Finance Minister Says He’s ‘Confident’ About Reaching a Deal on Greece in June CybersecurityExperts Say It’s ‘Highly Likely’ North Korea Was Behind the WannaCry Ransomware Attack TransferwiseNew ‘Borderless’ Accounts From TransferWise Make It Easier To Bank Overseas Office discussion Ezra Bailey/Getty Images Commentary Most Powerful Women Do This the Next Time You Notice Sexism at Work Lila Ibrahim May 22, 2017 The MPW Insiders Network is an online community where the biggest names in business and beyond answer timely career and leadership questions. Today’s answer for, “How can women respond to gender stereotyping at work?” is written by Lila Ibrahim, chief operating officer at Coursera. When I began my career as a computer hardware engineer in the 1990s, I stood out. I was not only a woman in a male-dominated field, but also at least a decade younger than most of my colleagues. I had to confront stereotypes about my gender and my age, often in the span of a single conversation. I learned then, and continue to be reminded today, that just calling out bias isn’t enough. Stereotypes are deeply rooted in our culture; pruning them helps, but to make real progress, we need to dig deeper. If you see bias playing out around you, try not to default to knee-jerk reactions. Instead, cultivate a confident, thoughtful outlook, understand where the bias is coming from, and build and a strong support system. Embrace your differences When I started that first computer hardware job, I tried to hide my youth. I pulled my wild, curly hair into a tight bun, wore fake glasses, purged my desk of personal photos, and smiled as little as possible. But burying my personality under a facade of adulthood (or what I thought was adulthood) made me miserable—and it didn’t work. I still had to respond to snide comments like, “Have you graduated from high school?” Related LeadershipWhat You Absolutely Can’t Do in Your New Job Leadership What You Absolutely Can’t Do in Your New Job Later in my career, I took a job in Intel’s consumer division in Japan. As a young American woman in a foreign country, I couldn’t avoid standing out. But this time, I embraced it. I knew I was valuable to the division, and instead of focusing on why I was the oddball, I focused on the advantages that my unique background offered. I asked questions fearlessly, contributed fresh ideas, and built strong relationships. Bias feeds on insecurity. We all have the impulse to hide our differences. But if you’re ashamed of who you are, you’re silently telling the world that you agree with stereotypes. Hold you head high and remind yourself that your differences are an asset, not a liability. Find the root of the bias To move beyond bias, we need to recognize it even when it’s subtle and confront it in ways that invite honest, factual conversation. For example, I once had a colleague who didn't treat me with respect, given our relative positions in the company and my responsibilities on our shared projects. I sensed that his behavior was due to some unconscious gender bias. When I addressed the issue with him, I focused on the impact that it was having on our work. We had a good conversation, and I was able to clarify my role and the support that I needed from him to do my job well. From then on, our relationship became much more productive. On another occasion, I had a coworker sit me down during my first week in a new job and question my judgment. The conversation felt combative, but I worked hard to probe the reasons for their concern. Once I looked past the tone of the interaction, I realized that some of their feedback was honest and practical—even if it was hard to hear. Listening to what they said, rather than how they said it, ultimately helped me improve my work. Make powerful allies Facing stereotypes takes courage, but you don’t have to do it alone. Find allies who will give you honest feedback and sound advice. Women entering the workforce today have their pick of strong role models and mentors in almost every industry; if you’re feeling stuck, seek out someone who’s been in your shoes, and ask for their help. Sometimes, a few words from a strong ally is all you need. When I was working overseas, I would often hear my parents’ voices in my head, saying, “Lila, you deserve to be here. You’ve earned this position.” I still repeat those words to myself in tough moments today. To all the women—and men—who are confronting stereotypes and working to make them a thing of the past: You deserve to be here. Embrace your unique strengths, keep having the hard and important conversations, and know that many people are cheering you on.

(FL), Campbell Soup Company (CPB) and Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. (HALO) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks View All Posts In the wake of news that U.S. allies in the Middle East will be purchasing $350 billion worth of defense and military hardware over the course of the next ten years, the bulls were willing to pick up where they left off on Friday. By the time Monday’s closing bell rang, the S&P 500 was up 0.52% to end the session at 2,394.02. Not every name got on board the bullish train today, however. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Forterra Inc (NASDAQ:FRTA) and Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) all moved in the other direction, however, albeit for understandable reasons. Here’s what traders need to know. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Last Tuesday, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices shares surged 8% on the heels of news that rival/partner Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) had inked a deal to use its graphical display technologies in future hardware. As it turns out though, the “news” wasn’t true. The next day, AMD stock gave all of that gain back when the company didn’t say a word about any such deal at an analyst event after that day’s close. In the meantime, the prospect of that Intel/AMD further withered. At a technology conference hosted by J.P. Morgan today, Advanced Micro Devices CEO Lisa Su made a point of saying of the rumors, “We’re not looking at enabling a competitor to compete against our products.” AMD ended the day down 3.3%. Amgen, Inc. (AMGN) Shares of biotechnology stock Amgen ended the day down 2.2% after its osteoporosis drug may be riskier to users than first expected. On Sunday, Amgen and its partner UCB Pharma announced that their jointly-developed osteoporosis drug, romosozumab, successfully limits the possibility of vertebrae fractures after menopause. But, it may also increase the odds of heart attacks to the tune of 30%. The additional findings from the company’s study won’t necessarily prevent the FDA from approving the drug. However, the company cautioned AMGN shareholders that the finding could delay the drug’s approval by a year or more from its originally expected decision due in July. On the flipside, the update does lower the odds of an approval. Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges gives romosozumab a 50/50 shot at an approval now. Forterra Inc (FRTA) Finally, pipe manufacturer Forterra lost 15.5% of its value on Monday, bringing the six-day rout to 54%. Don’t look for a specific reason FRTA sold off again today, however. Rather, Monday’s weakness was just an extension the selloff that got rolling last week. On the surface, its first-quarter earnings report looked fine. Revenue almost doubled. Yet, a closer look revealed that all of that growth stemmed from acquisitions rather than organic growth. Worse, the loss of 35 cents per share was leaps and bounds worse than the expected loss of nine cents per share of FRTA. The growth strategy isn’t paying off like it needs to. Fanning the bearish flames that have scorched FRTA in the meantime is a string of pending fraud cases being prepped against the company. As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Larry Klayman excoriates GOP 'political pygmies' targeting own president By Larry Klayman One has come to expect the worst from the vile, ultra-leftist, political hacks in the Democratic Party. There has been no falsehood or cheap, low-class tactic that is beneath the Nancy Pelosis, Chuck Schumers, or Elizabeth Warrens in this bankrupt political tribe. So when they, along with their leftist hacks in the media, the prime time "boys" of CNN, the prime time "girls" and communists of MSNBC and the slimy reporters (with the exception of a few) of the Washington Post, New York Times and Los Angeles Times set out to destroy Donald Trump after he won the White House on Nov. 8 of last year, it came as no surprise to anyone with an IQ over 50. But what has proven to be even more disgusting are the "Brutuses" in the establishment wing of the Republican Party: the jealous, hateful and at this point senile John McCain, the childlike, two-faced House Speaker Paul Ryan and the moronic media whore House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, all of whom, along with other hacks like intellectually challenged Senate Intel Committee Chairman Richard Burr, have literally stabbed their own president in the back. While President Trump is not the modern-day Caesar, his presence commands deceit and disloyalty among those who covet the opportunity to run on the Republican ticket for president in 2020. To have this chance, they have to collaborate with the modern-day National Socialists in the Democratic Party to destroy our president. These political pygmies could have had a field day had they slithered around Paris during the reign of Vichy France in World War II. As for Chaffetz, perhaps the biggest buffoon and hack of all – a man who as House Oversight Committee chairman covered up a bona fide investigation into the causes of the Extortion 17 tragedy, when 30 servicemen and 22 special ops forces, including SEAL Team VI, died in the largest loss of life during the war in Afghanistan not coincidentally three months after the death of Osama bin Laden – now that he and the rest of the Republican establishment traitors have succeeded in getting President Trump embroiled in a criminal special counsel investigation, he has chosen to hasten his previously announced and likely scandal-induced departure from Congress and the House Oversight Committee chairmanship. He is now reported to be taking a position as political commentator on Fox News. Realizing that his thunder was about to be snatched by special counsel and former FBI Director Robert Mueller – as Chaffetz wanted to be the one to collaborate with Ranking Minority Rep. Elijah Cummings to spearhead the takedown of The Donald in committee hearings – his future ambitions are better served as political commentator. See video of my take on Chaffetz move: It is clear now that little if anything will be achieved in the corrupt bowels of Congress by way of new legislation, thanks to the likes of these Republican and Democratic Party establishment politicians. Ironically, that may be good. Who needs more laws? We already have too many. And, why bother fixing and reforming Obamacare? Let it die on the leftist vine, as the president will just be blamed for any new law that will not, by economic necessity, be able to cover all Americans. Save for tax reform, nothing is worth doing in Congress. Instead, the president should continue to use his executive powers, in a legal non-Obama way, to pursue his domestic and foreign policy objectives and those for which the American people voted. In the foreign sphere in particular, with the prospect of nuclear war with North Korea and the Islamic Republic of Iran, Trump's ability to protect the nation and shape our future remains large. I would also urge the president to bear down in quickly appointing federal judges who respect the rule of law and the Constitution, and Freedom Watch's Judicial Selection Strike Force Coalition will work with him in this regard to identify and have confirmed honest and independent jurists. See www.judicialselectionstrikeforce.org. Currently, about 70-80 percent of the judges now sitting on the federal bench are, with a few exceptions, the generally leftist and intellectually dishonest appointees of former Presidents Clinton and Obama. If the leftist ideological mix on the federal bench is not diluted, the president will continue to lose legal challenges by the likes of the American Civil Liberties Union in judicial circuits such the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. Fortunately, there are over 100 judicial vacancies in the lower federal courts that need to be quickly filled. In short, while the vile, leftist Democrat Party and its henchmen in the media, coupled with the "Brutuses" in the Republican establishment, continue to sharpen their knives to kill the Trump presidency and have him removed from office, The Donald simply needs to don his gladiator helmet and spear, keep his head down, soldier on and refuse to leave the Colosseum until his opponents are legally slaughtered. In this regard, he will not only have the support of yours truly, but that segment of the citizenry who voted him into power, knowing full well that that he would be under attack and have to then fight for his and our lives. The Trump presidency is the nation's last chance to be made great again, if not survive at all. If you think the last president, one Barack Hussein Obama – had his policies and actions been furthered under a President Hillary Clinton – was a real threat to the vision and creation of our Founding Fathers, the republic's future beyond an unsuccessful Trump presidency will likely be "hell on leftist earth."

(more) Larry Klayman, founder of Judicial Watch and Freedom Watch, is known for his strong public interest advocacy in furtherance of ethics in government and individual freedoms and liberties. During his tenure at Judicial Watch, he obtained a court ruling that Bill Clinton committed a crime, the first lawyer ever to have done so against an American president. Larry became so famous for fighting corruption in the government and the legal profession that the NBC hit drama series West Wing created a character after him: Harry Klaypool of Freedom Watch. His character was played by actor John Diehl. In 2004, Larry ran for the U.S. Senate as a Republican in Florida's primary. After the race ended, he founded Freedom Watch. The author of two books, Fatal Neglect and Whores: Why and How I Came to Fight the Establishment, Larry is a frequent commentator on television and radio, as well as a weekly columnist, on Friday, for WND.com. He has been credited as being the inspiration for the Tea Party movement. (See "Larry Klayman — The One Man TEA Party," by Dr. Richard Swier.)

He and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu played up their friendship during a joint appearance, even as questions continued to swirl about Trump revealing classified information to the Russians that was reportedly given to the United States by Israel. Trump on Monday said he never mentioned Israel to the Russians. "I never mentioned the word or the name Israel. Never mentioned during that conversation," Trump said in Jerusalem during a meeting with Netanyahu. Reports about Trump's disclosure to the Russians do not allege he explicitly named Israel, but that Russia could have gleaned the source from what Trump did say. The Hill's Jordan Fabian has more on that here. Despite reports that Israel is privately furious, Trump and Netanyahu were all smiles during their press conference after the meeting. The Hill's Jonathan Easley reports: Netanyahu, who had a frosty relationship with former President Obama, grinned throughout the press conference while swiping at Trump's predecessor. "We understand each other and so much of the things we wish to accomplish for both of our countries," Netanyahu said. He thanked Trump for his "deep commitment to Israel's future" and, taking a shot at Obama, said he appreciated "the reassertion of American leadership in the Middle East." Read more on the press conference here. Trump's stop in Israel followed his swing through Saudi Arabia over the weekend, where he received a glamorous welcome, officially announced a $110 billion arms deal with the Saudis and gave a major speech seeking to heal wounds with the Muslim world. If you missed The Hill's weekend coverage of the Saudi stop, some highlights: -- Trump urges Muslim world to 'drive out the extremists' -- Official: Trump's 'radical Islamic terrorism' wording changed because he's 'exhausted' -- Trump readies high-stakes speech to the Muslim world -- Trump gets royal welcome during 'tremendous' Saudi Arabia visit -- Trump signs $110B defense deal with Saudi Arabia -- Saudi Arabia courts Trump LATEST ON FLYNN SAGA: Former national security adviser Michael Flynn officially refused to comply with the Senate Intelligence Committee's subpoena Monday, setting up a potential showdown. In a letter to the committee, Flynn's lawyers invoked the Fifth Amendment and an "escalating public frenzy" around the investigation into Russian election interference. The Senate now must decide how far it's willing to go to enforce the subpoena, reports The Hill's Katie Bo Williams: If they do seek to enforce the subpoena, they will need the cooperation of the Justice Department. And it's unclear which official would be responsible for handling the referral. For now, the Senate panel's appetite to hold Flynn in contempt -- the first step to enforcing the subpoena -- appears limited.

Read more on their reaction here. Also Monday, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee accused Flynn of misleading security clearance investigators about who funded a trip he took to Russia in 2015. Read more about that here. ARMED SERVICES CHAIR TALKS BUDGET, TROOPS IN EASTERN EUROPE: Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, was at the Brookings Institution on Monday talking military readiness. There, he warned against "low expectations" ahead of the Trump administration's budget rollout Tuesday. President Trump will ask for a $603 billion base defense budget, well below what Thornberry and other defense hawks have advocated for. Ahead of the budget's official unveiling, Thornberry urged his colleagues not to start budget negotiations with a pessimistic mindset as he championed his higher proposal. "As President Bush said in a different context, don't be guilty of the soft bigotry of low expectations," Thornberry said. "Even some of my colleagues are saying, 'OK, we're in a for a yearlong [continuing resolution].' If that's our mindset, then we will bring it to pass." Thornberry also said he's asked the Pentagon to price out how much it would cost to permanently station U.S. troops in Eastern Europe, he said Monday. "I've asked for just a study [of] the costs," Thornberry told reporters after the event. "What are the estimates of what it would take to have a permanent unit there versus the cost of rotations? We ought to know that information." U.S. troops have been in Eastern European countries such as Poland and the Baltic states on a rotating basis as part of the European Reassurance Initiative established to assuage allies worried about a resurgent Russia. The presence is effectively permanent since the rotations are continuous. But opponents say that's not an aggressive enough approach to confront Russia and that a permanent stationing would send a stronger message. Read more about the budget here, and the troops in Eastern Europe here. PENTAGON REPORTEDLY OVERCHARGING FOR FUEL: The Pentagon has amassed nearly $6 billion in seven years by charging the military excessive prices for fuel, using the money on underfunded -- and in some cases mismanaged -- defense programs, The Washington Post reports. The Defense Department has, since 2015, used the extra dollars for $80 million to train Syrian rebels, $450 million for a fraud-riddled prescription-drug program and $1.4 billion to cover unanticipated expenses from fighting in Afghanistan, according to the Post, which cited military accounting records. Critics accuse Pentagon officials of gaining the extra money by billing the military branches for fuel at much higher rates than what commercial airlines paid for jet fuel on the open market. The Hill's Ellen Mitchell has more on the Post report here. ON TAP FOR TOMORROW: The Pentagon will brief reporters on the 2018 budget request: -- Noon: Acting comptroller John Roth and director of force structure, resources and assessment for the Joint Staff Lt.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars TRANSPORTATION Guest How open source software will drive the future of auto innovations Ted Serbinski, Techstars@tedserbinski May 22, 2017 2:10 PM Image Credit: Screenshot Automotive companies are shifting from bending metal to bending bits. Soon they will be offering software and services to complement their manufactured metal. As these companies become software-driven, open source will become a staple to drive innovation faster and more reliably. Today’s cloud is powered by open source software: 78 percent of businesses run open source software in some form. With the convergence of automobiles and the cloud (supporting autonomous systems and connectivity), it’s quite clear this open source paradigm that took over the cloud will take over the automobile. This future of mobility includes the convergence of automotive hardware and software-driven cloud solutions. Open source will be at the core of this transformation and will drive innovation faster. Soon we will see Ford, GM, Fiat Chrysler, BMW, and other manufacturers launching their own open source initiatives. Open-sourcing parts of your automobile Whether it be navigation, music and media, or mobile phone support, you might be interfacing with features built on top of open source software already. Genivi is an open source framework for in-vehicle infotainment launched in 2009 with founding members BMW, GM, Intel, and Delphi. It launched with a goal of “driving innovation” to “reduce time-to-market and total cost of ownership.” This platform gives car makers more impact and leverage over the features available in an in-car experience. Automotive companies can reduce costs and enable richer experiences by leveraging an open source project like Genivi. This allows them to focus on what differentiates their own product. Your engine, transmission, airbags, anti-lock brakes, and cruise control are all connected via a system called the CAN bus. This protocol powers the backbone network in a vehicle. Like the HTTP protocol that powers the internet, systems can be built on top of the CAN bus to enable entirely new applications, like cars that drive themselves. In the automotive world, examples include: PolySync developed an open source car control project detailing the conversion of a vehicle into an autonomous driving vehicle. George Hotz is giving away the code behind his self-driving car project, an open source alternative to Tesla’s Autopilot. ROS, a robot operating system, is enabling R&D teams at automotive companies to quickly develop and prototype autonomous vehicles and sensor-rich vehicles. Just like much of the web is built on Linux, much of the autonomous future will be built on open source projects. Today, it already seems clear that ROS is one of those emerging open source platforms. The blueprints to design and build electric vehicles and transportation services One of the more audacious open source projects is OSVehicle, founded with a mission “to democratize mobility by enabling businesses and startups to design, prototype, and build custom electric vehicles and transportation services.” Renault’s open source mass market vehicle platform was the first major automotive company to leverage this product. This was the world’s first open source mass market vehicle platform. Other OSVehicle projects include: BusyBee, the first road-legal city car built on the open platform FabCar, a vehicle showcased at Fab10 in Barcelona that can be built inside a FabLab SPA’s Luxury EV, from a historical Italian brand and made of new high-tech materials Maker’s cars, vehicles created by hobbyists with local materials such as fabric and wood Nika, the first connected car made specifically to enable app development The future of automotive is open source The future of mobility will encompass services offered for getting around more freely. Automotive companies will shift from manufacturing steel to serving up bits. Software and data will drive this core differentiator, enabling new services and seamless experiences. The entire internet infrastructure changed over the late ’90s and early ’00s, leveraging open source software. Those proprietary systems opened up, making it easier and cheaper to build websites. Content management systems became open, allowing publishers to focus on their core differentiator: their content. As a result, we saw a proliferation of amazing websites, apps, and tools online. The automotive industry and emerging mobility companies will see the same result over the coming decade. It won’t be limited to infotainment, autonomous systems, or vehicle design. Open source will enhance every aspect of a vehicle in the coming decade. Companies that embrace this change will drive innovation faster. They will be able to shift to enabling new services and experiences. This will drive up their competitive advantages while reducing costs associated with running commodity parts of their business. Ted Serbinski is the managing director of Techstars Mobility, a startup accelerator.

(AMD) Stock Risks a Nasty Breakdown Dow Jones Finishes Strong as Trump Fears Recede View All Posts Shares of chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) are reversing lower on Monday, ending a month-long recovery from a test of its 200-day moving average after suffering a 30%-plus decline from its late-February high. Excitement over the launch of the new Ryzen CPU architecture — allowing AMD stock to take the fight to Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) for the first time in years — has given way to doubts about sales growth and guidance. Click to Enlarge The rebound from recent lows accelerated last week on chatter arch rival Intel would license graphics chips from AMD for low-cost integrated solutions (for non-gaming PCs) to help compete against Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Subsequent reports shot down that idea, and the bid quickly disappeared. The company reported a 18.3% year-over-year revenue expansion for the first quarter on May 1 thanks to the Ryzen launch. But its profit-margin outlook disappointed. Considering that AMD stock had gained 20% year-to-date (and nearly 400% since the beginning of 2016), this bit of bad news was enough to encourage aggressive profit-taking. Following earnings, analysts at UBS noted margin guidance was lower than expected and thus maintained their “sell” rating on limited upside earnings potential in AMD stock to justify a high price-earnings multiple. The problem is the company will continue to invest heavily to compete with Intel (in CPUs) and Nvidia (in GPUs) going forward. A break below the 200-day moving average — which also represents double-bottom support from January and May, would set up a fall back to pre-holiday levels near $7 for a drop of nearly 40% from here. AMD stock will next report results on July 31. Analysts are looking for breakeven on $1.15 billion in revenue. Much depends on the success of the upcoming Vega GPU chipset. But with NVDA flooding the market over the past year with GTX1000 graphics cards, one wonders if near-term demand from PC gamers has already been satiated.

U.S. Editions Australia Edition China Edition India Edition Italy Edition Japan Edition Singapore Edition United Kingdom United States May 23, 2:49 AM EDT Subscribe Search Search Business Technology World National Media & Culture Millennial Money Entertainment Sports Subscribe Technology Growth Of Enterprise Ethereum Alliance Foreshadows Blockchain Gold Rush By Leigh Cuen On 05/22/17 AT 4:20 PM Close The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance announced Monday more than 86 companies joined its network of blockchain innovators, including the National Bank of Canada, Samsung SDS and the San Francisco Stock Exchange. The EEA is the leading corporate gateway into the world of blockchain. Its founding members include Microsoft, JPMorgan Chase, Intel and Wipro, just to name a few. Although blockchain technology is still in its infancy, there is rampant adoption and integration across the tech industry, from startups to corporations. Among fintech veterans, the EEA already has a reputation for pragmatic collaborations where members wiggle around the red tape to get things done. “We still have a few hundred potential members waiting on the waiting list,” Matt Spoke, CEO of the blockchain startup Nuco, said at Consensus 2017 in New York on Monday. “You won’t get much as an observer. You’ll get more value as a participant. ... Everything is built around incentivizing members to actively participate.” Read: Why Startups Are Raising Cryptocurrency Along those lines, JPMorgan quickly moved from private talks to a public partnership with Zcash, a cryptocurrency with more privacy features than bitcoin. Forbes reported Monday that Zerocoin Electric Coin Co., the firm behind Zcash, plans to add Zcash’s privacy technology to JPMorgan’s blockchain system, Quorum. Critics of the Ethereum gold rush say blockchain is widely misunderstood, which is definitely true, and that privacy concerns create a major barrier for enterprise companies. JPMorgan’s new project may resolve many of those discrepancies between public and private ledger distribution. "Until now, blockchain technology's lack of privacy and confidentiality has been a major obstacle to adoption,” Zcash chief operating officer Jack Gavigan told Forbes. “By combining the zero-knowledge security layer (ZSL) with Quorum's private smart contracts, that obstacle is removed for many use cases, ranging from simple equity trades to complex derivatives." Amber Baldet, Blockchain Program Lead at JP Morgan, unveiled a live demo of the Quorum open-source platform at Consensus 2017 on Monday. She said internal departments are already using Quorum for payments. It won’t be long until JPMorgan offers blockchain contracts and scalable financial services for external clients too. “Corporate and investment banking, global scale financial applications,” Baldet explained during the demonstration. Even though the project is still in development, Quorum is an open source system and these experiments are having a wider impact on the Ethereum community. “What we’ve seen is an ecosystem emerging that really doesn’t have anything to do with what we’re doing at JPMorgan," Baldet said. "It's really cool."  For example, Spanish banking giant Banco Santander is already using Quorum. John Whelan, Banco’s director of innovation, described Baldet as “the genius” pushing banks forward into the future. “It’s great to see the privacy components coming together,” Whelan told International Business Times. “In financial services, the privacy of a financial transaction is not only important from a business point of view, it’s also mandated by regulators.” Read: How Women Are Building The Future And Promoting Diversity With Blockchain Blockchain technology is generally decentralized and values public, anonymous transactions over accredited options. Some major financial institutions are experimenting with private blockchain solutions. For example Nasdaq and Citi also announced Monday they are integrating blockchain technology into their internal systems. JPMorgan’s project is more along the lines of technology being developed by IBM, offering unique combinations of both public and private options. “Which is different from the bitcoin or Ethereum system,” Whelan said. In the back rooms of the New York conference, Wall Street veterans gossip about making millions over the next few weeks from cryptocurrency investments. Mashable reported the price of bitcoin passed $2,000 on Monday. Ethereum's ether tokens are now reportedly valued at around $180, a 1,400 percent rise compared to three months ago. Meanwhile, professional groups like the EEA are taking that growth from investors' private bank accounts to mainstream enterprise. “We’re not about top-down structure,” CME Group blockchain leader Sandra Ro said at the New York conference. “The working groups themselves are the real engine.”   Join the Discussion Most Read The Newsletter Exclusive articles delivered to your inbox daily.

(QCOM) Stock Fights Back Against Apple Inc. (AAPL) Markets are recognizing the deep value in Qualcomm By Chris Lau, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  May 22, 2017, 2:10 pm EDT Get AAPL alerts: Submit     Popular Posts: 7 Criminally Underrated Tech Stocks to Buy Now!

(AAPL) Nokia Oyj (ADR) (NOK) Stock Is Smart for Income Investors 7 Criminally Underrated Tech Stocks to Buy Now! View All Posts Ever since Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) lost its arbitration case against BlackBerry Ltd (NASDAQ:BBRY) in April, investors have been looking beyond the bad news. At a 14x forward price-to-earnings ratio, the complaints against QCOM are more than priced in the share price. Source: Karlis Dambrans via Flickr Paying investors a dividend yielding 3.9% (the stock trades at ex-dividend on May 26) helps limit the downside. Fundamentals are improving, with only one more hurdle left. The market is waiting on the EU decision by June 9 on Qualcomm’s buyout of NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI). QCOM Stock’s NXPI Buyout Although the U.S. approved the deal on April 4 (shareholders accepted the deal in January), the E.U. may potentially impose some restrictions. But if the EU is more concerned about Brexit and the French elections, it may just let the deal go through. In the near-term, though, investors may care more about QCOM’s tussle with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Apple stopped paying royalties to Qualcomm but Qualcomm fought back. On May 17, it filed a breach of contract complaint against Apple’s manufacturers. QCOM has an edge with the filing. Though it cannot stop the production of this year’s iPhones, it could make 2018 difficult for Apple. Apple is playing a dangerous game against its former ally. Qualcomm has a solid OFDMA patent portfolio. But Samsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) filed briefs that support the FTC’s complaint that Qualcomm monopolized a key device. Despite the filing against Apple’s manufacturers, QCOM still views Apple as an important customer. On its conference call, QCOM touted its strengths in the latest technology, including LTE and 5G NR. It said: “We are optimistic about the speed of innovation in the modem and RF areas with technologies such as gigabit LTE, 5G NR, multimode and millimeter wave becoming increasingly important. Considering the strength of both our product roadmap in R&D investments, we expect to continue to be an important supplier to Apple now and into the future.” In the Q2 report, Qualcomm excluded in its revenue forecast over $150 million owed in the Dec. quarter in unpaid royalties. Intel Falls Behind Qualcomm Qualcomm has an array of intellectual property in 3G, 4G, and GSM. As 5G cellular technology becomes mainstream, Intel will fall further behind. For years, Intel failed to catch up to Qualcomm’s modem technology. QCOM stock still has better modem performance. It already announced in February it sampled 5G, months ahead of schedule. Late last year, it expected testing would begin in the second half of 2017. Outlook and Forecast Qualcomm expects OEMs will announce the adoption of its 205 mobile platform designs for 4G LTE connectivity. Carriers are launching the very fast Gigabit LTE worldwide. This gives it an edge over other network suppliers. Despite these expectations, shares are still nearly 20% below yearly highs. In 2019, QCOM expects launches for commercial products for 3GPP-based 5G radio connections in 2019. Shipments for 3G and 4G totaled 400 million units in the last quarter. Qualcomm expects shipments will grow to 1.75 billion to 1.85 billion devices this year. Takeaway The company has limited revenue visibility until it and Apple resolve their differences. Since the market priced in the downside in QCOM stock, any judgment that favors Qualcomm will send the stock sharply higher. Value investors should consider this stock now that it trades below 20 times earnings. As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The tweet, posted late Sunday, shows four cover keyboards, including a red one and a blue one. “Working session. 30 hours to go,” said Panay, using hashtags, #MicrosoftEvent #Surface #Shanghai. Read: iPad Pro 2 Launching At WWDC, Expected Features Include Bezel-less display, 10nm processor, Reports Photos of the hybrid tablet-laptop were leaked by Evan Blass earlier this month. Blass said the update from the Surface Pro 4 will be called the Surface Pro, not Surface Pro 5. Panay had  said earlier this month there’s “no such thing as the Surface Pro 5.” Microsoft’s new tablet, which was previously expected to be unveiled Tuesday, won’t see major changes, with most upgrades expected to be internal. The device looks similar to the Surface Pro 4, and comes with the same 3.5mm headphone jack, Mini DisplayPort and a USB Type-A port, another report said. The Surface Pro won’t have any USB-C ports, since Microsoft believes the feature is not yet ready for the mainstream. It was previously rumored Microsoft was looking into adding Intel’s seventh-generation Kaby Lake processors for the new Surface Pro, so users should expect better performance from the device. Read: Apple iPad Pro 2 10.5-Inch Launching At WWDC In June, Leaked Screenshot Hints The Surface Pro is rumored to come with new accessories, including Microsoft’s Surface Arc Mouse, which was unveiled alongside the Surface laptop. The Surface Pro will also come with a new Pen and Type Cover color versions that will resemble the Surface Laptop’s color palette. Microsoft released the Surface Pro 4 in October 2015. Panay previously said the company wants to deliver meaningful and “experiential change that makes a huge difference in the product line,” and not just equip it with the latest processor. The Surface Pro will compete with other tablets on the market, including Apple’s iPad, Amazon’s Fire devices and Samsung’s new Galaxy Tab S3. The Tab S3 features a 9.7-inch display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 chip, 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage with expansion of up to 256GB, a 13-megapixel autofocus camera and a 5-megapixel front camera. Apple is expected to unveil the iPad Pro 2 at the Worldwide Developer Conference next month. The tablet is rumored to come with an edge-to-edge screen display measuring 10.5-inches. The iPad Pro will also come with a new accessory: a revamped Apple Pencil, which is said to be magnetic. The tablet is expected to have an electromagnetic strip, which will serve as a charging point and dock for the Apple Pencil 2. Additionally, the iPad Pro 2 is rumored to come with a 12-megapixel camera for 4K video recording and Live Photos. Meanwhile, Amazon released its latest low-priced tablets last week: the Amazon Fire 7 Tablet, Amazon Fire HD 8, all-new Amazon Fire 7 Kids Tablet and the Fire HD 8 Kids Edition.

 Now is the worst time to buy a new MacBook from Apple Kif Leswing May 22, 2017, 2:02 PM 24,007 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty If you're hoping to buy a new Apple laptop, you should wait two weeks before pulling the trigger. On June 5, Apple will kick off its annual developer conference, and it looks as if it might launch some new products in addition to announcing software updates for iPhones, Macs, and Apple Watches. Apple is planning to release three new laptops next month, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. Apple may update its MacBook Pro, MacBook, and MacBook Air with new Intel chips, according to the report. It most likely won't be a groundbreaking update, but the new models should be faster than the current ones. The MacBook Air, for example, hasn't been updated since 2015. Apple's other laptops have been updated more recently, but none uses the latest Intel chip. While the new laptops Apple is rumored to launch probably won't sport a redesign, the latest chips would help them last longer before they feel sluggish. And when Apple launches laptops with new chips, the older models often are discounted. So if you're in the market for a new Apple laptop, wait two more weeks — there's a chance it could save you some money. There are also rumors that Apple could launch a new iPad or voice-activated speaker next month, although it's unclear whether Apple plans to do so.

In theory, Microsoft appears to generally follow the latter doctrine, although after more than 18 months of waiting, it’s practically set in stone that the aging but still dependable Surface Pro 4 will merely get a minor refresh unveiled in Shanghai tomorrow. The Surface Pro (no numerical add-on this time around) is a perfect replica of its predecessor on the outside, it seems, with Intel Kaby Lake inside, plus a few other internal enhancements and revisions we’re yet to hear about from rock-solid sources. A convertible, extra-versatile tablet is of course only as appealing as its accessories, with new pens and keyboards in the pipeline reportedly similar to the Surface Laptop’s “palette”. Here’s a quick look today at a premium quartet of Surface Pro keyboard attachments, straight from the proverbial horse’s mouth, i.e. Panos Panay, Redmond’s Corporate VP of Devices, on Twitter. What we’re checking out here aren’t regular $130 Type Cover sequels, but rather fresh, diverse takes on the Pro 4’s single $160 Signature Type Cover model. They’re all coated in something called Alcantara fabric, which Microsoft describes as warm, luxurious, comfortable, wonderfully soft and incredibly durable in Surface Laptop marketing materials. It’s basically a fancy cousin of suede, made from polyester and polyurethane for increased durability and stain resistance. Bottom line, it’s nice but far from groundbreaking, and we’ll probably say the same about the rehashed Surface Pro itself in less than 24 hours. Advertisement likethis What's your reaction?

AMD, -3.24% sank 4.9% in active trade Monday, after the company seemed to confirm that it has not, and would not, license its graphics technology to rival chip maker Intel Corp. Volume topped 57 million shares in early afternoon trade, enough to make the stock the second-most actively traded on major U.S. exchanges. When Chief Executive Lisa Su was asked Monday at the J.P. Morgan Technology, Media & Telecom conference about recent speculation over a potential licensing deal with Intel INTC, +1.05% Su responded by saying, "We're not looking at enabling a competitor to compete against our products," according to a transcript of the event provided by FactSet. Speculation about a license deal has been around for months, but became more rampant last week ahead of AMD's analyst meeting. The stock sold off after the meeting when AMD made no mention of a deal, and analysts dispelled the speculation. The stock was still up 8.1% over the past two weeks. But after rocketing nearly 4 fold in 2016, it has tumbled 24% year to date, while the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX, +1.09% has run up 18% and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.52% has gained 6.9%.

HP has unveiled new models in its ENVY line – at Cannes Film Festival no less – and these new notebooks seem to be positioned for competition with Microsoft’s latest notebook. In all, HP has introduced three new notebooks in the ENVY line today: the ENVY 13, ENVY 17, and ENVY x360 15. The ENVY 13 and 17 are certainly cut from the same cloth. With the same hardware options throughout, the main difference comes in their displays. As you may have already guessed, the ENVY 13 offers a 13-inch display, while the ENVY 17 is outfitted with a 17-inch one. These displays can either be FHD (1080p) or 4K depending on your preference. HP has certainly taken pride in their design, stating that these new ENVYs are “red-carpet ready.” Both laptops feature a metal chassis in either natural silver or silk gold colors, while the hinge on the display offers a degree of lift when the laptop is open. This lift hinge allows for better positioning while typing and also helps to keep things running cool. You may need that extra cooling as well, since the ENVY 13 and 17 can respectively house up to a Core i5 and Core i7 processor. On the ENVY 17, you also have the option of going for discrete NVIDIA GTX 940MX graphics, giving you a boost in graphics power over Intel integrated graphics. Make no mistake, the ENVY 13 and 17 are definitely designed to be Surface Laptop competitors, especially the ENVY 13. At just 13.95mm thick and 2.7 pounds, the design of the ENVY 13 certainly challenges that of the Surface Laptop, but there are a few advantage here. Those advantages include more customization options – including options for a lot more storage than the Surface Laptop offers – and the fact that this notebook ships with Windows 10 proper, not Windows 10 S. For those who would rather have a convertible laptop instead of a traditional clamshell, there’s the ENVY x360 15. Again, we need only look to the name to get all the info we need about the display, which clocks in at 15.6-inches and can rotate into a variety of different usages modes. Like any convertible laptop, this is probably the better choice for anyone who can see themselves using it in a tablet configuration. There may be more reason than usual to use this as a tablet, as the ENVY x360 15 ships with one of HP’s N-tig pens and support for Windows Ink. There are two different configurations for the new x360, and what kind you get ultimately depends on your color choice. Ash silver models will ship with AMD FX processors, while natural silver models use Intel’s Core lineup. While these laptops haven’t launched yet, they’re right around the corner. HP says that all three are launching in June, with varying price points for each. The ENVY 13 starts at $1,049.99, while the ENVY 17 comes in just a bit lower with a starting price of $999.99. The ENVY x360 15 is the least expensive of the bunch, as prices start at $899.99. All three will be available through HP’s website beginning next month.

Updated May 22, 2017 10:08AM SHARE ALSO SEE Hewlett-Packard Laptop Spectre Envy Enterprise IT Technology News Tech giant HP took advantage of its participation in the Cannes Film Festival to release several new premium laptops aimed at creative professionals. HP is at Cannes to celebrate its more than seven decades of "empowering filmmakers and creative visionaries." The laptops announced at the film festival include new entries in the Spectre and Envy lines, as well as new features such as support for Windows Ink, metal chassis, and detachable keyboards. An Artist's Dream The newest member of the Spectre line, dubbed the HP Spectre x2 (pictured above), seems to be aimed at animators and graphic designers. The laptop comes with a Windows Ink-certified stylus that supports a wide range of artistic effects such as varying line weight, shading, and coloring. It also comes with a stainless steel kickstand, allowing artists to either draw on a flat surface or with up to a 165-degree tilt. Photographers and graphic designers, meanwhile, will likely be pleased with the large 12.3-inch 3K2K display, featuring 6 million pixels, HD rendering, and a variety of ambient light options to help improve screen visibility regardless of the environment. The Spectre x2 also has plenty of features that will appeal to just about any user, including a more durable aluminum chassis, a full-size detachable keyboard, and a glass trackpad. It also comes with two high-resolution cameras: a 13MP rear camera and a 5MP front camera. In addition, the device has an IR camera to support Windows Hello biometric authentication, boasts up to eight hours of battery life on a full charge, and claims to be able to recharge up to 50 percent of its battery life in as little as 30 minutes. Portability and Power The Envy 13, on the other hand, is being more explicitly marketed as an ultra-portable machine. It weighs only 2.72 pounds, while still offering up to 14 hours of battery life and the power of a 7th generation i5 Intel processor and 8 GB of RAM. It also brings a UHD display with 8 million pixels to the party, along with quad Bang & Olufsen speakers, certain to please anyone hoping to catch up on their favorite Netflix shows while on the go. The Envy 17, meanwhile, is aiming to replace the desktop with 16 GB of RAM included, a Nvidia GeForce 940MX graphics card, i7 Intel chip, a 1 TB hard drive and DVD-write optical drive. It also offers an edge-to-edge Full HD touchscreen that supports any Microsoft Universal Pen stylus, and has its own IR camera for password-free login. At 6.73 pounds, though, this is probably not going to be the machine people will want to be lugging around, but it does provide all the power and capability avid gamers or professionals could want from their desktops. The Envy x360 rounds out the new arrivals, with a 15.6-inch convertible display. Like the other premium devices in the collection, the Envy comes in a unibody aluminum chassis and offers Windows Ink support for note taking and document markups. The Envy x360 also comes with a choice of Intel i5, i7, or AMD processors, along with up to 16 GB of RAM. While the Envy 17 is currently on sale, the other models are slated to to be released next month. Image credit: Product shot by HP.

After all, you can’t always find your favourites on the usual streaming services, while buying the same stuff again on another new HD format isn’t always the best use of your money. Sadly, ripping DVDs on your Windows PC isn’t quite as easy as, say, ripping MP3s. Windows 10 doesn’t even have a built-in tool to play DVDs, let alone rip them, and while there are free products available, they often struggle to do a great job. Some are slow, awkward to use or flaky, while others can’t cope with the full range of copy-protection systems used on commercial DVDs. Nobody wants to spend hours slowly ripping TV shows and movies at a snail’s pace, only to have the whole thing tripped up by copy protection or a software bug. Luckily, there is a better way. WinX DVD Ripper Platinum  is a different kind of DVD tool; fast, flexible and easy to use, making short work of a pile of DVDs. The latest version – version 8.5 – goes even further, with new technology to support the latest processors and GPUs, plus mechanisms designed to cope with the most challenging – and annoying – 99-title DVDs. The Strongest DVD Ripper for 99-title DVDs DVDs with large numbers of titles have become a bugbear when ripping DVDs. Some, like fitness DVDs, just have complex structures so that viewers can choose their own workouts. Others have been designed with excess titles simply to make life hard for people copying DVDs. Either way, they’re a real headache for users trying to legitimately convert or back-up their DVDs. If so, WinX DVD Rippler Platinum has the remedy, analysing the disk and intelligently picking out the most important titles for conversion. Here’s a guide that introduces how WinX DVD Ripper handles the 99-title DVDs. In the vast majority of cases there’s no need to go through, manually selecting titles and soundtracks. Insert the disc, click the DVD button, select an output profile for the device you want to play back from and you’re good to go. You can go from selecting the disk to starting ripping in under a minute. Even obscure discs with ISO 9600 and non-UDF formats are covered, making this an incredibly flexible and powerful ripping tool. Higher Speed in DVD Ripping The actual conversion process is faster than ever before as well, thanks to revolutionary hardware acceleration technology that makes full use of Intel Quick Sync Video (QSV) and NVidia NVENC. QSV uses dedicated processing power on Intel CPUs to speed up video encoding and decoding functions, and the version built into the latest Skylake and Kaby Lake Processors allows PCs with a 32x DVD drive to rip full movies in five minutes or less. NVENC does much the same using the sheer parallel processing grunt of the latest GeForce GPUs. That TV box-set that used to take several hours to rip can now be tackled in under sixty minutes. All of this comes without any compromise to image or sound quality. Thanks to the High Quality Engine and Yadif Double Frames De-interlacing Engine, WinX DVD Ripper Platinum delivers video that looks great on your smartphone or when upscaled on a 1080p or 4K TV screen. Free download WinX DVD Ripper Platinum and see how fast it can be in digitising you DVD collections. Power Features High speeds and a simple workflow might be the program’s biggest strengths, but there are plenty of more advanced options available for those who want more control. You can select which titles to convert or copy, pick stereo or surround audio streams in DTS or AC3 and add subtitles in any available language – or even add externally developed .SRT format subtitles if needed. What’s more, intuitive editing features make it easy to crop the image for a specific display or trim away unwanted footage, or potentially rip just one scene. You can also merge several titles together, turning several videos into just one file. Plus, where other DVD rippers are ceasing development, Digiarty, the makers of WinX DVD Ripper Platinum, continue to invest in new features and continuing support. That’s resulted in a program that has coped with new copy-protection measures and that includes output profiles for the latest smartphones and tablets. While the heyday of DVD might have come and gone, WinX DVD Ripper Platinum doesn’t feel stuck in the past. Get a Licensed Copy with Special Discount In short, if you want the best, fastest and easiest way to digitise your DVD collection, WinX DVD Ripper Platinum is the tool of choice.

clock menu more-arrow Circuit Breaker Acer Predator 21 X review: overpowered overkill The best gaming laptop $9,000 can buy by Chaim Gartenberg@cgartenberg May 22, 2017, 11:15am EDT Photography by Amelia Holowaty Krales share tweet Linkedin The first thing you notice about the Acer Predator 21 X is the size. The sheer bulk of the 21 X will shock you almost every time Whether you’re seeing it for the first time as you take it out of the custom Pelican case it ships in, passing someone struggling to carry it on their way to a meeting, or sitting down to see it at a desk day after day, the sheer bulk of the 21-inch, almost 19 pound laptop will shock you almost every time. It’s a laptop that looks like it has grown strong dining on the blood of other, smaller laptops. The screen by itself is thicker than a MacBook Pro. Originally announced at IFA 2016, the 21 X was never meant to be a practical or affordable option. It’s the ultimate "what if?" device, a glimpse at what hardware makers can accomplish when things like common sense and logic are thrown out the window. Weighing in at an impressive 18.76 pounds, the Predator 21 X physically dwarfs pretty much any other laptop ever made. And with an $8,999.99 price tag, weight isn't the only place the 21 X beats out any competitor. Put simply: this is the biggest, most powerful, and most expensive gaming laptop ever made. And yes, it is technically still a laptop, with a built-in screen, keyboard, mouse, and batteries that, at least in theory, allow it to function away from a desk. This is the biggest, most powerful, and most expensive gaming laptop ever made Acer has made the most of the enormous size of the 21 X, cramming what feels like every inch of it with some serious firepower — like the external design, the 21 X's spec sheet feels built for sheer overkill. A Core i7 Skylake Intel processor that’s overclocked up to 4.1 GHz. Two SLI linked GTX 1080 GPUs, with a total of 16GB of dedicated onboard VRAM. USB-C, USB 3.0, an HDMI port, two DisplayPorts, and an SD card slot. 64GB of DDR4 system RAM. Five fans. Five storage slots: three SATA, two PCIe (Acer ships a single configuration, with one 1TB hard drive and two 500GB SSDs in a RAID configuration.) A Tobii eye tracking rig, for further immersion. And of course, the show-stopping curved 21-inch screen, which Acer highlights as the first in a laptop (the screen also features a 120Hz refresh rate and NVIDIA’s G-Sync technology). Side by side with any other laptop (gaming or otherwise), it almost feels like the punchline to a joke: "You call that a laptop? No, THIS is a laptop." While the scale and specs the 21 X may be impressive (as is the engineering to actually build it), Acer hasn't taken any dramatic departures when it comes to the aesthetic design. Between the slew of glowing LED lights, the sharp edges on the plastic case, the giant plastic exhaust vents, and the enormous metallic blue dragon that graces the vast expanse of space above the keyboard, this is a gaming laptop through and through. (As a side note, the blue dragon is one of 20 options for the panel, which is removable to access internal hardware.) Battery life is a disappointment with the 21 X, even compared to the lowered expectations for gaming laptops. The Predator lasted just an hour and 51 minutes on the Verge Battery Test, which cycles a series of web pages through Google Chrome. Unplugging it for gaming resulted in even poorer results that brought the time to under an hour (exactly how much depends on how hard you’re pushing it) along with a hit to performance to boot. Hypothetically, you can use the Predator unplugged for a few minutes, but it was clearly designed to remain attached to the nearest wall. And the power bricks — yes, there are two of them, each individually massive —are made even more comical when placed together in the custom rubber enclosure that comes with the laptop. Given that the Predator 21 X is so obviously, single-mindedly focused toward gaming, I figured the only natural thing to do with it was to try and use it as a regular computer for my day to day life. Look, I was curious to see how it would work. The 21 X is simply not very good at regular computer tasks In short: The 21 X is simply not very good at regular computer tasks. Breaking that down a bit more, there is of course of the size, which I’ve already said plenty about. But wrestling through a door while desperately trying not to drop the $9,000 computer I was holding really highlighted for me how absurd it was to even try to use this thing in an office setting. Additionally, the 21 X features a full mechanical keyboard, complete with standard desktop Cherry MX Brown switches. It is loud, very loud, to the point where the entire pod of coworkers near me had either commented, complained, or possibly plotted my death in a secret Slack room. (I personally find the MX Brown to be a good middle ground for both typing and gaming use, but I can see why the noise would get on people’s nerves. Sorry, Dan / Ashley / Kaitlyn / Lizzie / Michael / Kwame!) But the keyboard itself is incredibly awkward to use for non-gaming purposes: it’s positioned right up at the front edge of the laptop, instead of farther back. That means that there’s no natural place to rest your palms except for the optional, magnetic palm rest, which becomes yet another thing to carry around. But even with the rest, given the high height that the keyboard actually sits at due to the thickness of the 21 X, I found it to be uncomfortable to use for extended periods of time, which drove me back to my MacBook Pro when I needed to get actual work done. All three of these issues vanish when it comes to actually gaming The same can be said about the screen. On paper, the massive 21-inch curved panel seems like it would be great for productivity. But the resolution is relatively low at 2800 x 1080 pixels — sure, it’s wide, but it comes out to the same vertical resolution of a regular 1080p panel. That said, it was nice to be able to stack tons of windows side-by-side, even if I had to manually adjust text size smaller to fit a reasonable amount of information. There’s also the trackpad, which has the neat parlor trick of magnetically detaching and flipping over to turn into a number pad. As Windows computers go, the trackpad is actually really good. Acer has included Windows Precision drivers, so it’s accurate, and the array of swipes and gestures all work well. But the trackpad itself is just too small for navigating so wide a screen even with mouse sensitivity turned up, and I generally preferred to use an external mouse even for regular work. To be clear, all three of these issues — the keyboard, the screen, and the trackpad — all vanish when it comes to actually gaming. The keyboard, while poorly positioned for typing, is much more comfortable when it comes to mashing the WASD keys while running around in Overwatch. The screen, which resulted in comically sized windows for most websites, gives a wide, almost cinematic experience in Battlefield 1. And the trackpad — well, if you're using the trackpad on the 21 X for gaming, then you're already missing the point of it. As for performance? You might be able to trip up the 21 X if you do advanced CAD work or heavy video editing, but there's certainly nothing in my workflow that could manage it. Ultimately, using the Predator 21 X for regular work feels a lot like driving a Lamborghini to a supermarket — sure, it'll get you there, but that's not really the point of owning one. When it comes to the actual act of playing games on the Predator 21 X — its sole raison d'être, — there’s actually surprising little to say. This is a $9,000 computer built solely towards that purpose and function. Of course it runs games well. With the kind of hardware on tap here, it would have been surprising if things didn’t run well. Of course the 21 X runs games well Still, it was my duty to put the Predator through its paces, and the results were pretty much as expected. But beyond the binary of whether or not games worked well, it’s the experience of gaming on the Predator 21 X that make it stand out. Put practicality aside for a moment, and you’ve got perhaps the single most powerful laptop ever made at your disposal. The curved screen dominates your field of view, and really does lend itself to a more immersive experience (assuming the game you’re playing supports a 21:9 aspect ratio — not all do.) And this thing is just ludicrously, almost needlessly fast. Overwatch — one of my favorite games for comparative testing across gaming PCs, since it works on almost anything — barely dipped below 200 frames per second. Battlefield 1, one of the most graphically intensive games on PC these days, ran smoothly even at Ultra settings. And Rise of the Tomb Raider’s sprawling vistas look incredible, even at maximum resolution. Plus, the 21 X actually runs quietly, all things considered — unless you intentionally set the fans to maximum, in which case the five fans spin up to what is amount to gale force winds. The 21 X is barely easier to carry around than a desktop But while impressive, it’s still the kind of high gaming performance that illustrates exactly why the 21 X is impractical. Does the Predator 21 X run games well? Undoubtedly. But it doesn’t run them $6,000 better than a less powerful desktop, or even a comparable one. Between the sheer bulk of the laptop and chargers, the almost non-existent battery life, and the oversized carrying case you’ll need to move it around anywhere farther than down the hall, the 21 X is barely easier to carry around than a desktop. (In fact, there’s tons of desktop computers that are more portable.) Even if you want to just park the Predator 21 X at a desk and pretend its a desktop computer, you’ll probably want to use a larger external monitor and a separate keyboard, which could be difficult to fit on a single surface. And given that it’s perfectly possible to build a similarly specced desktop PC for roughly half what the Predator 21 X costs, you’re paying a massive premium for what amounts to a laughable idea of mobility. But that’s sort of the point to the Predator. It’s not practical because it’s not meant to be practical. It’s a trophy for anyone who buys it, a status symbol of having the biggest and best thing out there. Of course it doesn’t fit on a desk or in a bag — because the Predator is meant to stand out, to make people take note. I’m still glad the Predator 21 X exists Despite all the shortcomings in price and practicality, I’m still glad the Predator 21 X exists. While it’s probably as unobtainable as a multi-million dollar supercar at an auto show for the vast majority of consumers, much like a Bugatti or a Ferrari, the technology and engineering that went into making the 21 X can trickle down to the more affordable models in Acer’s Predator line. It’s something that we’re already seeing direct results of with laptops like the upcoming Predator Triton 700, which clearly draws from its larger cousin when it comes to design. And at the end of the day, it’s just cool that someone has managed to stuff this incredible amount of hardware into a single device for to achieve this singular purpose at the highest level possible. So, yes, the Predator 21 X is overkill. But sometimes, overkill is underrated.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Who Will Buy Imagination Technologies plc's MIPS Tech? A few candidates that came up in the past could be buyers of this once-again-for-sale technology asset. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) May 22, 2017 at 11:15AM In 2012, graphics specialist Imagination Technologies (NASDAQOTH:IGNMF) acquired processor intellectual property maker MIPS Technologies for $100 million in a bid to diversify its product portfolio beyond graphics technology. MIPS processors are used in a variety of applications, but in recent years, chip vendors that had previously used MIPS technology (for example, network chip vendors) have begun transitioning their product lines over to processor designs and/or intellectual property developed by ARM Holdings. Image source: Intel. Imagination had hoped to push the MIPS architecture as a viable alternative to the ARM architecture in the multibillion-unit smartphone applications processor market, but ultimately found little success in doing so. Imagination eventually scaled back its ambitions vis-a-vis MIPS. After Imagination disclosed last month that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), a customer that accounts for roughly half of its revenues, would no longer use its PowerVR graphics technology, Imagination announced that it plans to sell its MIPS and Ensigma businesses to "concentrate its resources on PowerVR, and strengthen Imagination's balance sheet." Now that MIPS is for sale, the question is, who's going to buy it? Some possible candidates Investors may recall that Imagination wasn't the only company interested in buying the MIPS assets in 2012. Fellow semiconductor intellectual property vendor, CEVA (NASDAQ:CEVA), originally agreed to snap up the MIPS assets for $90 million, but Imagination outbid CEVA, offering $100 million. Given CEVA's prior interest in the MIPS assets, and given that CEVA's business seems to be going quite well these days, CEVA might be well positioned to take advantage of Imagination's current predicament and score a good deal on the MIPS assets. Another potential buyer could be electronic design automation (EDA) tool and fellow semiconductor intellectual property vendor, Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS). Synopsys was mentioned as a potential acquirer of the MIPS assets way back in 2012 by analyst Gary Mobley. Synopsys currently offers a type of RISC processor family known as ARC ("Argonaut RISC Core"), which the company says target applications such as automotive and industrial, Internet of Things, mobile, storage, and digital home. The MIPS assets could allow Synopsys to further expand its processor intellectual property portfolio and possibly even supplant the ARC-based technology. Unlikely buyers I have seen other potential buyers mentioned that I don't think are all that likely. I went over why I don't think Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) -- a name that has come up -- would buy the MIPS assets and switch to MIPS from ARM here. Another chipmaker comes up as a potential buyer of the MIPS assets: Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). However, that doesn't make sense for several reasons. In Intel's personal computer and server processor markets (the bulk of Intel's revenue), as well as in its Internet of Things business, the company's X86 architecture has been and will likely continue to be highly successful. Intel has also made it clear that it would like to be a contract manufacturer of ARM-based applications processors and quite vocally signaled that it would be working with ARM Holdings to allow chipmakers to easily implement ARM's processor technology in Intel's chip manufacturing technology. Considering that MIPS processors haven't been successful in the mobile applications processor market (the market that Intel wants ARM's help to compete in), I don't see MIPS bringing much value to Intel's technology portfolio.   Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Plus: Get the Mass Effect trilogy for just $5! Laptops by Rick Broida May 22, 2017 5:32 AM PDT @cheapskateblog CNET's Cheapskate scours the web for great deals on PCs, phones, gadgets and much more. Questions about the Cheapskate blog? Find the answers on our FAQ page. And find more great buys on the CNET Deals page. Lenovo Good heavens, we are all spoiled rotten. Information at our fingertips, computing powerhouses in our pockets, laptops for $129. Think about this last for a second. A mere 25 years ago, an IBM ThinkPad would have cost you $2,375 (or around $4,000 in inflation-adjusted dollars). And it would have been a heavy, bulky slowpoke with a small, grayscale screen. Just 20 years ago, a color laptop -- the Gateway Solo, for example -- cost over $6,000 (inflation-adjusted). Ten years ago, a Dell XPS cost around $3,300. Not that you couldn't buy a laptop for less, but it's easy to forget how expensive they used to be. Today, this: Walmart has the Lenovo N22 11.6-inch Chromebook for $129 shipped (plus tax). Come on! This is the machine you buy for a kid who needs a laptop, the one who's heading off to middle school in the fall or needs something a little better than the aging hand-me-down you bought four years ago. It's no powerhouse, but it's powerful enough, with an Intel Celeron processor, 4GB of RAM (one would expect 2GB at this price point) and 16GB of expandable storage. Whoa, that's not much, right? Keep in mind this is a Chromebook, so it's designed to store schoolwork and other documents in Google's cloud. That said, you can easily (and inexpensively) devote one of the N22's two USB 3.0 ports to a full-time flash drive -- like this SanDisk 32GB Ultra Fit drive for $14.39. (Don't get me started on how cheap that is.) Lenovo packs in a few other amenities as well, including a webcam that can rotate up and down, a water-resistant keyboard and a battery that's good for up to 10 hours of runtime. The N22 also offers Bluetooth 4.0 and all the Wi-Fis: 802.11a/b/g/n/ac. It weighs 2.8 pounds. The Mass Effect trilogy is on sale for just $5! BioWare Not too shabby for $129, am I right? The one caveat I have is printing: Your student will almost certainly need to do some, so you'll need to make sure you have a Google Cloud Print-compatible printer. (See "How to print from a Chromebook" to learn more.) Your thoughts? Bonus deal: Game time! If you never played the Mass Effect series, you missed on some truly epic action-RPG sci-fi goodness. You also saved yourself a boatload of money, because for a limited time, Cdkeys has the Mass Effect Trilogy (PC) for $5.19. Over at Steam, just the first two games alone would run you $40. (Mass Effect 3 isn't even available there.) This deal nets you redemption keys for Origin, though, not Steam -- meaning you'll need an Origin account and the client software. The three games debuted in 2007, 2010 and 2012, and all earned top marks from GameSpot (among other sites). Check out this review of Mass Effect 3, just to get the flavor. I don't know how much longer the trilogy will be available at this price (I first spotted it yesterday), but I do know it's a killer deal on three phenomenal PC games. Don't miss it!

Asus ROG Strix X370-F and B350-F mobos take wing by Eric Born  10:02 AM on May 22, 2017 AMD launched its high-end Ryzen processors first and saved the lineup's mid-range offerings for later. Now that Ryzen 5 processors have been out on the market and Ryzen 3 processors are getting closer, it appears that Asus thought it was a good time to announce a pair of upper-midrange AM4 motherboards. These new offerings are the ROG Strix X370-F Gaming and ROG Strix B350-F Gaming. The ROG motherboards from Asus are known for their premium components, RGB LED bling, and gamer-friendly features. The ROG Strix X370-F Gaming checks all of these boxes. It's a big ATX board with dual, steel-reinforced PCI-e slots, one M.2 slot, and support for DDR4 RAM at 3200 MT/s. There's an onboard Intel I211-AT Gigabit Ethernet controller and a Realtek S1220A audio codec. The board includes one DisplayPort and one HDMI connector, even though AMD doesn't have a socket AM4 APU out on the market yet. The high-end X370 chipset offers a lot of connectivity, so accordingly there's a total of 10 USB ports in various flavors on the back panel, including USB 3.1 ports in Type-A and Type-C flavors. The board includes more than a few features for those inclined to overclock. A base clock generator headlines the list, and it could allow intrepid tweakers to push their CPUs' BCLK frequencies above 100 MHz for extreme memory overclocking. Asus claims users can push this frequency up to or beyond 158MHz on the X370-F. A ROG board just wouldn't look right without a few visual touches. The ROG Strix X370-F Gaming incorporates RGB LEDs (notably on the large I/O cover) and extra connectors with Aura Sync support. In many ways, the ROG Strix B350-F Gaming motherboard is the little cousin of the ROG Strix X370-F. The most important difference is the chipset, as the board employs AMD's mid-range B350 offering. Accordingly, the board has a couple fewer USB ports on the back and fewer PCIe lanes. The two USB 3.1 ports are of Type-A. Additionally, the B350-F doesn't use the standalone base clock generator. However, the board still includes the Intel I211-AT Ethernet controller, S1220A audio codec, and steel-reinforced PCI-e slots. While details on both boards are up on Asus' website, they haven't yet made it to online retailers. Asus hasn't yet revealed pricing or availability.

(MU) Stock for Free Income There is no letup in Micron, and best of all, it's not too late to go long MU stock By Nicolas Chahine, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  May 22, 2017, 10:01 am EDT     Popular Posts: Trade Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) Stock Through the Fear Fog Trade Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock While Others Fear it Trade Twilio Inc (TWLO) Stock for a Second Chance at the IPO Recent Posts: Ulta Beauty Inc (ULTA) Stock Offers Ultra Easy Profits Go Long Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) Stock for Free Income Catch Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY) Stock With Confidence View All Posts Even thought I’ve have good results trading Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) from the short and long sides, my preference is to be bullish equities. So today, my goal is to set another bullish bet on MU stock that’s designed to be boring and profitable. Source: Mike Deal via Flickr Boring trades are ones that need little attention. I do extensive homework so I can set the risk at levels that have a high chance of success. But Micron has already rallied by more than 170% in a year, and chasing a stock that has already gone so far, so fast, does not give me a high certainty of success. This means if we want to play MU stock, we need to do so via the options market. Now, Micron fans probably won’t like my next few words, but worry not — they are indeed a precursor to a bullish trade. Fundamentally, I find it misleading that some trading platforms rate Micron stock as cheap compared to the industry average. If I can buy Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) at a price-to-earnings ratio that’s less by a third, and get a healthy dividend to boot, MU shares are not cheap. Sure, there are other things to consider than pure financial metrics; all I’m saying is Micron stock, while a buy, isn’t a screaming buy. Click to Enlarge Technically, Micron recently has printed two attempts at $30, which was a measured move that I had set for shares in late January. So unless the bulls succeed soon, the experts will be talking about double-tops. Conversely, if the bulls can push through to $30 per share, the momentum could carry MU stock through to a new 15-year high. So instead of risking $28 per share to buy Micron here and without any room for error, I will sell downside risk in put options below proven support levels and let time do the work. How to Trade MU Stock The bet: Collect $1 to sell the Jan 2018 $21 put naked with a 75% certainty of success. The risk? If Micron falls below $20, I will start to accrue losses. Selling naked options is risky and not suited for all traders. If I am not willing nor able to own MU shares, then I should use credit put spreads instead. The alternate: Sell the 2018 $21/20 credit put spread, where I have the same odds of winning but which much less risk. The cost for the compromise is reasonable since the spread would still yield 20% on risk. Compare that with risking $28 with no buffer and needing MU stock to rally 20% to match the performance of the spread. That’s a much better deal in my book.

I’ve even tried various caching and syncing solutions to get the best of both. Until recently, though, affordable NAS solutions have been limited by either underwhelming CPUs, not enough RAM, or the physical limitations of 1-Gigabit Ethernet. Now, there are several units on the market that have broken through all of those limitations, particularly by providing 10-Gigabit Ethernet in a form factor suitable for small office and home (SOHO) use. I’ve been reviewing one from Synology. The Synology DS1517+ is an extension to Synology’s line of compact 5-bay NAS units that adds support for a 2-port 10 Gigabit PCIe card. The DS1517+ sports a speedy 2.4GHz, quad-core, CPU that provides more horsepower than entry-level units. You can get it with either 2GB or 8GB of DDR3 RAM, although you can upgrade it yourself to 16GB if needed. The 2GB version has a street price of around $750 (Buy on Amazon). The DS-1517+ is fairly future-proof. In addition to support for 10-Gigabit networking, you can add up to two DX517 expansion units, letting you house as many as 15 drives. If you need more bays, the DS1817+ provides three extra for about $150 more. The DS1517+ pushes past the limits of 1-Gigabit LANs I have a shelf full of various NAS units here in our office and studio, and most of them either couldn’t saturate our 1-Gigabit Ethernet, or were just barely able to. The DS1517+ kept its dedicated 1-Gigabit network connection pretty much saturated in all the benchmarks we ran, with only a 10-15 percent total load on the CPU. So the situation was definitely ripe for testing out its 10-Gigabit Ethernet module. Making the jump to 10 Gbps showed itself immediately in read performance, with sustained read performance over 400MBps for 256K blocks accessed both sequentially and randomly, even from a single client. Single-client write performance was also improved, although not as dramatically, to over 130MBps from 95MBps on a 1-Gigabit connection. This is with the provided 2-drive test configuration. Later I bumped that up further by adding more drives. The value of using 10-Gigabit for connectivity is pretty clear, even with a single client. However, the gains improve rapidly as you add multiple connections. With 1-Gigabit Ethernet, you can use Link Aggregation to improve total throughput beyond 1Gbps, but it is tricky to configure, can be expensive, and of course each individual client is still limited to 1Gbps. Fortunately, the price of 10-Gigabit adapters has come down, although 10-Gigabit switches are still quite expensive. At least you can at least get accelerated access for one or maybe two of your key workstations without breaking the bank. Adding 10 Gigabit to your NAS NAS vendors such as Synology and QNAP allow upgrades to 10-Gigabit through a PCIe adapter card. However, you need to make sure they offer a driver for the card you choose — or purchase one directly from them. Typically there is only 1 PCIe expansion slot, so you may need to decide whether to use it for an SSD cache or a network upgrade — unless the vendor has a card that provides both. For the DS1517+ Synology offers a choice of 10-Gigabit modules with one or two ports (E10G15-F1 and -F2) or an M.2 SSD x 2 module (M2D17). However, you can also choose from several supported third-party adapters. If you’re okay with a more constrained configuration, QNAP offers an inexpensive entry-level NAS with a built-in single 10 Gigabit port, the new TS-431X. Unfortunately, it is only offered with SFP+, which probably means a new and expensive cabling system. Which 10-Gigabit solution is right for you? There are multiple cabling solutions for 10-Gigabit Ethernet. Two of them are possibilities for use with the DS1517+ (and the situation is similar for others on the market). SFP+ is a robust cabling system that provides solid connectivity. However, cables over a few meters long get expensive, and the cables are completely different from, and not compatible with, your existing RJ-45-based Ethernet. Synology’s own 10-Gigabit modules uses SFP+. The DS-1517 supports a number of third party 10 Gigabit cards, one of which, the Intel X540-T2, uses standard RJ-45 cabling, provides a pair of ports, and sells for $200. That makes it my pick for the most cost-effective way to build a 10 Gigabit NAS using the DS1517+. You’ll want to use Cat 6A or Cat 7 rated cables, though, to ensure you can actually transmit 10Gbps over them. Interestingly, many users report remarkably good results even with lesser patch cables, so if you have existing wiring that will be difficult to replace, you might want to test over it before automatically replacing it. Whichever cabling system you choose, you’ll find that there is a total lack of affordable 10-Gigabit switches. Until those show up on the market, you’ll probably want to directly connect your main client machine to your NAS over the 10-Gigabit connection, while also leaving the NAS connected to the rest of your network over 1-Gigabit links. Here you can see the advantage of a dual-port 10-Gigabit adapter. It lets you accelerate access from two of your machines (or with one client and another NAS unit). Configuring your 10-Gigabit mini network If you take the plunge and get a router or switch that can handle your 10-Gigabit connectivity directly, you can set it up the same way you would for any other network. However, if you go the less-expensive route of direct connecting one or two client machines to the 10-Gigabit ports on your NAS, you may need to do a little more work. In my case, while drivers for my card installed automatically, I did have to do some network configuration. Specifically, since I had left the 1-Gigabit LAN connections live on the NAS — so that other machines could also access it — I needed to tell my Windows 10 client to always use the 10-Gigabit connection to get to the NAS. I did that by assigning IP addresses for the high-speed LAN ports on the Windows machine and the NAS on a different, but still private, network. Then I added the high-speed IP address of the NAS to the hosts file on my Windows machine (which is now not-so-conveniently located in \windows\system32\drivers\etc). Prior to making those changes, my client machine sometimes accessed the NAS on the 10-Gigabit network, but sometimes wound up on the 1-Gigabit connection. You can probably also play with route metrics, but this way seemed easy enough. Performance: the payoff The big question is whether all this upgraded technology pays off in real-world performance. Synology shows the DS1517+ (and its 8-bay sibling DS1817+) as capable of nearly 10GBps for reads and about half that for writes. However, that’s using all fast SSDs, multiple aggregated 10-Gigabit ports, a high-end switch, and multiple client PCs. Definitely not what a typical SOHO environment looks like. So I ran a series of benchmarks using both DiskMark and the same IOMeter utility that most NAS vendors use, but in more typical SOHO configurations, to get a sense of whether there are gains to be had in more normal use cases. In short, for file-intensive applications requiring large amounts of shared storage, the answer is yes. With the pair of provided Seagate Ironwolf Pro hard drives configured in a mirrored array, I was able to achieve sustained read performance of over 400MBps, and write performance of around 140MBps, both of which exceed anything possible on a standard 1-Gigabit LAN — and faster than performance access similar drives locally. However, the problem with two mirrored drives is that you don’t get much improvement on writes, as all data has to be written to both drives. So I added two more Ironwolf Pro drives — creating a 4-drive array with 1-drive redundancy — and write performance jumped up to nearly 300MBps. Read performance also improved to about 440MBps, which is helpful, but not as dramatic. As I mentioned above, you’ll see vendor-provided and Enterprise benchmarks that show faster performance, and often those are done with arrays of SSDs. However, those really aren’t useful in a SOHO environment, as they are relatively small and expensive. Both Synology and QNAP do support using SSDs either as dedicated volumes or as caches for hard-drive based volumes. How RAID arrays can be so fast For those new to NAS units, or to RAID arrays in general, it may seem hard to believe that access to data across a network can be faster than reading it from a local drive. One reason is because of the way processing and caching can be shared between your local machine and the server. But the bigger gain comes from the nature of RAID itself. Since data is split across multiple drives, reads in particular benefit from having two or more drives working on getting your data at once. Even the simplest RAID configuration — RAID 1, where two drives are mirrors of each other — essentially doubles read performance by using both drives. Larger arrays can further improve that performance by involving even more drives. Testing the option of SSD caching The DS1517+ provides the option of installing a PCIe card with M.2 SSDs for caching. However, since you can’t have both it and the 10-Gigabit card installed, I opted not to try to test the M.2 feature. I did test using some of the standard bays to house SSDs for a cache, using the Seagate XF1230 240GB drives Synology provided for review. Surprisingly, with the relatively-simple benchmarks I ran using IOMeter and DiskMark, the SSD cache just got in the way. I suspect that is because the 8GB of system RAM provided sufficient cache for my testing. Over the course of a full day’s work, I’m sure the SSDs would provide benefits for even a small office, but clearly they’re more important for larger-scale deployments. If you have a spare SSD or two (you need two to enable write caching) and open bays, it’s probably worth at least experimenting with them. Synology provides an SSD Cache Advisor that will tell you how your workload matches up with your cache configuration. All hard drives are not alike SOHO applications don’t put the same strain on hard drives that Enterprise applications do, unless you are doing 24/7 video recording, or are allowing around-the-clock access to your NAS from the internet. So you might be tempted to cheap out and stick some standard desktop hard drives in your NAS. I did for years and never had any trouble, but I also found I needed to banish my NAS units to a closet, and could still hear them chatter through the door. I was pleasantly surprised that I could barely hear our test DS-1517+ NAS’s Seagate Ironwolf Pro hard drives, even with the unit sitting on the desk right next to me while I benchmarked it. Plus you get all the performance and reliability tech that Seagate puts into them. That has convinced me to make them my new NAS hard drive of choice. They’re probably overkill for SOHO use though, so the non-Pro version will also do the job for about 25 percent less. If you’re on a tighter budget, Seagate’s Barracuda drive family will save you more, but aren’t designed for 24/7 use. I’ve also had good luck with Western Digital’s Red NAS drives, although since we’re thinking performance here, you probably want the 7200rpm Pro version. Summary: Is it worth taking the plunge? If you need to combine high-performance file access with network sharing, 10 Gigabit is definitely the way to go, at least the next time you’re in the market for a new storage server. Small offices that work on creating or managing content, including photographers, videographers, and creative agencies, fit this profile perfectly.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Reviews Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: HP refreshes its Surface Pro clone ahead of new Surface Pro launch 0 by Sean Chan May 22, 2017 at 13:29 GMT18 hours ago Microsoft is set to introduce a new Surface device tomorrow: the Surface Pro. Ahead of the launch of the new Surface Pro, Hewlett-Packard is refreshing its Surface Pro competitor: the HP Spectre x2. The new updates to the Spectre x3 are mostly focused towards performance, but a lot of the other components are still the same as last year’s model. The main difference on the new Spectre x2 is the processor. With the new Spectre x3, HP is now packing Intel’s 7th gen Core i processors — which is a pretty major upgrade from last year’s Core M processors. The company has also upgraded the 12.3-inch display of the Spectre x2 — which now has a resolution of 3000×2000 pixels, rather than last year’s 1080p panel. HP is also packing the Intel Iris Plus 650 graphics card which will apparently power two 4K monitors. As for the battery, HP says the new Spectre x2 can run up to 8 hours — but the company has packed fast charging into the device, which should let you charge your device pretty quickly. The updated model also comes with 360GB of storage, dual-speakers tuned by Bang & Olufsen, and it will start shipping next month, prices start at $999.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 22 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman PSSC Labs Announces „Greenest” New Eco Blade Server Platform for High Performance Computing LAKE FOREST, Calif., May 22, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — PSSC Labs, a developer of custom HPC and Big Data computing solutions, today announced its new Eco Blade server platform, the most energy efficient high performance blade server on the market. The Eco Blade is a unique server platform engineered specifically for high performance, high density computing environments – simultaneously increasing compute density while decreasing power use. Eco Blade offers two complete, independent servers within 1U of rack space. Each independent server supports up to 64 Intel® Xeon® processor cores and 1.0 TB of enterprise memory for a total of up to 128 Cores and 2 TB of memory per 1U. There is no shared power supply or backplane, a unique design feature that translates to power savings of up to 46% on a per server comparison with servers of similar capabilities from leading brands. By lowering the power consumption of these servers, PSSC Labs is offering the greenest server of its kind on the market, translating to lower lifetime ownership costs for institutions that adopt the Eco Blade servers. According to the EPA, volume servers are responsible for 68% of all electricity consumed by IT equipment in data centers in 2006. A study by the US government found that in 2014 US data centers consumed about 70 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, making up 2% of the country’s total energy consumption. Using over 90% energy efficient power supplies and combining them with power saving features, the Eco Blade servers result in significant savings in energy costs over the lifetime of the product. Along with the significant reduction in power used, the Eco Blade is built using 55% recyclable material, it a move that cements PSSC Labs’ commitment to finding sustainable enterprise server solutions that reduce waste and powers progress. „The global thirst for more computing power and storage see demand for volume servers and the resulting energy consumption to continue to rise. As an industry, it is our responsibility to find ways to reduce power consumption while still providing the computing ability needed to fuel cutting edge research and groundbreaking enterprises,” said Alex Lesser, Vice President of PSSC Labs. „PSSC Labs has taken a big step in engineering a HPC / data center server that does not compromise on performance but will significantly reduce power consumption. By deploying the Eco Blade server instead of traditional servers from other manufacturers, companies will reduce their cap ex and op ex while being good stewards of the environment.” In addition to the lifetime saving in energy costs, the Eco Blade servers allow higher density rack configurations which reduce the amount of infrastructure and networking equipment required, translating to huge cost savings during the initial purchase as well as savings to recurring maintenance costs. Eco Blade Technical Specs: Application Compatibility All PSSC Labs server installation includes a one year unlimited phone / email support package (additional year support available), with fully US based support staff. Prices for a custom-built Eco Blade servers start at $2,299.  For more information on the Eco Blade, visit http://www.pssclabs.com/servers/virtualization-servers/.

Plus: Get the Mass Effect trilogy for just $5! Laptops by Rick Broida May 22, 2017 5:32 AM PDT @cheapskateblog CNET's Cheapskate scours the web for great deals on PCs, phones, gadgets and much more. Questions about the Cheapskate blog? Find the answers on our FAQ page. And find more great buys on the CNET Deals page. Lenovo Good heavens, we are all spoiled rotten. Information at our fingertips, computing powerhouses in our pockets, laptops for $129. Think about this last for a second. A mere 25 years ago, an IBM ThinkPad would have cost you $2,375 (or around $4,000 in inflation-adjusted dollars). And it would have been a heavy, bulky slowpoke with a small, grayscale screen. Just 20 years ago, a color laptop -- the Gateway Solo, for example -- cost over $6,000 (inflation-adjusted). Ten years ago, a Dell XPS cost around $3,300. Not that you couldn't buy a laptop for less, but it's easy to forget how expensive they used to be. Today, this: Walmart has the Lenovo N22 11.6-inch Chromebook for $129 shipped (plus tax). Come on! This is the machine you buy for a kid who needs a laptop, the one who's heading off to middle school in the fall or needs something a little better than the aging hand-me-down you bought four years ago. It's no powerhouse, but it's powerful enough, with an Intel Celeron processor, 4GB of RAM (one would expect 2GB at this price point) and 16GB of expandable storage. Whoa, that's not much, right? Keep in mind this is a Chromebook, so it's designed to store schoolwork and other documents in Google's cloud. That said, you can easily (and inexpensively) devote one of the N22's two USB 3.0 ports to a full-time flash drive -- like this SanDisk 32GB Ultra Fit drive for $14.39. (Don't get me started on how cheap that is.) Lenovo packs in a few other amenities as well, including a webcam that can rotate up and down, a water-resistant keyboard and a battery that's good for up to 10 hours of runtime. The N22 also offers Bluetooth 4.0 and all the Wi-Fis: 802.11a/b/g/n/ac. It weighs 2.8 pounds. The Mass Effect trilogy is on sale for just $5! BioWare Not too shabby for $129, am I right? The one caveat I have is printing: Your student will almost certainly need to do some, so you'll need to make sure you have a Google Cloud Print-compatible printer. (See "How to print from a Chromebook" to learn more.) Your thoughts? Bonus deal: Game time! If you never played the Mass Effect series, you missed on some truly epic action-RPG sci-fi goodness. You also saved yourself a boatload of money, because for a limited time, Cdkeys has the Mass Effect Trilogy (PC) for $5.19. Over at Steam, just the first two games alone would run you $40. (Mass Effect 3 isn't even available there.) This deal nets you redemption keys for Origin, though, not Steam -- meaning you'll need an Origin account and the client software. The three games debuted in 2007, 2010 and 2012, and all earned top marks from GameSpot (among other sites). Check out this review of Mass Effect 3, just to get the flavor. I don't know how much longer the trilogy will be available at this price (I first spotted it yesterday), but I do know it's a killer deal on three phenomenal PC games. Don't miss it!

One of our biggest gripes with the previous version of the x360 was that it was rather large, and we didn't feel it was the ideal companion for taking on-the-go. While HP may have kept the same 15.6-inch screen, it has managed to take a sizeable chunk off of the bezels to make it much more manageable. Side bezels have been reduced by 55 per cent, to 6.65mm, while the top bezel is down 25 per cent to 13.9mm. Not only will this bezel trimming make the Envy x360 easier to carry around with you, it also gives the screen more of an edge-to-edge aesthetic. The keyboard is also edge-to-edge, is fully backlit, has full-size keys with 1.5mm travel and there's even enough space for a full numeric keypad to the right. Two versions of the Envy x360 will be available, a Dark Ash Silver model with an AMD A9 or A12 processor, or a Natural Silver model with Intel Core i5 or i7 processor, depending on your configuration. Both will have full HD screens, although Intel-version customers will be able to specify an Ultra HD screen. Storage can be specified in one of three ways, either a standalone HDD up to 1TB, a standalone SSD up to 512GB, or you can select a dual storage option that combines the two. Every model gets 16GB of RAM. As with other HP products, the audio on the Envy x360 has been tuned by Bang & Olufsen and connections include a single USB Type-C, two USB Type-A, an HDMI, SD card reader and 3.5mm headphone jack. Battery life figures differ depending on your processor option, the AMD version will last up to 10.25 hours, while the Intel model extends it to 11.5 hours. However, both have fast charge technology to regain 90 per cent power in 90 minutes. Pricing and availability for the HP Envy x360 has yet to be announced.

The Eco Blade is a unique server platform engineered specifically for high performance, high density computing environments – simultaneously increasing compute density while decreasing power use. Eco Blade offers two complete, independent servers within 1U of rack space. Each independent server supports up to 64 Intel® Xeon® processor cores and 1.0 TB of enterprise memory for a total of up to 128 Cores and 2 TB of memory per 1U. There is no shared power supply or backplane, a unique design feature that translates to power savings of up to 46% on a per server comparison with servers of similar capabilities from leading brands. By lowering the power consumption of these servers, PSSC Labs is offering the greenest server of its kind on the market, translating to lower lifetime ownership costs for institutions that adopt the Eco Blade servers. According to the EPA, volume servers are responsible for 68% of all electricity consumed by IT equipment in data centers in 2006. A study by the US government found that in 2014 US data centers consumed about 70 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, making up 2% of the country's total energy consumption. Using over 90% energy efficient power supplies and combining them with power saving features, the Eco Blade servers result in significant savings in energy costs over the lifetime of the product. Along with the significant reduction in power used, the Eco Blade is built using 55% recyclable material, it a move that cements PSSC Labs' commitment to finding sustainable enterprise server solutions that reduce waste and powers progress. "The global thirst for more computing power and storage see demand for volume servers and the resulting energy consumption to continue to rise. As an industry, it is our responsibility to find ways to reduce power consumption while still providing the computing ability needed to fuel cutting edge research and groundbreaking enterprises," said Alex Lesser, Vice President of PSSC Labs. "PSSC Labs has taken a big step in engineering a HPC / data center server that does not compromise on performance but will significantly reduce power consumption. By deploying the Eco Blade server instead of traditional servers from other manufacturers, companies will reduce their cap ex and op ex while being good stewards of the environment." In addition to the lifetime saving in energy costs, the Eco Blade servers allow higher density rack configurations which reduce the amount of infrastructure and networking equipment required, translating to huge cost savings during the initial purchase as well as savings to recurring maintenance costs. Eco Blade Technical Specs: Supports 2 x Intel Xeon E5-2600v4 Processors Up to 1.0TB of High Performance ECC Registered System Memory Per Server 2 x Redundant SSD Operating System Hard Drives Network Connectivity Options include 10GigE, 40GigE and 100GigE Remote Management through Dedicated IPMI 2.0 Network Certified Compatible with Red Hat Linux, CentOS Linux, Ubuntu Linux, Microsoft Operating Systems Application Compatibility Docker Kubernetes Mesos OpenStack Joyent Rancher Chef Puppet High Performance Computing (HPC) workloads All PSSC Labs server installation includes a one year unlimited phone / email support package (additional year support available), with fully US based support staff. Prices for a custom-built Eco Blade servers start at $2,299.  For more information on the Eco Blade, visit http://www.pssclabs.com/servers/virtualization-servers/.

I just went through the decision tree myself. Here's what I learned - and bought. By Robin Harris for Storage Bits | May 22, 2017 -- 12:26 GMT (05:26 PDT) | Topic: Hardware When I noticed my 13-inch MacBook Air was getting heavy, I decided to look at lightening my load. The two obvious choices were an iPad Pro or the latest MacBook. Why not a Windows Ultrabook? Simple: I'm invested in both of the Apple operating systems. I have Windows 7 and 10, and have run them on my Macs, but I prefer macOS. Plus, Apple's machines are more reliable. Price see also With one small tweak, the iPad could replace the laptop Apple clearly wants the iPad to replace the laptop. In fact, the company believes that it is already superior to the laptop. But it isn't. Read More I'd want the larger screen with an almost full sized keyboard, so I looked at the 256GB 12.9-inch iPad Pro model, which starts at $999. Add the $169 Smart Keyboard, and you're at $1168. The MacBook starts at $1299 for the 256GB with 8GB. For less than 10 percent more, price wasn't a critical difference. And with the MacBook you can upgrade to very fast 500GB SSD and an m2 or m3 Intel processor. Weight The combined large iPad+Smart Keyboard combo weighs in at 2.33 pounds (1.06Kg) while the MacBook comes in at 2.03 pounds (0.93 Kg). Not quite a deal breaker, but a definite plus for the MacBook. Display At 264 dpi, the iPad Pro beats the MacBook's 226 dpi. I've recently gotten massively improved vision thanks to lens implants, so for the first time I could appreciate the Retina displays. Score one for the iPad Pro, but both displays are excellent. Battery life A wash at 10 hours each. Keyboard As a writer the keyboard is important. The Smart Keyboard relies on a fabric covering to provide the springs for the keys, while the MacBook keyboard has a very low profile butterfly mechanism that has engendered some criticism. I'm a touch typist but not a purist. I could get used to either keyboard, but I liked the MacBook keyboard better. The MacBook has very clear backlighting, and, of course, there's none on the iPad's Smart Keyboard. Verdict: MacBook keyboard. OS The Unix-based macOS is pretty robust, although I experience more file corruption than I'd like (none would be fine). Of course, iOS is also Unix-based, but much more buttoned down, to make it harder for users to get into trouble. As a writer, my main writing apps (Scrivener and Simplenote) are available on both. But I often open a dozen or more browser tabs for research, and in my experience macOS handles that - along with more RAM on Macs - better than iOS. Also: How I saved nearly $7,000 on Apple gear this year | Apple tries to save the iPad, but it's too little, too late | iPad Pro review: A killer creative canvas with laptop-replacement dreams (CNET) | Apple MacBook (2016) review: Improved minimalist laptop is more tempting than ever I also do photo and video editing, and here, for me, macOS has the edge. Because I'm most used to Final Cut Pro, I find iMovie too clunky. And I prefer the photo apps on macOS for their greater flexibility. Verdict: macOS wins. I/O No contest. The MacBook's 10Gb/sec USB 3.1 port has way more capability than iPad I/O, even though the iPad's Lightning port is USB 3.0 capable, it isn't currently supported. The Storage Bits take I finally concluded that the two machines serve different users. If I were an artist I'd choose an iPad Pro and Apple Pencil. And if I hadn't spent the last 40 years playing with computers, I might also prefer iOS for daily work. But for me, a writer, the keyboard, OS/apps and weight moved me to choose the MacBook. What surprised me is that, for similar capabilities, Apple charges about the same price. Assuming the margins are similar, that may be the problem Apple has with declining iPad sales. For the cost of an iPad Pro with Smart Keyboard, you can get a real computer, with the flexibility to run multiple operating systems and pro applications. If the 12.9-inch iPad has been a disappointment for Apple, that's almost certainly why. How to securely erase any hard drive, SSD,...

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print COMEY WILL TESTIFY – CBO scores Obamacare repeal this week – HOUSE DEMS REHASH 2006 – Montana House seat decided Thursday 05/22/2017 07:46 AM EDT By Heather Caygle (hcaygle@politico.com or @heatherscope) With an assist from Daniel Lippman Story Continued Below OH, WHAT A WEEK — President Donald Trump will be overseas for the week, continuing on his first foreign trip since coming to the White House. But that doesn’t mean Congress is slowing down as it wraps up its last week of work before everybody heads home for Memorial Day recess. Some things to look out for: CHAFFETZ to talk to Comey today: House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) said over the weekend he expects to talk with fired FBI Director James Comey today. Chaffetz, who’s leaving Congress at the end of June, has been pressured by some top Republicans to give up his Oversight gavel now, before the committee’s probe into Trump really gets underway. ‘This thing runs deep’: “My impression, when I walked out of the briefing, was that this thing runs deep,” Oversight Committee ranking member Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said on ABC Sunday about the House’s briefing with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein last week. “There may be quite a few people that may have some problems with the law.” The Hill: http://bit.ly/2q2lx0N Chaffetz invited Comey to testify Wednesday at an Oversight Committee hearing on FBI independence but the former bureau director isn't expected to appear. "It's important to remember nobody's actually seen these documents," Chaffetz said on ABC’s “This Week” about Comey’s memo detailing Trump asking him to end the FBI investigation into Michael Flynn. Comey will testify in public before the Senate Intelligence Committee sometime after the Memorial Day recess. Trump called Comey “a real nutjob” during his recent meeting with top Russian officials, the New York Times reported Friday. Senate Judiciary leaders said they were “disappointed” Comey turned down an invitation to testify before their panel. “There is no reason he can’t testify before both the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees,” said Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). Burgess with more: http://politi.co/2qNxXaf REPUBLICANS face a deadline today in their lawsuit over the legality of Obamacare subsidies. If the White House drops its Obama-era appeal of the lawsuit, it could lead to an immediate insurer exodus, Dan Diamond reports for Pros. Trump is leaning towards killing the subsidies, with the thinking that Democrats will be blamed for the ensuing chaos. The administration could request another 90-day delay from the court today. POLITICO Pulse with more: http://politico.pro/2qNMjqM THE WHITE HOUSE BUDGET will be released Tuesday. Trump’s first budget will combine “uncharacteristically liberal demands with calls for the most extreme domestic spending cuts the country has ever seen,” Jen Scholtes and Sarah Ferris report. The budget, which is a White House messaging document more than anything, will include huge cuts to Medicaid and other safety net programs, Damian Paletta reports for the Washington Post. No love on the Hill: "Like I want to go home after having voting against Meals on Wheels and say, 'Oh it's a bad program, keeping seniors alive.' There's just some of the stuff in here that doesn't make any sense,” said Idaho GOP Rep. Mike Simpson. “Frankly, you can't pass these budgets on the floor." Much more: http://politi.co/2qNLMVX Also Tuesday: Former CIA Director John Brennan will testify before the House Intel Committee on Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Brennan will participate in a closed-door briefing with lawmakers following the public hearing. CONGRESSIONAL SCOREKEEPERS on Wednesday will release their estimate for the House Republican plan to repeal Obamacare. There’s a chance the House could have to re-vote on the proposal if CBO determines it doesn’t meet the Senate’s strict budget requirements needed to pass a bill with a simple majority. The CBO score will detail potential costs and estimate how many people could lose insurance under the GOP plan. More: http://politi.co/2qNpSSP VOTERS head to the polls in Montana Thursday to decide who will fill Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke’s old House seat: GOP candidate Greg Gianforte or political newcomer Rob Quist. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) barnstormed the state over the weekend to rally support for Quist. The Washington Post’s Kathleen McLaughlin and Dave Weigel have the dispatch from Butte: http://wapo.st/2q2ejtO And Attorney General Jeff Sessions will testify before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee Thursday on DOJ's fiscal 2018 budget request. MONDAY AGAIN? Okay, let’s do this. Welcome to May 22 and thanks for reading POLITICO’s Huddle, the play-by-play guide to all things Capitol Hill. FRIDAY’S MOST CLICKED: No surprise here, the pictures of Sens. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) in his casual wear, Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), et. al, hanging out during a relaxed moment was the big winner. YOUR TURN, LEADER McCONNELL — Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has managed to keep himself out of Trump-related controversies that have enveloped other Republicans this year, mostly by staying quiet. But the GOP effort to repeal Obamacare is now squarely in his court. “McConnell (R-Ky.) is handling the situation so far in his typically cautious manner, feeling out his conference but offering no positions of his own,” Burgess and Jen Haberkorn report. But ultimately, McConnell, likely behind closed doors and without public hearings, will decide the contents of the final plan. More on his playbook: http://politi.co/2q2u7wN With the special Russia prosecutor in place, Senate Democrats are ready to refocus their efforts on killing the GOP’s Obamacare repeal. “My worry is that this [Russia] story still dominates the headlines and provides cloud cover for Republicans who are rewriting the American healthcare system with nobody watching,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). “We can make Republicans’ life a living hell if they put a bill on the floor that looks like the House proposal. But we need to be ready.” Elana and Burgess: http://politi.co/2q2hq50 MEANWHILE, IN THE HOUSE... "House Republicans say they aren’t close to agreeing on a budget blueprint they have to approve before they can move ahead with one of their top priorities: a tax overhaul," Bloomberg's Erik Wasson reports. "The biggest point of contention is over conservatives’ demands that the spending plan chart a path toward a balanced budget within 10 years."

Working families can’t afford the BAT. Learn more at www.KeepAmericaAffordable.com. ** LET’S PARTY LIKE IT’S 2006 — House Democrats are revisiting ideas from more than a decade ago in their quest to take back the majority next year. Democratic leaders say there are real similarities to the 2006 political landscape, so why not engineer a playbook similar to the one that swept them into the majority and handed Nancy Pelosi the speaker’s gavel? A trio of House Democrats including Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, co-chair of the caucus’ messaging arm, is even heading to Chicago to meet with Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the party’s master strategist during the 2006 takeover. But (and there’s always a but), a lot has changed since 2006, including a redistricting landscape that significantly tilts Republican, and readopting the same campaign tactics (under the same leadership structure, nonetheless) likely won’t cut it, Edward-Isaac Dovere and Gabe Debenedetti report.

Ben Sasse went on NPR’s “Wait Wait…Don’t Tell Me!” this weekend to promote his new book and there were some real gems in the 10-minute conversation. “Before we get into anything, how was your week?” host Peter Sagal asked. “I haven't checked Twitter in the last six minutes, so I don't know yet,” Sasse replied. Listen here: http://n.pr/2qNAd0W TROUBLE IN THE GOLDEN STATE — Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) is facing heat back home from within her own party, as the liberal base seethes with boiling unrest against Trump. “Feinstein’s brand of moderation is showing signs of slipping out of favor in a state that delivered a landslide margin against Trump,” David Siders and Carla Marinucci report. Feinstein hasn’t said whether she’ll seek reelection next year – although she’s hinted as much. But the challenges she could face with her base were already on full display over the weekend as party operatives and progressive newcomers battled for control of the state’s Democratic Party chairmanship. Even with liberal opposition, Feinstein, the oldest member of the Senate at 83, could easily win a fifth term, political operatives say.

Perrine was most recently at the Senate Republican Conference. She’s a graduate of the University of Connecticut.

The Senate convenes at 3 p.m. with a roll call vote at 5:30 p.m. on the nomination of Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad to serve as ambassador to China.

Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) holds a press conference on President Trump’s first foreign trip at 5:45 p.m. in the House triangle. FRIDAY’S TRIVIA WINNER — Marshal Shemtob correctly guessed that former Sen. Mark Dayton (D-Minn.) served in Congress at the same time his Yale fraternity buddy George W. Bush was in the White House. Both men were members of Delta Kappa Epsilon.

Profitable companies will pay nothing in taxes. Working families will pay $1,700 more for food, clothing and prescription drugs. Over 42 million jobs will be at risk. Congress should pass tax reform that helps working families, protects existing jobs and fosters an environment for new ones to be created.

[x] HOME TECH GAMING BUSINESS CONSUMER MOBILE HEXUS.TV TRUST COMPETITIONS FORUMS SEARCH You are here: Laptop Mainboard Hardware News 2 Asus ROG teases an AMD Ryzen powered gaming laptop by Mark Tyson on 22 May 2017, 10:01 Tags: AMD (NYSE:AMD), ASUSTeK (TPE:2357) Quick Link: HEXUS.net/qadhor Add to My Vault: Computex 2017 kicks off a little over a week from today and we are already rather excited about what might be launched and demonstrated at this PC industry trade show. Asus is currently running a Computex teaser campaign, posting glimpses of hardware with the hashtag #Computex2017 attached. Here's what we can devine so far from the info that has been shared. Computex presentation dates As has become usual, Asus ROG and Asus will have their own presentations to share a plethora of respective new and exciting products. The Asus presentation will be dubbed The Edge of Beyond and is scheduled for Monday 29th May, at 2pm Taiwan time (Monday, 7am in the UK). It looks like this event is sponsored or co-hosted by Intel. We should expect to see new extremely slim Asus Zen devices, among many other things like personal assistant robots - but probably not new smartwatches. Asus ROG has invited folk to visit its presentation on Tuesday, 30th May at 6.30pm Taiwan time (that's Tuesday 11.30am in the UK). It has already teased a couple of products we might see. Check out the glimpses we have seen below… Asus ROG gaming laptop with AMD Ryzen processor Asus ROG is teasing "Something BIG is coming your way! Can you guess what it is?" Accompanying this tweet we get to see a video, also available on YouTube, and embedded below. The animation is self explanatory but leaves us with lots of questions. The image of an Asus ROG laptop superimposed on an AMD Ryzen logo is rather an obvious tease. However the questions concern what AMD chip(s) are being used inside this soon to be revealed machine. Could it be powered by a desktop Ryzen chip with discrete graphics from either AMD or Nvidia? Or could it come packing a Ryzen Vega Mobile APU? The consumer APUs are estimated on the roadmap to be arriving sometime in Q3 2017.   LiveDash OLED Asus ROG has some next gen motherboards on the way too. Expect some 'PRIME' motherboards from the firm to come with integrated displays. I've seen one or two high-end graphics cards with built-in LCD displays in recent months. Such a display could be equally, or even more useful, on a motherboard. If your motherboard could talk, what would it say? With the LiveDash OLED, you decide. #Computex2017 #NextGenMotherboards #ROG #PRIME pic.twitter.com/V0CUewBrAd — ASUS ROG (@ASUS_ROG) 20 May 2017 As you can see in the short video teaser above, Asus ROG has a system called LiveDash OLED which will display status info like CPU temps and CPU cooler fan speeds. OLED is a good choice in your PC case, for its dense blacks.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 22 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman DFC Intelligence Issues Reports on Emerging PC Gamers     SAN DIEGO, CA, May 22, 2017 /24-7PressRelease/ — Market analyst firm DFC Intelligence has issued a series of new research products focused on the emerging PC game consumer. These are younger game consumers that would like to play more high-end games on PC but are currently limited by hardware performance. These consumers are most likely to buy high-end PCs and accessories in the near future and will be a primary source of growth for the game market in general. Overall DFC Intelligence forecasts that a growing number of consumers will specifically make future computer and PC component purchases based on how well a PC system can play games. By 2021, consumers are expected to spend $40 billion on custom hardware specifically designed to play PC games, including a large number of consumers building their own system. „This is great news for companies like Nvidia, Intel and AMD as these consumers will look to increasingly spend money on performance hardware,” said DFC lead analyst David Cole. „Teenagers and young adults today are very aware of not only major PC brands, but also issues like the importance of specialized cooling systems and power supplies. The main issue is many of these consumers are not in a position to afford expensive systems. However, that will change as they grow older.” To analyze the „Emerging PC Gamer” segment DFC analyzed tens of millions of searches over several years on System Requirements Lab by consumers looking to assess if their PC was powerful enough to run a specific game. These were generally younger consumers that did not have access to the higher-end PC systems favored by core PC gamers. DFC also surveyed 1,300 consumers across North America, South America and Europe. The Emerging PC Gamer segment is 93% male with 86% of respondents in the 13-25 year old age range. The most popular game franchise was Grand Theft Auto with 81% of respondents saying they have played a game in the series. Other popular game industry franchises included Call of Duty (70%), Minecraft (62%) and Pokemon (58%). Among major PC game franchises The Sims actually ranked higher than League of Legends, Civilization and Warcraft. Surprisingly mobile gaming was not as popular as expected. Only 44% of respondents had played a game on their smartphone in the past month, the same number as played games on a laptop PC. Tablets were not that popular with 6% playing on an iPad and 11% on an Android tablet in the past month. Console game systems are popular with this audience with 34% playing on an Xbox One or PlayStation 4. This figure was high given that only 52% of respondents came from what DFC considers the major console markets of North America, Japan and Western Europe. Not surprisingly these consumers are very into new trends like eSports and virtual reality. In the past six month, 54% of respondents had watched or competed in an eSports event and 55% use a gaming headset. While less than 5% own a virtual reality system, 64% said they are excited by the prospect of VR. The systems with the most owners were Samsung GearVR, followed by PlayStation VR, HTC Vive and Oculus Rift in that order. When it came to future purchase intent the Vive led with 27%, followed by Oculus Rift at 25% and PlayStation VR at 19%. The challenge with this demographic is that they seem to be constrained in terms of spending. While 42% of respondents said they were in the market for a new PC in the next year, 40% said they keep their PC until it won’t run anymore. The majority of consumers paid less than $1,000 for their current PC. „Considering the high system demands for many PC games it is clear that performance limitations within the targeted audience are a major limiting factor for game sales,” said Cole. The new products are part of a line of services DFC has launched to help companies understand the addressable market for PC games. The products available include a pdf report, a presentation summary of the May 2017 survey results and an Excel pivot table with March 2017 actual hardware data from over 1.5 million consumers DFC has identified as part of the Emerging PC Gamer demographic.

Why the budget doesn’t balance Can the pope save Trump? More Opinion »   The May 14 Commentary essay, “Miracle Machine needs fuel,” co-authored by Alphabet executive chairman Eric Schmidt, touted quantum computing as an upcoming revolutionary technology with the capability to affect our lives in major ways, and argued that government support for its development is essential. Schmidt is correct: The time is right for a major U.S. investment in quantum computing. Most technologies that benefit us resulted from earlier science breakthroughs, many of which were enabled by government investment. For example, the Internet was invented by university and industry scientists supported by federal government grants. When it became operational, it was supported further through infrastructure investments for many years until private corporations saw the benefit of taking it on. Now an international race is on to see who can create the first working quantum computer and to put it to beneficial uses. What is quantum computing, and how is it revolutionary? A quantum computer would be able to compute answers to many important problems that no ordinary computer could handle: designing new industrial materials, determining the optimal molecular structures of pharmaceutical drugs, monitoring patterns of activity in communication networks, searching databases and other yet-to-be discovered applications. Ordinary computers store each “bit” of information in the states of miniature electrical switches. A switch can be on or off to represent a bit of data. A program of switching these on and off drives a computer’s operation. A quantum computer would store information in quantum switches, or “qubits,” which can in a sense be in the on state and the off state simultaneously. This gives quantum computers unique capabilities. The challenges to building working quantum computers are formidable. Controlling qubits is extremely difficult because they can be disrupted by any unwanted outside influence. Scientists have yet to create a quantum computer, but they are getting closer. They have learned how to “tame” qubits and “entice” them to perform the needed steps to carry out calculations using quantum principles. Some leading companies, including IBM, Microsoft, Google and Intel, have begun investing in efforts to construct quantum computers. But a gap exists between the kind of trained experts the companies need and the available scientific labor pool. What is needed are “quantum engineers,” and industry is not in a position to train such a workforce. And, really, at this point no one has the engineering know-how to build quantum computers. Other kinds of quantum technologies are also on the horizon. Quantum communication technologies have been invented that can promise complete security against messages being intercepted and read while in transit over the Internet. Quantum-based gravity sensors and accelerometers can be used in geo-exploration and in navigation where GPS is unavailable. And quantum magnetic-field sensors can enhance medical diagnostic technology and research. For these reasons, I recently became involved with a wide cohort of scientists and engineers in industry, government laboratories and universities who are calling for a major national investment in developing the engineering framework and scientific workforce needed to bring quantum technologies to fruition. This would be a quantum “moonshot” effort, like the government-funded Human Genome Project, which now affects medical research and practice in big ways, and creates growth in the economy. Following a meeting last fall at the White House Office of Science and Technology, some of us began working together and with professional scientific societies to encourage a major federal investment in quantum technologies, including quantum computers. The U.S. is playing catch up, as European governments are investing around $2 billion and it is believed China’s investment in quantum technology is moving quickly, including the launch of a quantum-enabled satellite. It would be nice if we could leave it up to the private sector to create the first quantum computer, but there are limits to what industry can achieve on its own. It’s easy to say that taxpayers shouldn’t have to foot the bill for science and engineering, but in many cases these investments provide exponential returns to the people who pay for them. The Internet, GPS, medical imagers, and countless other innovations have come about thanks to federally funded basic and applied research. Ultimately, these partnerships benefit the taxpayers, private industry and society. The same kind of successes can be had with quantum technology, but only if we commit to a race whose finish is far closer than once thought. To hear about the development of quantum computers from one of the pioneers in the field, you can attend the free public lecture at 7 p.m. May 30 by Nobel prize-winning physicist David Wineland, in the Straub Hall auditorium on the University of Oregon campus. Michael Raymer, a University of Oregon professor of physics, is the author of “Quantum Physics: What Everyone Needs to Know.” More Guest Viewpoint articles »     RG Opinion Editorials, commentary & more delivered to your inbox.         Today’s Opinion stories Editorial Revitalizing downtown Editorial Trump warms to Saudis Paul Krugman American workers’ freedom declining?

By also utilizing Marvell controllers, this module will help usher in the next generation of embedded and industrial storage. The 3D NAND technology has also been incorporated into many of Innodisk's SATA form factor series. The new AES SD card series integrates the US government standard 256-bit AES encryption, making it one of the most secure SD products on the market. The encryption key is randomly generated and is unknown to both the user and manufacturer. The encryption process is also fully hardware-based and does not impact system operations when encrypting or decrypting data. As the number of interconnected devices keep growing under IoT, management is becoming increasingly challenging. To address this Innodisk is launching the cloud management software iCAP to help system operators monitor and remotely control all their cloud-connected devices. Automation Innodisk can offer a wide variety of customizable solutions to meet the demands of Industry 4.0.

Server The new SATADOM [®] Server Boot-up Drive series are compact, high-performance devices which uses Cable-less SATA Power technology to simplify server design. The Boot-Up Drives also implement evolved firmware algorithms that greatly extend data retention. With a height less then 1U and by using dedicated SATA connectors, server scaling is made easy while also freeing up more space for storage devices. Innodisk's Server DIMM series comprises Very Low-Profile (VLP) and MINI DIMM such as 2666 MT/s 16GB MINI DIMM-VLP and 8GB MINI DIMM-VLP. These high-capacity DRAM modules are energy-efficient and designed to allow maximum airflow, thus keeping server maintenance costs to a minimum while simplifying server scaling. Surveillance With lower prices and extended longevity, SSDs are increasingly popular in the quickly growing surveillance market. The InnoREC™ feature set comprises multiple form factors that are optimized for surveillance applications. The RECLine™ feature combines several technologies that together deliver the optimal write performance for data recording. DRAM modules such as 2666 MT/s UDIMM-VLP and 32GB RDIMM-VLP offer high performance and small form factors that are perfect for surveillance applications. Innodisk's isolated expansion cards provide reliable and robust PoE expansion that is certified and tested for harsh environments. With a large set of form factors and interfaces, our PoE expansion cards are easily integrated into any system. Aerospace and Defense InnoRobust™ is Innodisk's DRAM and flash storage feature set designed for Aerospace and Defense applications that complies with MIL-STD-810G. It incorporates technologies and design features aimed at maximizing operability in extreme conditions. In addition to this, our data security features can delete and even physically destroy data in the blink of an eye, ensuring that vital information does not fall into the wrong hands. Our aerospace and defense storage devices also come with hardware integrated 256-bit AES cipher, further increasing data security.

Supplier HP www.hp.com Price $2699 AUD > Pricing info Specs 13.3-inch IPS touchscreen display • Intel i7 7500U (twin-core, Hyperthreading, 3.5GHz Turbo) • 1 x USB 3.1 Type A + 2 x USB 3.1 Type C/Thunderbolt Tweet Email this Print this Feedback One spectre that is hard to miss. Things are getting heavy in the land of ultraportables. Not a week goes by without a new ultra-light, super-slim notebook crossing the PC & Tech Authority testbench, and HP has weighed in with two lightweights. The second of these is the Spectre, a 13.3-inch convertible that is as light as it is flexible. Can it live up to the increasing competition of this sector though, where competition is incredibly fierce?  According to the official press release, HP has made some rather impressive improvements compared to the previous version of the Spectre. It’s 13% thinner at a mere 13.8mm, while it’s shed around 150 grams, bringing it to a total weight of 1.295kg, for the entry level model at least. This doesn’t make it the thinnest or lightest on the market, but it’s not far off. The convertible screen rotates through 360 degrees thanks to two hinges, and they’re nice and sturdy, minimising bounce if you choose to make use of the touchscreen capabilities. Speaking of which, the IPS screen is a beauty – our review model came with the wonderfully crisp 4K model. It may seem like overkill on a 13 incher, but it is a delight to behold. Unfortunately the price we were supplied was for the 1080p version – bump it up to 4K and you can add another $600 or so to the price quoted above.  Perhaps the biggest improvement though is a claimed 25% increase in battery life. HP says this should deliver up 15 hours of use thanks to a 57.8W battery combined with the latest Intel 7th Gen Core. Our review unit hit a very healthy 264 minutes in the very demanding PCMark 8 Home Battery test; it would have done even better if it was the 1080p version, as the 4K screen is known to be a bit of a power-pig. Helping optimise battery life even further, our sample came with the Core i7 7500U CPU, which ramps up to 3.5GHz under maximum load but generally likes to hang out around 2.7GHz for regular duties. It’s only a twin core model, but the inclusion of Hyperthreading helps out when it comes to multitasking.  One improvement that is easy to note is the new ‘micro-edge display bezel’, which has reduced the bezel by an impressive 10mm on each side, giving it that the infinite edge look and feel that is now the norm. Unfortunately due to its rather thin nature, the range of I/O ports isn’t overwhelming. On the left is a single USB 3.1 Type A alongside a 3.5mm stereo minijack, while the right has twin USB 3.1 Type C ports. The great news is they’re both Thunderbolt compatible. HP has also generously included three different peripherals that change the functionality of these ports; a single RJ45 Ethernet Adaptor, a HDMI adaptor and a VGA adaptor. There’s even a stylus included, though we couldn’t see any mention of it being pressure sensitive, and a quick test in Paint suggests it’s not, though it is very crisp and accurate. We were also blown away by the audio quality for such a lightweight – the quad speakers pump out clear, loud sound, though it obviously lacks bass.  Digging under the hood reveals a fairly well-rounded machine. As well as the aforementioned CPU, there’s 8GB of memory, which just scrapes in by our books; sadly it’s not upgradable. Our system came with a 512GB Samsung PCIe SSD, which can be upgraded all the way up to a Terabyte, and we’re confident this is why performance was so snappy, giving this machine an excellent score in PCMark 8 Home’s Accelerated test. This was quite the surprise, as the Yoga 910 had double the system memory and a bigger SSD, so by all rights should have placed first. It didn’t though, if only by the smallest margin, so we have to give the Spectre the chequered flag when it comes to performance.  It’s getting tougher and tougher to pick the best Ultrabook around, but the Spectre’s excellent performance combined with solid specs makes it one of the top contenders on the market. If only it had a larger SSD and more memory, it could have been the pick of the bunch.

It is usually the venue for announcing software-related stuff, but this year may be different. Rumors and speculations on the internet indicate that new MacBooks and even a new iPad may be revealed during the conference. Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the subject, reports that three new MacBooks are being planned to be announced during the Worldwide Developers Conference 2017. Fans can then expect to see a refresh to the 12-inch MacBook and MacBook Pro, along with an upgraded Air. This move may have been decided to compete with Microsoft, which just released its new Surface laptop earlier this month. The Surface Book 2 is also believed to be coming soon, which is probably why Apple is updating its lineup to keep its sales high. According to the report, the 12-inch MacBook will have a faster Intel chip, while the MacBook Pro will also receive a faster Kaby Lake processor. There was no mention of a refresh in design and other specs. The smaller one is expected to be revamped inside and out, though, while the Pro will not be much different than the current model. [Image by Apple] Surprisingly, Apple is also considering upgrading the MacBook Air, which did not get a significant update last year. Rumors have already started predicting its impending doom, but now it seems like the entry-level laptop will still be hanging around. Apparently, the sales of the company’s cheapest laptop are still doing great. So, to keep customers buying the Retina-deprived notebook, it will likely be receiving a new processor. The decision may also be partly because of the Surface Laptop, which competes directly with the Air. Seeing that it is newer with better specs and a pretty face, Microsoft’s laptop may prove to be a huge challenge to Apple’s entry-level laptop. [Image by Apple] A light refresh may be enough to Apple’s herd of loyalists, but some actually want significant changes. Nonetheless, the Cupertino-based company may still be planning to introduce a new model with revamped designs and maybe an upgraded display, but that cannot be confirmed. These are rumors and speculations for now, so better take these with a pinch of salt. 10.5-inch iPad Pro The software event may be bombarded with new hardware announcements, as the new iPad Pro variant is also rumored to be announced in WWDC. According to TechTimes, production may have already begun in time for an announcement in June, as predicted by popular KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. The analyst is known for his spot-on predictions, so his word holds a lot of weight. This is further corroborated by the leaked Urban Armor Gear inventory listing, which includes a Metropolis Folio Case for a 10.5-inch iPad Pro that is due in June, 2017. Urban Armor Gear prepping case for 10.5-inch iPad Pro, with June availability https://t.co/ivd6EQOrY4 pic.twitter.com/hdygYN549z — 9to5Mac  (@9to5mac) May 10, 2017 As for its specs, the Inquisitr reports that the new iPad Pro variant will have Pro specs with a 10.5-inch screen crammed into the 9.7-inch iPad’s chassis. Its home button may be removed to accommodate the big display in a small space, or it will stay to house the fingerprint sensor. The True Tone display from the 9.7-inch iPad Pro will also be carried over to its bigger sibling, as well as advanced support for the Apple Pencil. Aside from these obvious details, not much is really known about the 10.5-inch variant. Until now, there are skeptics of the existence of the tablet as it does not seem logical to release another iPad Pro when there are already three variants (including the rumored iPad Mini Pro) on the market. WWDC 2017 kicks off on June 5, so stay tuned for more updates.

In addition, the new InnoREC™ and Boot-up drive series will focus on surveillance and server solutions respectively. These innovations along with the new Innodisk Cloud Administration Platform (iCAP) and our DDR4 2666 and Very Low-Profile DRAM modules make up the core of Innodisk's next step towards software and hardware integration. The latest innovations By combining the NVMe protocol and 3D NAND flash technology, the new PCIe M.2 SSD sports significantly increased performance and capacity.

The encryption key is randomly generated and is unknown to both the user and manufacturer. The encryption process is also fully hardware-based and does not impact system operations when encrypting or decrypting data. As the number of interconnected devices keep growing under IoT, management is becoming increasingly challenging.

Theatre Military Commands For Indian Military Is Flawed Concept – Analysis Julian Assange, Sweden, And Continuing Battles – OpEd Kim DotCom Claims Seth Rich Ties To WikiLeaks – OpEd North Korea: Kim Jong-Un Claims Ballistic Missile Ready For Mass Production Eurasia Review A Journal of Analysis and News News Opinion Analysis Business Social Religion Entertainment Environment Technology About Editorial Staff Authors and Partners Contact Submit an Article Buzz Future Privacy Policy And Terms Of Use World News  Unmasking Microchip Manufacture To Reveal New Potential Markets November 25, 2011 Eurasia Review 0 Comment Europe, Research By Eurasia Review Miniaturised devices like smart-phones have now reached the mass consumer market, but when first introduced, manufacturing costs for low volumes can keep innovative products from taking off. EU-funded researchers have developed new technology for microchip manufacture that promises to dramatically cut costs and increase design flexibility. By reducing costs for small-scale production, and enabling further miniaturisation in microchips, the results are likely to open the door for new applications and markets. The project’s technology will also help smaller EU microelectronics companies. Semiconductor lithography is the process by which microchips are printed with the tiny channels and gates which are the heart of transistors that make up the modern ‘integrated circuit’ (IC). Using a technique called ‘Maskless lithography’ (ML2), researchers in the EU-funded ‘Maskless lithography for IC manufacturing’ (MAGIC) project are starting a new era in small scale IC production that will make the process faster, simpler and cheaper. Current microchip manufacturing uses a mask-based optical lithography technique, essentially using a template to define the desired circuit pattern. It is a process that has long served the microchip industry well because it is very effective. But masks are very expensive; it can cost up to several hundred thousand euro to produce just one of them. A single chip requires several of these masks. The total mask cost is drastically rising as chip features become smaller and more sophisticated. For this reason, MAGIC studied the potential for maskless technology to combat the rising costs of semiconductor masks. Indeed, mask-based lithography becomes more and more complex with each new advance in lithographic technology. For example, optical proximity correction is a technique that compensates for distortion effects often seen along the edges of circuit channels, while phase-shift masks use interference produced by phase differences in light to improve the resolution of photolithography. Both of these techniques are needed to compensate for problems introduced by pushing lithographic techniques ever further. As lithography becomes more sophisticated mask manufacture becomes more complex and expensive. So masks now require higher performing, expensive materials and elaborate, time-consuming production processes. ‘There is now a real need for maskless lithography, because the increased costs associated with mask manufacture play a huge role in the overall cost of ownership of this technique,’ explains Laurent Pain, coordinator of the MAGIC project. ML2 technology uses multi-beam principles. Essentially, a large electron beam is focused through an aperture. The aperture can split the beam into thousands, or even millions, of smaller beams. These beams pass through an active ‘Micro-electrical-mechanical system’ (MEMS) element, called a blanker, which can control each beam individually. Some beams are then deflected, or blanked, while those that are allowed to pass create the desired microchip circuit. Helping the European microelectronics industry Large-scale industrial manufacturers, like Intel and Samsung, focus on massive production of microprocessors or memory chips. For them, the impact of lithography cost increase is less important because the associated costs are spread across huge production runs involving millions of chips. But companies developing ‘Application specific integrated circuits’ (ASIC) and small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) are struggling with the expense. It is a big problem for Europe because many of the continent’s technology companies are SMEs. It is a general problem for technology too, because the high cost of small-scale microchip manufacture can kill off innovation; new markets cannot take off if innovative devices are too expensive when manufactured in small numbers. The concept of a maskless technique is already supported by some key Complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) manufacturers around the world, like TSMC in Taiwan and STMicroelectronics in France. Even Intel, in recent industry conferences, has highlighted the potential of this technology as a complementary solution to optical lithography. This means the technology has a promising future and makes it an even more attractive R&D path. Testing multi-beam technologies MAGIC, the EU-funded collaborative project sought to develop ML2 technologies to ‘alpha-stage’ prototypes for testing. Two partners, the Netherlands-based MAPPER Lithography and Austria’s IMS Nanofabrication, had already made major advances towards high-resolution integrated circuit design using maskless electron lithography, confirming the capability of this technology and the leadership of these two European companies in the field. Half of MAGIC’s work focused on further development of the tools created by MAPPER and IMS. This provided a wide range of technology, as MAPPER’s tool is based on low voltage electron beams while IMS developed a high voltage beam system. The project delivered alpha-version prototypes meeting the semiconductor manufacturing requirements of 32 nanometre half-pitch technology. Half-pitch refers to the size of lines and spaces that separate one element from another on the microchip. ‘Over the three years of the project both platforms have pushed the maturity of their respective technology from the proof-of-concept to the pre-alpha level,’ notes Dr Pain, adding, ‘Today, both solutions have achieved significant progress, emphasising the credibility of maskless lithography.’ The second half of MAGIC’s work sought to develop the necessary infrastructure to use these tools in an industrial environment, and this infrastructure work was split into three key areas: data treatment, electron beam proximity effects and industrial integration. MAGIC developed a fast, robust and commercial data preparation platform, compatible with industry standards, that can provide full support for a maskless production system. The platform also compensates for ML2-related electron beam proximity effects. This was a vital development. Overall electron beam interaction on the substrate, as well as potential heating effects, has to be compensated for to ensure the accurate patterning of the microcircuit. The solutions developed within MAGIC eliminate this problem by applying the suitable corrections. Finally, the project demonstrated in real world conditions that ML2 can be integrated into manufacturing environments using the platforms developed by the partners. ‘2010 was an important year for MAGIC,’ remarks Pain. ‘This last year confirmed the full potential of massively-parallel electron beam lithography. For both developed technologies, operational machines were built that demonstrate all the key functional elements.’ The technique is promising but it has been a long time in development. IMS Nanofabrication first mooted the concept of maskless lithography in the 1980s, but required enabling technologies did not exist at the time. Recent efforts to support introduction of maskless lithography began in 2005 with another EU-funded project called ‘Radical innovation in maskless nanolithography’ (RIMANA) and with the MEDEA+ projects T408 and T409. Now MAGIC has dramatically enhanced Europe’s standing in advanced ML2 semiconductor manufacture. The MAGIC project received research funding under the EU’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7), in the ICT budget line. ← Malaria In Suriname Almost Eliminated Data Mining 3.0: From Info To ‘Collective Intelligence’ → You May Also Like Murdoch’s Troika – OpEd July 10, 2011 Arab News 0 Airport Body Scanners: EU Wants Strict Safeguards July 6, 2011 Eurasia Review 0 Could Dams Replace Glaciers In The Alps?

Morgan Global Technology, Media and Telecom Conference in Boston. “The platform will be in place to do an over-the-top sort of play…and we’ll go out and test it,” McAdam said. “But we have not committed to a launch date or anything. We’re going to see how this evolves.” Verizon, which recently retooled its free, ad-based OTT service, go90, is reportedly working on a national OTT TV service that would feature “dozens” of channels. Such a move would put Verizon in the virtual MVPD category alongside several others, including Sling TV, DirecTV Now, fuboTV, PlayStation Vue, Hulu and YouTube TV. REPORT: Verizon to Join Virtual MVPD Race: Report McAdam didn’t spell out exactly what Verizon has in mind, but pointed to other OTT efforts already underway, including a digital joint venture with Hearst, its exclusive NFL deal to offer NFL games on mobile devices, and a recent deal to offer National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) games on go90. RELATED: go90 Nets NWSL Deal As far as how OTT fits into the AOL-Yahoo strategy, McAdam pointed out that Tim Armstrong, AOL’s CEO, has been focused on several content “pillars” that include news, sports, finance, entertainment and lifestyle. McAdam also said Verizon remains optimistic about using 5G as a wired replacement/alternative for gigabit-class wired broadband service and, generally, how 5G can square with Verizon’s out-of-footprint TV and broadband strategy. “As we have built that architecture, 5G, on a fixed broadband perspective was the best application for us,” he said. “We did not need to wait for all of the mobile standards, we didn't have to wait for it to be…crammed into an iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy device. You can use basically your home router that you have today, just put some different chips in it. We’re working with Intel on that…and you are then a broadband provider and a TV provider outside of your franchise footprint.” He also downplayed concerns that 5G, as a fixed wireless technology used in millimeter wave spectrum, would require line-of-sight and would have trouble dealing with obstacles such a trees and buildings. McAdam warned against locking into wireless “design principals from the 2000s,” holding that the cost for small cells have come down and that antenna technology has improved. He noted that the expectation was that Verizon was expecting less than 1,000 feet of propagation to deliver gigabit speeds, but found that field trials and efforts in South Korea have shown that “we're seeing substantially more than that 1,000-foot propagation.” “So, we're feeling very bullish on it at this point, and we'll be able to say more about that after we go through the trials over the summer,” McAdam said.  RELATED: Verizon Gets a Fix on 5G Trials Want to read more stories like this?

Promote your Business on Economictimes.com for free and reach out to millions of potential Customers List Your Business Find Service Near You BENGALURU: Web-testing platform BrowserStack is being wooed by a slew of investors -strategic and financial -as they hunt for the next big winner in a sector, which combines rapid business growth with steady profits and offers a stark contrast to cash guzzling consumer internet startups that have dominated the funding cycle in recent times. Mumbai-based BrowserStack, a bootstrapped venture -a term that denotes a company which has not raised any institutional funding -has received interest from marque venture funds including Sequoia Capital and Warburg Pincus, according to three people aware of the development. Software maker Microsoft, which signed a business part which signed a business partnership with BrowserStack in March, has also offered to invest around $40 million in the company at a valuation of $400-500 million over the past few months, said two of the sources cited above. "But the company is holding out for a (higher) valuation," the sources said, adding that it is looking for a $800million to $1-billion valuation. Microsoft and Warburg Pincus did not reply to email queries from ET. Sequoia Capital responded saying, "this information is incorrect". Founded by IIT-Bombay batchmates -Ritesh Arora and Nakul Aggarwal -in 2011, BrowserStack is the fourth venture for the duo, and the first to succeed. The company helps developers visualise what their code will look like and how it will perform across browsers and operating systems. A code has to work across multiple browsers -Windows' Internet Explorer, Apple's Safari and Google's Chrome. Each browser has its nuances and the behaviour of codes varies on different platforms. Arora, 33, did not confirm the investment talks but said his company interacts with venture capital firms on a regular basis to explore choices. "I've known the Sequoia folks for four years now and Warburg for over a year. We speak to a lot of VCs but there's nothing substantial that has developed in terms of funding," he said. Arora, 33, who along with Aggarwal was a winner of the inaugural ET Startup Awards in the Bootstrap Champ category in 2015, told ET that, "we have been open to the option of fundraising, we don't have a timeline though and haven't decided on how much to raise. It's very open-ended at the moment." BrowserStack's annual recurring revenue is estimated to be about $40 million to $50 million, with about 76,000 paying customers including companies like Adobe, Microsoft, Twitter, AirBnB, Spotify and Amazon. For investors, the Indian enterprise SaaS space is attractive as companies offer competitive pricing and requires less upfront investment. What's more, with global giants including, Apple, Intel and Nutanix shopping for such startups, the chances of exits are also bright. So far, 67 SaaS startups have received funding this year. Freshdesk, one of India's best known product software makers, was valued at about $700 million when it raised a round led by Sequoia Capital in November and is estimated to have an annual revenue run rate of $60-70 million. Other bootstrapped Indian SaaS startups include Zoho, which competes globally with the likes of Salesforce and Microsoft, Delhi-based web-testing platform Wingify, hospitality SaaS provider Rategain and FusionCharts, a data visualisation company that has over 25,000 consumers across 118 countries. "From a company's perspective, if there is good customer traction and the numbers look good, there is no harm in raising external funding, as long as there is a vision for what the money is going to be used for," said Naganand Doraswamy, founder of IdeaSpring Capital.

A service robot at CES in Las Vegas. Image: Alex Wong/Getty Images By Patrick Kulp2017-05-23 02:23:45 UTC Robots are coming for retail jobs.  In-store automation threatens to kill four in 10 positions in the retail sector throughout the next decade, according to a new study. That could add up to 7.5 million lost jobs—proportionally a much bigger hit than even manufacturing took when automation devastated its labor market, according to Cornerstone Capital Group, the bank behind the report.  SEE ALSO: Trump's treasury secretary is 'not worried at all' about job-killing AI It's not as if retail workers don't have enough to keep them up at night. Hundreds of store employees have lost their jobs over the past few years as online shopping and excess store space plunge the traditional retail industry into choppy waters.  Just today, Sears said it would add 30 more store closures to the 150 the beleaguered department store announced earlier this year. Many analysts say the industry is headed for an even worse bloodbath. In that environment, stores are looking to advances like checkout kiosks and self-returning carts to streamline operations and compete with high-tech rivals, further compounding worker woes. In many cases, these types of new technology could replace certain roles outright, the study says.  Cashiers, for instance, are cited one of the easiest jobs in the economy to automate. That replacement in particular might disproportionately impact women, whom the study says make up three quarters of the retail cashier workforce. The researchers write that the impact of automation is already starting to creep into the industry—something that's evident in recent headlines. Online shopping behemoth Amazon has mapped out a host of new cashier-less physical stores, at least some of which incorporate grab-and-go checkout via an app. A New York Post story in February suggested the entirety of each store could be run by as few as a handful of employees, though Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos cryptically mocked the tabloid's sourcing on Twitter. Intel also announced a massive investment in retail tech earlier this year aimed at creating a licensable system that could integrate a store's basic functions into a single web-connected system. During that rollout, the company also teased Simbe Robotics' Tally, a pillar-like robot that roams through store shelves to update inventories. Simbe Robotics' Tally checks inventories. Image: intel While technology will ultimately ravage the retail labor market, the report says certain advances could support workers for increased productivity in the short term. The wave of automation is part of a larger trend that could imperil the very fabric of the labor economy in years to come. A recent study estimated that half of all jobs could be replaced by technology that exists or is in development.

Supplier Lenovo www.lenovo.com/au/en Price $3299 AUD > Pricing info Specs Intel’s i7 7500U (twin-core, HyperThreaded, 3.5GHz Turbo) • 16GB memory • 1TB NVMe SSD • 13.9-inch 4K IPS Touchscreen Tweet Email this Print this Feedback Bending the price just a tad too far. Adding to this month’s never-ending supply of ultraportable convertibles is the latest in Lenovo’s highly successful Yoga range, the Yoga 910. At $3,299 it’s considerably more expensive than the rest, so has a lot to prove. Is it worth rolling out the welcome matt for such a pricey entrant when there are so many other contenders with almost Zen-like mastery of the category?  So, just what makes this a special contender? It’s certainly not the size nor weight, as it’s one of the chunkier and heavier models around. Sure, the extra 100 grams or so up to 1.38kg isn’t exactly back-breaking, while the extra 5mm bringing it to a total of 14.3mm in thickness, but when competition is this fierce, every specification counts. We hate to say it, but we’re also not huge fans of its aesthetic; from the outside it looks fine, but there’s something about the font used on the keyboard that just looks a little prosaic, and there’s minimal travel distance. Thankfully the beautiful touchpad offsets this, with the glassy finish we’ve grown to love of late, but that isn’t so fast that it’s hard to be accurate with. The screen is an absolute stunner, adopting an edgeless design to make its 13.9-inch span look even bigger than it is. As expected, it’s an IPS touchscreen display, and is available in 1080p or 4K (our sample came with the high-end 4K panel, which goes a long way to justify the price point).  If there’s one thing that is bound to divide prospective owners, it’s the hinge design. Rather than the subtle twin hinge system used on most convertibles, the Yoga 910 goes for a whopping ten different hinges, alternating between plain black and a stainless steel polished design. It may not turn everybody on, but it’s definitely rock solid, with absolutely zero flex.  In terms of I/O, the twin USB 3.1 Type C connections are bound to excite, but it’s disappointing to see they’re not Thunderbolt enabled, unlike the Spectre. There’s also the obligatory single USB 3.1 Type A port, alongside a headphone jack. In terms of internals, it’s very similar to the competition. Intel’s i7 7500U does the heavy lifting, but we definitely appreciate the extra 8GB of memory over the Spectre, with 16GB in total. It also has twice the storage capacity on the hard drive, with a 1TB SSD NVMe-equipped Samsung SSD. Which is why the PCMark 8 Home benchmark results were so perplexing – by all rights, the Yoga should run rings around the Spectre, and yet our results showed it being slightly slower.   To ensure everything was running correctly, we re-ran Windows Update (a procedure we do every time we test a machine), and it turns out a bunch of updates had been released between the time of testing the Yoga 910 and the Spectre, including the new Windows 10 Creators update. A quick install of the update on the Yoga and it was time to rerun the test. Thankfully this time around the difference was much less.  We’re assuming the Yoga has some slightly more aggressive CPU throttling in action, despite it being thicker than the Spectre. On paper the Yoga 910 beats the Spectre in every regard, for a price that is almost equal to the Spectre. The tiny performance difference isn’t noticeable in real life, so the additional memory and SSD capacity of the Yoga 910 give it the edge over the Spectre.  Related Reviews Review: Toshiba Portégé X20 PRT13A-05S002 convertible laptop Review: Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 hybrid Review: Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 Review: Acer Swift SF713-51 is a smooth operator Review: Venom BlackBook Zero 14 Source: Copyright © PC & Tech Authority.

Paul Manafort And Roger Stone Reportedly Turned Over Their Russia Documents To The Senate Probe David Matthews 05.22.17 10 hours ago Facebook Twitter EMAIL Getty Image Earlier this month, the Senate Intelligence Committee asked several Trump associates to hand over their communication records and emails about Russia, which is often the first step toward Subpoena Town. After refusing that request, and ignoring a subpoena for his documents, former national security advisor Michael Flynn is now saying he is invoking his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination as the reason for not complying with the Senate probe’s demands. However, two close Trump advisors are decidedly not using Flynn’s strategy. As the Senate prepares next steps regarding Flynn, including possibly finding him in contempt and interviewing James Comey, former campaign manager Paul Manafort and Roger Stone have handed over all of their documents to the Intel Committee in its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The two provided the information before last Friday’s deadline, a spokesman for Manafort and Stone confirmed. Stone himself confirmed to NBC News. “I gave them all documents that were consistent with their specific request,” Stone said in an email. The congressional source said it was too early to tell whether the documents from Manafort and Stone suggested they had fully complied with the request. According to reports, Flynn has so far behaved in a legal way. “Flynn can make an argument that his right against self-incrimination extends even to the production of documents that could hurt him,” Senate sources told NBC.

 Ford claims its new CEO has deep ties to Silicon Valley — but the company still has a big self-driving-car problem Danielle Muoio May 22, 2017, 2:23 PM 2,743 facebook linkedin twitter email print Jim Hackett, Ford's new CEO.Ford Ford is showing it's serious about self-driving tech by naming Jim Hackett its new CEO, but whether Hackett can compete in the multi-million talent war for AI experts remains to be seen. Hackett has led Ford's Smart Mobility unit since it was formed in March 2016. The division was created as part of Ford's expansion into smart mobility services, which includes the development of autonomous vehicles and its car-sharing service GoDrive. Ford said Hackett's background and ties with Silicon Valley will help it advance in the fields of robotics and artificial intelligence. Chairman Bill Ford said during a Monday press call that Hackett is held in high-esteem by Silicon Valley leaders, which he witnessed firsthand during a board trip out West last February. "As you know the Silicon Valley culture is very, very different than industrial midwest… and to see Jim not only navigate that so well but to be held in such high regard there made an impression on me," he said. Hackett, however, doesn't have a tech background. Ford is betting that his experience as Steelcase CEO and former athletic head for the University of Michigan will prove useful. "Look for Ford to present itself as an AI Machine Learning Big Data Tech Firm," Morgan Stanley auto and mobility analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note. "During his stint heading the University of Michigan Athletic Department, Jim Hackett proved to be highly effective in bringing talent from Silicon Valley to Southeast Michigan (Jim Harbaugh)." Although commendable, convincing former 49ers coach Harbaugh to leave the West Coast for his alma matter is a lot different than convincing AI experts to leave traditional tech companies for the auto industry, which is still new to this technical space. "The traditional power and talent of the auto industry was based in their product development group," Gary Silberg, the head of KPMG’s automotive unit, previously told Business Insider. "You can't just turn on a dime and say, 'ok, now we are going to go recruit AI geniuses and computer scientists and expect them to come to work with us.'" Six technology companies employ 54% of all deep learning specialists: Google, Microsoft, NVIDIA, IBM, Intel, and Samsung, according to a 2016 report by accounting firm KPMG. The automaker isn't a stranger to recruiting from the outside to make radical changes, Jonas wrote in his note, adding that Alan Mulally came from Boeing before becoming Ford CEO in 2006. As CEO for furniture company Steelcase, Hackett helped transition the company from selling cubicles to designing furniture for an open office plan when the concept was still relatively new.  But transitioning a company with roots in personal car ownership to entirely new mobility platforms is no easy feat. "In many ways, Mr. Hackett's job may be more challenging than Mr. Mulally's," Jonas wrote. A self-driving Ford Fusion.Ford Under Hackett, Ford's Smart Mobility has made relatively small gains. It bought shuttle-van startup Chariot for $65 million, which will eventually integrate with Ford's bike-sharing service GoBike when it launches in 2018. The unit also bought Israeli company SAIPS to advance its machine learning algorithms for self-driving cars. Under Fields, Ford invested $1 billion in startup Argo AI as part of a talent grab for autonomous software experts. But Ford's acquisitions may not be enough to compete with the investments made by rivals General Motors and Fiat Chrysler: GM has invested $500 million in Lyft and acquired Cruise Automation, an autonomous driving startup founded by MIT engineers, for $581 million. Fiat Chrysler is supplying Waymo, the self-driving company born out of Google's parent company, with over 500 Pacifica minivans for Waymo's driverless test fleet and reportedly collaborating on a robot taxi service. Hackett's experience with Silicon Valley so far may very well prove useful to creating new alliances that Ford needs to compete with the Big 3 and Tesla. It will simply depend on how deep those ties run when it comes to recruitment. Get the latest Ford stock price here.

Max Langridge and Elyse Betters23 May 2017Laptops Microsoft Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Microsoft is holding yet another hardware event this year. The company recently held an event in New York City, where it revealed products aimed at the education sector. Those included Windows 10 S, a new operating system that only has access to apps from the Windows Store (which has been done to make sure everything runs quickly), and the Surface Laptop, a laptop that will go head-to-head with Apple's MacBook Air when it launches in June. You can watch Microsoft's 2 May education event here, Surface Laptop and Windows 10 S revealed Microsoft unveils the Surface Laptop, a Windows 10 S device looking to take down the MacBook But education isn't all Microsoft is focusing on this year it seems, as the company has released a teaser to say there will be another event on 23 May in Shanghai to show off what's next for Microsoft. But what exactly is next? Microsoft isn't giving anything away, but we took a few educated guesses as to what the computing giant has up its sleeve. Here's what you need to know. Microsoft Surface event in Shanghai: When is it? MicrosoftEvent will hold its event in Shanghai, China on 23 May beginning at 4 am PST (7 am EST/ 12 pm GMT). The company said you can follow along with updates on its blog here. Microsoft Surface event in Shanghai: What to expect VentureBeat Surface Pro 5 Microsoft's VP of Devices, Panos Panay, tweeted a teaser from his account that included the hashtag #Surface. Panay credits himself as being the creator of the Surface series of devices, so it would be fair to assume there will be another new Surface device on the way. Considering we've just been given the Surface Laptop, it's unlikely to be another computer, but could instead be the Surface Pro 5 2-in-1. Although Microsoft firmly denied that there was a Surface Pro 5 in the works, it looks a new Surface Pro is indeed coming, thanks to a new leak. We know what you're thinking: this looks a lot like the current Surface Pro 4 that launched in 2015. Physically, the update doesn't look any different to the existing model, but Venture Beat said will simply be called the Surface Pro - losing the number. That makes sense if you're from the Apple School of thought (think MacBook Pro), and it's better than calling it the Pro 4S or Pro 4.5 or something. Reportedly the changes will be under the skin, with Intel's seventh-generation chips used and presumably some other hardware changes. VentureBeat said that the pen and keyboard to accompany the Surface Pro will be available in a range of colours, too. There will more than likely be several different variations of the Surface Pro 5 available when it does launch, with different processor speeds and storage. As for price, we can't be sure, but the starting price will be somewhere between £700 and £1000. Microsoft Surface Pro Type Covers Microsoft is teasing new products ahead of its Surface event. The company is expected to launch a new Surface Pro device in Shanghai on 23 May, so naturally, a day before the event, Microsoft's Surface chief has taken to Instagram to publish a teaser. Panos Panay posted an image of what appears to be four Surface keyboards with the following caption: "Working session. 30 hours to go." These keyboards essentially look like Type Covers in new colours. They also appear to be wrapped in alcantara, the same fabric also used on Microsoft’s new Surface Laptop. Surface Phone Talks of a Surface Phone have been on and off in recent months and years. At one point there were strong rumours to suggest Microsoft would channel its Surface laptop 2-in-1 technology into a powerful phone. But since then the company has sold off its phone patents, implying it won't be working on a phone itself. But we've then seen images of a possible Surface Phone, although some media outlets thought it was a Windows Phone made by Dell. We haven't heard much more on the subject since those images surfaced. However, Alcatel manufactures Microsoft branded phones, and Alcatel is headquartered in Shanghai, the same city where Microsoft's event is taking place. It could therefore be possible that we'll either see a new Microsoft phone unveiled, or at the very least get an update on the current state of play. Of course, until Microsoft officially reveal whatever it's planning on 23 May, we can only speculate. We'll be sure to bring you the very latest news and product announcements as and when we hear them.

It patches through texts and calls directly to our wrists. It tracks daily motion and automatically prompts us to keep active throughout the day. No wearable has simpler navigation, and it integrates that famous ease of use into each of its fitness functions as well. Want to go for a run? Just say “Hey, Siri, let’s run,” and once you’re on the trail you get verbal pace, distance, and elapsed-time updates. When you’re finished, the watch will keep track of your daily, weekly, and monthly mileage goals. Like its predecessor, the Series 2 is more welcoming than other watches when it comes to third-party fitness apps like Strava and MapMyRun. And those revamped good looks are indicative of a larger trend in wearables: shedding all that teched-out styling for something you’re not embarrassed to wear on a date. After all, nobody wants to broadcast “Look at me—I run!” even if that’s exactly what you’d rather be doing, every chance you get. Buy Now Garmin Fenix 5S   Photo: Courtesy Garmin Garmin Fenix 5S ($599) Best For: Superb on-wrist heart-rate monitoring. The Test: The svelte 5S is one of Garmin’s smallest, most sophisticated models yet. It delivers up to nine days of battery life (or 14 hours of continuous GPS tracking), and its fitness diagnostics are superb. After a run, we synced our workout to the Garmin Connect app and manipulated overlay charts that showed, for instance, average steps per minute against pace to see if our form fell apart as we increased speed. There are also interval modes and custom alerts for pace and distance. On-wrist heart-rate capture was among the best in our test, matching the Suunto Spartan Sport. The only bummer: Garmin doesn’t allow onboard music storage. The Verdict: A long-lifed wearable with fitness chops. Buy Now Samsung’s Gear S3 Frontier   Photo: Courtesy Samsung Samsung Gear S3 Frontier ($350) Best For: Samsung devotees. The Test: Too many timepieces that combine altimeter, barometer, and compass (ABC) functions feel like they’re stuck in 1999. Samsung’s Gear S3 Frontier, on the other hand, is wholly 2017, with analog ABC sensors that work together with Wi-Fi and a built-in SIM card to triangulate your precise location. Thanks to that SIM, the watch also lets you send an SOS beacon to friends and family. Three days of battery life make it a great weekend-escape watch, too. Did we mention it may have the most versatile pay-from-your-wrist system on earth? So you can leave not only your phone at home but also your wallet. The interface—a slick rotating bezel—is clever and easy to use. We especially love that Samsung’s proprietary S Health app automatically logs various workout activities. Plus, you can run other fitness apps, including Under Armour Record and MapMyRun. The Verdict: ABC watches, welcome to the 21st century. Buy Now LG Watch Sport   Photo: Courtesy LG LG Watch Sport ($349) Best For: Dialed user-friendliness. The Test: Android wearables came out of the gate a bit clunky—physically big, with illogical, cumbersome interfaces. However, the new LG Watch Sport is one of the first timepieces to get Android Wear 2.0, streamlining things considerably. The watch has its own SIM, so you can listen to Spotify and make calls sans phone. Like the Samsung, navigation is smooth: rotate the watch crown to scroll through menus rather than tapping and swiping the screen, which can be a real problem with sweaty fingers in the middle of a jog. Android lets you download fitness apps (Runtastic, Strava, Seven, and more) directly to the watch. All told, though, we wish it had a slightly slimmer design. The Verdict: The best Android Wear watch on the market.  Buy Now New Balance RunIQ   Photo: Courtesy New Balance New Balance RunIQ ($299) Best For: Fleet-of-foot Android fans. The Test: Strava fanatics, this is your watch. Sure, it runs Android Wear 2.0, but Strava comes preloaded and fully integrated; simply tap the upper-right button to fire it up. Plus, Strava boasts a few features just for the RunIQ that you won’t see on other Android or iOS watches, like footfall ­cadence, accurate speed metrics, and easy-to-use lap mode. The RunIQ’s five-hour battery life (with GPS running) doesn’t even match the half-as-costly Polar, but it’s fully waterproof down to 50 meters—good news for tri­athletes. And New Balance—with R&D by Intel—includes highly accurate heart-rate monitoring that held up impressively well during high-intensity intervals. Also, this puppy stores up to 50 hours of music. The Verdict: A dedicated running watch with stealth wearable capability. Buy Now Suunto Spartan Sport Wrist HR   Photo: Courtesy Suunto Suunto Spartan Sport Wrist HR ($499) Best For: Going hard. The Test: The name may be a mouthful, but the watch is impressive—12 hours of battery in GPS mode, water-resistant to 100 meters, and 80 different preloaded sport modes, including trail running, open-­water swimming, and adventure racing. It has an easy-to-read touchscreen, but the physical buttons on the side were clutch when our hands got sweaty. On-wrist heart-rate accuracy was matched only by the Garmin, and GPS was top-notch. Workouts get logged in Suunto’s MovesCount app and desktop program, and you can use the latter to download nearby routes and preplanned training calendars. The Verdict: A multisport workhorse. Buy Now Polar M200   Photo: Courtesy Polar Polar M200 ($150) Best For: Giving you gobs and gobs of data. The Test: The M200 is ­light­weight and comfortable, and despite its price, it tracks a ridiculous number of sports, including badminton, disc golf, and literally a hundred more. Using it couldn’t be easier, with just two buttons and an intuitive operating system. Like most wearables, the M200 has GPS and accurate on-wrist heart rate, and your workout data syncs to your phone via the Polar Flow app. The M200 also works with Android’s Google Fit and can populate Apple’s Health Kit. However, its six hours of GPS battery life left us hanging on all-day epics. The Verdict: Looking to track your handball stats? There’s a watch for that.  Buy Now By: Michael Frank The Best Women's Gym Gear of 2017 Quality gear to make you feel like a million bucks no matter how hard you’re pushing it.  CEP Dynamic+ Run Ultralight Low socks.   Photo: CEP CEP Dynamic+ Run Ultralight Low Socks ($20) Some compression socks feel as tight as tourniquets.

The company is expected to launch a new Surface Pro device in Shanghai on 23 May, so naturally, a day before the event, Microsoft's Surface chief has taken to Instagram to publish a teaser. Panos Panay posted an image of what appears to be four Surface keyboards with the following caption: "Working session. 30 hours to go." These keyboards essentially look like Type Covers in new colours. They also appear to be wrapped in alcantara, the same fabric also used on Microsoft’s new Surface Laptop. Keep in mind this teaser comes a week after a leak revealed a Surface Pro 5 is coming. It looks a lot like the current Surface Pro 4 that was launched in 2015. Reportedly, the changes will be under the skin, with Intel's seventh-generation chips used and presumably other hardware changes.

(AMD) Stock Risks a Nasty Breakdown Dow Jones Finishes Strong as Trump Fears Recede View All Posts U.S. equities drifted higher in drama-free trading on Monday, a blissful calm after last week’s volatility. Political headlines slowed as President Trump continues his first foreign trip moving from Saudi Arabia to Israel today. Several appearances by Federal Reserve officials broke no news ahead of the release of the latest meeting minutes later this week. And traders looked ahead to the possible extension of OPEC’s supply freeze agreement at an upcoming policy meeting. In the end, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4%, the S&P 500 gained 0.5%, the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.8% and the Russell 2000 added 0.7%. Treasury bonds were unchanged, the dollar was down against the euro, gold added 0.6% as silver surged and oil gained 0.9% to hit a one-month high. The gain in silver boosted the ProShares Ultra Silver ETF (NYSEARCA:AGQ) to a 3.6% gain for the day for Edge subscribers. Breadth was positive, with 2.2 advancers for every declining issue on light volume, with just 792 million shares on the NYSE totaling 88% of the 30-day average. Technology stocks led the way with a 1% gain while energy was the laggard, down 0.2% despite the gain in crude. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) gained 2.1% on the announcement CEO Mark Fields would retire amid frustration with the company’s stalled stock price and a loss of momentum in areas like electric vehicles and autonomous technology. Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) gained 2.8% on an upgrade from JPMorgan on the closure of the NXPI acquisition. And Oclaro, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCLR) gained 10.2% on a positive Jefferies note following China Mobile’s selection of ZTE (representing about 10% of the company’s business) for buildout of its packet network. On the downside, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) fell 3.3% — reversing a recent rebound rally — after Citigroup cast doubt on recent reports the company could get a licensing agreement from Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) for certain graphics processor technologies. Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) fell 2.2% on cardiovascular risks for its Evenity treatment for osteoporosis. Turning back to OPEC, the oil sheiks will meet in Vienna on May 25. The consensus is for a nine-month extension to the supply cap that’s been in place in the first half of the year aimed at normalizing the global oversupply situation. There has also been chatter of a potentially deeper level of output cuts. The risk, of course, is that OPEC is merely sacrificing hard won market share gains earned during the post-2014 price war against U.S. shale producers; as wildcatters have eagerly increased U.S. drilling rig counts in response to the OPEC-driven energy price recovery that started in early 2016. Outside of OPEC, watch for the release of the latest Fed meeting minutes on Wednesday for insight into the timing and pacing of additional interest rate hikes through the end of the year. Wall Street is braced for another hike in June; but the rest of the year is murky with less than a 50% chance of a second hike before 2018.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Computers HP finally made the MacBook Air we’ve all been waiting for Chris Mills @chrisfmills May 22nd, 2017 at 6:30 PM Share Tweet Last fall, Apple confirmed that it’s sending the MacBook Air to the server farm upstate. Although it still sells the Air, the form factor hasn’t been updated since 2013, and the screen is equally antique. Apple suggests the non-Touch Bar MacBook Pro as the entry-level laptop for people who want a fully-featured laptop, but $1,500 is one hell of an entry-level price. So, it falls to other companies to fill the void that Apple’s left. Some of the premium Chromebooks are fantastic options for half the price of a MacBook Air, but Chrome OS is still lacking in features for some users. Luckily, HP has a new laptop you might want to take a look at. Don't Miss: Leaked tests show OnePlus 5 is much more powerful than Galaxy S8 and Google Pixel At an event today, HP announced a bunch of new premium Windows laptops. There’s three different sizes, but the one I’m most interested in is the smallest, the Envy 13. It’s a 13.3-inch laptop with 1080p or 4K display, all-metal body, Core i3, i5 and i7 processors, and four USB ports of various kinds. There’s also an option to equip discrete Nvidia graphics of some kind. The best thing is the price: $1,049 for the base option. If that comes with Intel’s latest Core i3 processor and 8GB of RAM, it’s a decently low price for a great-looking laptop. HP’s build and battery life has been stellar on the laptop range for the last few years; now that details like USB-C ports and thin bezels are being added, it means HP’s starting to challenge Microsoft and Apple in the premium laptop world. The Envy 13 should also fill the niche that the MacBook Air left behind quite neatly. It has enough power to handle any reasonable everyday computing task, (theoretically) a long enough battery to last a day, and a premium thin-and-light design that is easy enough to carry around. We’ll have to wait and see if the details like a good keyboard are also good, but things are looking promising. The entire new lineup of laptops goes on sale in June.

Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the top Democrat of the House Oversight panel, released a letter Monday signed by all of the committee’s 18 Democrats, backing a request by Office of Government Ethics director Walter Shaub to review and publicly disclose any ethics waivers the administration may have granted to allow former lobbyists to work in the administration. In a letter sent to Shaub last week, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney asked Shaub to hold off on his request and questioned whether Shaub has legal authority to seek the information. Late Monday, Shaub issued a scathing, 10-page response and refused to back down. He called Mulvaney's request "highly unusual" and said he expects agencies to comply with his call to provide information on ethics waivers by June 1. "Public confidence in the integrity of government decisionmaking demands no less," Shaub wrote. Ethics groups and some congressional Democrats have expressed alarm at reports that dozens of ex-lobbyists and others with ties to Wall Street and energy companies have found jobs in the Trump administration. Trump signed ethics rules earlier this year that barred any lawyers and lobbyists joining the administration from working on matters that involved their former clients. But Trump, unlike President Barack Obama, made no commitment to disclose whether his administration is granting any waivers to that provision or other parts of his ethics order. Mulvaney’s letter, first reported by The New York Times, “appears to be an effort by the White House to prevent oversight and enforcement of their own policy,” said Fred Wertheimer, president of the Democracy 21 watchdog group.  “They want to hide how many lobbyists they are hiring.” Shaub, an Obama appointee whose five-year term expires next year, has clashed repeatedly with the White House. Even before Trump took office, Shaub publicly criticized him for failing to relinquish his ownership of his real-estate and licensing businesses. Read more: Ethics chief: Conway likely broke rules with 'go buy Ivanka's stuff' remarks Top government ethics official denounces Trump's business plans Earlier this year, Shaub urged the White House to discipline Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway for violating federal rules by endorsing first daughter Ivanka Trump’s clothing line during a televised interview from the White House briefing room. The White House Counsel’s Office rebuffed that recommendation, saying Conway had acted “inadvertently.” FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn The Trump presidency: A new era in Washington  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

Here’s what to watch for: Who will be the biggest winners and losers? The budget outline Trump released in March would dramatically reduce the federal government’s involvement in many domestic areas while boosting investments in national security. That proposal included increasing defense spending by $54 billion and paying for that with steep cuts to education, environmental protection, health and human services, and foreign aid. Those proposed cuts were to the parts of the budget lawmakers must approve annually in agency spending bills. But the fuller budget request that will be released Tuesday is expected to include changes to a much larger area of spending: benefit programs that would require Congress to make changes in the law. These include provisions such as who is eligible to receive benefits. The Associated Press and others have reported the administration will propose cuts to Medicaid, welfare benefits like food stamps, federal employee pensions and farm subsidies. In addition to the defense spending increases proposed earlier, the budget is expected to include funding for a border wall with Mexico, infrastructure spending and paid leave for parents of a newborn or newly adopted child, according to the Associated Press. Will Trump keep his campaign promise not to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid? Trump pledged not to cut the major entitlement programs of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, the largest drivers of federal spending. That promise has already been broken with Trump’s backing of the House health care bill, which would cut Medicaid by more than $800 billion over 10 years. Much of those cuts were directed at people who had become newly eligible for the health program for the poor under the Affordable Care Act. But most Medicaid spending benefits the elderly and disabled, and the administration could propose additional cuts beyond what’s in the health care bill. The cuts to other safety-net programs, such as food stamps, could also be large. The Associated Press reported food stamp funding could be cut more than 25% over 10 years through changing who is eligible and imposing additional work requirements. Is the administration’s projected economic growth realistic? The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects the economy will grow less than 2% a year over the next decade under current policies. White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney has said the administration wants to reach 3% levels of growth. While that’s the historic average, experts say 3% growth will be difficult to achieve because of a slowdown in the growth of labor, capital and productivity. The main reason for that is the aging population — which is also driving the projected increases in spending for Social Security and Medicare. Why does this matter? If the administration is counting on 3% annual growth, that could lead to overly optimistic levels of how much revenue the government will collect to keep the deficit from growing and to pay for Republicans’ hoped-for tax cuts. Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney participates in a photo-op to review the production run of the FY2018 budget in the Government Publishing Office on May 19, 2017.  (Photo: Jim Lo Scalzo, European Pressphoto Agency) Will there be more details on Trump’s tax overhaul proposals? The tax overhaul outline Trump released in April proposed big corporate rate cuts, a simpler tax code and big increases in standard deductions. But the one-page plan included few details on how those changes would be made — or paid for. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the federal government would collect $3 trillion to $7 trillion less in taxes over the next budget if Trump’s changes are made. The administration could propose ending some tax benefits in exchange for creating others. But such proposals won’t be credible unless they’re specific. “We all know that closing tax expenditures is hard and controversial,” said Robert Greenstein, president of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Is it realistic to expect Trump to balance the budget?  Unlike the president’s earlier budget outline, Tuesday’s more detailed plan will project revenue changes over the next decade. Hardline conservatives have been pushing for a balanced budget, and Mulvaney has said he wants to get there in 10 years. But even he acknowledged that’s difficult. Deficits are projected to more than double over the next decade. Experts, such as those at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, say they will be on the lookout for “gimmicks” that would make a path to a balanced budget look easier than it is. Those include: overly optimistic projections of economic growth, unspecified savings and unrealistic proposals. How will Capitol Hill react? Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has already denounced the Medicaid cuts reported to be included in the budget. “This budget is taking the fast lane to rejection by the American people and both parties in Congress,” the New York Democrat said in a statement Sunday. And it’s not just Democrats who have spoken out. Rep. Mike Conaway, the Texas Republican who heads the House Agriculture committee, told the Associated Press the expected proposed cuts to farm programs are “wrongheaded.” But Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said it would be a mistake to dismiss Trump’s budget as dead on arrival. He expects the budget blueprint the House will draw up after Memorial Day will feature similar contours of broad tax cuts, spending reductions in domestic programs and increases for defense.

We’re on the verge of a massive technology shift from the internal combustion engine, which … This current automotive landscape is a tricky one for automakers. We’re on the verge of a massive technology shift from the internal combustion engine, which every automaker has been using for over 100 years, to electric motors. While the change will be relatively drastic, and has been ongoing for some time, car companies are now starting to significantly increase their efforts in electric mobility and autonomous driving. According to BMW, the Bavarian brand plans on being the world leader in electric and autonomous tech, a goal it wants more than being the sales leader. BMW recently had its sales crown stripped from it by Mercedes-Benz. However, BMW CEO Harald Kruger claims that sales figures aren’t as important to BMW as leading the industry in technology. Its success will come from being the best and most technologically-advanced brand on the market, rather than what the numbers on a sales sheet say. Kruger acknowledges, though, that BMW will need some help in this endeavor and cannot do it on it’s own. “We are not the best in making radars and vision controls, so we work with Mobileye,” he said. “We do not make chips, so we cooperate with Intel. We have just taken on board Delphi to cooperate on software and system knowledge.” So with all of these brands’ expertise, it’s certainly possible that BMW could lead the industry in advanced mobility tech quite soon. But don’t just think that BMW is going to be transforming from a luxury car company into a boring tech company. “We are in the premium business. We sell design and emotion, not just a way of getting from point A to B,” said Kruger. He also went on to say that there will never be a BMW that doesn’t allow the driver to take over. Many enthusiasts are afraid that when autonomous cars come, BMWs will become little transportation pods, rather than the Ultimate Driving Machine they remember. “You will never see a robo-taxi from BMW,” Kruger said, stating that BMWs will always have the option for the driver to drive. Although, that isn’t slowing BMW’s efforts into the world of autonomy. BMW is planning on the iNext 2021, a Level 4 autonomy-capable car that will begin production in, you guessed it, 2021. But it isn’t just electric and autonomous vehicles that Bavarian brand is investing in. The brand wants to continue to invest into diesel technology, as it claims the new European emissions restrictions can’t be met without diesels.  “You need to invest in clean diesels, and Euro 6 engines are clean diesels,” said Kruger. We know that the automotive landscape is changing and we know that BMW will have to change with it. Adapt or die, right? But it’s nice to know that the Bavarians won’t abandon their principles in the name of autonomy or electrification. BMWs will always drive like BMWs, even when electrons finally take over.

Music News Entertainment Politics Features Share < br />this article: Chris Christie: ‘I wouldn’t let General Flynn into the White House’ In News by Maggie Serota / May 22, 2017 Share < br />this article: Follow @maggieserota On Monday, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie went to bat for former FBI Director Jim Comey and tossed his fellow Trump transition team member Gen. Michael Flynn under the bus. Some of the noteworthy soundbites include Christie refuting Trump’s claim that the ousted FBI director is a “real nut job.” “I would disagree with the characterization of Jim as a ‘nut job,’” Christie, a former U.S. Attorney told reporters at a press conference held in the state capitol. “I’ve known Jim for a long time. I don’t always agree with him, as I’ve told you guys before, but, no, that wouldn’t be the way I would characterize Jim.” Christie also took the opportunity to voice a public “told ya so” at the president when he discussed his reservations about appointing Gen. Michael Flynn as national security adviser. It turns out that President Obama wasn’t the only person to warn Trump not to appoint the unhinged Islamaphobe with shady ties to Russia to a cabinet position, especially one that traffics in highly sensitive information. “I will just say this to you: If I was president of the United States, I wouldn’t let General Flynn in the White House,” Christie, a failed 2016 GOP presidential candidate, said, “let alone give him a job.” Christie’s comments come in the wake of the report that Flynn will invoke 5th Amendment protection in declining to testify in front of the Senate Intel committee in the Russia probe. Christie makes it clear that there is no love lost between himself and Flynn. “I think it’s safe to say that General Flynn and I didn’t see eye to eye,” Christie said. “I didn’t think he was someone who would bring benefit to the president or to the administration. And I made that very clear to candidate Trump and I made it very clear to President-elect Trump. That was my opinion, my view. Do I feel vindicated? I don’t have any need to feel vindicated one way or the other.” Sorry, dude, you do not get to look like a hero at any point in this mess.

Today, Dell Technologies is one of the biggest hardware and software technology companies in the world with estimated annual revenues in the $60 billion range, putting it neck and neck with Huawei for the title of world’s biggest private tech company. This has truly been an amazing journey for a company founded in 1984 on a $1,000 investment to sell IBM PC clones out of a dormitory room. Despite more than two decades of incredible success built around cost-effective manufacturing, rapid product introduction, industry best supply chain management and a direct to consumer business model, recently the company had struggled to maintain relevance and to avoid commoditization of its hardware- centric business model. In 2013, Michael Dell started taking a set of actions that amount to one of the biggest gambles ever taken in the world of technology; let’s look at what he did, why, and how it might play out going forward. 2013: Dell is taken private through a private equity funded leveraged buyout; at $24 billion it goes down in history as the largest technology buyout ever. 2016: Dell completes the $67 billion acquisition of EMC Corp, the largest technology merger in history bringing EMC, VMware, RSA, Pivotal, SecureWorks and Virtustream all under the Dell Technologies’ umbrella. So why on earth did Michael Dell and team take on an eye-watering, terrifying mountain of debt to transform and enlarge his company, when others have the reverse strategy? The answer I believe has all to do with the rapid change being experienced in the enterprise data center, which has historically been a major profit center for infrastructure equipment and software vendors. Several things are changing: Public Cloud (IaaS and SaaS) Growth Public cloud (and the SaaS services hosted therein) continues to grow at a rapid rate and is literally eating the enterprise data center, which some are predicting is doomed. Virtualization and ‘Software Defined’ Technology has evolved rapidly to the point that complex, critical functionality traditionally embedded in specialized storage, networking and security products is now offered as virtualized software running in and on the hypervisor of a server. Commoditization of Hardware Hardware system innovation has been at a standstill for years with every vendor having access to the same reference designs from Intel, Broadcom and others. As such, margins for systems have collapsed to commodity levels. Dell’s Success Case: ‘Apple’ The success case for Dell is that it manages to stabilize the shift to cloud such that the world’s compute and storage remains evenly split between the public cloud and on-premise within enterprise. They establish a walled garden, integrated stack, including networking, storage, compute, virtualization and security, within enterprise, capturing 99 percent global profit share from a much lower market share (as Apple has done in smartphones). It is worth noting that despite years of competition from Microsoft’s System Center and from OpenStack (R.I.P – enough said), VMware still commands 90-plus percent profit share in virtualization and orchestration. In this scenario, all competitors exit the data center market and Dell enjoys a monopoly in perpetuity within the enterprise becoming the world’s most valuable company. Dell’s Failure Case: ‘Just Bananas’ The failure case involves endless migration to the public cloud to the point that the enterprise data center ceases to exist. Without the enterprise market, the global profit pool for vendors shrinks by an order of magnitude even though global compute and storage continue to increase. This is due to the scale effects and buying power of the small number of public cloud providers, combined with their penchant and abilities to engineer their own solutions if and when a commercial option becomes too expensive. In short, shops like AWS, Azure and GCE are the worst types of customer for an infrastructure or software vendor. The resulting business for Dell is at such thin margins that they cannot fund any research and development and cannot create enough cash from operations to pay the interest on their debt. They go bankrupt. It will be fascinating to see how this all plays out over the next several years; it is very hard to predict the outcome, but one thing is for sure: The recent Dell moves will either go down in history as the bravest, wisest, most profitable move ever taken in tech, or they will go down as the most foolish, reckless, irresponsible, cash burning, company-destroying moves ever.

Flynn lobbied for the Turkish government and was paid about half a million dollars to do so. The deal was inked just before President Trump tapped him to be his National Security Advisor. Flynn also had security clearance during this time. He’s also been accused of misleading Vice President Mike Pence and other White House staff about a conversation he had with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak concerning Washington’s sanctions against Moscow, which ultimately forced President Trump to request Flynn’s resignation. Pixabay Anti-Logic: FBI Blind to DNC Servers Before Accusing Russia of Cyberattack In March, Flynn retroactively registered the Flynn Intel Group, his now-defunct consulting firm, as required by the Foreign Agents Registration Act, for work on behalf of a firm owned by a Turkish national with links to Turkish institutions. The Fifth Amendment was included in the Bill of Rights to guard citizens from being required to serve as witnesses in cases where a person is also the subject of a criminal case. Flynn previously sought immunity in exchange for testifying, a point that led critics to wonder what Flynn had to hide.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars TECH Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable MORE Entertainment Science Health Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars Tech   Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable More   Entertainment Science Health Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search The HP Spectre x2 wants to solve your Surface Pro frustrations Chris Davies - May 22, 2017 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Microsoft has left the Surface Pro to languish, unloved, and HP isn’t going to let an opportunity like that pass it by. Welcome, then, the HP Spectre X2, the latest in the laptop company’s range of touchscreen 2-in-1s. With the body of a tablet – and a 12.3-inch, 3,000 x 2,000 resolution one at that – and the flexibility of a magnetically-attached keyboard, HP is hoping you’ll forget all about your Surface Pro dreams. At first glance, it might just do that. The Spectre X2 certainly looks the part, with a CNC-machined aluminum chassis finished in dark ash silver; the pop-out kickstand is made of stainless steel, but given a striking copper finish that really pops. It’ll stand the tablet up at any angle between flat and 165-degrees. The keyboard, meanwhile, is full-sized, has backlit keys, and a glass trackpad. As with previous Spectre detachables, it uses magnets to cling in place. Atop the touchscreen there’s a 5-megapixel wide-angle camera and an infrared camera, which can be used for Windows Hello, and dual digital microphones. A 13-megapixel camera is on the back, and HP throws a digital stylus in the box. The speakers are tuned by Bang & Olufsen. It’s inside where things get really interesting, mind. HP has thrown in up to Intel’s 7th-generation Core i7-7560U processor, paired with up to 8GB of LPDDR3 memory. There’s a 360GB PCIe SSD for storage, and Intel Iris Plus Graphics 650. The 41.58 Wh li-ion battery, HP claims, should last for up to 8 hours of mixed use, or 7 hours and 15 minutes of solid video playback. More usefully, thanks to HP Fast Charge, it’ll go from flat to 50-percent in half an hour. It’s worth noting that you can’t actually be using it during that time if you want to see such speed, and beyond the half-battery point it’ll go back to the regular charging rate. Connectivity includes 802.11ac and Bluetooth 4.2. There are two USB 3.1 Type-C ports for up to 5Gb/s data, DisplayPort 1.2, charging the Spectre X2, and using HP’s Sleep and Charge to power up connected peripherals even when the 2-in-1 itself is turned off. HP includes a USB-C to USB Type-A adapter for older device you might have; it’s a small touch, but it’s something Apple neglects to do with the latest MacBook Pro. Otherwise, there’s a headphone/microphone combo port and a microSD slot. The whole thing weighs in at 2.49 pounds. In short, if you can’t wait for Microsoft to get around to upgrading the Surface Pro 4, your 2-in-1 dreams aren’t dashed. The HP Spectre x2 will go up for sale in June, priced from $999.99.

Photo: Wikimedia Commons. Israel’s economy minister wants to boost the Jewish state’s exports to the US over fivefold by the end of this decade. In a statement issued as President Donald Trump began his official visit to Israel, Eli Cohen said that “one of our main goals is to increase Israeli exports to the US to more than $100 billion by 2020.” In 2016, trade of goods between the US and Israel reached $27 billion — $17.6 billion of which consisted of Israeli exports to America. Trade of goods constitutes some 50 percent of economic activity between the two countries. Trading in services constitutes 19 percent, and investments make up the additional 31 percent, according to statistics from Israel’s Ministry of Economy and Industry.

The defense sector is also a major growth area, comprising 14 percent of Israel’s annual exports. A number of Israeli companies in the technology and security sectors saw their stocks rise sharply in the wake of Trump’s election, as markets anticipated growing trade with the US.

 Microsoft wants to store data in DNA Antonio Regalado, MIT Technology Review May 22, 2017, 12:19 PM 1,206 facebook linkedin twitter email print Dragan Radovanovic/Business Insider Based on early research involving the storage of movies and documents in DNA, Microsoft is developing an apparatus that uses biology to replace tape drives, researchers at the company say. Computer architects at Microsoft Research say the company has formalized a goal of having an operational storage system based on DNA working inside a data center toward the end of this decade. The aim is a “proto-commercial system in three years storing some amount of data on DNA in one of our data centers, for at least a boutique application,” says Doug Carmean, a partner architect at Microsoft Research. He describes the eventual device as the size of a large, 1970s-era Xerox copier. Internally, Microsoft harbors the even more ambitious goal of replacing tape drives, a common format used for archiving information. “We hope to get it branded as ‘Your Storage with DNA,’” says Carmean. The plans signal how seriously some tech companies are taking the seemingly strange idea of saving videos, photos, or valuable documents in the same molecule our genes are made of. The reason, says Victor Zhirnov, chief scientist of the Semiconductor Research Corporation, is that efforts to shrink computer memory are hitting physical limits, but DNA can store data at incredible densities. Formatted in DNA, every movie ever made would fit inside a volume smaller than a sugar cube.  “DNA is the densest known storage medium in the universe, just based on the laws of physics. That is the reason why people are looking into this,” says Zhirnov. “And the problem we are solving is the exponential growth of stored information.”  Last July, Microsoft publicly announced it had stored 200 megabytes of data in DNA strands, including a music video, setting a record. The work, described in a paper published in March on the pre-print server Biorxiv, has been led by Carmean and Karin Strauss, both of Microsoft Research, and the University of Washington laboratory of computer scientist Luis Ceze. Major obstacles to a practical storage system remain. Converting digital bits into DNA code (made up of chains of nucleotides labeled A, G, C, and T) remains laborious and expensive because of the chemical process used to manufacture DNA strands. In its demonstration project, Microsoft used 13,448,372 unique pieces of DNA. Experts say buying that much material on the open market would cost $800,000. “The main issue with DNA storage is the cost,” says Yaniv Erlich, a professor at Columbia University who earlier this year reported a novel approach to DNA data storage. “So the main question is whether Microsoft solved this problem.” The main issue with DNA storage is the cost, so the main question is whether Microsoft solved this problem. Based on their publication, Erlich says, “I did not see any progress towards this goal, but maybe they have something in their pipeline.” According to Microsoft, the cost of DNA storage needs to fall by a factor of 10,000 before it becomes widely adopted. While many experts say that’s unlikely, Microsoft believes such advances could occur if the computer industry demands them. Automating the process of writing digital data into DNA will also be critical. Based on the several weeks it took to carry out their experiment, Carmean estimates that the rate of moving data into DNA was only 400 bytes per second. Microsoft says that needs to increase to 100 megabytes per second. Reading the data out is easier. That was done using a high-speed sequencing machine, including to recall specific parts of the files, analogous to random-access memory on a computer. Even a two-fold improvement in DNA reading would make that aspect of the system efficient enough for commercial use, Microsoft thinks.    Because writing and retrieving data into DNA is slow, any early use of the technology will be restricted to special situations. That could include data that needs to be archived for legal or regulatory reasons, such as police body-cam video or medical records. Microsoft currently works with Twist Bioscience, a DNA manufacturer located in San Francisco. Twist is one of a number of newly formed companies trying to improve DNA production, a list that now includes startups DNAScript, Nuclera Nucleics, Evonetix, Molecular Assemblies, Catalog DNA, Helixworks, and a spin-off of Oxford Nanopore called Genome Foundry. One exciting possibility being pursued by some of the startups is to replace the 40-year-old chemical process used to make DNA with one that employs enzymes, as our own bodies do. Jean Bolot, scientific director of Technicolor Research, in Los Altos, says it is funding such work at Harvard University, in the laboratory of George Church, the genomics expert. “I am confident we will have results to talk about this year,” says Bolot, who adds that his company has been in discussions with movie studios about how they might employ DNA storage. He says half of all films made before 1951 are already lost because they were stored on celluloid. Now new formats, like high-definition video and virtual reality, are stretching studios’ ability to preserve their work, he says. Zhirnov says computer chip makers are taking DNA seriously because there are physical limits to how much data can be stored in conventional media, like tapes or hard drives. His organization, which is funded by Microsoft, Intel, and others to perform applied research, began taking a closer look at DNA starting in 2013. He says semiconductor experts who believed DNA was too “soft” were surprised to learn that it lasts a hundred to a thousand times longer than a silicon device. The molecule is so stable that it is frequently recovered from mammoth bones and ancient human remains. But its most important feature is density. DNA can hold 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 (aka a quintillion) bytes of information in a cubic millimeter. “Density is driving everything,” says Zhirnov. A spokesperson for Microsoft Research said the company could not confirm “specifics on a product plan” at this time. Inside the company, the DNA storage idea is apparently gaining adherents but is not yet universally accepted. “Our internal people believe us, but not the tape storage people,” says Carmean, formerly a top chip designer at Intel.   In addition to being dense and durable, DNA has a further advantage that’s not often mentioned—its extreme relevance to the human species. Think of those old floppy disks you can’t read anymore or clay tablets with indecipherable hieroglyphs. Unlike such media, DNA probably won’t ever go out of style. “We’ll always be reading DNA as long as we are human,” says Carmean. Get the latest Microsoft stock price here.
