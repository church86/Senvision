He has been covering Microsoft since 2009 back when this site was called WMExperts (and later Windows Phone Central). His interests include Windows, Surface, HoloLens, Xbox, and future computing visions. Follow him on Twitter: @daniel_rubino. Despite past history, Microsoft's Windows 10 on ARM is vastly different than Windows RT. Here are the main differences. Microsoft and Qualcomm are moving forward with their Windows 10 on ARM initiative, which is expected to debut publicly in late in 2017 with new devices from HP, ASUS, and Lenovo. Taking Windows 10 from the Intel processors to the ones found in high-end smartphones is one of the biggest, most substantial jumps in modern computing history, because it opens the floodgates to new always-connected consumer experiences. One area of confusion that I want to put to rest is that somehow Windows 10 on ARM will be crippled, à la Windows RT, which was riddled with unfortunate complications. That is not the case. Windows 10 on ARM is just Windows 10 Part of the problem Microsoft is facing — at least amongst enthusiasts — is the misunderstanding around the varieties of Windows in 2017. At least for consumers there are a lot of configurations (or stock-keeping units [SKUs]), including: Windows 10 Home — The normal, run of the mill Windows 10 that lacks the advanced networking and management features found in Windows 10 Pro. Windows 10 Home users can at any time upgrade to Windows 10 Pro through the Store for a $99 fee. Windows 10 S — Mostly an education version that limits installation of apps to the Windows Store. However, it will also be featured on the new Surface Laptop. Like Windows 10 Home, it can be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro for free through 2017 and for $49 after that. Windows 10 Pro — Geared towards those who need remote desktop management and some other non-essential consumer features, Pro comes with many high-end laptops and PCs, including the Surface Pro, Surface Book, and Surface Studio. Any versions of an OS can be confusing, but so far, these variants of Windows 10 are cut and dry with only a few minor differences. They can all run proper Win32 desktop applications and act like full Windows. Only Windows 10 S has some limits. Windows 10 on ARM is not Windows RT Where things seemingly get messy is with architecture, which refers to the underlying hardware required to run Windows 10. Since its inception, Windows has run on Intel x86 (32-bit) and more recently x64 (64-bit) Intel and AMD processors. These are the familiar Intel Core, Pentium, and Atom processors that are sold in consumer desktops, laptops, and tablets. Windows 10 on ARM is nothing like Windows RT. In 2012, Microsoft put a version of Windows onto an ARM processor, specifically a 1.3GHz Nvidia Tegra 3 with the Surface RT. The problem there as many remember was that version could not run proper Win32 desktop applications. It looked like full Windows, but it was limited to the Windows Marketplace, which itself was nascent at the time. This limitation and the radical UI shift of Windows 8 doomed Windows RT to a niche category before fading from the market altogether. Here we are again in 2017 with Microsoft putting Windows on ARM. Same thing as RT, right? Far from it. Here is why Windows 10 on ARM is very different than RT. Windows 10 on ARM is SKU agnostic — Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) can put Windows 10 Home, Windows 10 S, or Windows 10 Pro for ARM onto any device. Just like PCs and laptops today this decision will come down to target markets (consumer versus education) and desired price points (Home is cheaper than Pro to license). Windows 10 on ARM can run Win32 applications — Windows RT could only run a subset of proper Win32 applications like Microsoft Office, and users could not install anything else. Due to Microsoft's new emulation layer (which is a bit mysterious at this point), Windows 10 on ARM should run any application whether it is from the Windows Store or user-installed via .exe files. Windows 10 on ARM is upgradable to new SKUs — Just like today, if you buy a Windows 10 on ARM device with Windows 10 Home you should be able to upgrade to Pro. The same applies to Windows 10 S editions that can be upgraded to Pro to install non-Windows Store applications. From this perspective, Windows 10 on ARM is nothing like Windows RT. What you can say is that Microsoft seemingly learned its lessons from Windows RT and fixed all of that for version 2.0. It's approaching the problem differently this time while retaining the benefits of using an ARM hardware architecture — better battery life, instant-on capability, and 4G LTE Advanced cellular connectivity. The 'cellular PC' revolution begins: full Windows 10 and desktop apps are coming to mobile ARM chips The most important takeaway here is that Windows 10 on ARM does not mean it's Windows 10 S. One is the hardware architecture, the other is an OS SKU, but they are not bound to each other. In fact, Microsoft and Qualcomm have demonstrated Windows 10 on ARM using mostly Windows 10 Pro so far. Why this probably doesn't matter to you After reading this, you may be throwing up your hands exclaiming it's all too complicated. Indeed, once you break it down by OS SKUs and hardware architectures, it is messy. None of this even accounts for Windows 10 Mobile (itself ARM 32 but there are internal ARM 64 builds too). To the consumer, though, none of these intricacies matter. Here's why. Emulation layer and structure of Windows 10 on ARM. When your average person walks into a Best Buy or a Microsoft Store, they will simply see Windows devices. Some will be thin and less powerful with 4G connectivity (new "cellular PCs") while others will be bigger but much more powerful like a Dell XPS 15 (9560) running a quad-core Core i7 with 32GB of RAM and a 1TB of storage. Windows 10 S Review The hardware architecture — x86, x64, or ARM — won't be a visible factor. All these devices have Windows 10 and can run Win32 applications. Differences will be found in price points, size, form factor, performance, and 4G connectivity — the same hardware variants we've seen for years now. This observation gets back to Microsoft's long-term goal for Windows: make the underlying hardware architecture invisible to the end-user but deliver the same Windows experience. That was not the case with Windows RT, but it is the case with Windows 10 on ARM. Microsoft's long-term goal for Windows: make the underlying hardware architecture invisible to the end-user. Reading Microsoft's roadmap, it should be clear the same will happen with Windows 10 Mobile as that gets folded into proper Windows 10. The key to making that happen is still down the road with CShell and Project Andromeda, which is needed to shift the UI to different experiences. For instance, imagine having a proper Game Mode on your Razer Blade gaming laptop that shows an Xbox One UI instead of Windows 10. Questions remain ... None of this is to say that Windows 10 on ARM is a slam dunk. Big questions remain regarding performance. Initial reports coming out of Computex claim the experience of running Windows 10 on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 feels like running the OS on a Compute Stick. Presumably, that puts the Snapdragon 835 around an Atom or Core-m3 level of performance, which is impressive but still far from a proper dual-core Core i7 or even quad-core experience. Other questions remain about how well the Win32 emulation runs legacy applications and if it lives up to expectations. Battery life, standby times, software bugs and integration with modern hardware will also be up for review. Those are all legitimate concerns. But there's a lot to be optimistic about. I think the next few years we will see Qualcomm's ARM architecture make steady advances in power and performance. The Snapdragon 835 gets the foot in the door to be comparable to x64 Intel chips but is still behind in some ways. And it should be leaps and bounds better than a 2011-era Nvidia Tegra 3. Qualcomm is already reportedly gearing up for Snapdragon 84x for the end of 2017 or early 2018 — again, another octa-core 10nm variant — which will push the category further. Combined with Microsoft's continued streamlining of Windows 10 and the Universal Windows Platform (UWP), the user experience should be excellent. Running UWP apps even on an anemic Intel Atom chip is still a better experience than running old Win32 applications, which are slow and sluggish by comparison. Microsoft's future for computing erases the underlying hardware from the equation. Windows 10 on ARM is just another example of an OS spreading – in theory, unhindered – to new systems, resulting in never-before-seen devices. The only thing consumers need to worry about is what PC and experience they want and can afford. In other words, leave the nitty-gritty details to Microsoft and just be productive.

LG G6 launched with SD820 because SD835 was (a) so new (b) scooped up by Samsung. 6 11 hours ago Reply Deaconclgi Dan, thanks for reminding me that the LG G6 has a Snapdragon 820. My wife bought me an Alcatel Idol 4s with Windows today (For Father's day, arrives tomorrow...too bad same day delivery doesn't exist everywhere :) ) and even though that SD 820 is the most powerful chipset in a Windows 10 Mobile phone, techy Android users would make it seem like it is woefully outdated but in the context of the LG G6, a 2017 Android flagship coming with the 820, I don't feel so bad about. Sure, I would have rather the G6 had an 835 but it is what it is. Plus, paying under $301.74 with next day shipping for an unlocked, premium build, powerful phone with the OS I prefer that can push pixels like my Galaxy S7 Edge and the 2017 LG G6, makes me smile. Thanks for the great article and for the great work that you do for Windows Central!   0 8 hours ago Reply Daniel Rubino Cheers! Yeah, I use the OnePlus 3T - SD821 - and LG G6 and both are fine with that processor. In fact, most reviews about GS8 don't say much about SD835 as being a big jump for Android.

Thing is we really have no idea what HP, Lenvo, ASUS, or even Microsoft (you can bet there will be a Surface device) are planning to release. Sure, laptop-like devices and 2in1s have been bantered about but even Qualcomm demo'd this on a 6-inch phone-like device at Computex, so it may be too early to say what is coming. A phone-phone is out initially, but this stuff really starts to blur. 1 10 hours ago Reply Mr. MacPhisto And the lines are already beginning to blur a bit.  T-Mobile just took Digits out of Beta and it appears they will support the esim found in these devices, so they could build a Digits app for UWP just as they have for iOS and Android.   So what is a phone?  With VoLTE and things like Digits, the reality is an ultra mobile PC can be a phone - and different OEMs can have different takes. The positive is that these devices will be free from the carriers preventing updates while Android phones still languish.  Maybe it won't be a market changer, but there's a good chance that Microsoft fans can have a Windows 10 device they can use to make phone calls, that will have LTE connectivity, and will update regularly. I expect MS will launch something that blurs all those lines in the form of some kind of Surface that will not be branded as a phone, but will be an ultra portable or mobile PC.  Then HP, Lenovo, Dell, and whoever else can follow suit with ARM based esim devices - and we'll also see plenty of Intel based cell connected machines too. 1 10 hours ago Reply bub78 Yes, every fanboy on this site is expecting this magical device to launch.  Maybe it will at some point. As Rubino has said many times, the Surface team doesn't release a device until it's ready.  It took them 2 years to design & release a thin & light laptop...  Also, not only is this device supposed to be revolutionary, but will also seemingly disrupt the status quo of what phones are and the trillion dollar plus market cap of the mobile carriers and OEMS... Or, you know, maybe W10 on ARM will  just be limited to chromebook clones & cheap tablets for the forseeable future. -3 9 hours ago Reply Mr. MacPhisto I think a bunch of "magical" devices will launch that blur the lines.  I have no doubt that Dell, HP, and Lenovo would like to expand their footprint a bit.   The mobile carrier status quo has already been disrupted quite a bit in the US.  T-Mobile has shaken things up and now some form of unlimited data package is pretty standard.  T-Mobile is also very happy to let you bring your own device on their network. unlocked.  If anyone will be willing to embrace the idea of the e-sim and devices they don't control as much, it's Legere.  I think Android actually puts the carriers in a bad place in many ways because of the fragmentation and liability issues.  In fact, I've been told this by a high level mobile exec.  There is the controlling aspect, but the carriers are often left to deal with the problems Android represents and so they have a one size fits all policy towards anything not an iPhone.  A bad iOS update falls squarely on Apple, not the carrier.  Android is murkier.   We already know AT&T and T-Mobile will support these devices.  Sprint and Verizon are not onboard yet and that's not shock concerning Verizon.   Windows 10 on ARM will never be about being a Chromebook clone because it can do more.  It IS Windows.   And the OEMs are always looking to expand their market.  As I said, HP, Dell, Asus, Acer, etc would all love to find any way to make gains and if they can do it at the expense of the phone market, so be it.  The PC OEM most threatened by this is Samsung, but they are a much smaller presence in the PC market.  Lenovo and HP have a lot of manufacturing power they can leverage and the designs from most of the PC makers have been innovative and stunning of late. I expect Microsoft to make a more expensive halo device - the hero.  But I think the OEMs will find ways to deliver new form factors to expand their markets while providing them at a competitive price. The Snapdragon 835s are much cheaper than Intel Core i series and from all I've seen, they can provide performance on par with a Core i3 at least - and maybe match an i5 - and do it at 1/3 of the price.   This will make for thinner and lighter 2-in-1s and it will allow for some very real pocketPCs.   2 9 hours ago Reply dkediger I keep coming back around to the Courier concept, perhaps with a small pairable/dockable handset for the "phone" stuff. 0 9 hours ago Reply Withheld They probably won't limit themselves to just calling them phone but there are hundreds of OEM's around the world producing very inexpensive Windows 6, 7 & 8” tablets and now that Microsoft is releasing its OS for ARM, most must be considering replacing Intel’s Atom processors with Qualcomm’s faster, smaller, inexpensive, feature rich processor that has better battery life. It’s safe to say, most OEM’s won’t disable the 835’s integrated hardware and see the advantages over Chrome when to selling Windows all-in-one devices to budget minder consumers. 0 8 hours ago Reply Gunbust3r This is all just fluff talk until someone shows me Win 10 on ARM running faster than the moderatly painfull experience of Win 10 on Atom. -3 10 hours ago Reply Daniel Rubino I should have written a section talking about performance...oh wait, I did. Even if it is like Atom - and it could be - ARM will only get faster and better as it drops below 10nm manufacturing process. It's inevitable. 6 10 hours ago Reply terence chan Faster processor means nothing if the hypervisor is written poorly. The fact that Windows 10 on ARM runs on an emulator cause application performance greatly dependent on how the hypervisor translate the X86 application to the ARM instruction set. So, in the end, it very much dependent on how MS decide to update or design the hypervisor running the emulation. 3 10 hours ago Reply Mr. MacPhisto Hypervisor has nothing to do with this.  That is all about running VMs and the emulation is not VM based.  The emulation layer is essentially a translator for apps designed to make calls to x86.  It calls to pre-generated binaries to translate the DLLs etc for ARM use and does it on the fly.  In real world application, it doesn't take a lot of time to do this. Apple did something similar with their 68k emulator that existed at a low level in the OS allowing for old Mac programs to work on PowerPC designs.  Rosetta is somewhat similar, expect it was less deeply integrated and more prone to compatibility issues because it was user level.   I expect it will be pretty seamless and I'll be interested to see benchmarking against modern i3 and i5 machines.  I suspect it may run on par with many mobile i5s, especially because the GPU is likely superior to the Intel integrated, even now.  At 10nm and with the ability to execute out of order instructions, there are some advantages. 3 9 hours ago Reply Cruncher04 Intel x86 emulation does not use a hypervisor in any form or shape. 0 4 hours ago Reply Dav2070 As you use the term "Windows 10 on ARM" it sounds like it is another SKU that is different from the other Windows versions.

However, it is sad that it's necessary that this is written thanks to how Microsoft has handled customers in the past. 0 9 hours ago Reply SydneyTechHead My guess is that W10 on ARM will be somilar to RT to the extent that the OS will be compiled to run on ARM natively (so is optimised for performance and battery life) and emulation will be limited to old Win 32 and Centennial apps which were compiled to run on x86. New UWP apps will also work natively via ARM-compiled .NET libraries etc. 2 8 hours ago Reply atulk malhotra Everything that I throw at it will work like Windows of the old.

When you say, "Windows has run on Intel x86 (32-bit) and more recently x64 (64-bit) Intel and AMD processors," you are forgetting that Windows (and DOS before it) were actually multi-platform. You could also run on DEC Alpha processers, on IBM PowerPC proccessors and on Motorolla 6800 and 68000 series processors, in addition to, originally, 16-bit Intel Architecture processors then 32-bit then 64-bit and the variations and capabilities of each of the generations. My point is that MS has always been rather platform agnostic. They have run their software on different processor architectures, and they write the code in such a way that it can take advantage of much of each processor's native capabilities. So, adding supporting a new processor, namely Qualcomm now, is nothing at all revolutionary; it is mostly a matter of writing only the low-level routines and telephony. 0 7 hours ago Reply midnightfrolic I think of it as regular Windows 10 on lightweight hardware.

You can follow him over on Twitter at @RichEdmonds. MSI should be proud of what it has done with the Trident 3, packing powerful hardware into a compact form factor that really works. It's one thing to build a full tower PC capable of some serious gaming. It's a whole different one cramming in various high-end parts into a compact case with sufficient cooling. MSI is no beginner when it comes to powerful mini PCs, and the Trident 3 is the best one yet. Why do we like this stunning PC so much? Keep reading. See at Amazon Atomic power Here are the tech specs for the Trident 3 configuration MSI sent to Windows Central for review: Category Specification Processor Intel Core i7-7700 8MB cache, 3.6GHz (4.2GHz boost) Storage 256GB M.2 solid state drive (SSD), 1TB hard disk drive (HDD) Memory 16GB DDR4 (2,400MHz) Graphics Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 (8GB GDDR5) Intel HD Graphics 630 Motherboard MSI mini-ITX with H110 chipset Software Windows 10 Networking Intel Wireless-AC 3165 (802.11ac) Bluetooth 4.2 Rear ports One USB 3.1 Four USB 2.0 Four HDMI (1 VR-link) Two DisplayPort One DVI EthernetMicrophone port Front ports One HDMI 1.4 (VR-link) Two USB 3.1 One USB 3.1 Type-C One Microphone port One Headphone port Power 330W power brick Weight 6.9 lbs Dimensions 13.63 inches x 9.15 inches x 2.83 inches It's worth noting that this is the most expensive configuration, and while it will set you back $1,499, it guarantees a stellar experience. Performance readings and our findings on how the PC handles games and other tasks should not be taken literally if you're considering more affordable models of the Trident 3. All-in-all, regardless of which Trident 3 you happen to choose, it's a powerful platform. Interestingly, the Trident 3 isn't seen by MSI as a competitor to gaming PCs that sit on a desk. Instead, the company has its eyes firmly set on consoles and living room solutions such as the Nvidia Shield and Steam Link. First off, this thing is small. Like, really small. It's almost the same size as the Xbox One but packs way more power for handling even more demanding titles. As you can see from the above specifications table, we have not only an Intel Core i7 processor (and that's seventh-gen Intel, too) but a Nvidia GTX 1070. This Trident 3 PC is incredibly compact, powerful enough for latest games on high settings, and it can even handle some VR content. The 16GB DDR4 RAM (clocked at 2,400MHz) makes it possible to boot up a bunch of browser tabs, engage in multi-task productivity and even run a Mixer stream from the same machine. More than a black slate Thankfully, MSI hasn't gone overboard with the design of the Trident 3, which gaming companies tend to do when it comes to components and other computing equipment. As highlighted already, the size and weight of the PC itself almost match that of the Xbox One. Instead of a mere black box that can only sit horizontally, MSI opted for a more sleek profile and some aggressive angles. There's also a bundled stand to allow for upright orientation. Much like the design of the Trident 3, the lighting also steers clear of being too ostentatious, resulting in a subtle but attractive-looking effect on the front corner of the case. It's impressive to look at, not only for the looks but also to analyze just how the company has managed to pack in a full desktop processor and GPU with enough cooling to avoid thermal throttling. Opening up the Trident 3 reveals another bonus of this small factor PC — you can upgrade most components, except for the processor. Running a full release of Windows 10, the Trident 3 offers a more diverse experience with scalability, something the Xbox One and other consoles cannot match. One thing to note is the external power supply, which makes it difficult to overclock the system and add even more powerful components. Everything else is top notch, including the massive array of ports available on both the front and rear of the unit. For connectivity, we have a massive array of ports, both on the front and rear of the case. On the front, MSI uses a single HDMI 1.4 pass through for VR, which hooks up to the GPU on the rear. There are two USB 3.1 ports and a single USB 3.1 Type-C port. Microphone and headphone jacks complete the package. For the rear, there is a total of four USB 2.0 ports, one USB 3.1, and two HDMI (one for onboard output, a second for the VR link on the front). The GPU included offers a further two HDMI, two DisplayPorts, and a single DVI port. Hooking up a number of peripherals and monitors will not be an issue. And the single HDMI port for the onboard Intel graphics processor is disabled when a dedicated card is present. 'G' for gaming Under load, the CPU gets really hot. Even though the chip itself (Intel Core i7-7700) only has a TDP rating of 65W, how everything is set up inside the case means you'll be seeing temperature readings of beyond 176 degrees F (80 degrees C). We managed to hit 86 degrees C at the highest point while stress testing before thermal throttling kicked in and pulled temperatures under 80 degrees C. Even still, that's a high reading. Taking apart the Trident 3 to see just what MSI used to cool the onboard Core i7, you see a simple blower fan that draws from air circulating from within the case. This presents the issue of there not being enough airflow within the case to adequately keep the CPU cool, especially when the GPU fan isn't running. Thus the company opted for a locked CPU, and we highly recommend against increasing thermal output inside the case. When under load, the CPU fan kicks in, but even when the processor heats way up, it's difficult to tell fan noise apart from the ambiance. This is ideal for the living room where a jumbo jet-sounding PC would not be welcome. Fan behavior can be manipulated in the UEFI manager, but we were unable to manipulate the fan directly with software controls — some of our suites of choice didn't even recognize a CPU fan. The RAM and the GPU are extremely easy to access and replace. The GTX 1070 inside the Trident 3 is a full desktop card, making it possible to achieve good results in various 3D benchmark suites, as well as stable performance in demanding titles. We tried out some Player Unknown's Battlegrounds, DOOM, Stellaris, GTA V, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and The Witcher 3 without issue. Again, as noted above, the main concern was heat, which appeared to have a slight effect on the main processor. And when we ran a few tests, deploying both the CPU and GPU together, we saw temperatures touch 89 degrees C, which is somewhat concerning. I was pleasantly surprised by the performance of the Trident 3. Taking into account the Core i7 processor and GTX 1070, I still had expectations that certain demanding titles would prove too much for the PC at high settings (1440p resolution, for example), but MSI went all out to ensure it really can be deployed as a serious gaming machine. MSI Trident 3 PC review conclusion: Pack away that console I'm a big fan of small form factor PCs that offer great levels of customization and performance. MSI has done wonders here, installing high-end components and allowing owners to upgrade storage and RAM or swap out the GPU for a more powerful option. As for heat, it does indeed get hot and the CPU turns into a stove ready for some oil and tonight's dinner, but it shouldn't damage the processor, and thermal throttling was rather light. The Trident 3 model we had in for review, which features the Core i7 Intel processor and GTX 1070 GPU, would set you back $1,499. Is the price worth it? We think so, but that depends on your needs and budget. To be fair, the pricing for the Trident 3 is competitive with similar products from other OEMs. Overall, we're big fans of this PC and think you will be too. Pros Beautiful design. Up to Intel Core i7 and GTX 1070. Upgradable. VR-ready. Cons 330W power brick. Gets really hot. No room for overclocking.

Digital Trends Dell Inspiron 13 7000 2-in-1 (2016) review Dell's latest Inspiron 2-in-1 performs great for the price, with one hiccup Share Dell’s Inspiron 13 7000 is a sturdy, fast, and affordable 2-in-1. Dell’s Inspiron 13 7000 is a sturdy, fast, and affordable 2-in-1. Dell’s Inspiron 13 7000 is a sturdy, fast, and affordable 2-in-1. Highs Sturdy, but light Handsome, inoffensive style Great hardware for the price point Offers USB-C connectivity at low price Lows Too large and heavy for serious tablet use Display suffers poor color quality DT Editors' Rating 7.0 Scores Explained Home > Product Reviews > Laptop Reviews > Dell Inspiron 13 7000 2-in-1 (2016) review By Justin Pot Posted on 06.02.17 Research Center: Dell Inspiron 13 7000 2-in-1 (2016) Updated 5-25-17 by Jayce Wagner: This model is no longer offered by Dell, but the latest Inspiron 13 2-in-1 features nearly identical pricing and specs, and features 7th-generation Intel Core i5 processors.  Pity the affordable laptop maker. Sales are down, margins are tighter than ever, and Chromebooks are eating up the bottom end of the market. There’s less money to be made in cheap Windows laptops than ever before. Even the Dell Inspiron line, long known for being affordable and reliable, feels the need to be just a little bit flashy. Which brings us to the Dell Inspiron 13 7000 2-in-1, Dell’s latest attempt to bring some excitement to the Inspiron without driving up prices. It’s a sturdy 2-in-1 that starts at $750 with a Core i5 processor, a 256GB solid state drive, and 8GB of memory. That’s not a bad price point for this kind of power. If you can spend a bit more, $1,080 nets you a Core i7, 512GB of solid state storage, and 12GB of memory. Plus, there’s a touchscreen, and a 360-degree hinge which enables tablet use. On paper, this Dell has a winning bang-for-the-buck breakdown, but are there compromises? And is this device truly useful as a tablet? Sturdy small laptop; big bulky tablet “Designed by Dell” means more than it used to, thanks to the XPS line’s consistently high praise from critics and users. The Inspiron line has never inspired quite the same devotion. The 2015 verison of the Dell Inspiron 13 7000 2-in-1 was a system that looked five years out of date. This year’s model is similar, though not identical, and it feels more robust. This is a sturdy laptop, with no flex to speak on the frame, and just a little bit in the display. At three quarters of an inch thick while closed, and just over three and a half pounds, it’s reasonably thin and lightweight. Like the 2015 model, the 2016 version is built of attractive but generic brushed aluminum, but there is one notable improvement. The keyboard is now inset into the chassis, so a separate panel of material doesn’t surround it. This makes the new Inspiron 13 7000 2-in-1 look sleeker and feel more durable. Greg Mombert/Digital Trends Greg Mombert/Digital Trends Greg Mombert/Digital Trends Greg Mombert/Digital Trends While we liked the 2-in-1’s overall design, there was one detail that bugged us. The power button. It’s on the side of the device, near the front edge, which can be problematic. It’s far too easy to accidentally turn off this laptop while picking it up. Unless you want to use it as a tablet. The wraparound hinge is sturdy and reliable, and holds steady in pretty much any position. But three and a half pounds, while not heavy for a laptop, is quite the load for a tablet. Holding this 2-in-1 with one hand, and swiping with the other, will leave you with a sore arm. You might occasionally use this 2-in-1 as a tablet on a table, or while resting on your knee, but we suspect most users won’t bother to do so very often. It’s a neat supplemental feature, but not a replacement for the portability and comfort offered by an actual tablet. The Dell Inspiron 13 7000 is a 2-in-1, but it’s a laptop first and foremost. If you don’t like that, detachable designs like the Samsung TabPro S and Microsoft Surface Book are worth looking into – though they have their own compromises. Beautiful and comfortable keyboard The keyboard on the Dell Inspiron 13 7000 2-in-1 looks great, with black keys that stand out nicely on their aluminum backdrop. The keys, while perhaps a touch small, are well spaced, with plenty of room in between. And there’s a satisfying amount of feedback with every keystroke, meaning it’s never unclear if you’ve hit a key or not. The keys are backlit, and toggled between off, bright, and brighter in a single keystroke. Nothing about this laptop’s design stands out, for better or worse. The touchpad is perhaps smaller than it should be, at two and a half inches tall and four inches wide. But there’s plenty of room to work with, and support for multi-touch gestures. Traditionalists will be happy to see clearly defined right and left click regions. The texture isn’t perfect, but isn’t bad either. There’s also the giant touch screen. The glass feels smooth, and input is accurate. It’s so satisfying you might find yourself reaching over the keyboard to scroll from time to time, if only because the scrolling on your touchpad isn’t working. Connect them all The Dell Inspiron 13 7000 2-in-1 offers two standard USB ports — one USB 3.0, another USB 2.0. There’s also a USB Type-C port, giving the laptop a degree of future proofing. Finally, there’s an SD card port. Greg Mombert/Digital Trends A full HDMI port lets you connect external displays, or your TV, and a headphone jack lets you connect external speakers or a microphone. An Intel dual band wireless AC-3165 card provides 802.11 ac wireless connectivity and Bluetooth 4.1 compatibility. Less than vibrant colors The 13.3-inch display is behind a single piece of glass extending to cover most of the bezel. With a resolution of 1080p, the Dell Inspiron 13 7000 2-in-1 offers 166 pixels per inch. That isn’t impressive in this day and age, but also isn’t bad. Users should have plenty of room to work with (things can feel a bit crowded out-of-the-box — for some reason, Dell cranked up the default scaling setting in Windows 10.) The display puts out 215 lumens of light, which is fairly bright but not exceptional. Using this laptop outside, even on a cloudy day, is a bit of a strain, and the glossy screen makes things worse. The contrast ratio, at maximum brightness, is 640:1, which is not terrible but worse than any of the devices we’re comparing to it. Even the Acer Aspire S13 edges out the Inspiron, with an 800:1 ratio. Users won’t have trouble reading text, but shadows in videos and games might be a bit of a problem. Display gamut is a weak point, as this Dell can handle only 48 percent of the AdobeRGB spectrum. That’s awful — similar laptops average around 70 percent of the gamut. This means the range of colors offered isn’t great, something you can notice while checking out National Geographic’s photos of the day series — the stunning vistas just seemed to be missing something. On the other hand, the average color difference is 1.84, which is pretty good. Colors are clearly defined. There’s just not enough of them. Dell Inspiron 13 7000 2-in-1 (2016) Compared To HP Spectre x360 15-bl075nr Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 Acer Spin 7 HP Spectre x360 13-w023dx Samsung Notebook 7 spin Dell Inspiron 17 7000 2-in-1 (2016) Acer Switch Alpha 12 Huawei Matebook Vaio Z Flip Toshiba Satellite Radius 12… Dell XPS 15 Dell Inspiron 11 (2015) Dell Inspiron 13 7000 Special… Toshiba Satellite Click 2 Pro HP Spectre 13t x2 The gamut problems make everything you watch on this display feel somewhat dour and depressing. Watching the trailer for Swiss Army Man, the colors felt muted, particularly the forest greens and ocean blues. Scenes that should be beautiful feel just a little bit off. Overall, the display is a real weak point of the Dell Inspiron 13 7000. The speakers aren’t much better. There’s a muddy quality to the entire range, with treble and mid tones somewhat hard to distinguish. Things get a little better if you set the laptop on a solid surface, because the speakers are on the bottom of the device and rebound off what’s beneath. But even in ideal conditions you can’t expect this 2-in-1 to rock out. Performs really well for the price Our test laptop came with a 6th-generation Core i5 processor and 8GB of memory. With this kind of power, users shouldn’t expect many hiccups in day-to-day usage, or even moderately taxing usage. Our GeekBench test results confirm this. With a single core score of 3174, and a multi-core score of 6475, this laptop performs similarly to other i5 devices, including the Acer Aspire S13. It even keeps up with considerably more expensive devices, such as the Microsoft Surface Book with Core i5 processor. These benchmarks show respectable processing power for a $750 device. With this kind of power, day-to-day computing like browsing and writing never felt slow. And even more intensive tasks were relatively quick, if not up to par with anything equipped with a Core i7. Our Handbrake video encoding test, where we transcode a 420MB .mp4 file, took just over a half hour. That’s perfectly respectable, and suggests this laptop can handle a little bit of video encoding without much trouble. Respectable solid state speeds Our review unit came with a Sandisk Z7400s m.2 hard drive with 256GB of storage space. That’s a generous amount of solid state storage for an affordable laptop, but how is the performance? Around average, if a little on the slow side, our tests revealed. Running a CrystalDiskMark sequential test, we saw a read speed of 475 megabytes per second and a write speed of 310.7MBps. The read speed is in line with most similar devices, though the Surface Book does quite a bit better. The write score is about 100MBps slower than the competition, which is unfortunate but not dire. Our HDTune test showed a read speed of 316MBps, which is in line with these results. While the performance isn’t great, the capacity deserves another mention. Our review unit – the $750 base model – has a 256GB solid state drive. That puts it on par with Asus Zenbook UX305UA, and way ahead of most competitors. Not everyone even bothers to offer a solid state drive at this price, and most alternatives have a 128GB drive. Runs games at low settings The Inspiron 13 7000 uses integrated graphics, specifically Intel’s HD Graphics 520. No one should expect a great gaming experience, given these specs, and our benchmarks confirmed this. The Fire Strike score of 878 and the Sky Diver score of 3,657 suggest a little bit of graphics capability, but not much. To test this further, we fired up some games at a low resolution, 1,366 by 768. Heroes of the Storm, at the lowest settings, gave us a framerate of 58 frames per second, which is just slighty below the 60FPS generally considered ideal for steady gameplay. Things got worse at high settings, with an average of 20FPS. Counter Strike: Global Offensive was similar. At low settings we saw a perfectly playable framerate of 73FPS, but high settings brought us down to 21FPS. You can get some games running on this laptop, but don’t expect a good experience unless you’re willing to turn down both the resolution and the graphics quality. Battery lasts for five hours of browsing At 3/4 of an inch thick, and 3.6 pounds, this is not a bulky laptop. You will not have trouble fitting this in your backpack or messenger bag, and while you’ll notice that you’re carrying something, it won’t weigh you down too much. The display’s colors look muted and dour, particularly forest greens and ocean blues. But if you bring it with you, will the battery hold up? The Dell Inspiron 13 7000 2-in-1 comes with a three-cell lithium ion battery that has 41 watt-hours of capacity. Our Peacekeeper battery test, where we run benchmarks until the system shuts down, gave us four hours and four minutes of battery life. That’s decent, though some similar laptops do better. The Acer Aspire S 13, for comparison, lasts four hours and 46 minutes. The Zenbook UX305CA lasts six hours and 17 minutes. Our less intensive browsing loop, which rotates a variety of sites to simulate basic web browsing, gave us five hours and two minutes of battery life. And our video loop, where an HD video is played, gave us six hours and 30 minutes. These are usable results, but not spectacular. Not too warm, but audible fan The Dell Inspiron 13 7000 2-in-1 didn’t get too warm while we ran benchmarks. The highest surface temperature we recorded on the surface was 93 degrees, which is warm to the touch but not uncomfortable. You can use this 2-in-1 on your lap without the heat becoming much of an issue. Greg Mombert/Digital Trends The fan also isn’t too loud, although it is audible. We couldn’t detect with over the ambient sound in our test room, but could make it out with our ears. It’s not likely to overwhelm movies or music. Standard one-year warranty The Dell Inspiron 13 7000 2-in-1 comes with a one year limited hardware warranty. If you need any repairs, you’ll need to mail the laptop to Dell. Paying $70 extra gives you on-site service for that year. For $220, you can extend that to four years of on-site coverage, though that is likely overkill for most people. A decent compromise, but make sure it’s what you want The DT Accessory Pack Logitech M510 wireless mouse $23.89 WD 1TB Black My Passport external hard drive $59 AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI cable $6.49 PNY Elite Performance 64 GB High Speed flash card $23 The Dell Inspiron 13 7000 2-in-1 is a good value. Its build is solid, its battery life is acceptable, and its performance is pretty good for the price. If not for the display’s color problems, we’d recommend it. As is, we can’t quite go that far. So we suggest you shop around. Toshiba’s Satellite Fusion line offers an i7 reversible with 8GB of RAM and a 256 SSD for $750. If you’re willing to ditch the SSD, Lenovo’s Flex 3 gives you a terabyte of conventional storage with an i7 processor and 8GB of memory. And if you’re just looking for a mid-range computer, ditching the touchscreen could get you a better laptop for the same price. The Asus Zenbook UX305UA, for example, offers a superior display and build quality for around the same price to spec ratio. If you have $750 or more to spend, the Dell Inspiron 13 7000 is worth considering as a starting point. Just keep the display’s problems in mind before making a decision.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jun 2, 2017 at 1:30PM On May 30, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced its new Skylake-X processor family aimed at high-end desktop personal computers. At the very top of the product stack is a chip known as the Core i9-7980XE. This chip, based on what we know about it, is quite a beast. It packs 18 server-grade processor cores as well as 44 PCI Express lanes, among other goodies. Additionally, Intel is pricing the chip at $1999. Image source: Intel. About $1,999 for a consumer-grade computer processor is certainly expensive, but it's worth noting that the value proposition of this new chip should be substantially better than that of the company's previous high-end desktop flagship chip, the Core i7-6950X. The 6950X had only 10 cores and 40 PCI Express lanes for around $1,700 at launch, and it managed to sell better than Intel had expected it to. The success of the 6950X in the marketplace makes me hopeful that the 7980XE (which is arguably a much better product than the 6950X was, relatively speaking) will do well in the market, too. It's worth noting, though, that while some of the basic specifications of the Core i9-7980XE are known (core count, PCI Express lanes, etc.), Intel hasn't yet disclosed the base or turbo boost frequencies at which the chip will run. Although these chips will primarily be sold to users who will run these chips out of specification, the frequencies at which the chip runs out of the box is still an important consideration. Here's where I think Intel needs to peg them on the 7980XE for it to be as compelling as realistically possible. Low base but high Turbo Boost 2.0 speeds Intel typically tells consumers the base frequency of a given chip as well as the maximum Turbo Boost 2.0 frequency at which the chip can run when only one or maybe two cores is being used. Given that there are 18 cores on the 7980XE, it's not realistic to expect that these cores will be able to run at high frequencies when they're being loaded up simultaneously. However, for the 7980XE to work well as a gaming chip in addition to a productivity chip, the chip needs to ramp up to high frequencies when only a few cores are in use (e.g., what most games will be able to use). Intel did a respectable job of this with its 10-core Core i9-7900X; it comes rated at a base frequency of 3.3GHz, but the chip offers a maximum Turbo Boost 2.0 speed of 4.3GHz, which should make it quite good for gaming applications out of the box. What's more is that since any of the 10 cores found on the 7900X can be tapped to run at 4.3GHz when executing a workload that can only use a few cores, every core on the chip needs to have the capability to run at 4.3GHz. This makes it harder for Intel to find "good" chips within a given batch, although for the $999 asking price of that chip, Intel really must do it. For the 7980XE to be cleanly superior to the $999 Core i9-7900X, it should offer a maximum Turbo Boost 2.0 speed of 4.3GHz, meaning that each one of the 18 cores on the chip needs to be able to run at 4.3GHz -- no easy feat. Moreover, the turbo speeds of the chip in 1-10 core operation really needs to match the 1-10 core turbo speeds of the 10-core Core i9-7900X. If Intel can offer that, then the 7980XE won't be a compromise relative to the cheaper models in the product stack and should easily be worth its asking price. If Intel compromises on that to any significant degree, then even enthusiasts who generally demand the best and are willing to pay for it might forgo the Core i9-7980XE in favor of a cheaper model, like the Core i9-7900X. Given Intel's strategy to try to upsell consumers to better, more expensive processors as much as it can, compromising on this would be less than ideal.

The investigation, according to Reuters, will focus on Flynn’s work for Inovo BV, a Dutch shell company operated by Ekim Alptekin, the chairman of the Turkish-U.S. Business Council. It is not clear if Mueller is investigating Flynn’s lobbying work because it relates directly to the Russia probe or as a separate matter. Flynn, a retired lieutenant general, is also under scrutiny because of his contacts with Russia’s ambassador, Sergey Kislyak. In August, while he was advising the Trump campaign, Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group, signed a $600,000 contract with Alptekin, a former U.S. congressional aide. (RELATED: Michael Flynn Is Lobbying On Behalf Of Dutch Firm Tied To Turkish Government) As part of the deal, Flynn agreed to conduct research on Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric living in exile in the U.S. who Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, wants extradited back to Turkey. Ekim Alptekin (Youtube screen grab) The contract also called for Flynn to create a documentary about Gulen and to utilize an “investigative laboratory” of former intelligence community officials to investigate the imam. (RELATED: As Foreign Agent Of Turkey, Flynn Agreed To Form Elite Investigative Team, Make ‘Criminal Referrals’) The contract also called for Flynn Intel to potentially make “criminal referrals” based on its investigation.

Mueller, a former FBI director who was appointed last month to oversee the Russia probe, has some history with one member of Flynn’s investigative team. As FBI director, Mueller appointed Brian McCauley to serve as associate deputy director of the FBI division overseeing human intelligence operations. McCauley was paid $28,000 by Flynn Intel for consulting work on the Inovo BV contract. Flynn Intel disclosed its involvement with Inovo BV to Congress in September under the Lobbying Disclosure Act. But the filing included few details of the arrangement, and Inovo BV’s ties to the Turkish government were not made apparent until several days after Flynn published an op-ed in The Hill on Nov. 8, Election Day, calling on the U.S. to extradite Gulen. The Daily Caller found that Flynn had signed a lobbying deal with Inovo BV and then discovered Alptekin’s involvement through business documents filed in the Netherlands. Flynn disclosed details of the work for Inovo BV on March 7, in a retroactive filing under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. In the filings, Flynn revealed that he and Alptekin met on Sept. 19 with two Turkish government ministers, including Erdogan’s son-in-law, Berat Albayrak. McCauley, the former FBI official, also reportedly attended the meeting. Former CIA director James Woolsey, an unpaid adviser to Flynn Intel who also attended the session, has since said that the issue of an extrajudicial extradition of Gulen was discussed that day. Flynn, through his attorney, has disputed Woolsey’s claim. Former FBI Director Robert Mueller, August 1, 2013. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst It is not entirely clear why Mueller’s investigation is turning toward Flynn’s work for the Turkish government. A federal grand jury in Virginia has already issued subpoenas for Flynn’s business associates involved in the lobbying effort, several news outlets have reported. According to Reuters, the subpoena “seeks bank records, documents and communications related to Flynn, his company, Flynn Intel Group, Alptekin and Inovo.” Flynn’s decision in March to file retroactively under FARA puzzled many at the time, but is now clear that the Justice Department compelled the former Army general to register under the law, which has more stringent disclosure requirements than the Lobbying Disclosure Act. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that the Justice Department began looking into Flynn’s lobbying work after a staffer read the Nov. 8 op-ed. The unnamed staffer then reached out to Flynn, according to The Journal. TheDC has recently obtained Justice Department documents through the Freedom of Information Act showing internal discussions about Flynn that helps fill in a few gaps about the Justice Department’s inquiry. On Nov. 29, Mary McCord, then the head of the Justice Department’s national security division, sent an email to two associates entitled “question on Lt. Gen. Flynn complaint.” McCord, who left the Justice Department earlier this year, referred to a “complaint/letter” that had been sent to the agency regarding Flynn. The email includes few details about the complaint or about the fledgling Flynn probe, though the recipients of the correspondence may shed light on how the Justice Department has handled the investigation. McCord sent the email to Adam Hickey and Bradley Weinsheimer. Hickey serves as deputy assistant attorney general for national asset protection, a role which oversees the national security division’s cyber security and economic espionage investigations. Weinsheimer is director of risk management at the national security division. The National Security Division reached out to Flynn and his a day after that email was sent, other DOJ documents reveal. “In light of that editorial and reports in the media about potential ties between Lt. Gen. Flynn and others who might be acting on behalf of the government of Turkey, on Nov. 30, [DOJ’s National Security Division] requested additional information from Lt. Gen. Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc.,” reads a Jan. 27 spreadsheet sent to then-Acting Attorney General Sally Yates. (RELATED: Here’s What Prompted Michael Flynn To Register As An Agent Of Turkey) The spreadsheet, which contained a list of high-profile Justice Department issues, noted Flynn’s Nov. 8 op-ed at The Hill which “expressed views that were critical of the Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen similar to those previously expressed by the president of Turkey and other Turkish officials.” Follow Chuck on Twitter Tags: Donald Trump, Michael Flynn, Robert Mueller, Turkey Hide Comments   Show comments Free News Alerts Privacy: We never share your email Sections Politics US Opinion Entertainment World Business Sports Tech Featured Partners Columns Ann Coulter Ask Matt Labash Matt Lewis The Mirror DC Trawler Ginni Thomas Corporate About Us Advertise With Us Emails and Notifications Employment Terms Of Use Privacy Policy Contact Us Follow Facebook Twitter Google+ © Copyright 2010 - 2017 | The Daily Caller

But if the $849 price is right, AMD will be charging less than half the cost, at $1150 cheaper. For that cost, you could get the motherboard and a good kit of DDR4 RAM and still have change left over.   Intel's upcoming 16C/32T chip is $1699, which is still massively more expensive than the rumored $849 price on the Ryzen ThreadRipper 16C/32T processor.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 1 Problem for Intel Corporation’s Kaby Lake-X Chips Nice chips, but they'll soon be made obsolete by the next round of Intel updates. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jun 2, 2017 at 11:30AM In addition to announcing its high-end Skylake-X chips for desktop personal computer enthusiasts this week, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) also announced a family of chips known as Kaby Lake-X. The two Kaby Lake-X chips are the Core i7-7740K and the Core i5-7640K. These chips are based on the company's Kaby Lake architecture, and indeed, are based on the same exact silicon that powers the Core i7-7700K and Core i5-7600K, respectively, (codenamed Kaby Lake-S) that launched earlier this year. An Intel Kaby Lake-X chip. The main differences between the Kaby Lake-X chips and the current Kaby Lake-S chips are the following: Kaby Lake-X can work in the same motherboards as the Skylake-X chips, while the Kaby Lake-S can't. The Kaby Lake-X chips come rated at slightly higher speeds out of the box than the Kaby Lake-S chips, and are also rated at higher thermal design power levels (112 watt versus 91 watt). The integrated graphics processor inside of the Kaby Lake-X chips is disabled and can't be used; the one on the Kaby Lake-S chips can be used. The Kaby Lake-X and their corresponding Kaby Lake-S counterparts are otherwise the same, and are even priced identically. Although I understand why Intel offers these chips (I don't believe they're pointless as some others do, but that's a topic for an upcoming column), here's why I don't think these Kaby Lake-X chips will succeed in the marketplace. The Coffee Lake-S "problem" Intel originally planned to release the successor to its Kaby Lake-S processor family, known as Coffee Lake-S, in the first quarter of 2018. However, various credible leaks suggest that the enthusiast/gaming-oriented SKUs of Coffee Lake-S will now launch in August, representing a three-quarter pull-in. Coffee Lake-S promises to bring several compelling improvements over Kaby Lake-S. For one thing, while Kaby Lake-S (and, by extension, Kaby Lake-X) tops out at just four cores, Coffee Lake-S will pack up to six cores. Coffee Lake-S should also be manufactured in a higher-performing 14nm++ manufacturing technology (Kaby Lake-S/X are built using a lower-performing 14nm+ manufacturing technology). On top of all of that, motherboards that support Coffee Lake-S should start at much lower prices than the motherboards that support Kaby Lake-X. So, once Coffee Lake-S is out, if somebody came to me asking whether she or he should build a system using Coffee Lake-S or a system using Kaby Lake-X, it would be an easy decision: I'd tell them to go with Coffee Lake-S without any reservations. Now, obviously this isn't exactly bad for Intel -- an Intel chip being more compelling than another Intel chip, which leads users to purchase an Intel chip, clearly isn't a situation that should bug the company or its stockholders. However, it seems that Intel is determined to make its high-end desktop platform (the one that Kaby Lake-X is a part of) into the platform of choice for gamers and enthusiasts, and having the entry-level chips on the high-end desktop platform become obsolete after just a couple of months isn't conducive to that goal. What Intel can do, then Leaks suggest that Intel is planning a "Coffee Lake-X" chip for its high-end desktop platform at some point in the future. Presumably, this will be like Kaby Lake-X -- that is, the same fundamental silicon that's used in Coffee Lake-S, but reworked to be compatible with the high-end desktop motherboards. If Intel can get this part out in a reasonable time frame (say, for the holiday shopping season), that would go a long way toward keeping the low-end of Intel's high-end desktop platform relevant to gamers and personal computer enthusiasts. But if this chip won't arrive until, say, mid-2018, then that'll simply be too late to be relevant -- just as the Kaby Lake-X chips are. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

By Liam Tung | June 2, 2017 -- 13:27 GMT (06:27 PDT) | Topic: Developer The UP Core can run full Windows 10, Android Marshmallow, and various Linux options. Image: UP UP has launched a crowd-funding campaign for its new developer board, the Intel-powered QuadCore x86 UP Core. The UP Core claims the title as the "smallest quad-core x86 single board computer in the world", and measuring just 56.5mm x 66mm (2.22in x 2.6in), it's about half the size of a smartphone, and a thumb-length shorter than the Raspberry Pi 3. The device can run full Windows 10, Windows IoT Core, Android Marshmallow, and Linux options, including Ubuntu, ubilinux, and Yocto. UP Core runs on a the Intel Atom x5-Z8350 QuadCore, aka Cherry Trail, offering a newer CPU than Intel's own Minnowboard. The UP Core is available in 1GB, 2GB, and 4GB RAM variants. The 1GB with 16GB eMMC storage unit is available for the early-bird price of €69 ($89), while the 2GB RAM and 32GB storage version is available for €85 ($95), again for early birds. If you pledge €129 ($145) or more, you'll get the 4GB RAM variant with 64GB storage. Prices exclude shipping. With built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support, the UP Core comes with a USB port, HDMI port, and 5V DC jack. It also has 100-pin I/O connector for up to three stackable expansions, compared with the 40-pin GPIO on the previously released standard UP board. UP also has high- and low-speed expansion boards for the UP Core as well as a custom chassis, which can be acquired as a package with pledges above €195. Though 2GB isn't much memory to run a PC, the UP Core will function as a simple, pocket-sized computer once a monitor, keyboard, and mouse are attached, as UP developers have demonstrated in this video of it booting up Windows 10. The UP Core is UP's third and tiniest developer board, following the UP and the UP2. The device is available on Kickstarter with an estimated shipping date of August for the 16GB units, and October for larger storage options.

We have run around to check as many things as we could (check our Computex 2017 coverage), but we didn’t stray too far from our normal regimen of laptops and key components such as CPUs and GPUS. We’ve compiled this list (no particular order) of what we thought were the best products of the show, so congratulations to those companies and team who built them. The goal for next year: see and try even more products! ASUS Flip S convertible laptop Gallery: Asus Zenbook Flip S, Hands-On ASUS came in force to Computex 2017, and the ASUS ZenBook Flip S is the most interesting laptop the company showed. At 10.9mm and 1.1Kg, t is the thinnest convertible laptop. It is also a powerful computer, with up to Core i7, 16GB RAM, 1TB PCIe SSD and a digitizer pen. Add to that a good battery size and a starting price of $1099, and you have a laptop that provides excellent value. NVIDIA Max-Q design for thin gaming laptops The NVIDIA Max-Q design is a set of technologies and design rules from NVIDIA that enables PC-makers to build “real” gaming capable laptops into a thin and light form factor. By putting an extreme emphasis on power-efficiency, Max-Q design laptops can run the most demanding games without requiring a huge chassis and the weight associated with it. Not only gamers can benefit from this, but designers and creative users can too. Qualcomm Mesh Networking Reference Design WiFi connectivity remains a challenge for millions of users: bad connectivity, poor range, no line of sight and other problems abound in the real world. Qualcomm has been driving the next-generation mesh-based WiFi self-organising networks. They are easier to setup, have longer range, and use technologies originally developed for cellular telephony.  Qualcomm’s new mesh networking reference design will help build new commercial products faster. Intel Core X-Series CPUs With renewed competition from arch-rival AMD, Intel has announced a new line of “enthusiast” CPUs called Core X, which closes the performance gap and offer an extreme X cores version which should become the new speed leader. More importantly, Intel has adjusted its prices to the new reality, with deep cuts at every level of performance where it needs to compete. The consumer wins. PS: keep an eye out for the 8th generation of Intel Core processors — they should get a nice speed boost. Acer Predator Triton 700 gaming laptop Gallery: Acer Predator Triton 700 Acer is among the first OEMs to build a thin and powerful gaming laptop around NVIDIA’s Max-Q design. The ACER Predator Triton 700 is a powerful machine, with a fast Intel Gen 7 processor, NVIDIA’s 1080 GTX graphics chip, up to 32GB of RAM and two PCIe SSD. Add to that support for 2x USB 3.0, 1x USB 2.0, 1x Thunderbolt 3, 1x full-size HDMI, 1x DisplayPort and Killer networking. Despite this power, the chassis is only 0.74” thick. The only downside is its price of $2999+. ASUS Vivo S Laptop The ASUS Vivo S is a laptop designed for the average user who wants a good computing experience. To achieve this, ASUS has built a computer with good looks: there’s an aluminum design (17.9mm thin), and an 80% display to body ratio for the 1080p/FHD screen. For games and creative apps, there’s an optional discrete graphics chip, and there’s a fingerprint reader built-in for convenience. The best part: it starts at $499. ASUS Zenbook 3 Deluxe Gallery: Asus Zenbook 3 Deluxe, Hands-On In the 14” ultrathin laptop space, ASUS hits hard with the Zenbook 3 Deluxe, a laptop that made some noise at CES, but that is set to ship in the next few weeks. With a 12.9mm thickness (and 2.42 lbs), it should be the thinnest 14” laptop when it becomes available for sale at a starting price of $1199. It comes fully loaded with up to Core i7, 1TB PCIe SSD, and Thunderbolt 3 support. Gigabyte Brix Gaming VR PC Gallery: Gigabyte Brix Gaming VR PC Desktop Gaming PCs are mostly huge towers, but it doesn’t have to be that way. The Gigabyte’s Brix Gaming PC is small (110 x 110 x 220 mm) but can be configured to be VR-capable (GeForce 1060+Core i7). Additionally, it comes with a lot of ports: 2x USB-C 3.1, 3x USB 3.0, 3x mini-DP, 1x HDMI. There’s integrated WiFi and Gb Ethernet, support for SATA and M.2 SSDs, two memory slots. Price remains the unknown, but we love the idea. MSI GS63VR 15” thin gaming laptop Gallery: MSI GS63VR 15 Gaming Laptop MSI’s GS63VR laptop is a 15” mobile gaming rig that is compact (17.7mm thick, 4.2 Lbs) but packs a punch at the same time. It has a powerful NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 graphics processor and a 120Hz HDR display that has a 3ms response time. The compactness is made possible by using an impressive heat pipe cooling system that is shared among CPU and GPU units to dissipate heat efficiently. ARM Cortex A55 CPU Core Design ARM has announced a new graphics processor, along with two new CPU cores that will start to appear in many 2018 smartphones. The Cortex A55 CPU Core is probably the one that will have the most impact on the everyday life of Billions of phone users. The Cortex A55 is the piece of silicon that runs your phone most of the time: when it is in standby mode. The new power optimizations it has will bring power efficiency to a new level, and everybody loves to have a little more battery life. Filed in Computers.

We know there’s a new high-end, 16-core variant, dubbed Threadripper, on its way in the not-too-distant future, and now we’ve got some early rumors on what clock speeds might be. Oh — and AMD has trimmed the price on existing Ryzen 7 CPUs as well, in case you’re interested in buying into that family, but were hoping for a bit of a price cut first. Let’s talk about the price cutting first. It’s not clear yet if the current price trimming is permanent or not, but Tech Report reports that the Ryzen 7 1700 has gotten trimmed from $329 to $315, the Ryzen 7 1700X has dropped to $350 from $399, and the Ryzen 7 1800X is dropping from $500 to $460. The cuts are fairly modest, ranging from about 5 percent to ~13 percent. AMD hasn’t given any reason for the price trimming, but if I had to guess, I’d guess that the company is testing the waters at various prices to see how consumers respond. CPU prices have been static for so long, it’s easy to forget that these kinds of periodic price cuts used to be the norm. Back when AMD and Intel were in direct competition with each other, it was normal for prices to drop on a regular basis as new, faster parts were introduced. Both companies still enforced price banding and kept their mainstream, high-end, and server parts separate, but it wasn’t unusual to see chip prices fall on a regular basis. Neither AMD nor Intel launch new parts at the speeds they used to, and Ryzen 7 is relatively new, so I suspect something different may be happening here (assuming, of course, that these aren’t just temporary prices to goose sales a bit during Computex). AMD’s Ryzen 7 is the most competitive desktop CPU the company has launched in over a decade. Phenom II (aka Deneb) was a good part for its day, but it didn’t compete particularly well against Nehalem, which had been in market for over a year by the time Deneb debuted in early 2009. Ryzen 7, in contrast, takes the fight directly to Intel’s top-end HEDT markets, and it does so at dramatically lower prices. Our own benchmark comparison of Ryzen 7 1800X versus its various Intel counterparts like the 6900K and 6950X are shown below, and our full review is here. The flip side to this, however, is that AMD is retaking some degree of market share in spaces where it hasn’t competed for a number of years. It’s hard to accurately guide on price when there’s no near-term market data to draw on, the response from your primary competitor is uncertain, and the PC market is moving in different directions depending on where you look. Overall PC unit shipments have fallen from 365 million units in 2011 to 269.7 million units in 2016, while gaming and enthusiast markets have continued to grow throughout that period. It’s not surprising, therefore, to see AMD playing a bit with Ryzen 7 pricing, and again, all of this assumes that the new prices aren’t temporary. AMD’s Threadripper Lineup Meanwhile, on the Threadripper front, Hot Hardware has a rumored spec sheet of future Ryzen Threadripper parts. There isn’t just one Threadripper SKU — there are nine, ranging from the R9 1955 (10 cores, 20 threads, 3.1GHz base, 3.7GHz Turbo) to the R9 1998X (16 cores, 32 threads, 3.5GHz base, 3.8GHz Turbo). AMD’s top-end 10-core part would be a 125W TDP core with a 3.6GHz base and 3.9GHz Turbo, as compared to Intel’s Core i7-7900X, with a 3.3GHz base clock and 4.3GHz Turbo. As always, all of these specs should be taken with a substantial grain of salt. But while these are rumored specs, they’re rumored specs that make reasonable sense based on what we know about Ryzen’s performance, frequency scaling, and overall capabilities. I’d expect the final figures to be within 5-10 percent of these clocks and TDPs. There’s only so much, however, that these spec sheets can tell us. Even if they’re accurate, the big question will be how effectively these big-core chips can maintain their clock speeds, and at what core counts. The more cores on any given piece of silicon, the harder it’ll be to move heat out of that die effectively and to keep the chip running at top frequency. Which company does a better job on this front could be critical to determining which company pulls ahead in the inevitable benchmark wars. It’s interesting to watch AMD and Intel fight this battle now compared with AMD’s original surge, from 1999 through 2006. Back then, AMD started with a relatively high-end consumer CPU (Athlon), followed by a lower-end budget chip (Duron). It had a server platform for K7 (the AMD 760MP and less-expensive 760MPX), but didn’t get serious about that market until Opteron debuted in 2003. AMD is being much more aggressive this time around, taking on Intel’s entire product stack in desktop, high-end desktop, and in servers via Epyc, while simultaneously prepping updated APUs with Vega graphics for mobile and budget desktop markets. No matter what else happens, the next six months are going to be very interesting for the CPU market.

According to a new report, Apple’s legal dispute with Qualcomm is going to have an effect on iPhone 8 components, and Apple might have to substitute some Qualcomm chips with Intel components. Given the inferior quality of the Intel chips in last year’s iPhone 7, that’s not good news. Don't Miss: 10 best new movies and shows coming to Netflix in June According to a Digitimes report, Apple will shift supply of iPhone baseband modems away from Qualcomm and towards Intel, starting this year. The report says that 50% of the iPhone 8 modems could be supplied by Intel, with that number rising to 70% for the 2018 iPhone lineup. Intel’s modems have historically been cheaper but worse-performing than Qualcomm’s solution. A worse modem means less power efficiency but also a worse cell signal with lower speeds — all important things for Apple, especially considering new LTE technologies are being deployed this year, and wireless speed is set to take on a new level of importance. Qualcomm generally supplies the modem for every Android flagship worth talking about, and the iPhone’s reputation is all about reliability and speed. Apple could be forced to make a bad choice here: make an unpleasant legal settlement with Qualcomm, which would likely eat into Apple’s profit margins; or accept an inferior component in nearly half of its brand-new iPhone range. Apple’s dispute with Qualcomm is related to the licensing fees Qualcomm charges for its patents. Qualcomm’s intellectual property is used inside every single iPhone — which Apple acknowledges — but Apple contends that Qualcomm charges unreasonably high patent fees. Apple has sued Qualcomm over the issue in the past, and even instructed its manufacturing partners like Foxconn to stop royalty payments to Qualcomm. The chip manufacturer has countersued in the Southern District of California; if the case there fails, Qualcomm could even take the issue to the US International Trade Commission, and seek a ruling banning the import of iPhones into the US. Nothing’s yet indicated that Qualcomm is prepared to go that far. But the rumors about Apple shifting as much of supply as possible away from Qualcomm is telling. Apple’s bunkering down and preparing for a war with a vitally important component supplier; let’s just hope iPhone customers don’t get caught in the crossfire.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Report: Intel Corporation Could Benefit From the Spat Between Qualcomm, Inc. and Apple Inc. This chipmaker could see an increase in its cellular-modem shipments due to increasing animosity between Apple and its primary cellular-modem supplier. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jun 2, 2017 at 7:30AM A fresh report from DigiTimes says that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) currently sources 30% of the cellular modems used in the iPhone 7-series devices from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), with the remaining 70% coming from longtime iPhone supplier, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). Losing a portion of Apple's iPhone cellular modem orders certainly impacted Qualcomm's financial performance, as well as, arguably, the perception of the value of Qualcomm's technology. Previously, only Qualcomm built stand-alone models that could meet Apple's iPhone needs, but with Apple's use of Intel modems in its flagship smartphones, that perceived value may have lessened among investors. Image source: Apple. Per DigiTimes, because of the increasingly bitter litigation between Qualcomm and Apple, Intel is expected to see its iPhone modem allocation as a percentage of Apple's total flagship iPhone shipments increase over time. "Apple's outsourcing proportion to Intel for the next-generation iPhone baseband chips has risen to about 50% for orders running through the end of 2017," DigiTimes says. It will get worse for Qualcomm and better for Intel if DigiTimes' reporting is accurate. The report says that Apple is "likely to shift even more baseband chip orders away from Qualcomm with Intel to supply over 70% of the baseband products for iPhones by 2018." Good thing Intel's XMM 7560 supports CDMA One of the key factors that will enable Intel to potentially capture the bulk of Apple's iPhone modem orders is that its upcoming cellular modem, known as the XMM 7560, is expected to support the CDMA standard, a feature that's lacking in the company's current XMM 7360 (used in the iPhone 7-series) and the upcoming XMM 7480 (likely to be used in this year's iPhone models). With CDMA support, iPhones incorporating Intel's modems will be usable on CDMA-capable networks like Verizon and Sprint, as well as on the GSM-capable networks that the current Intel-based iPhone models support. In other words, iPhones with Qualcomm and Intel models would be, for all intents and purposes, interchangeable. However, Apple doesn't gain this flexibility -- and Intel doesn't enjoy this potential opportunity -- until the product cycle after the coming iPhone 7s/8 cycle. What this could mean for all parties involved Obviously, the loss of additional share at Apple would sting Qualcomm's chip business. Now, it wasn't the end of the world for said business when Qualcomm lost that initial part of Apple's modem orders to Intel, and it certainly wouldn't be the end of the world for Qualcomm to lose additional share here. Remember that Qualcomm sells mobile applications processors, often with additional support chips, to a wide range of customers, and Apple is just one customer -- albeit a reasonably large one. For Intel, the impact of additional share gains at Apple would be a boost to its relatively small wireless chip business, which is just one small part of the company's overall Client Computing Group, or CCG, business. The impact to said wireless business would be large, and it would give Intel additional incentive to continue to develop cellular modem technologies, but the impact to the company's overall revenue and profits would be quite small -- as was the impact of the initial Apple modem revenues to Intel's business. Finally, Apple would further lessen its dependence on Qualcomm, with whom it's in a bitter legal battle. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

Tesla's self-driving systems are just the start of what could be a massive change in the economy Credit: Bloomberg Alan Tovey, Industry Editor 2 June 2017 • 11:24am Self-driving cars will revolutionise the way we travel, work and live and create a $7 trillion-a-year industry by 2050, according to Intel. The US tech giant is forecasting what it terms a “passenger economy” that will create massive opportunities for new businesses as people transform from drivers into riders with time - rather than a steering wheel - on their hands. Some of the more outlandish predictions from the Intel research include what it calls “car-venience” applications such as onboard beauty salons in cars, as well as mobile health clinics and treatment pods. It even imagines that self-driving vehicles could “platoon” together to form pod hotels. Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich warns that companies that do not adapt face extinction Credit: Getty “Companies should start thinking about their autonomous strategy now,” said Brian Krzanich, Intel chief executive. “Less than a decade ago, no one was talking about the potential of a soon-to-emerge app or sharing economy because no one saw it coming. “This is why we started the conversation around the passenger economy early, to wake people up to the opportunity streams that will emerge when cars become the most powerful mobile data-generating devices we use and people swap driving for riding.” He warned that companies that do not prepare for this “explosive” change face failure and even extinction, drawing parallels with the disruption caused by the rise of mobile phones, which has “reconfigured entire industries.” Driverless cars will unlock a 'cognitive surplus' allowing people to use travelling time for more productive applications Credit: Volvo Mr Krzanich also predicted an “unlocking of cognitive surplus” - giving people back time spent driving to think and do other things. Self-driving cars are expected to free up more than 250m hours per year of commuters’ time in the world’s most congested cities. The research predicts this new economic sector will be worth $800bn a year by 2035, rising to $7 trillion 15 years later. Of this amount, 98pc is expected to come from “mobility as a service”, broadly split between consumers abandoning traditional car ownership models and summoning driverless vehicles as and when needed, and business using self-driving vehicles for transportation and freight delivery. The remainder - some $200bn -  will be generated by new and emerging applications in sectors such as hotels and hospitality, tourism, entertainment and healthcare. Driverless technology could also help passengers use their time to watch movies, play games or shop, further driving spending in the economy. How Rolls-Royce imagines the driverless car of the future will look Credit: Bloomberg The research - carried out for Intel by Strategy Analytics - forecasts a huge expansion of existing businesses to support driverless cars, as well as companies offering entirely new services. These could include companies “going mobile” by developing pods that could take their services out to customers, with suggestions that fast-food restaurants or coffee shops could create “driverless kiosks” that go to their customers rather than the other way round. Fleet management companies are also set to enjoy a boom as traditional car ownership dies out, and "recharging farms" will be needed to support the explosion in electric vehicles. Another new feature of this environment could be “storages lakes” where fleets of vehicles could recharge, restock or temporarily park. These could take the form of “mothership” vehicles. “It is easy to envision an electric Uber delivering people and goods on a nearly around-the-clock-schedule as needed,” said the report. “It is also realistic to expect that trucks transporting goods between distribution centres and retail outlets will be able to run on an almost 24-hours a day, seven days a week schedule. These high-utilisation rates will spawn a very active secondary market for used pilotless vehicles as companies replace and refresh their fleets.” Share this article Follow Telegraph Business Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on LinkedIn View comments If you would like to add a comment, please register or log in Register Log in Please review our commenting policy Follow Telegraph Business Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on LinkedIn Related Topics Global economy Self driving cars Apps Passengers Uber Industry Driverless cars Show more Galleries Gallery 02 Jun 2017, 4:30pm Gallery: Nine things you could buy with this week's £131m EuroMillions jackpot Gallery 30 May 2017, 6:46pm Gallery: Ten things you didn't know you could do on Amazon Gallery 26 May 2017, 4:15pm Gallery: Apple Park: Apple's new 'spaceship' campus - in pictures Business latest 03 Jun 2017, 7:06am EuroMillions results: What are the winning numbers and did anyone win the jackpot? 02 Jun 2017, 10:59pm Comment: The next government must reform the UK tax system for the 21st century Andrew Sentance Premium 02 Jun 2017, 10:28pm Comment: Jeremy Corbyn's state-run firms would be catastrophic for the economy Allister Heath Premium 02 Jun 2017, 6:20pm RBS settlement yo-yos as investors raise millions to continue battle  02 Jun 2017, 4:39pm World stocks hold all-time highs but dollar falls to seven-month low against euro as US jobs growth slows Gallery 02 Jun 2017, 4:30pm Gallery: Nine things you could buy with this week's £131m EuroMillions jackpot 02 Jun 2017, 4:16pm Sage sells US payments business for £200m 02 Jun 2017, 4:12pm More people are buying diamonds for themselves as global sales bounce back 02 Jun 2017, 3:29pm Soft US jobs and wage growth 'unlikely to derail June rate rise' as unemployment drops to 16-year low 02 Jun 2017, 3:12pm Jacques Vert closes in on rescue deal to save 1,500 jobs 02 Jun 2017, 2:23pm Housebuilding rises at fastest pace since 2015 02 Jun 2017, 12:59pm KKR latest private equity house to hit record with $9.3bn Asia fund 02 Jun 2017, 12:53pm Metro Bank buys £600m UK mortgage portfolio 02 Jun 2017, 12:49pm BP teams up with Rosneft to bring more Russian gas to Europe 00:55 02 Jun 2017, 12:48pm What is the Paris Agreement on climate change?

The details have been reported by French site Consmac, and relate to regulatory filings made in a Russian-language regulatory filing. Five model numbers for personal computers carrying the Apple trademark are listed. The model numbers registered in this filing are A1289 A1347, A1418, A1419, and A1481. The expectation is that these model numbers represent updates to a number of existing Mac machines rather than Apple recycling the model numbers; A1289 is the older boxlike Mac Pro, A1347 is the Mac mini, A1418 is the iMac, A1419 iMac, and A1481 is the cylindrical Mac Pro The inclusion of significantly older machines like the Mac Pro and the Mac mini clouds the issue of what exactly is being refreshed, but the obvious answer is that some of the Mac machines are going to join the MacBook line-up with an update to use Intel’s Kaby Lake chip architecture. There are already major signals that the three MacBook Pro machines announced in October 2016 will pick up the seventh-generation Intel chipsets. As previously discussed on Forbes, Apple’s decision to release one final iteration of MacBooks in 2016 with the sixth-generation Intel chips has meant the Windows 10 competition captured a lead in terms of specifications over the last six months. Apple has decided to risk upsetting the early adopters with a switch to Kaby Lake very early in this production cycle. The filing also has a new number - A1843 - listed as  a wireless input device and handily referred to as a ‘keyboard’). There’s been less talk of a new Magic Keyboard from Apple, but a recently published patent shows a wireless keyboard with an adaptive input row that matches the design and implementation of the Touch bar, but on a standalone peripheral. For developers to make best use of the Touch Bar it needs to become a primary control area, something that cannot happen with legacy hardware.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Smartphones Cybersecurity Innovation Social Media Games Motoring Technology Motoring Life-saving robot car industry to be worth $7 trillion by 2050 Intel also predicts the autonomous vehicle industry will save 585,000 lives between 2035 and 2045. By Alistair Charlton June 2, 2017 11:11 BST Autonomous vehicles like the Navya Arma bus will create a $7tn industry, says IntelNavya Autonomous cars will create a 'passenger economy' worth $7 trillion (£5.4tn) annually by 2050, technology company Intel has claimed. In a report compiled for Intel by Strategy Analytics, the company says the self-driving industry will grow from $800bn in 2035 to $7tn just 15 years later. Intel also predicts that, between 2035 and 2045, some 585,000 lives could be saved thanks to autonomous cars being safer than those driven by mistake-prone humans. The report states: "Autonomous driving technology will enable a new passenger economy worth $7tn in 2050. It will drive change across a range of industries, displacing vehicle ownership with mobility-as-a-service, and defining a new landscape of concierge and ride-hailing services, as well as pilotless vehicle options for businesses in industries like package delivery and long-haul transportation." On that last note, Google's self-driving car division Waymo announced this week it is working on creating a self-driving truck, no doubt similar to those of Otto, the autonomous road haulage branch of Uber. Intel believes that $7tn will be split fairly equally between consumer mobility-as-a-service ($3.7tn) and a business-facing equivalent ($2.9tn), while the remaining circa $200bn will come from what the report calls "new and emerging pilotless vehicle services". These could include entertainment services for self-driving car passengers, or even services like medical checkups. At this point, it is worth pointing out that Intel has a strong vested interest in the autonomous vehicle market becoming a success. It has invested countless millions of dollars into developing the underlying technology to make driverless cars function. It recently bought Israeli autonomous vision company Mobileye for $15bn, will spend $250m over the next two years on self-driving technology, and is working with BMW to put robot-driven cars on the road later in 2017. As well as the enormous potential financial gain from a society shuttled by autonomy, Intel sees a near-future where more than 250 million hours of wasted commuting time is saved every year, helping consumers to be more productive (or distracted by paid-for streaming media services) when stuck in traffic. Panasonic's autonomous car concept allows the driver to either control the car or socialise with passengers.Panasonic A common theme in the report is that of autonomous "pods" used for a variety of purposes. For example, delivery pods will "use autopilot to deliver items as received from their dispatch location", while "experience pods" can offer "on-board beauty salons or touchscreen tables for remote collaboration". Such pods could also be managed on a fleet basis, autonomously ferrying passengers or delivering goods, then recharging and restocking at a "larger mother-shop vehicle", the report envisions.

So let’s talk about the CPUs and make a few comparisons, though before we get too far into it please note we don’t have any official model names, clock speeds or pricing info for the Threadripper series, while the clock speeds for Intel’s higher-end Core i9 series is yet to be revealed as well. So on Intel’s side, sitting at the head of the family is their answer to AMD’s 16-core/32-thread Threadripper CPU: the eye-watering Core i9-7980XE -- and I say eye-watering not because it boasts an incredible 18 cores and 36 threads, but because it will set you back $2000. The price might be extreme even for the flagship model, but Intel will also be releasing 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16-core models, in what looks to be an outright assault on AMD. The Zen architecture has clearly lit a fire under Intel and all this competition is good news for us, the consumer. Intel will also be releasing 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16-core model, in what looks to be an outright assault on AMD The Core X series includes both the Skylake-X architecture as well as the Kaby Lake-X architecture. All CPUs that have a core count of 6-18 cores are based on Skylake-X, leaving just the quad-cores to use Kaby Lake-X. AMD has already fired shots with their 4-core, 6-core and 8-core models and we are expecting 10, 12, 14 and 16-core versions soon. Not wanting to simply match AMD’s core count Intel has gone one step further with the Core i9-7980XE by hitting 18-cores. This is essentially the Titan XP of the CPU world, so it’s not really that relevant. Anyway if you have money to burn and the 18-core model is indeed worth whatever premium it ends up being over Threadripper, what does all that mola land you? Well, Intel says the i9-7980XE is the first ever teraflop desktop PC processor, so there’s that. You also get a CPU with a truly massive 18MB L2 cache. That is 1MB per core and then there’s a shared 24.75MB L3 cache. The operating frequency is yet to be revealed (base frequency) but using Turbo Boost Max 3.0 a core or two should be able to hit 4.5GHz. For such a monstrous processor you might be expecting a thermal design power rating in excess of 200 watts. But the good news is the TDP rating has been set at just 165 watts. That should make thermals quite manageable, but Intel is also selling its own liquid cooler designed for the 165W TDP and 140W TDP chips. It's estimated retail price is between $80 and $100, and will work with some previous generation CPU models as well. For those that can’t drop $2K on a CPU there’s the Core i9-7960X for a much more wallet friendly $1700 -- of course! What’s interesting here is that this model boasts the same core count as AMD’s upcoming flagship Threadripper CPU, rumored to be called Ryzen 9 1998X. All AMD Ryzen Threadripper CPUs will have quad channel DDR4 support as well as the full 64 PCIe Gen3 lanes. That is 20 more lanes than Intel’s highest end Skylake-X Core i9 processors and incredibly 40 more lanes than its 8-core and 6 core Core i7 models. So AMD has Intel against the ropes when it comes to PCI Express lanes, those X399 motherboards are going to be quite incredible. Intel says the i9-7980XE is the first ever teraflop desktop PC processor, so there’s that. So with the 8-core Ryzen 7 1800X at $500 and the 1700 model which is essentially the same thing that’s currently selling for as little as $310, how much can a 16-core Ryzen CPU really cost? It would have to be well over double the price of the most expensive 8-core model to come even close to the i9-7960X, so that’s something to ponder. Anyway, the Core i9-7960X will feature a 16 MB L2 cache, again 1MB per core, as well as 22MB’s of L3. Memory support is the same for all Skylake-X processors and remains at Quad Channel DDR4-2666. The TDP is also locked at 165 watt and again for now, the base clock of this model is yet to be announced. Image credit: IDG Intel says that compared to Broadwell-E chips such as the $1700 10-core i7-6950X, the new 10-core model offers 15 percent faster single thread performance and is 10 percent faster on multi-threaded tasks. So naturally for multi-threaded workloads the 7960X is going to crush the 6950X albeit for the same ludicrous price. Dropping down to the low, low price of $1400 we find the Core i9-7940X, a 14-core model with a 14MB L2 cache and a 19.25MB L3 cache. Again you get quad-channel DDR4 and the same 165 watt TDP. The 12-core Core i9-7920X comes in at $1200 and now we’re starting to nudge towards that original extreme price of $1000. With this one you get 12 MB of L2 cache with a 16.5 MB of L3 cache. The TDP has been lowered to 140 watts but you still get quad-channel DDR4-2666 memory support and all 44 PCI Express lanes enabled. Stepping in for my 6950X is the Core-i9 7900X, the new 10-core/20-thread model. This model comes in at the same price as the earlier Extreme Edition models such as the Core i7-965 Extreme Edition, so $1000. We know that this model will operate all cores at a base frequency of 3.3 GHz and that’s a nice little 10% boost over the 6950X. That said the new 7900X does only sport a 13.75MB L3 cache and that’s almost half that of the 6950X. However whereas the 6950X only has a 2.5MB L2 cache the 7900X has a huge 10MB L2 cache by comparison. L2 is considerably faster so having more should help boost performance substantially. Finally the 10-core model has been given the same 140 watt TDP rating as the 12-core model, quad-channel memory and 44 PCIe lanes. Okay, so this is where it gets really interesting, the 8-core/16-thread Core i7-7820X featuring an MSRP of $600. That means we are seeing a notable 40% reduction in price when compared to the 10-core model and just a 20% reduction in core assets. This also means that the 7820X will come in 20% more expensive than AMD’s Ryzen 7 1800X and awkwardly almost twice the price of the 1700 model, so it could be a good deal next to the 1800X, but unlikely to be with the existence of the 1700. It comes clocked at 3.6 GHz for all cores but can boost as high as 4.5 GHz. So that is a higher clock speed than what Ryzen can currently achieve. This is another 140 watt part but PCIe lanes have been reduced to 28, though this is still plenty for most power users. Still as noted earlier this is a massive 56% reduction in lanes when compared to even the base Ryzen Threadripper CPU. Now for the 6-core/12-thread model and Intel has a lot riding here. As you probably know the Ryzen 5 1600 is considered to be the golden chip of the entire Ryzen lineup and at just $220 it’s hard to beat. It seems like Intel’s not even going to try as their 6-core Core i7-7800X is set to come in at $390. That’s not a significant saving over the current 6-core Broadwell-E chip, about 10% cheaper when compared to the 6800K. This model can boost as high as 4GHz out of the box with a base clock frequency of 3.5GHz. It also packs 6MB of L2 cache and 8.25 MB of L3 cache. Again this is a 140 watt model with 28 PCIe lanes. With the 6-core model still coming in at almost $400 that still leaves some room for some lower tier models. Intel is offering quad-cores on the X299 platform, the fastest of which will be the Core i7-7740X. Priced at $340 it comes in at the same price as the Core i7-7700K and this model is based on the new Kaby Lake-X architecture. I think most will agree with me though when I say, I don’t really get this model. It’s not a great deal cheaper than the 6-core model and yet it only offers dual channel memory support and a mere 16 PCIe lanes. Why offer such a measly CPU on a flagship platform that will no doubt be dominated by premium and expensive motherboards? It’s almost a joke that the entry level Threadripper CPU will support three times as many PCI Express lanes. As you probably know the Ryzen 5 1600 is considered to be the golden chip of the entire Ryzen lineup and at just $220 it’s hard to beat. Perhaps even more puzzling is the $240 Core i5-7640X which is another quad-core part, though it lacks Hyper Threading support so just 4-threads are on offer here. So for $20 more than the Ryzen 5 1600, Intel is giving us a traditional Core i5. I won’t bother reading out the specs, I’m pretty sure this is going to be another Core i3-7350K situation where I'll simply tell you guys, don't buy it. Before wrapping things up I checked out two X399 motherboards over in the Asrock booth. The first is the X399 Taichi and this board does a pretty good job of trying to tackle all those PCIe lanes with four PCIe x16 slots and three M.2 slots. As you can see that massive TR4 socket occupies a huge amount of space on the board, as do the 8 DIMM slots. Asrock also had their X399 Professional Gaming on display and the core specifications were very similar though this board does pick up a Creative audio solution and 10 gigabit Ethernet which is very cool. I also spotted this Mini-ITX X299 motherboard. Looks like you'll be able to make an 18-core Core i9 rig in a shoebox size PC if you want. This tiny board wasn’t light on features either offering six SATA ports, three M.2 ports -- I know, three on a Mini-ITX board. There’s also loads of USB ports, numerous networking options and support for quad-channel memory via four laptop style DIMM slots. Impressive stuff and I can’t wait to check these new boards out when time comes. In a nutshell, Intel’s new Core X series certainly looks very interesting and a bit confusing at the same time. They are clearly feeling the Ryzen heat and going with an all-out assault. The release date for the first wave of chips is June 19 and I should have on hand for testing the 10-core Core i9-7900X and 4-core Core i7-7740X.

The major motherboard manufacturers are all aflutter showing off all the RGB LEDs—ahem, compelling features that set their X299 boards apart. Buried in all the noise are hints of new RAID functionality that Intel developed to accompany X299. The company doesn't seem to have directly disseminated any information about what it is or how it works, but we've managed to cobble together a rough idea by talking to Intel's motherboard partners. For starters, the new RAID functionality is called Virtual Raid On CPU, or VROC. Users dropping high-speed NVMe storage into M.2 and spare PCIe slots can select arbitrary subsets of those drives to create a blazing-fast RAID 0 array. Here's where the waters get muddied a bit. Some Asus guy with pretty solid storage credentials who goes by the Gasior surname asserts that those arrays are bootable. However, Gigabyte told us that VROC depends on Intel's RSTe driver, which is software you run on top of Windows. These two claims would seem to be at odds, at least at first sight. VROC header on EVGA's X299 FTW K At the end of the day, it would appear that Intel's out to make a quick buck (my words, not the manufacturers'). X299 boards may optionally include a VROC header on the PCB. Support for RAID 0 NVMe arrays is free, but you have to shell out $99 for a physical VROC key to plug into the header to unlock RAID 1 and RAID 10. For RAID 5, there's a more expensive key (we heard both $199 and $299 are possible). These keys aren't being channeled through motherboard manufacturers, so as far as we know Intel will be selling them directly. Since the implementation details of VROC are nowhere to be found, we don't know whether the key contains any real mojo or not. All signs point to it merely being a sort of physical DRM. We'll keep you posted as we learn more. Tags: Motherboards Storage Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

G.Skill demonstrated a number of new products at Computex that look to occupy all availabe X299 niches. At least some X299 buyers are going to run their memory in dual-channel mode. Intel's Kaby Lake-X chips only have two memory channels to work with, and Skylake-X overclockers might choose to leave two channels unoccupied when chasing high clock rates. G.Skill has shown off its Trident Z DDR4-4800 CL19 16GB (2 x 8 GB) kit, capable of running with tight CL19-19-19-39 timings. The demo system was built with ASRock's X299 OC Formula motherboard. Some folks need some bling to go with their high-speed memory, and G.Skill showed off its Trident Z RGB DDR4-4400 16GB (2 x 8 GB) to that crowd. G.Skill touts the kit as the fastest memory on the block with RGB LEDs. The DIMMs' timings are set at CL19-19-19-39. For this set, G.Skill's demo system was assembled using Gigabyte's X299 SOC Champion motherboard. I would imagine most X299 buyers want their system to have a lot more than 16 GB of memory. Someone at G.Skill must think along the same lines, because the company also showed off the Trident Z RGB DDR4-4200 64 GB (8 x 8 GB) kit, which, as the long-winded name suggests, consists of eight rainbow-lit 8 GB DDR4 DIMMs running at 4200 MT/s. Timings are a bit looser at CL19-21-21-41, but having 64 GB of RAM spread across eight sticks in the same system at that speed is an impressive feat. This particular demo system was built around an Asus Prime X299-Deluxe motherboard, suggesting that such feats may is possible on "entry-level" X299 boards. Buyers might also want DIMMs larger than 8 GB each. G.Skill meets this demand with its Trident Z RGB DDR4-4000 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) kit, which has a pair of 16 GB modules running at 4 GT/s. Timings are extra-tight at CL17-18-18-38. The demo system for these modules used another ASRock X299 OC Formula board. Intel's X299 chipset hasn't made an appearance in laptops yet, but G.Skill didn't want to leave laptop buyers out of the party. The company showed off an EVGA SC17 gaming laptop packed with two 16 GB 3466 MT/s DDR4 modules running at CL16-18-18-43 timings, for a total of 32 GB of RAM. G.Skill did not provide pricing or availability information for any of the new high-speed kits. Tags: Memory Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

By Tas Bindi | June 2, 2017 -- 06:53 GMT (23:53 PDT) | Topic: Innovation Fully autonomous vehicles will bring forth a new "passenger economy" worth $7 trillion by 2050, according to new research from Intel and Strategy Analytics. The passenger economy does not include the autonomous vehicle industry itself; rather, it's a "peripheral" economy or a "side-effect" of autonomous vehicles becoming mainstream, Doug Davis, VP of Intel and GM of Intel's Automated Driving Solutions Group, told journalists on Thursday. While the predicted value can be disputed, Intel's overarching point is that fully autonomous vehicles will generate new types of products, services, and business models as today's drivers become tomorrow's idle passengers. what's hot on zdnet Cyberweapons are now in play What to expect at Apple WWDC 2017: Sure bets and long shots Autonomous driving will spawn $7 trillion 'passenger economy': Intel Password manager OneLogin hacked, exposing sensitive customer data Given autonomous vehicles are expected to free more than 250 million hours of consumers' commuting time per year in some of the most congested cities in the world, a key opportunity will be how to capitalise on all of the time people will save when they're no longer having to drive, according to the Intel-Strategy Analytics study. Due to the scope of the opportunity, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said it would be wise for businesses to start thinking about their autonomous strategy now. "Less than a decade ago, no one was talking about the potential of a soon-to-emerge app or sharing economy because no one saw it coming. This is why we started the conversation around the Passenger Economy early: To wake people up to the opportunity streams that will emerge when cars become the most powerful mobile data generating devices we use and people swap driving for riding," Krzanich said. "Mobility-as-a-service" will be the dominant business model, disrupting traditional patterns of vehicle ownership, maintenance, operations, and usage, according to Intel. In fact, the chip giant envisions a future where individual vehicle ownership is less important, and shared commuting on autonomous vehicles is the norm. "Half of commuters in Manila are not driving ... some take jeepneys, which are these old diesel minibuses [that carry] 20 people. When those become electric, autonomous, algorithmically guided, and massively more efficient, you're giving those time savings back to people. You suddenly have this whole new form of mass transportation," Roger Lanctot, director of Automotive Connected Mobility at Strategy Analytics and author of the Intel-commissioned study, said on Thursday. While some posit that the popularity of autonomous vehicles will increase congestion on roads, the study argues that the vehicles of the future will be able to retrieve and share real-time traffic data, and subsequently optimise routes and tasks such as finding parking. Davis added that autonomous vehicles will not kill off public transport; rather, it will reinvent it, providing commuters with a vastly different experience to what they're accustomed to today. Transport -- such as buses, ferries, trains, trams, and taxis -- could even become "experience pods", places where people get their nails and hair done, conduct business meetings, consult healthcare practitioners, or have dinner with friends, according to the study. Lanctot believes the technology will bring forth new vehicle types that are adapted to local circumstances. "The autonomous vehicle is not going to be a four-seat Sedan; it's going to start as that, and then rapidly evolve into minibuses. I think we'll see a whole new class of vehicles spawned for dense urban environments, like autonomous electric bicycles that are ultra lightweight, clean, emissionless. It will pedal itself to you and then electrically assist you to where you want to go or convey you there," Lanctot said. "At the extreme end, we could eventually start to see the evolution of RVs into autonomous houses that can trundle along, create nomadic communities, going from place to place." Davis believes autonomous vehicle technology will "democratise transportation", bringing mobility to those who currently struggle with it such as those who are older or living with disabilities. "When you look at ageing populations around the world, like in Japan for example, autonomous taxis could be used to help people age in place and preserve old towns," said Greg Lindsay, senior fellow at the New Cities Foundation. The study predicts the B2B sector to be among the first to experience change as a consequence of autonomous vehicle technology advancing. For example, businesses involved with package deliveries and long-haul transportation will no longer be impacted by driver shortages. While it will take decades to reach full integration of autonomous vehicles, the projected $7 trillion global value will come from three major areas, according to the study: $3 trillion, or 43 percent, is expected to come from business use of mobility-as-a-service; $3.7 trillion, or 55 percent, will come from consumer use of mobility-as-a-service; and $203 billion would be generated by new vehicle services and features. Davis wrote an article in May saying the reason he decided to postpone his retirement from the company, in which he spent more than 30 years, is because of Intel's potential in the autonomous driving sector. Davis believes Intel is not getting enough credit for its role in autonomous driving technology, saying that many autonomous vehicle carmakers are not talking about "who is powering the brains in their test cars lest they give away secrets". Davis said that he firmly believes Intel is best equipped to address the data challenge associated with autonomous driving technology. According to Intel, autonomous cars will generate about 4TB of data -- from cameras, LIDAR, RADAR, and other sensors -- every 90 minutes of operation. special feature Cybersecurity in an IoT and Mobile World The technology world has spent so much of the past two decades focused on innovation that security has often been an afterthought. Learn how and why it is finally changing. Read More To prepare for this, Davis said the company has set up the first of several planned datacentres dedicated to autonomous driving, which will be used for algorithm development and training, as well as understanding the infrastructure required for autonomous driving data movement and storage. At an event in San Jose, California, Intel and BMW also unveiled the first of approximately 40 autonomous cars built on the 7 Series platform that it will be testing on the road. The vehicles will include technologies such as cameras for road scanning from Israeli company Mobileye, which Intel acquired for $15.3 billion in March. Under its partnership with Intel, BMW will be responsible for driving control and dynamics, component integration, and evaluation of functional safety including setting up a high-performance simulation engine. All the cars are expected to be on the road by the end of the year. Intel also unveiled its Advanced Vehicle Lab in Silicon Valley, which it said will explore artificial intelligence, connectivity, in-vehicle computing, sensing, and other technologies required to make fully autonomous vehicles a reality. It joins the company's other labs in Arizona, Oregon, and Germany. Intel is among a growing cohort of tech companies looking to capitalise on autonomous driving technology, including Apple, Baidu, BlackBerry, Google, Lyft, Nvidia, and Uber.

The giant chipmaker made the announcement as it reported lower-than-expected sales for the first quarter. This as industry analysts say an extended slide in global PC sales is showing no signs of leveling off. Intel, which has long been the world’s leading maker of PC chips, is now trying to expand into other types of computing. “It’s time to make this transition,” CEO Brian Krzanich told analysts. While calling the job cuts “difficult,” he said they would help the company sharpen its focus in new areas. The latest cuts follow an earlier reduction of about 5,000 jobs announced by Intel in 2014, and analysts say they may not be the last. “These companies are so big that it takes time” — and sometimes multiple rounds of restructuring — to change direction, said Patrick Moorhead, a longtime industry expert at Moor Insights & Strategy. Krzanich has been pushing Intel to change its focus from PCs to other computing segments that are growing and providing more profit. These include making microprocessors for “cloud computing” data centers, along with chips for Internet-connected gadgets, wearable devices and drones. “We are evolving from a PC company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices,” he said in a statement. Intel said the job cuts will include “voluntary and involuntary departures” over the coming year, some of them occurring as Intel consolidates some of its PC chip operations into fewer locations. A spokeswoman declined to say exactly which jobs or locations would be affected. Intel has large campuses in Portland, Oregon; Chandler, Arizona; Rio Rancho, New Mexico; and Santa Clara and Folsom, California. It also has facilities in countries including Israel and China. Most of the affected workers will be notified in the next 60 days. The cuts are likely to involve divisions making and selling chips for traditional desktop and laptop computers, Moorhead said. He noted Intel has signaled its plans to continue investing in chips for gaming consoles and new “two-in-one” devices that resemble tablets with detachable keyboards. Those devices are still seeing strong sales growth. Krzanich has been trying to change Intel’s focus since he became CEO in 2013, and he’s replaced several top executives in recent months. Intel said Tuesday that longtime Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith will transition to a new position in coming months. But aside from the data center business, which now contributes nearly a third of Intel’s revenue, the markets for Intel’s other new products are still “very embryonic,” according to Mark Hung, an industry analyst at the Gartner research firm. “It’s going to take two to three years before they provide meaningful growth for the company,” Hung said. Krzanich cited Intel’s first-quarter financial performance as evidence the transition is working. Intel reported revenue of $13.70 billion for the first three months of 2016, up 7 percent from the same period a year earlier. That was slightly lower than the $13.73 billion that analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting. Global demand for PCs fell 9.6 percent in the first quarter, according to figures released earlier this month by Gartner. The industry has been in decline for the last four years, Hung noted, but some analysts had expected PC sales to level off this year. Instead, he noted quarterly PC shipments fell below 65 million for the first time since 2007.

Announced as part of a new partnership during this year’s Computex in Taipei, Taiwan, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835-enabled Windows 10 devices could be a game-changer for lightweight and portable Windows 10 machines. We already know that desktop-like performance can be had with the 835 thanks to the Samsung Galaxy S8’s Android-powered computer interface. Instead of running a custom-built desktop, future Snapdragon 835 devices will be able to run Windows 10 natively. Don’t think this means that the next wave of smartphones, or the likes of the HTC U11 will suddenly become Windows 10 devices. The Windows 10-compatible Snapdragon 835 is a slightly different SKU to ensure it works better with Microsoft’s OS.  What this really means is a slew of affordable, low-power, lightweight Windows 10 ultraportables running on Qualcomm’s chips. It’s unlikely this means the end of Intel’s, somewhat lacklustre, mobile chips, but it does certainly apply some pressure on the manufacturer. Currently no Snapdragon 835 Windows 10 devices have been unveiled, but we do know that HP, Lenovo and Asus are all working on manufacturing some. It’s expected the first slew will arrive later this year, priced in the $400 – $700 range. Going by the mentioned manufacturers, it’s likely these won’t be phone-like devices, but could be lightweight Windows 10 tablets that can dock into a full desktop experience. Video of Windows 10 on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 Mobile PC Platform Microsoft and Qualcomm claim that this is full-fat Windows 10, not some sort of cutdown OS like Windows RT was. Qualcomm sees the 835 as competing with Intel’s Y chips and, while it’s not going to be the performance beast gamers would want, it should be more than capable enough of simple photo editing and any light workload most users will want on the move. The real benefits of switching from an Intel chip to a Qualcomm one come in the form of better battery life and superior connectivity. Not only is Qualcomm well versed on the connectivity front, trying to create mesh networks for the home and bring superior 5G mobile connectivity speeds, but the Snapdragon 835’s integrated Gigabit X16 LTE means a Windows 10 device could offer always-on connectivity. Combine that with eSIMs and your portable Windows 10 machine could literally always be connected even when you don’t have Wi-Fi. See related  Qualcomm is building the solution to your Wi-Fi woes Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 preview: Better battery life, faster charging and a focus on VR In terms of battery life, the 10nm Snapdragon 835 is smaller and more power efficient than Intel’s mobile chips. Not only does this mean more room to slide in a bigger battery due to Snapdragon 835’s 30% smaller chipboard, but it’s BigLittle architecture allows for the high-power cores to run idle when not in use – meaning your battery isn’t sapped. Qualcomm claims that all of this results in up to 50% longer battery life compared to “a competing solution” and four to five times better connected standby. This, should, result in a truly all-day battery life for a Qualcomm-enabled Windows 10 machine. It’s going to be a little while until we get to see one of these devices in operation, but when they do finally emergy it could completely change the ultraportable market. Only time will tell, but it’s clear Microsoft believes Qualcomm has what it takes to give Intel a run for its money.

The Taipai-based show started on 30 May, and ever since then, we've been gleaning through the press conferences and more to determine what's noteworthy. We managed to narrow it to five products - with a couple of them more overarching concepts than actual hardware. However, they're design templates and processing chipsets that could change the way we perceive PCs and gaming laptops for years to come. Here are our top five tech products at this year's Computex. Computex 2017: All the announcements that matter Intel Core i9 X-Series Intel Intel Core i9 X-Series is a hardcore gamer's delight Desktop processors aren't exactly exciting. With each new one, you can expect more power and more efficiency. So, when a company comes along and introduces a new processor with an insane amount of horsepower, especially at a time when everyone is clamoring for more of it, you take notice. Intel’s Core i9 is the first consumer desktop processor to pack 18 cores and 36 threads into one piece of silicon. That matters when consumers are streaming more 4K video and jumping into more virtual reality experiences than ever before. The more cores and threads there are in a single CPU, the more dedicated tasks it can handle simultaneously without compromising performance. Needless to say, a 18-core, 36-thread processor is a bit much for some people, but for others using intensive apps it's a no-brainer. A video editor, for instance, will want Intel’s $1,700 CPU. Or anyone who compiles code or runs VR experiences or live-streams games or tends to manage several interrelated tasks at once (think: streaming, recoding, broadcasting, chatting, etc -- all simultaneously). Intel even upgraded its Turbo Boost in order to give a pick-up to the two top-performing cores for single-threaded or light-threaded workloads. MSI GS63VR Stealth Pro Pocket-lint MSI GS36VR Stealth Pro preview: Taking gaming laptops to the Max-Q If you want a powerful gaming laptop, you usually have to choose between thick, heavy machines with monster graphics cards or slim ones with lower-performing GPUs. In other words, hefty laptops tend to equal more power. However, MSI's new laptop, the GS63VR Stealth Pro, makes it so we no longer have to compromise. It packs a Nvidia GTX 1070 graphics and a 15-inch HDR (120Hz, 3ms) display. And it's just 17.7mm thick and 4.2 pounds heavy. MSI said it's slimmest laptop available with this GPU and display. While the late 2016 version of the MSI GS63VR had the same exact thickness and weight, it packed Nividia's GTX 1060 GPU. The updated model also has MSI's Cooler Boost Trinity technology with five different heat pipes and advanced "Whirlwind" fan blades to keep your system cool. Other features include a non-mechanical SteelSeries keyboard with customisable backlighting and ESS Sabre audio MSI also has yet to announce detailed specifications or pricing for the laptop. However, we imagine it'll be available with Intel 7th Generation and quad-core CPUs. Asus Zenbook Pro UX550 Pocket-lint Asus Zenbook Pro UX550: Next-level machine with a 4K touchscreen Asus’ Zenbook range has quite the following, thanks to its very competitive prices. At Computex, Asus announced the latest addition to the family: Zenbook Pro UX550. it's is a revamp of the original Zenbook Pro, which launched a couple of years ago, and it looks like Asus has really gone to the next level in terms of battery life and portability. It’s slim, light, rocks some great specs, and is a bit of a looker. Asus shaved almost 2mm off the earlier model, at 18.9mm, and the weight has dropped from 2.26kg to a mere 1.8kg. It still manages to squeeze in a 14-hour battery life and can charge to 60-per cent capacity in 49 minutes. The top-shelf model even runs on Intel’s H-series core i7 processor and boasts a Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti graphics card, up to 1TB of PCIe x4 SSD storage, and 16GB DDR4 RAM. The display is another strong point with a 15.6-inch UHD 4K NanoEdge touchscreen with super slim 7.3mm bezels that give an 83-per cent screen-to-body ratio. There’s also a quad speaker set up by Harman Kardon, two USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports, two USB 3.1 ports a full sized HDMI port, and a micro SD card reader, and a fingerprint scanner for Microsoft Hello. And it ships with Windows 10 Pro or Home. Asus said it will start off at just over a £1,000 when it lands in July. Nvidia Max-Q design Nvidia Nvidia Max-Q could ensure your next gaming laptop has MacBook looks Nvidia has unveiled Max-Q, a design approach that major gaming laptop manufacturers can adopt for a series of Nvidia card-packed notebooks. They will be powerful and designed with gaming firmly at the forefront, but they will also be MacBook-thin and useable as a great, travel anywhere, multipurpose laptops. Max-Q laptops will sport GeForce GTX 1080, 1070, or 1060 graphics processing. They will be engineered with sophisticated thermal and electrical design in order to maintain a thin footprint yet keep cool and quite in operation. Nvidia's proprietary WhisperMode technology will also ensure a Max-Q laptop runs quietly. Manufacturers signed on to produce Max-Q machines include Acer, Asus, Alienware, Gigabyte, Lenovo, and MSI. Expect them to appear on the market from 27 June. Asus ROG Zephyrus Pocket-lint Asus ROG Zephyrus: Slim gaming laptop with Nvidia's latest architecture Republic of Gamers' (ROG) has unveiled an exceptionally impressive-looking gaming laptop at Computex: the Zephyrus. Essentially forget everything you think you know about the necessary form factor for a powerful and efficient gaming laptop, because the Zephyrus is packing a vast amount of power in a minuscule package. It's just 17.9mm thin at the thickest point and 16.9mm at the thinnest. The Zephyrus can run GeForce GTX 1080 without any overheating, thanks to an ingenious cooling system ROG calls Active Aerodynamic System. Essentially, there is a flap on the rear of the base that flips out as you open the lid, allowing for a clear airflow. Plus, heat escapes from the large perforated area above the keyboard. The lid is made of contoured steel and there’s a lovely diamond cut edge. It also boasts a 15.6-inch IPA panel with a 1080p resolution, 7th-generation Core i7 Kaby Lake processor, up to 24GB of RAM, four M.2 PCI ports for super-fast SSD storage, multiple USB ports, including USB-C, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and an HDMI video output (no wired Ethernet, though). Unfortunately, it's an expensive machine. It costs $2,699 in the US, which will set you back £2,600.

To earn a chance to win a free SBC, participate in our 3-minute survey of these 98 sub-$200 hacker-friendly SBCs. Over the last year, LinuxGizmos has reported on dozens of new community backed, open spec, hacker- and developer-friendly single board computers that run Linux and Android. We’ve added these to a curated list of earlier boards to publish a catalog of 98 SBCs. The boards included in our survey must be priced under $200 (not counting shipping), have a promised shipment availability by July, and meet our relatively flexible selection criteria for open source compliance (see farther below). This SBC catalog is a companion to our 2017 hacker boards survey launch announcement, held in partnership with the Linux Foundation’s Linux.com community website. Click on over for a discussion of recent hacker board trends, as well as links to a brief survey. Fill it out, and you will earn a chance at winning one of 27 free SBCs from six different vendors (see prize details in our survey launch announcement). We’ll announce the winners in mid-June. In addition to the 98 product summaries farther below, we have also generated a detailed spreadsheet that compares the major features of all 98 boards. Spreadsheet comparing the survey’s 98 SBCs (click image to view complete spreadsheet) Our list of 98 boards has expanded since our early January catalog of 90 SBCs, which did not include a survey component. Our June 2016 catalog and survey had 81 boards, and the May 2015 catalog had 53.   Selection criteria Determining the criteria for community backed, open-spec SBCs is always a challenge. No SBC is completely open source, especially given the state of opaque GPUs and sometimes sketchily documented CPUs, although the RISC-V architecture may change this in the coming years. Few of the boards on our list explicitly claim fully open source hardware licensing. At the very least, however, the projects must post extensive specs, as well as schematics for expansion I/O at a minimum, or for the carrier portion of sandwich-style boards. The projects must also offer at least some community and technical support for individual developers, such as forums, tutorials, and other resources for sharing tips and designs based on the SBCs. More important to most customers is the need for open source Linux or Android distributions for download that can dependably exploit the boards’ resources. In the case of new SBCs, we allow a bit of a grace period to post the above resources in a timely manner. The summaries below provide brief descriptions and specs of each board in our survey, along with links to related coverage here at LinuxGizmos.com and at supplier product pages. The listed prices are the lowest we saw at publication, but the pricing on many of these boards is fairly fluid. Typically, the prices do not include free shipping, or if so, only to certain regions. Sometimes the shipping prices can be considerable, turning a $35 board, for example, into a $50 board. Since LinuxGizmos has an international audience, we did not attempt to include shipping costs in the listed board prices. We welcome reader comments on all of the above, especially in regard to your experiences with software and support. Please participate in the discussion area at the conclusion of this post.

The boards offer Arduino-compatible expansion, low power consumption, and a modular COM+baseboard design. Features include Fast Ethernet, USB 2.0, and microSD connections, plus 17x digital I/O pins and 6x analog inputs. A $69 One model adds HD audio and more expansion I/O. There’s also an EduCake mini-PC version and a SeeedStudio version of the One. This appears to be a fading project however, with very little activity in the forum.   A20-OlinuXino-Lime2 Company/project — Olimex, OlinuXino, Mouser Product page Processor — Allwinner A20 (2x Cortex-A7 @ 1GHz); Mali-400 GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM; optional 4GB eMMC version Price — $50 (45 Euros); $61 (55 Euros) for 4GB version Bulgaria-based Olimex’s OlinuXino project is one of the older hacker board projects around, but lately it seems more focused on the open source, but not Linux compatible ESP32 platform. There’s plenty of activity on the oLinuXino forums concerning its Linux boards, however, and earlier this year the project released an open source, Linux-driven Teres-A64 laptop kit based on the Allwinner A64 for 225 Euros. Meanwhile, there’s still interest in the older A20-OlinuXino-Lime2, which offers a Gigabit Ethernet (GbE, or 10/100/1000Mbps) port, microSD slot, HDMI port, LCD interface, 3x USB ports, battery support, and 160x GPIOs. The 84 x 60mm SBC is available with Android 4.2.2 or Debian Jessie with Linux 3.4.1 images. Last year, the Lime2 switched to the same PCB Revision G used by the Lime2-4GB/eMMC, bringing an up-to-date RTL8211E Ethernet PHY, grounded mount holes, and a streamlined shape without the cutouts found on the 4GB model.   A20-OlinuXino-Micro Company/project — Olimex, OlinuXino, Mouser LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner A20 (2x Cortex-A7 @ 1GHz); Mali-400 GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM; optional 4GB NAND Price — $61 (55 Euros); $72 (65 Euros) for 4GB version The A20-OlinuXino-Micro has all the I/O of the first-gen Lime models, and adds VGA, LCD with touch support, and audio I/O. This larger, 142 x 83mm board offers expansion connectors with optional I/O modules. The 4GB NAND version is otherwise identical.   A33-OlinuXino Company/project — Olimex, OlinuXino, Mouser Product page Processor — Allwinner A33 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.2GHz); Mali-400 GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM; 4GB NAND version available Price — $40 (36 Euros) or $49 (44 Euros) for 4GB version The A33-OlinuXino has a faster quad-core Allwinner A33 SoC compared to earlier OlinuXino boards, but it offers a reduced feature set. The only real-world ports are a mini-USB OTG port, audio jacks with 100dB codec, and a 5V jack. Two unassembled 40-pin connectors support GPIO, as well as up to 1280 x 800 LCD and dual MIPI-CSI (5- and 8-megapixel) interfaces. Other features include a debug connector, a LiPo charger, and a step-up converter. The 71 x 66mm SBC is smaller than the A20-based Lime and Lime2 boards. You can download images for Android 4.4 and Debian Jesse with Linux 3.4.39.   Arduino Industrial 101 Company/project — Arduino LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Qualcomm Atheros AR9331 (1x MIPS24k @ up to 400MHz) Memory — 64MB DDR2 RAM; 16MB SPI flash Price — $38.50 The Arduino wars are now over, but we haven’t seen many new official Arduino boards since the reunification except for the non-Linux, Sigfox-ready MKRFOX1200. The two websites have yet to merge, with each offering a slightly different set of features. The Linux-ready, sandwich-style Arduino Industrial 101 is still available on Arduino.org in addition to the Arduino.cc page linked to above. The board injects the Linux/WiFi capability of the Arduino Yun into a COM that is integrated with an Arduino-enabled baseboard. The module incorporates a soldered down Linino Chiwawa LGA module that runs Linino (a version of OpenWrt) on an AR9331 WiFi SoC, accompanied by 64MB DDR2 RAM and 16MB SPI flash. The carrier adds a 16MHz ATmega32u4 MPU along with 2.5KB SRAM and 32KB flash. There’s also a USB OTG port and 20x DIO pins that include UARTs, 7x PWMs, Ethernet, and 12x analog inputs.   Arduino Yun / Yun PoE Company/project — Arduino Product page Processor — Qualcomm Atheros AR9331 (1x MIPS24k @ up to 400MHz) Memory — 64MB DDR2 RAM Price — $68.20 (Yun) or (Yun PoE) $78.10 This original Arduino Yun is still available at Arduino.org, and the new Arduino Yun PoE version is sold by Arduino.cc (see link above), but not vice versa. The smaller Arduino Yun Mini is listed on both sites, but is out of stock, with no promises of a refresh. For $10 more than the Yun, the Arduino Yun PoE adds Power-over-Ethernet to the original Yun design, letting you power the board over the 10/100 Ethernet port with the help of an included add-on module. Both versions run the OpenWrt-based Linino on Qualcomm’s 400MHz AR9331 WiFi SoC while also processing Arduino code on an Atmel Atmega32U4. Linux-driven components include the 2.4GHz WiFi-n radio, USB 2.0 host port, and microSD slot. Arduino-controlled interfaces on the 5V board include 20x DIO pins, 7x PWM outputs, and 12x analog I/O pins. Alternatively, buyers with existing Arduinos can still purchase the $49, OpenWrt-driven Arduino Yun Shield, which brings a Yun experience to any Arduino board.   Arduino Tian Company/project — Arduino LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Qualcomm Atheros AR9432 (1x MIPS24k @ up to 560MHz); Atmel SAMD21G18 Cortex M0+ MCU (48MHz) Memory — 64MB DDR2 RAM; 4GB eMMC; 256KB flash and 32KB RAM for SAMD21G18 Price — $95.70 Compared to the Arduino Yun and Yun Mini PoE, the 68.5 x 53mm Arduino Tian runs Linino on a faster Atheros AR9432, and uses a more powerful, 32-bit Atmel SAMD21G18 MCU. In addition to providing WiFi, the Tian adds a Qualcomm CSR8510 chip for Bluetooth EDR/BLE 4.0a support. You also get a USB 2.0 host port, a GbE port, and 4GB eMMC. On the Arduino side, there are 6x analog pins and 12x PWM outputs.   Banana Pi BPI-M2 Company/project — SinoVoip LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner A31 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.0GHz); PowerVR SGX544MP2 GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM Price — $40 SinoVoip’s Banana Pi M2, which sells for a low of $40 on Amazon, closely resembles the RPi Model B+, complete with a 40-pin connector. The M2 features GbE, WiFi, five USB ports, and a range of display and camera interfaces. We removed the smaller, Allwinner H3 based, SATA-enabled Banana Pi M2+ from our list because it appears to be out of stock. We could only find it at AliExpress in a stripped-down, $22 EDU version without wireless or onboard flash, or as a $27 to $35 offering that appears to be aimed at OEM customers.   Banana Pi BPI-M2 Ultra Company/project — SinoVoip LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner R40 (4x Cortex-A7); Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 2GB DDR3 RAM; 8GB to 64GB eMMC Price — $40 The Banana Pi M2 Ultra can be found for a low of $40 on Amazon with free shipping, but it ranges up to $60 elsewhere. It essentially replaces the similarly 92 x 60mm M2, but offers a faster Allwinner R40, which also enables a SATA connector. In the process, one of the four USB host ports was sacrificed. There’s also a generous 2GB of RAM, which is unusual for a Cortex-A7 SoC. The M2 Ultra is further equipped with GbE, WiFi, Bluetooth, micro-USB OTG, a 40-pin connector that supports Raspberry Pi add-ons, and several display and camera interfaces.   Banana Pi BPI-M3 Company/project — SinoVoip Product page Processor — Allwinner A83T (8x Cortex-A7 @ 1.8GHz); PowerVR SGX544MP1 GPU Memory — 2GB LPDDR3 RAM; 8GB to 64GB eMMC Price — $74 fy SinoVoip’s Banana Pi M3 (BPI-M3), which features the octa-core Allwinner A83T SoC, sells for $74 at AliExpress and a dollar more at Amazon, both with 2GB RAM and 8GB eMMC. The M3 has about the same size (92 x 60mm), layout, and features of the M2 Ultra, and similarly integrates a RPi-ready 40-pin link. Like the M2 Ultra, the M3 supplies GbE, WiFi, SATA, 3x USB, and multiple display and camera options. Software support is more extensive than some other Banana Pi boards, although all have improved (see the download locator here). Options include Android 5.1, Debian 8, Ubuntu 16.04 Mate, Raspbian Jesse Mate, Kano, Kali, CentOS, Gentoo, OpenSUSE, Arch, CRUX, and Fedora.   Banana Pi BPI-M64 Company/project — SinoVoip LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner A64 (4x Cortex-A53 @ 1.2GHz); Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 2GB DDR3 RAM; 8GB to 64GB eMMC Price — $74 SinoVoip’s first 64-bit Banana Pi has a high price ($74 at AliExpress) compared to the similarly Allwinner A64-equipped Pine A64, but it’s loaded with 2GB RAM and numerous peripherals. You get 4K-ready HDMI, MIPI-DSI, and MIPI-CSI, as well as onboard wireless and GbE connections. The 92 x 60mm board is further equipped with 3x USB host ports, a micro-USB OTG, and an RPi 40-pin connector.   Banana Pro Company/project — LeMaker LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner A20 (2x Cortex-A7 @ 1GHz); Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM Price — $48 Compared to the rival Banana Pi M2 boards from former partner SinoVoip, LeMaker’s own Banana Pi update sticks closer to the original, retaining the dual-core A20 SoC. The Banana Pro features a SATA connector and an RPi-like 40-pin connector. Other features include microSD, WiFi, 2x USB host ports, and a micro-USB OTG. LeMaker also offers a LeMaker Guitar SBC, as well as a 96Boards-compatible HiKey board (see farther below).   BeagleBone Black, Rev C Company/project — BeagleBoard.org LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — TI Sitara AM3358 (1x Cortex-A8 @ 1GHz) with PRU MCU chips; PowerVR SGX530 GPU Memory — 512MB RAM; 4GB eMMC Price — $48 The Debian-ready BeagleBone Black Rev C, which came in at third place out of 81 in our June 2016 survey, is available from numerous sources, with the $48 MCM Electronics currently offering the lowest price. This industrial-oriented SBC stands out with its numerous expansion interfaces and programmable “PRU” MCUs, as well as its deeply rooted BeagleBoard.org community and ecosystem. In recent years, the design has spawned several BeagleBoard.org authorized clones. In addition to two SeeedStudio BeagleBone Green models, Octavo’s BeagleBone Black Wireless, and BeagleBoard.org’s own BeagleBone Blue (see reports below), these include Element14’s new BeagleBone Black Industrial 4G, which is identical to the BB Black except for its conformal coating and -20 to 85°C support. SanCloud’s feature-rich BeagleBone Enhanced shipped to Indiegogo backers, and although the design is free to use, the board itself is no longer available. As for the long delayed, dual-core Cortex-A15 based BeagleBoard-X15 successor to the venerable BeagleBoard, it’s finally available from locations including Mouser. At a low of $264, however, it’s over our $200 limit.   BeagleBone Black Wireless Company/project — BeagleBoard.org; Octavo Systems LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Octavo Systems OSD3358 SiP with TI Sitara AM3358 (1x Cortex-A8 @ 1GHz) with PRU MCUs; PowerVR SGX530 GPU Memory — 512MB RAM; 4GB eMMC Price — $68.75 This BeagleBoard.org backed, Octavo Systems built alternative to Seeed’s BeagleBone Green Wireless (see below) similarly adds 2.4GHz 802.11a/b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.1 BLE to the BeagleBone Black design. Unlike Seeed’s two BB Green models, the BeagleBone Black Wireless retains the BB Black’s micro-HDMI port, but removes the Ethernet port. It is otherwise identical to the BB Black with one big exception: It incorporates the Octavo Systems OSD3358 SiP (system-in-package) module, “which integrates BeagleBone functionality into one easy-to-use BGA package,” making it easier to create custom variations.   BeagleBone Blue Company/project — BeagleBoard.org LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Octavo Systems OSD3358 SiP with TI Sitara AM3358 (1x Cortex-A8 @ 1GHz) with PRU MCU chips and PowerVR SGX530 GPU Memory — 512MB RAM; 4GB eMMC Price — $80 This robotics-focused BeagleBoard.org collaboration with the UCSD Coordinated Robotics Lab is a BeagleBone clone that adds motion control and battery friendly power. Like the BeagleBone Black Wireless, the BeagleBone Blue integrates a TI WiLink 8 with WiFi and Bluetooth 4.1 LE, as well as an Octavo Systems OSD3358 SiP module that encapsulates the Sitara AM3358 SoC, RAM, and flash along with a PMIC and other features. There’s no Ethernet port or display interfaces, but you get micro-USB 2.0 host and client ports, 8x servo outputs, 4x DC motor outputs, and 4x quad encoder inputs. Other features include an IMU, barometer, JTAG, and GPS and DSM2 radio interfaces. There’s a wide-range 9-18V DC input, a LiPo battery connector, and the usual extensive list of BB Black interfaces. Plenty of user buttons and LEDs are also onboard. The BeagleBone Blue defaults to a real-time enhanced Debian stack, but also runs Ubuntu Core, and supports ROS and ArduPilot.   BeagleBone Green Company/project — SeeedStudio; BeagleBoard.org LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — TI Sitara AM3358 (1x Cortex-A8 @ 1GHz) with PRU MCU chips; PowerVR SGX530 GPU Memory — 512MB RAM; 4GB eMMC Price — $39 SeeedStudio’s BeagleBoard.org-sanctioned, IoT-focused re-spin of the BeagleBone Black sells for a low of $39 at Banana Robotics. The BeagleBone Green loses the BB Black’s micro-HDMI port and 5V barrel jack connector. However, it costs less, and it adds expansion connectors for Seeed’s Grove sensors. It also replaces the mini-USB connector with a micro-USB port. Seeed offers its own Grove-oriented BB Green developers site in addition to drawing on the support of the larger BeagleBoard community.   BeagleBone Green Wireless Company/project — SeeedStudio; BeagleBoard.org LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — TI Sitara AM3358 (1x Cortex-A8 @ 1GHz) with PRU MCU chips; PowerVR SGX530 GPU Memory — 512MB RAM; 4GB eMMC Price — $49.90 The BeagleBone Green Wireless has the same base feature set as the BB Green, with identical additions and subtractions from the BB Black, including the addition of a Grove interface. The Wireless model adds WiFi and Bluetooth, as well as three more USB host ports for a total of four, making it the USB leader among all the currently announced BB Black clones. A TI WiLink8 module is now standard, boosting wireless capabilities to Bluetooth 4.1 LE and 2.4GHz 802.11a/b/g/n with 2×2 MIMO.   Bubblegum-96 Company/project — uCRobotics LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Actions Semiconductor Actions S900 (4x Cortex-A53 @ 1.8GHz); PowerVR G6230 GPU Memory — 2GB LPDDR3 RAM; 8GB eMMC Price — $89 Based on an earlier ActDuino S900 prototype, the uCRobotics Bubblegum-96 adopts Linaro’s 96Boards CE spec.

Prices range to $160, but you can get it for a low of $146 at Netgate. The board includes a low-speed expansion header that provides Arduino-like prototyping I/O, as well as a 60-pin high speed connector for add-on boards called Lures. Other I/O includes dual USB ports plus GbE, micro-HDMI, and SATA. Firmware support includes Debian, Ubuntu, Yocto Project, Android 4.4, and Windows 10. The Turbot Dual, has recently been joined by an almost identical MinnowBoard Turbo Quad-core (see item below).   MinnowBoard Turbot Quad-core Company/project — Intel, ADI, MinnowBoard.org LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Intel Atom E3845 (4x Bay Trail @ 1.91GHz); Intel HD Graphics Memory — 2GB DDR3L RAM Price — $190 The MinnowBoard Turbo Quad-core, which began shipping only last week, has the same 99 x 74mm footprint as the dual-core Turbot Dual, and much the same layout and feature set. The Quad advances to the quad-core, 1.91GHz Atom E3845 from the same 22nm Bay Trail generation, and adds a heatsink, a fan, and a faster Intel I210 GbE controller. Almost a year ago, ADI announced a larger (103 x 99mm) MinnowBoard Turbot Dual-E SBC with a choice of dual-core Atom E3826 or quad-core E3845 SoCs. The Dual-E is named for it second GbE port, and it also offers an M.2/micro-SIM combo for WiFi, LTE, or SSD. There’s still no word on pricing or availability.   MYS-6ULX SBC Company/project — MYIR LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — NXP i.MX6 ULL or i.MX6 UL (1x Cortex-A7 @ 528MHz or 696MHz, respectively); 2D PXP GPU Memory — 256MB DDR3 RAM; 256MB NAND Price — $24.80 (i.MX6 ULL) or $26.80 (UL) MYIR is primarily a commercial board vendor, but it has spun several open-spec hacker boards like the MYS-6ULX SBC that have crossover appeal to makers. Others include the Rico Board (Sitara) and Z-turn (Zynq) (see farther below). The $25 to $27 MYS-6ULX offers a choice of i.MX6 UL (UltraLite) or its newer, down-clocked sibling, the i.MX6 ULL. Each SBC model has its own unique super power: The i.MX6 UL version offers -40 to 85°C support instead of 0 to 70°C, and the i.MX6 ULL model features a USB-powered WiFi radio. Otherwise, the 70 x 55mm boards are identical. You get a microSD slot, Fast Ethernet port, USB host and micro-USB 2.0 OTG ports, a debug connector, and an LCD interface with optional touchscreens. The dual 20-pin expansion connectors can be used to attach an optional baseboard, which is not yet available. The MYS-6ULX comes with an open source Linux BSP with a 4.1.15 kernel and either Debian or Yocto Project with ported Qt. There’s no forum or dedicated community site, but you get full schematics and extensive documentation.   NanoPC-T3 Company/project — FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Samsung S5P6818 (8x Cortex-A53 @ 400MHz to 1.4GHz); Mali-400 MP GPU Memory — 1GB or 2GB DDR3 RAM; 8GB eMMC Price — $60 FriendlyElec (AKA FriendlyARM) now offers at least a dozen SBC SKUs, depending on how you delineate them, leading us for the first time to apply our 10-product limit and trim a few from the list. Those that didn’t make it are noted in the blurbs of similar NanoPi models. The 100 x 60mm NanoPC-T3 is one of the few without NanoPi branding. As the PC nomenclature suggests, this is one of the most feature-rich FriendlyElec boards. Equipped with an octa-core Samsung S5P6818, the NanoPC-T3 SBC is almost identical to the earlier, quad-core NanoPC-T2. In addition to the faster processor, the T3 adds a 2GB RAM option. Other features common to both NanoPC boards include an SD slot, GbE, WiFi, and Bluetooth 4.0. The board provides 4x USB host, a micro-USB client, and media ports include HDMI, LVDS, LCD, MIPI-DSI, MIPI-CSI, and audio. In place of the usual 40-pin RPi connector, the NanoPC-T3 provides a 30-pin GPIO header.   NanoPi A64 Company/project — FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner A64 (4x Cortex-A53 @ 1.2GHz); Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM Price — $25 The NanoPi A64, which appeared in December, was FriendlyElec’s first 64-bit quad-core NanoPi. It has since been joined by the NanoPi K2 and NanoPi Neo 2, and there’s also the earlier octa-core NanoPi-T3. The NanoPi A64 has a compact, 64 x 60mm footprint that matches that of the NanoPi M3. The board provides two USB host ports, a power-only micro-USB, and HDMI, MIPI-DSI, microSD, audio, and DVP camera connections. The 5V SBC offers GbE and WiFi, but no Bluetooth, and you get the NanoPi-typical 40-pin Raspberry Pi expansion header. Images are available for Ubuntu Core and Ubuntu Mate. Most of the NanoPi boards are available with a growing list of options ranging from cases to heat sinks to camera modules. Shipping to the U.S., however, is expensive. Single-unit prices range from $16 to $36, compared to under $4 for the Orange Pi project.   NanoPi K2 Company/project — FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Amlogic S905 (4x Cortex-A53 @ 1.5GHz); Mali-450 MP2 GPU Memory — 2GB DDR3 RAM Price — $40 If the specs for the video-oriented NanoPi K2 look familiar, that’s because they almost perfectly mimic the $46 Odroid-C2, which aside from the processor is itself a near doppelgänger of the $35 Raspberry Pi 3. The NanoPi K2 has the same quad -A53 Amlogic SoC and 85 x 56mm footprint as the Odroid-C2, as well as similar features like 2GB RAM, 4x USB, GbE, and a 40-pin RPi-like bus. Unlike the Odroid-C2, but like the RPi 3, the NanoPi K2 adds WiFi and Bluetooth 4.0, so you don’t have to use up a USB port. The Amlogic S905 with Mali 450 GPU is considerably more powerful than the RPi3’s Broadcom/VideoCore IV SoC, and [email protected] decoding and DVFS. Android 5.1 is available, with Ubuntu in development.   NanoPi M1 Company/project — FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H3 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.2GHz); ARM Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 512MB or 1GB DDR3 RAM Price — $15 or $20 (1GB) The 69 × 48mm NanoPi M1 adopts the quad-core Allwinner H3, the same SoC found on the $10, H3-based Orange Pi One. The M1 offers more features, however, including a CVBS A/V output, an IR receiver, a mic, and two more USB 2.0 host ports for a total of three. Standard features shared by both include microSD, Fast Ethernet, HDMI, DVP camera, and a 40-pin RPi connector. Images are available for Ubuntu MATE and Ubuntu Core. Last year, LinkSprite launched a rebranded version of the NanoPi M1 called the pcDuino4 Nano, selling for $25 with 1GB.   NanoPi M1 Plus Company/project — FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H3 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.2GHz); ARM Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM; 8GB eMMC Price — $35 This recent, more feature-rich version of the $15 NanoPi M1 retains the Allwinner H3, but is slightly smaller at 64 × 60mm. The higher price reflects the standard 1GB RAM and 8GB eMMC, as well as new features like WiFi, Bluetooth, mic, and the advance to Gigabit Ethernet. One of the three USB 2.0 host ports, however, has moved to an onboard header. OS options include Ubuntu Mate, Ubuntu Core, Debian, and Android.   NanoPi M2A / M3 Company/project — FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Samsung S5P4418 (4x Cortex-A9 @ 400MHz to 1.4GHz with 3D GPU) for M2A or Samsung S5P6818 (8x Cortex-A53 @ 400MHz to 1.46GHz with Mali-400MP GPU) for M3 Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM Price — $30 (M2A) or $35 (M3) The recently released NanoPi M2A replaces the similarly Samsung S5P4418 driven, $25 NanoPi M2, which we removed from the list due to being out of stock. Aside from the SoC, the NanoPi M2A is almost exactly like the still available, $35, octa-core Samsung S5P6818 based NanoPi M3, so we’ve combined the two SBCs here. The 64 x 60mm footprint, layout, and features appear to be identical except for the M2A’s addition of an onboard mic and a switch from a 5V @ 2A to a 5V @ 3A input. Both SBCs provide WiFi, BT 4.0, and a GbE port, plus media interfaces like HDMI, LCD, LVDS, DVP, and audio. They both offer dual USB 2.0 host ports and two more USB headers, a micro-USB port, and a 40-pin, RPi-ready header. Images listed for the NanoPi M2A include Android 4.4 and 5.1, Debian 8.1, and Ubuntu Core with Qt.   NanoPi 2 Fire Company/project — FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM) Product page Processor — Samsung S5P4418 (4x Cortex-A9 @ 400MHz to 1.4GHz); 3D GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM Price — $29 The NanoPi 2 Fire replaces the earlier NanoPi 2 SBC, and similarly runs Android or Debian on a quad -A9 S5P4418 SoC. The Fire swaps out the earlier wireless module for a GbE port, and adds a PMIC. The 75 x 40mm SBC offers both an HDMI port and an LCD interface, and supplies a DVP camera link. Other features include a microSD slot, a 40-pin RPi connector, a micro-USB OTG port, and a USB host port.   NanoPi Neo/Neo2 Company/project — FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H3 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.2GHz with Mali-400 MP2 GPU) for Neo or Allwinner H5 (4x Cortex-A53 @ 1.2GHz with Mali-450 GPU) for Neo2 Memory — 256MB or 512MB DDR3 RAM (Neo) or 512MB DDR3 (Neo2) Price — $8 or $10 (512MB) for Neo or $15 for Neo2 Earlier this year, the quad -A7, 40 x 40mm NanoPi Neo was joined by a 64-bit quad -A53 near twin called the NanoPi Neo2. The Neo2 is the same as the Neo except for the faster SoC, GbE instead of 10/100 Ethernet, two more USB headers, and lack of a 256MB RAM option. Both boards, along with a third, wireless enabled Neo Air option (see below) are the world’s smallest and most affordable quad-core ARM SBCs. At 40 x 40mm, they consume only 1,600 square millimeters, compared to 1,950 sq. mm for the 65 x 30mm Raspberry Pi Zero. The NanoPi Neo and Neo2 are further equipped with microSD, USB 2.0 host, and micro-USB OTG ports. All three Neo boards, which run Ubuntu Core or Mate, lack display or camera interfaces. You get 36 GPIO pins instead of the usual RPi connector.   NanoPi Neo Air Company/project — FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H3 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.2GHz); ARM Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 512MB DDR3 RAM; 8GB eMMC Price — $20 The NanoPi Neo Air is a juiced up NanoPi Neo. This headless, IoT board has the same minisicule 40 x 40mm footprint, and similarly runs Ubuntu Core and Mate on an Allwinner H3. The Neo Air comes standard with 512MB of RAM, and adds 8GB eMMC, WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, and a DVP camera connector. The Air also sacrifices the Ethernet port and the sole USB host port, however, leaving you only a micro-USB OTG for power and data. You can get more USB ports or a power connection via the split bank of 36 GPIO pins.   NanoPi S2 Company/project — FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Samsung S5P4418 (4x Cortex-A9 @ 400MHz to 1.4GHz); 3D GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM; 8GB eMMC Price — $45 The NanoPi S2 is like a pumped up, wireless-enabled NanoPi 2 Fire, sharing the same 75 x 40mm footprint and quad -A9 S5P4418 with Debian and Android support. Other common features include USB 2.0 host and micro-USB ports, a microSD slot, a PMIC, a 40-pin RPi connector, and links for LCD and camera. The NanoPi S2 dispenses with the Fire’s GbE port, but adds WiFi and Bluetooth 4.0. It also shrinks the HDMI port to mini-HDMI. Unlike the 2 Fire, the S2 features 8GB of eMMC, an ADC pin header, an audio jack, and an LVDS interface.   Odroid-C0 Company/project — Hardkernel, Odroid project LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Amlogic S805 (4x Cortex-A5 @ 1.5GHz); Mali-450 GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM; optional eMMC 4.5 Price — $30.80 (with $1.80 Connector Pack) Aimed at IoT and robotics, the Odroid-C0 is a smaller (65 x 56mm), somewhat stripped-down version of the Odroid C and C+ (see below). It has the same quad-core -A5 Amlogic SoC, and offers the same Ubuntu and Android 4.4 support with GCC 4.9.2 Linux toolchain. The C0’s only coastline port is an HDMI port. However, an optional Connector Pack lets you solder on real-world connections for unpopulated interfaces including dual USB host, serial console, IR, I2S, and an RPi 40-pin interface. A battery connector with charging circuit supports an optional 3.7V Li-Po battery. Internet connectivity requires an optional WiFi dongle. As with all Odroid boards, the price includes worldwide shipping.   Odroid-C1+ Company/project — Hardkernel, Odroid project LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Amlogic S805 (4x Cortex-A5 @ 1.5GHz); Mali-450 GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM; optional 8GB eMMC Price — $35 The Odroid-C1+ upgraded the earlier, very similar Odroid-C1 with features like a full-size HDMI port, a standard heatsink, and I2S audio and micro-USB-OTG links. The C1+ has a price, footprint, and feature set that is almost identical to the original, 32-bit Raspberry Pi 2, but is more fully open source, has a faster processor, and supports Android 4.4 in addition to Ubuntu 14.04. The C1+ is further equipped with a microSD slot and optional eMMC, as well as GbE, serial console, ADC, and a RPi-compatible 40-pin connector.   Odroid-C2 Company/project — Hardkernel, Odroid project LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Amlogic S905 (4x Cortex-53 @ up to 1.5GHz); Mali-450 MP2 GPU Memory — 2GB DDR3 RAM; optional 8GB eMMC Price — $46 The Odroid-C2 came in second out of 81 hacker SBCs in our June 2016 survey. It has the same 85 x 56mm size and layout as the Odroid-C1+ and Raspberry Pi 3, but advances to a quad -A53 Amlogic S905 SoC. It’s faster and more open source than the RPi 3, but there’s no WiFi or Bluetooth, and the price has edged up to be $11 more expensive. The C2 doubles the RAM of the C1+ to 2GB, and offers a choice of optional storage between up to 64GB of eMMC and an 8GB or 16GB SD 3.01 compatible UHS-1 microSD card. The Odroid-C2 can output 4k/60Hz video, and has almost everything the C1+ has, including GbE and HDMI ports, four USB host ports, and a 40-pin RPi connector. Images are available for Android 5.1 or Ubuntu 16.04, based on a Linux 3.14 LTS kernel.   Odroid-XU4 Company/project — Hardkernel, Odroid project LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Samsung Exynos5422 (4x Cortex-A15 @ 2.0GHz and 4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.4GHz); Mali-T628 MP6 GPU Memory — 2GB LPDDR3 RAM; optional up to 64GB eMMC Price — $59 While the other Odroid boards have crept up in price, the Odroid-XU4 recently received a $15 price cut. This 83 x 58mm Odroid-XU3 replacement uses the same octa-core Exynos5422 and Mali-T628 GPU. Features include a GbE port, audio-enabled HDMI port, 2x USB 3.0 ports, and a USB 2.0 port. The XU4 offers a 12-pin GPIO header in addition to a 30-pin expansion connector. There’s an option for a USB-based SATA 3 module, an I/O board, and various wireless add-ons.

The Orange Pi project has been criticized for poor Linux support and HW quality issues, but it appears to be improving. The Armbian community is helping to improve Linux support, and in March, Shenzhen Xunlong partnered with Canonical to launch an Ubuntu snap app store for its Orange Pi SBCs. Linux and Android OS images available on the Orange Pi site vary widely by board. The first Orange Pi on our list is somewhat atypical. The tiny, 68 x 42mm Orange Pi 2G-IOT can withstand -10 to 65°C temperatures, and runs Android 4.4, Ubuntu, Debian, or an RPi image on a single-core, Cortex-A5 RDA RDA8810PL SoC (typically 1GHz) with an integrated 2G GSM/GPRS/EDGE baseband. The $10 board offers WiFi, BT, and a SIM card slot with 2G antenna. Other features include LCD, MIPI-CSI, and audio interfaces, as well as USB 2.0 host and micro-USB OTG ports, and a 40-pin RPi-style connector.   Orange Pi Lite Company/project — Shenzhen Xunlong Software LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H3 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.2GHz); Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 512MB DDR3 RAM Price — $12 The fetchingly priced Orange Pi Lite, a WiFi variant of the Orange Pi One, offers the 1.2GHz version of the quad-core H3 SoC compared to 1.6GHz on the Orange Pi PC. It’s also limited to a half gig of RAM, and lacks an Ethernet port, but you get a second USB host port. Other features include microSD, WiFi, HDMI, MIPI-CSI, micro-USB OTG, and the usual Orange Pi 40-pin RPi header.   Orange Pi One Company/project — Shenzhen Xunlong Software LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H3 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.2GHz); ARM Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 512MB DDR3 RAM Price — $10 The highly affordable Orange Pi One preceded the similar $12 Lite version. It provides 10/100 Ethernet instead of WiFi, and supplies a single USB host port instead of two. Otherwise, the specs are identical, including microSD, HDMI, MIPI-CSI, micro-USB OTG, and 40-pin connections. Comparing only by price, performance, and features, the Orange Pi One clearly beats the $5 to $25 RPi Zero. Meanwhile, the tiny, H3-based NanoPi M1 has a few more features, but has crept up to $15 to $20. A hands-on report on the Orange Pi One can be found here.   Orange Pi PC / PC Plus Company/project — Shenzhen Xunlong Software LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H3 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.6GHz); Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM; 8GB eMMC on PC Plus Price — $15 ($22 for PC Plus) The $15 Orange Pi PC provides an Allwinner H3, a Raspberry Pi-like 85 x 55mm footprint, and RPi-compatible 40-pin expansion. It has twice the RAM of the Lite and One models, and provides microSD, HDMI, CVBS, CSI, USB OTG, and 10/100 Ethernet connections. A newer Orange Pi PC Plus model adds 8GB of eMMC flash.   Orange Pi PC 2 Company/project — Shenzhen Xunlong Software LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H5 (4x Cortex-A53); Mali-450 MP2 GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM Price — $20 Shenzhen Xunlong’s first 64-bit Orange Pi arrived in November with the same 85 x 55mm footprint, 40-pin RPi header, and many other features found on the Orange Pi PC. However, it offers a quad -A53 Allwinner H5 instead of a quad -A7 H3. The PC 2 is further equipped with 3x USB host ports, as well as micro-USB OTG, HDMI, GbE, microSD, CVBS, audio, and MIPI-CSI.   Orange Pi Plus2 / Plus2E Company/project — Shenzhen Xunlong Software Product page Processor — Allwinner H3 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.6GHz); Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 2GB DDR3 RAM; 8GB eMMC Price — $49 ($35 for Plus2E) Like the Orange Pi 2 and the still available, $39 Orange Pi Plus1, the Orange Pi Plus2 and new Plus2E run distributions such as Lubuntu, Raspbian, and Android on a quad-core, 1.6GHz Allwinner H3. Compared to the Plus1, the Plus2 doubles the RAM to 2GB and expands slightly to 108 x 67mm. Other features appear to be identical, including an RPi-compatible 40-pin connector, four USB host ports, a GbE port, and WiFi. The board is further equipped with micro-USB, microSD, SATA, HDMI, CVBS, and CSI connections. The Orange Pi Plus2E swaps the four-port USB hub for three separate USB ports, and loses the SATA connection, but shaves $14 off the price.   Orange Pi Prime Company/project — Shenzhen Xunlong Software LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H5 (4x Cortex-A53); Mali-450 MP2 GPU Memory — 2GB DDR3 RAM Price — $29.90 Like the $20 Orange Pi PC 2, the $30 Orange Pi Prime offers a quad -A53 Allwinner H5, a 40-pin RPi header, 3x USB host ports, and micro-USB OTG, HDMI, GbE, microSD, CVBS, audio, and MIPI-CSI connections. This larger, 98 x 60mm SBC doubles the RAM to 2GB, however, and adds WiFi, Bluetooth, and extended -10 to 65°C support. Images are available for Android 4.4, Debian Desktop, Ubuntu Desktop, Arch Server, Raspberry Pi, and Banana Pi.   Orange Pi Win Plus / Win Company/project — Shenzhen Xunlong Software LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner A64 (4x Cortex-A53); Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 2GB DDR3 RAM for Win Plus (1GB on Win); optional eMMC Price — $29.90 (Win Plus) or $25 (Win) While most of the new 64-bit Orange Pi models use the Allwinner H5, the 2GB Orange Pi Win Plus and 1GB Orange Pi Win tap the older Allwinner A64, which is much the same except for its weaker Mali-400 GPU. The Win boards, which appear to be named for its upcoming Windows 10 IoT support, can currently run Android 6.0, Ubuntu Desktop/Server Xenial, Debian Server Jessie, and a Raspberry Pi image. The 93 x 60mm SBC is only slightly smaller than the similarly priced and configured, H5-based Orange Pi Prime. Like the Prime, the Win SBCs provide micro-USB OTG, HDMI, GbE, microSD, audio, MIPI-CSI, and 40-pin RPi connections. They similarly furnish WiFi and Bluetooth, and offer -10 to 65°C support. Differences include a MIPI-DSI LCD interface on the Win boards in place of RCA/CVBS/AV, and the availability of 4x USB host ports instead of three. You also get optional eMMC.   Orange Pi Zero Company/project — Shenzhen Xunlong Software LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H2 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.2GHz); Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 256MB or 512MB DDR3 RAM Price — $7 or $9 (512MB) The Orange Pi Zero is the smallest and cheapest SBC in the lineup. Just a bit smaller than the Raspberry Pi Zero, the 48 x 46mm SBC uses an Allwinner H2 SoC that is much like an H3, but is limited to HD instead of 4K video. The headless, IoT-oriented Orange Pi Zero has only a single USB 2.0 host port, as well as a micro-USB OTG for power, but it offers both WiFi and Ethernet. There’s a 26-pin header compatible with older Raspberry Pis, as well as a separate 13-pin high-power interface, 3x GPIO, debug serial, and a mic interface.   Orange Pi Zero Plus 2 H3 / Zero Plus 2 H5 Company/project — Shenzhen Xunlong Software LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H3 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.2GHz with Mali-400 MP2 GPU) or Allwinner H5 (4x Cortex-A53 @ 1.2GHz with ARM Mali-450 MP2 GPU) Memory — 512MB DDR3 RAM; 8GB eMMC Price — $18.90 or $19.90 (H5) These rev’d up versions of the Orange Pi Zero have the same tiny, 48 x 46mm dimensions, but offer a choice of two more powerful processors. The Orange Pi Zero Plus 2 H3 has an Allwinner H3 instead of an H2, which adds 4K support. The Orange Pi Zero Plus 2 H5 advances to a quad -A53 Allwinner H5, which also moves up to a Mali-450 GPU. Otherwise, the H3 and H5 devices are identical and only $1 difference in price. Differences with the still available Zero include the removal of the USB 2.0 host and 10/100 Ethernet ports, as well as the dedicated mic interface. Yet while the headless Zero was limited to an AV-out interface grouped along with other I/O on the still-available 13-pin function header, the Zero Plus 2 boards add an HDMI port and MIPI-CSI camera interface. They also add 8GB eMMC and Bluetooth 4.2, which is provided on an Ampak AP6212 module along with the previously supplied WiFi. It all looks good for low-cost multimedia, except that the H5 version could really use a 1GB RAM option.   Parallella Company/project — Adapteva, Parallella.org LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Xilinx Zynq-7020 or -7010 SoC (2x Cortex-A9 @ 667MHz plus FPGA); 16-core Epiphany RISC chip Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM Price — $99 Aimed at power-efficient server clustering applications and parallel programming research, the ever popular Parallella features a Zynq ARM/FPGA SoC running an optimized Ubuntu 15.05 distro called Parabuntu, plus a homegrown 16-core Epiphany coprocessor. I/O includes microSD, GbE, micro-HDMI, and dual USB ports. Four 60-pin connectors provide extensions for I/O linked to FPGA and its novel Epiphany parallel processing chip. Adapteva also offers a $75 Micro-Server version with a Zynq-7010 that omits the USB, HDMI, and expansion I/O. Also new since last year is a $29.50 Parallella Aluminum Case with heat spreading plate and thermal pad, but it’s currently out of stock. A new Epiphany-V chip with 4.5 billion transistors is now several months overdue.   pcDuino Lite WiFi Company/project — LinkSprite Technologies Product page Processor — Allwinner A10 (1x Cortex-A8 @ 1GHz); Mali-400 GPU Memory — 256MB RAM; 2GB flash Price — $29 LinkSprite’s pcDuino Lite has been retired, but the similar pcDuino Lite WiFi lives on. The 100 x 52mm board runs Ubuntu 12.04 with Linux 3.0 on the old-school, Cortex-A8 Allwinner A10. The 5V board offers 256MB RAM, 2GB flash, an HDMI port, an Arduino-style interface, and of course, WiFi. LinkSprite appears to have retired several other boards over the last year, including the pcDuino2, pcDuino3, and pcDuino3B. The newer Allwinner A20 based pcDuino3 Nano is listed as “out of stock — check back later.”   pcDuino8 Uno Company/project — LinkSprite Technologies Product page Processor — Allwinner H8 (8x Cortex-A7 @ 2GHz); PowerVR SGX544 GPU Memory — 1GB DRAM Price — $49 The pcDuino 8 Uno isn’t listed on LinkSprite’s main pcDuino page, but a shopping page is buried on the site. The board features an octa-core Allwinner H8 clocked to 2GHz, combined with the usual pcDuino Arduino expansion. The 92 x 54mm board provides microSD, GbE, USB host, USB OTG, HDMI, audio, MIPI-CSI, and IR connections. An Android-only PCDuino 8 STB set-top box version for the OEM market ships with slightly different I/O and an enclosure.   Pepper 43R / 43C Company/project — Gumstix Product page Processor — TI Sitara AM3354 (1x Cortex-A8 @ 800MHz); PowerVR SGX530 3D GPU Memory — 512MB RAM Price — $169 Gumstix, which is known for its Overo and DuoVero modules and associated carrier boards, has also shipped some Pepper SBCs in recent years, now supported with full schematics. The original, $250 Pepper that appeared back in 2013 has been replaced with three new models, although with a lower-end TI AM3354 SoC rather than the original AM3359. The AM3354 is paired with a 3D-ready PowerVR GPU, but the SoC lacks the PRU units found on some models. The $169 Pepper 43R and 43C are very similar, but the Pepper DVI-D is sufficiently divergent to deserve its own blurb below. The Pepper 43R supports resistive touchscreens while the Pepper 43C supports capacitive, and each are supported with $39, 4.3-inch Newhaven touchscreen options. The 43R version also adds an 8-ch. bidirectional level shifter and a TI step-down converter among other minor variations. Both boards have a GbE port, microSD slot, dual micro-USB ports, a USB console port, and a TI WiLink 8 WiFi/BT 4.1 LE module with access point mode and U.FL connectors. The Pepper 43 boards are further equipped with 20-pin GPIO, an audio jack, LiPo battery support, a PMIC, and LEDs. The board can be further customized in the Gumstix Geppetto online design and manufacturing service.   Pepper DVI-D Company/project — Gumstix Product page Processor — TI Sitara AM3354 (1x Cortex-A8 @ 800MHz); PowerVR SGX530 3D GPU Memory — 512MB RAM Price — $119 The Pepper DVI-D has a similar size, TI AM3354 SoC, and 512MB RAM as the Pepper 43R and 43C (see above), but has a much lower price and a different layout and purpose. Instead of supporting touchscreens, the Pepper DVI-D features an HDMI port (via DVI-D) to support HD output instead of 720p. Other features include a microSD slot, GbE port, audio jack, console port, USB host port, and dual micro-USB device ports. As with the Pepper 43 boards, images are available for Yocto, Ubuntu, and Android. A community portion of the site shared with other Gumstix developers provides projects and tutorials. Like the other Peppers, the SBC is designed with the Gumstix Geppetto DIY design service, and supports further user customization of I/O using Geppetto. You can then send your design to the related Gumstix Geppetto short-run, fast-turnaround manufacturing service.   PICO-IMX6UL-KIT Company/project — Wandboard.org; Technexion; NXP LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — NXP i.MX6 UltraLite (1x Cortex-A7 @ 528MHz); WXGA graphics Memory — 512MB RAM; 4GB eMMC Price — $65 The sandwich-style PICO-IMX6UL-KIT is last year’s HobbitBoard rebranded and enhanced with 512MB RAM. Instead of supporting Google’s Brillo OS, it comes pre-loaded with Google’s revamped version of Brillo, called Android Things. The PICO-IMX6UL-KIT appears to be the de facto reference platform for the IoT-oriented OS, which also supports the Raspberry Pi 3 and the Intel Edison. Like the HobbitBoard and the almost identical NXP I.MX6UL Development Platform [PDF], the PICO-IMX6UL-KIT is based on TechNexion’s PICO-IMX6UL COM (sold by NXP as the NXP Pico). Despite its commercial foundations, the PICO-IMX6UL-KIT’s COM and carrier have been released with full schematics and open licensing. Aside from the RAM and the OS, the PICO-IMX6UL-KIT is identical to the HobbitBoard, and features a low-power i.MX6 UltraLite (UL), plus WiFi, BT 4.0, 10/100 Ethernet, dual USB ports, an audio jack, and a PMIC. The COM can be removed and plugged into the 70-pin Hirose socket on an Intel Edison carrier. When connected to the 100 x 45mm PICO-IMX6UL-KIT carrier, the Edison connector remains active. The board also offers a MikroBus socket for Click add-ons, as well as four Wandboard-compatible board-to-board expansion headers. The kit goes for as high as $90, but can be found for $65 at ARMkits.   Pine A64 Company/project — Pine64, Inc. LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner A64 (4x Cortex-A53 cores @ 1.2GHz); Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 512MB (standard), 1GB ($19 Plus), 2GB ($29 Plus) DDR3 RAM Price — $15 to $29 This quad-core, 64-bit Raspberry Pi imitator broke new price/performance ground when it arrived last spring, and it’s still very competitive. Standard features include microSD, HDMI, Fast Ethernet, audio, dual USB 2.0 host, and micro-USB ports. The 127 x 79mm board offers a Pi-compatible, 40-pin connector and a 14-pin Euler connector. There’s also an RTC and -20 to 70°C support. The $15 model ships with 512MB RAM, but we recommend the $19 or $29 Plus models, available in 1GB and 2GB configurations, respectively. These higher-end models also boost Ethernet to GbE, and add a touchpanel interface, MIPI-DSI and MIPI-CSI ports, plus display and camera options. Curated OS mainline Linux based images include Android 6.0/7.1, Remix OS 2.0, Debian Jesse Mate, and Ubuntu 16.04 in Mate, Base, and minimal images. The board is further compatible with openSUSE, Armbian, Arch, Fedora, Gentoo, and more. In January, Pine64 released a SODIMM-style SoPine A64 COM featuring the guts of the Pine A64. It also launched an open source Pinebook laptop based on the same A64 processor, sold for $89 (11.6-inch) or $99 (14-inch).   Raspberry Pi Zero Company/project — Raspberry Pi Foundation LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Broadcom BCM2835 (1x ARM1176JZFS core @ 1GHz) with FPU and VideoCore IV dual-core GPU Memory — 512MB SDRAM Price — $5 and up Even when factoring in $5 to $25 more to add various cables and adapters — we’re calling it $14 in our comparison spreadsheet — the $5 Raspberry Pi Zero is still a good deal for space-constrained IoT hacking projects. The tiny, 65 x 30mm Zero upgrades the same ARM11 processor found on the Raspberry Pi A+ and B+ to 1GHz speed. The COM-like SBC ships with a microSD slot, a pair of micro-USB ports, and a mini-HDMI port with audio support, as well as an unpopulated composite video header. Missing are all the USB ports, DSI and CSI ports, and audio jacks found on the Pi 2 and 3.   Raspberry Pi Zero W Company/project — Raspberry Pi Foundation LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Broadcom BCM2835 (1x ARM1176JZFS core @ 1GHz) with FPU and VideoCore IV dual-core GPU Memory — 512MB SDRAM Price — $10 and up The new Raspberry Pi Zero W is identical to the RPi Zero except for the addition of the same Cypress CYW43438 wireless chip found on the $35 Raspberry Pi 3, providing 802.11 b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.1 with BLE. The Zero W is available starting at only $10 at outlets like Cana Kit and BuyaPi, but you need the same add-ons as the Zero to get real-world video and USB ports.   Raspberry Pi 2 Model B 1.2 Company/project — Raspberry Pi Trading LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Broadcom BCM2836 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 900MHz) or on v1.2 model, Broadcom BCM2837 (4x Cortex-A53 @ 900MHz); Broadcom VideoCore IV GPU @ 250MHz Memory — 1GB SDRAM Price — $35 Last October, the Raspberry Pi 2 was revised with a v1.2 model, replacing the quad -A7 based BCM2836 with the same quad-core, Cortex-A53 BCM2837 used on the Raspberry Pi 3. However, the SoC is still clocked to 900MHz instead of 1.2GHz, and the board lacks the RPi 3’s WiFi and Bluetooth module. Otherwise the RPi 2 is almost identical to the faster, wireless-enabled RPi 3, but with no price discount.   Raspberry Pi 3 Model B Company/project — Raspberry Pi Foundation LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Broadcom BCM43437 (4x Cortex-53 @ 1.2GHz); Broadcom VideoCore IV GPU @ 400MHz Memory — 1GB SDRAM Price — $35 The world’s most popular Linux hacker SBC — and the runaway winner of our 2016 survey — is commonly marked up, but it’s still found at the official $35 price at outlets like Circuit Specialists. The Raspberry Pi 3 gives you everything the new RPi 2 v1.2 does at the same price, and adds a higher clock speed plus WiFi and Bluetooth. Some other boards with the same RPI expansion compatibility can beat it on price, performance, and features, and many are more open source than RPi 3, which like its siblings does not provide complete schematics or open source licensing. Yet, if you want guaranteed Raspberry Pi compatibility (and dependability), and membership in the thriving community, this is still your top pick. Last week, the Raspberry Pi Foundation doubled down on its original educational mission by merging with CoderDojo, a non-profit that organizes learn-to-code clubs for kids 7-17. Practically, the Raspberry Pi Foundation is becoming a corporate member of the CoderDojo Foundation, but will otherwise maintain its identify and association with the commercial Raspberry Pi Trading entity.   Rico Board Company/project — MYIR LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — TI AM437x (1x Cortex-A9 core @ up to 1GHz); PowerVR SGX530 GPU Memory — 512MB DDR3 RAM (alternatively 256MB or 1GB); 4GB eMMC flash Price — $99 ($149 for full kit with cables etc.) MYIR’s open-spec, 100 x 65mm Rico Board taps TI’s single-core, Cortex-A9, Sitara AM437x SoC. The SBC integrates HDMI, GbE, and dual USB ports, as well as a 24-bit LCD interface that supports optional 7-inch touchscreens. You also get camera interfaces and dual 40-pin expansion connectors with support for CAN and other industrial I/O.   RioTboard Company/project — Newark Element14, RioTboard.org LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — NXP i.MX6 Solo (1x Cortex-A9 @ up to 1GHz) Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM; 4GB eMMC Price — $79 The RioT (“Revolutionizing the Internet of Things”) board runs Android or Linux on a low-power, single-core Cortex-A9 SoC. The 120 x 75mm SBC offers several advantages over the similar Wandboard Solo, including twice the RAM, built-in flash, and many more USB ports.   SAMA5D4 Xplained Company/project — Newark Element14, Atmel LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Atmel SAMA5D4 (1x Cortex-A5 @ 528MHz) Memory — 512MB DDR2 RAM; 512MB NAND flash Price — $93.50 SAMA5D4 Xplained is a collaboration between Atmel’s Linux4SAM developers site and Newark Element14. The Linux-ready, IoT-focused SBC showcases Atmel’s SAMA5D4 SoC, which like the earlier SAMA5D3, is limited to a single Cortex-A5 core. The SAMA5D4 adds NEON, L2 cache, and security features, and several models support 720p video. The 138 x 88mm Xplained board ships with 512MB each of RAM and NAND flash, and offers partial Arduino compatibility. You also get HDMI, Fast Ethernet, and three USB ports.   SavageBoard Company/project — Poslab Technology LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — NXP i.MX6 Solo, DualLite, or Quad (1x, 2x, or 4x Cortex-A9 @ 1GHz); Vivante CG880 GPU Memory — 512MB (Solo) or 1GB DDR3 RAM; 4GB (Solo) or 8GB eMMC Price — $59 (Solo); $79 (DualLite); $99 (Quad) The aging, but recently revised, Wandboard now has direct competition from the similarly configured, i.MX6 based SavageBoard. The 125 x 95mm SBC is larger than the Wandboard and lacks the Wandboard Quad’s 2GB of RAM, but it’s $20 cheaper. Unlike the Wandboard, the SavageBoard offers onboard eMMC storage, although it lacks the Wandboard’s second microSD slot. Among other differences, the SavageBoard’s SDIO/UART connected WiFi and Bluetooth module is a $35 option whereas wireless is standard on the DualLite and Quad WandBoards. The SavageBoard lacks the Wandboard’s user-available mini-PCIe slot, as well as its S/PDIF audio interface, although it does provide MIPI-DSI in addition to HDMI and MIPI-CSI ports. Other features are similar, including a GbE port, 2x USB 2.0 ports, micro-USB OTG port, and COM and audio ports. BSPs are available for Android 6.0, Yocto Project, and Arch Linux. Poslab also has posted a page on its website for an apparently open source HobbitBoard. The SBC is said to be available, but has no price or shopping page. The HobbitBoard is nothing like Wandboard.org’s former Brillo-on-i.MX6 UltraLite based board of the same name, now rebranded as an Android Things based PICO-IMX6UL-KIT SBC (see blurb farther above). The HobbitBoard is based on the SavageBoard, but with a different mix of features.   Seeeduino Cloud Company/project — SeeedStudio LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Qualcomm Atheros AR9331 (1x MIPS 24kc @ 400MHz); Atmel ATmega32u4 MCU @ 16MHz Memory — 64MB RAM; 16MB flash; 32KB flash for MCU Price — $70 SeeedStudio’s Seeeduino Cloud Arduino Yun clone is a variation on its Seeeduino Arduino clone, and similarly adds Arduino support and the ability to connect the company’s Grove sensor and I/O add-ons. By integrating Dragino’s HE computer-on-module, the Seeeduino Cloud provides a Yun-like Atheros AR9331 WiFi subsystem that runs OpenWrt Linux. Other features include 10/100 Ethernet, USB host, micro-USB, 20x DIO pins, 7x PWM channels, and 12x analog inputs. Like the Seeeduino, the Seeeduino Cloud eases the interface between Arduino firmware and complex web services, in this case via a YunBridge library that delegates all network connections and processing of HTTP transactions to the Linux machine.   Tinker Board Company/project — Asus LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Rockchip RK3288 (4x Cortex-A17 @ 1.8GHz); Mali-T760 GPU Memory — 2GB LPDDR3 RAM Price — $60 Asus’ Tinker Board is the first open spec hacker SBC from a major PC manufacturer, and the first Rockchip-based hacker board with a Raspberry Pi style size, layout, feature set, and 40-pin connector. The RPi 3 is $25 cheaper, but the Tinker Board has advantages like a faster, although still 32-bit, RK3288 SoC, a more powerful Mali T760 GPU, twice the RAM, and GbE instead of Fast Ethernet. It also supports upscaled 4K/30fps playback. RPi3-like features include WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, and 4x USB 2.0 ports plus microSD, micro-USB, HDMI, MIPI-CSI, and MIPI-DSI interfaces. A community site is available with a forum and schematics, 2D and 3D drawings, and other open-spec resources. The only currently available image is the Debian-based, LXDE desktop ready TinkerOS, but Android support is in the works.   Udoo Neo Company/project — Udoo (Seco) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — NXP i.MX6 SoloX (1x Cortex-A9 @ 1GHz); Cortex-M4 MCU; Vivante GPU Memory — 512MB DDR3L RAM (1GB on Plus version) Price — $49.90 (Basic) $59.90 (Extended), $64.90 (Full) Like the larger Udoo Quad/Dual SBCs, the IoT-focused, 85 x 59mm Udoo Neo runs Linux or Android on a Cortex-A9-based i.MX6. The Neo, however, is optimized for the single-core i.MX6 SoloX variant, tapping its Cortex-M4 MCU to mimic an Arduino. The specs differ slightly from the Kickstarter package referenced in the news link above. The Udoo Neo Basic provides Ethernet, microSD, USB host, micro-USB OTG, micro-HDMI, LVDS with touch, and a Parallel camera interface. There’s also an Arduino connector, as well as GPIO, UART, CAN, PWM, I2C, and SPI interfaces. For $10 more, the Neo Extended bumps the RAM to 1GB, adds 3-axis motion sensors, and replaces Ethernet with a WiFi/Bluetooth module. The Neo Full is identical to the Extended, but offers both Ethernet and wireless.   Udoo Quad / Dual / Dual Basic Company/project — Udoo (Seco) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — NXP i.MX6 Quad or DualLite (4x or 2x Cortex-A9 @ 1GHz with Vivante GPUs); Atmel SAM3X8E Cortex-M3 MCU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM Price — $99 (Dual Basic); $115 (Dual); $135 (Quad) Seco’s Udoo project offers three SKUs for its flagship Udoo board. They all measure 110 x 85mm, and are enhanced with a Cortex-M3 based Arduino Due subsystem. The Udoo Dual Basic and Udoo Dual provide the dual-core i.MX6 DualLite while the Quad has the quad-core i.MX6 with a higher-end Vivante GPU. The Dual Basic supplies microSD, HDMI, LVDS with touch, audio, and CSI connections, along with dual USB host and dual micro-USB ports, one of which is OTG. There are 76 GPIO pins in addition to the Arduino interface. The Udoo Dual adds WiFi and GbE connections, and the Quad also adds SATA.   Udoo X86 Company/project — Udoo (Seco) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Intel Braswell quad-core SoCs (Basic: Atom x5-E8000 @ up to 2.0GHz; Advanced and Advanced Plus: Celeron N3160 @ up to 2.24GHz; Ultra: Pentium N3710 @ up to 2.56GHz); Intel Gen 8-LP GPU Memory — 2GB (Basic) or 4GB (Advanced/Plus) or 8GB (Ultra) DDR3L RAM; 32GB eMMC on Advanced Plus and Ultra Price — Basic $125; Advanced $149; Advanced Plus $165; Ultra $259) The delayed, Kickstarter-backed Udoo X86 SBC finally shipped to backers in March, and is now publicly available. All but the $259 Ultra version with a quad-core Atom X5-E8000 are eligible under our $200 limit. This is the most fully open source of any of the new wave of third-party, non Intel/AMD backed x86 hacker board projects. Since our initial coverage, Seco’s Udoo project has added a Pentium N3710 based “Ultra” version with 8GB RAM and 32GB eMMC. The N3710 is from the same 14nm Intel Braswell family as the Advanced versions’ Celeron and Basic models’ Atom. The SoCs range from 5-6W TDP power consumption, which is low for the x86 world. The Udoo X86 also includes an Intel Curie chip with a Quark MCU. The feature list on this 120 x 85mm device is too extensive to cover here, but highlights include M.2, SATA III, HDMI, 2x DP, wireless, and GPIO. It runs Linux, Android, and Windows 7/8.1/10.   UP board Company/project — Aaeon; UP Community LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Intel Atom x5-Z8350 (4x Cherry Trail @ 1.44GHz/1.92GHz burst); Intel HD 400 Graphics Memory — 1GB, 2GB, or 4GB DDR3L RAM; 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB eMMC Price — $89 (1GB/16GB), $99 (2GB/16GB); $109 (2GB/32GB); $129 (4GB/32GB); $149 (4GB/64GB) The UP board shipped in time for our 2016 survey, but we disqualified it for its lack of open source compliance. Like the more powerful UP Squared (see below), and upcoming, small-footprint UP Core version of the UP board, the original UP is not backed up with full schematics. Yet, the UP Community now offers far more extensive documentation, including some schematics, as well as open source downloads, and goes beyond the typical “community” site in offering tutorials and support. The UP board runs Yocto Project or Ubuntu Linux, Android 5.0, or Windows 10 on a quad-core, 1.44GHz/1.92GHz Atom x5-Z8350 of the 14nm Cherry Trail generation. Various memory configurations are available up to a a $149 4GB RAM, 64GB flash version, and 4GB is also available on the Up board inside the Intel RealSense Robotic Development Kit. The 85.6 × 56.5mm board not only looks like a Raspberry Pi, but it offers a 40-pin expansion bus via an Altera MAX V CPLD that is said to provide RPi 2 compatibility. The UP features 16GB eMMC, a GbE port, a USB 3.0 OTG port, 4x USB 2.0 ports, and two more USB 2.0 headers. The board is further equipped with HDMI, DSI, CSI, I2S, and eDP interfaces.   UP Squared Company/project — Aaeon; UP Community LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Intel Celeron N3350 (2x Apollo Lake @ 1.1GHz/2.4GHz) or Pentium N4200 (4x Apollo Lake @ 1.1GHz/2.5GHz); Intel Gen9 HD 500/505 graphics; Altera Max 10 FPGA Memory — 2GB, 4GB, or 8GB LPDDR4; 32GB eMMC 5.0, expandable to 128GB Price — $145 (Celeron with 2GB/32GB), $169 (Celeron with 4GB/32GB), $219 (Pentium with 4GB/32GB), or $269 (Pentium with 8GB/64GB) The “Up2” (or “Up Squared”), which may be the most powerful hacker-friendly single board computer around, began shipping to Kickstarter backers only last week. It features dual-core Celeron or quad-core Pentium SoCs from Intel’s latest Atom-like “Apollo Lake” generation, although the Pentium SKUs are beyond our $200 limit. As noted in the UP board blurb above, the UP SBCs are not fully open source, but they come close. The 90 x 86mm Up Squared offers 4K video encode and decode, dual GbE ports, dual HDMI outputs, a SATA interface, M.2 support, and mini-PCIe expansion. You also get eDP, dual MIPI-CSI, 3x USB host ports, a micro-USB 3.0 OTG, and both a 60-pin GPIO and a 40-pin interface tied to an Altera Max 10 FPGA. OS support includes Linux (Ubuntu, Ubilinux, Yocto), Android Marshmallow, and Windows 10 IoT Enterprise.   USB Armory Company/project — Inverse Path LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — NXP i.MX53 (1x Cortex-A8 @ 800MHz) Memory — 512MB DDR3 RAM Price — $123 (with USB host adapter); $112 (100 Euros) without This tiny (65 x 19mm), Crowd Supply funded SBC for secure computing applications features Trustzone security, USB emulation, and a secure boot feature that lets users apply verification keys that ensure only trusted firmware can be executed on a specific device. The fully open source USB Armory is limited to two real-world ports: a USB 2.0 OTG port and a microSD slot, but you can extend that with the adapter. Surprisingly, this thumbdrive-style SBC supports Android, as well as Linux. A 10-Euro host adapter is required for stand-alone rather than USB stick mode.   Wandboard Reload Company/project — Wandboard.org; Technexion LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — NXP i.MX6 Solo, DualLite, or Quad (1x, 2x, or 4x Cortex-A9 @ 1GHz); Vivante GPU Memory — 512MB (Solo) 1GB (Dual), 2GB (Quad) DDR3 RAM Price — $79 (Solo); $99 (Dual); $129 Quad The venerable Wandboard, a modular, sandwich-style, COM+baseboard assembly featuring a replaceable compute module, was recently updated as a Wandboard Reload. The pricing is identical and the feature set is much the same. The Wandboard Reload adds the i.MX6 QuadPlus as an alternative to the Quad model, bringing an improved Vivante GC2000+ GPU. The SBC’s WiFi has been updated to 802.11ac and Bluetooth to 4.1 BLE. There’s a new PMIC, and Wandboard.org has fixed an HDMI EDID + CEC problem. Features include dual microSD slots, analog and S/PDIF audio, plus GbE, HDMI, camera, serial, USB, and USB OTG connections. The Dual lacks the Quad’s SATA connection, and the Solo also foregoes the WiFi and Bluetooth found on the Quad and Dual. The Wandboard now has head-to-head competition from a similar SavageBoard (see blurb farther above.)   Z-turn Board Company/project — MYIR LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Xilinx Zynq-7010 or -7020 (2x Cortex-A9 cores @ 667MHz, plus FPGA) or optional Zynq-7020 Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM Price — $99 (7010) or $119 (7020) The Z-turn Board runs Linux on the Xilinx Zynq-7010 or -7020, which combine dual Cortex-A9 cores with different levels of FPGA circuitry. The 102 x 63mm SBC features HDMI, GbE, and dual mini-USB ports, as well as a variety of sensors, buzzers, switches, buttons, and LEDs. Dual 80-pin expansion connectors express the FPGA signals, and can be configured as LVDS pairs. A $139 kit version adds a power adapter, cables, and a 4GB data card.   Next Steps1.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Sports Smart bats and drones deliver more data to cricket fans Scott Collie June 1, 2017 Intel wants drones, VR and smart bats to improve cricket data tracking  View gallery - 5 images Smart technology has given amateur and professional sportspeople access to a huge array of data. The latest suite of smart sports gear from Intel is focused on delivering more info to cricket players and fans alike, with plans to bring drones, virtual reality and a bat sensor to life later this year. Drones NEW ATLAS NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT Upgrade to a Plus subscription today, and read the site without ads. It's just US$19 a year.UPGRADE NOW So much of cricket is dependent on the pitch, so being able to analyze how the 22-yard strip of grass in the middle of an oval will behave is invaluable – both for fans and players. Intel plans to outfit its Falcon 8 Drone with high-definition and infrared cameras for pre-game pitch reports, with information about grass cover, grass health and topology for commentators to use during broadcasts. The technology will be rolled out at the Champions' Trophy, which kicked off on June 1 in England. Bat Sensor The new bat sensor is powered by Intel Curie – a tiny module design to act as a low-power, multi-use brain for activewear. Sitting at the top of the handle, it's designed to track every shot a batsman plays. Cricket is an intensely technical game, and small tweaks to a batter's backswing, bat speed or follow-through can be the difference between an embarrassing walk back to the pavilion and a game-breaking century. The tech will be making its debut at the Champions Trophy, where information from the current batsman will be shared with commentators. It will also be available to consumers as "Speculur BatSense" in Australia, Britain, India and the USA in the second half of 2017. "Speculur BatSense with Intel Inside has the potential to transform cricket across a varied audience from coaches to aspiring self-taught cricketers," says Speculur Managing Director Atul Srivastava. "Coaches can use their insights and expertise along with the bat sensor data to make specific adjustments to a batsman's technique." Virtual Reality Bat tracking has more benefits than telling amateurs how poor their technique is. It will allow fans to slap on a VR headset and test their skills against a virtual bowler. The bat tracking technology will allow visitors to The Oval and Edgbaston to pretend they're out there with their heroes, and give them feedback about their bat speed, back-lift angle and a final score from the VR "session."

Both companies have been firing lawsuits after lawsuits at each other for quite some time now. It is undeniable that the relationship has now been strained especially after one calling the other “unfair” and the other retaliating with an import ban. Now, rumor has it that Apple has gained a new ally with regards to the iPhone 8 that may spell disaster to Qualcomm. Over the past few years, Apple has been dependent on Qualcomm to provide its products for Apple’s range of mobile devices. These are mostly broadband or wireless modems used on most of the iPhones in the market. Last year, Qualcomm has controlled the majority of supplies for the iPhone’s modems. The other part of the spectrum was held by Intel, with its subpar chips. Last year, however, Digitimes reports that the supply for wireless modems will be split equally between Qualcomm and Intel. Furthermore, the report also mentioned that Apple is planning on giving Intel much of the supply percentage by 2018. This could potentially mean the end of Qualcomm modem’s inside the future iPhone and iPad devices. Alleged iPhone 8 mockup unit (by Benjamin Geskin) The only real reason that Apple chose Qualcomm is the fact that it has the better technology when it comes to wireless modems. However, since the release of Intel’s XMM 7560 LTE modem, this will soon change. This is because the said chip is capable of reaching a theoretical 1GB bandwidth. The recent counter lawsuits against each other has certainly not helped Qualcomm’s reputation in this regard. It should be noted that Apple, early this year, withheld almost $1 billion of royalties to Qualcomm on the basis of unfair monopoly. After that, Qualcomm fired with a counter lawsuit regarding patents that are used on the iPhones and has sought to get the said devices banned in the United States. Because the court has ruled in favor of Apple, a few companies have started following suit by not paying royalties to Qualcomm. This has infuriated Qualcomm which leads us to the current predicament. Unless Qualcomm does something drastic about the matter, it risks losing quite a big chunk if its earnings. For more tech update, be sure to check us out at The Bitbag.

The move comes as another major planned tech project, the first element of a €1bn data centre campus planned for Dublin by internet giant Amazon, is also appealed to An Bord Pleanála. In 2015, Thomas Reid of Hedsor House in Kildare won a Supreme Court appeal against a decision by the High Court to allow the IDA to compulsorily acquire land he and his family had worked for more than a century. He sued the IDA and the State after an order was granted permitting the development agency to acquire the 72-acre property, which includes a farm and the Reid family home. Mr Reid did not want to sell his land. He claimed the decision to allow the acquisition of it was flawed and unfair and breached his property rights as well as his rights under the Constitution and European Convention of Human Rights. The IDA had argued it was entitled to acquire Mr Reid's lands under powers granted in the 1986 Industrial Development Act. But the Supreme Court found that the making of the compulsory purchase order in 2012 for Mr Reid's lands had gone beyond the powers of the Act. Last month, Kildare County Council approved plans by Intel Ireland to expand its mammoth facility in Leixlip that would put the Irish site in the running for a potential $4bn (€3.6bn) investment. But there's no immediate intention to build, as the Irish unit has to vie with other global Intel sites for investment. "The planning application is part of a strategic initiative by the Intel Ireland site to ensure that the designated campus is optimised and is in a competitively-placed position to compete for next generation investment within the Intel corporation when major future capital investment decisions are being considered," planners for Intel noted. An Bord Pleanála will make a decision by the end of September. It will also make a decision by that date in the appeal taken in the Amazon case. A key opponent of Apple's data centre project in Co Galway, Allan Daly, has appealed a decision by Fingal County Council to grant permission to Amazon for the first part of what could be a €1bn data centre project, amid energy usage concerns. Another objector, architect David Hughes, told An Bord Pleanála that the financial benefit derived from data centre jobs will be eclipsed by EU fines of up to €300m a year. He claims these could be levied if Ireland fails to meet a target of producing 40pc of its energy from renewable sources by 2020.

Two people living near the multinational’s factory in Leixlip have appealed a recent decision of Kildare Co Council to grant planning permission for a new state-of- the-art facility on the site. Local Labour TD Emmet Stagg expressed disappointment that objections to Intel’s plans had been lodged with An Bord Pleanála. It is estimated the project would create 3,000 jobs during the construction phase as well as 850 full-time jobs at Intel’s base at Collinstown Industrial Park in Leixlip. Intel sought planning permission for the development in November in what was effectively a revamp of planning permission it first secured in 2013. The latest proposed facility is about 50% smaller than the original plan but is still a massive 88,740 sq metres. The multinational, which employs 4,500 full-time staff, says the move is part of a strategic initiative to ensure its Leixlip campus is in a position to compete for a new generation of investment. Mr Stagg said Intel’s Irish operations were in competition with some of the company’s other facilities in Israel and the US. Intel bosses have still to decide the location of the new manufacturing plant estimated to be worth €3.6bn. The company, which has been based in Leixlip since 1990, has invested around €12bn in its Irish plant to date. READ MORE Visit the section home page here © Irish Examiner Ltd.

PHOTOGRAPHY BY GEORGE PFOERTNER Getting good Intel, in this age of the Internet, is pretty easy. Prior to the Class 3A state semifinal game, New Trier star defender Sam Urban said the team read an interesting quote in an online story previewing the big girls soccer showdown between the Trevians and the Kahoks of Collinsville. “It said that we didn’t have a prominent goal-scorer like we did last year … ,” said Urban. Not a cut down. Not really bulletin-board material (the article went on to praise the New Trier program). And, just maybe … not the truth. Following NT’s 2-1 overtime victory over the Downstate powerhouse on June 2 at North Central College in Naperville, a case could be made for Emma Weaver. The freshman looked pretty “prominent”. Pretty “prolific”. The highly touted Weaver had a dream game. In scoring both of her team’s goals, she looked very Kelly Maday-ish. “She’s our secret weapon — but not really,” said Urban, with a smile. No one associated with the New Trier program is surprised by what Weaver did on the steaming hot turf at North Central’s Benedetti-Wehrli Stadium. Everyone knew Weaver, who now has 14 goals and six assists on the season, was a special talent. She came to the Trevians after being a top age-group club player with Eclipse. “She came up big time on the big stage tonight,” said New Trier head coach Jim Burnside, who watched his Trevians improve to 24-2-1 “What she did tonight is the stuff she does.” “Under the pressure and all, she performed extremely well,” added NT junior defender Sydney Parker. “She’s just a freshman. But she’s an experienced player. She knows how to play the game.” Weaver’s first score came in the 18th minute, when she gathered in a long feed from Urban on the left side, made a sharp cut to the inside, broke free and blasted in a shot from the top of the box. “What she did, dribbling across the field, is very difficult to defend,” said Urban, who was credited with an assist on goal No. 1. Weaver’s overtime goal, in the 82nd minute, was virtually a carbon copy. Lined up on the left side, Weaver took possession near the 30-yard line, shook free on a cutback route and hammered in a shot that nicked the glove of Collinsville goalkeeper Morgan Lerch. “I went across the defense,” said Weaver, sister of former NT standout Jess Weaver who went to play at DePaul University. “I like doing that. It messes up their dynamic. “And I love taking people one-on-one,” she added. Ten minutes after the game, Weaver was triple- and quadruple-teamed by sportswriters. She handled that just as flawlessly. “To be able to put two in the back of the net and walk off the field with a win is just amazing. It’s unreal,” said Weaver. “It’s an honor to play and contribute for a team like ours. We have so many great players on this team.” Much like Maday, a star scorer for the Trevians who is now playing Division I soccer at the University of Illinois, Weaver has the ability to strike at any time, at any place. Burnside, who has guided New Trier to 27 straight postseason wins, made a subtle, yet strategic move in overtime. After playing on the left side in the first half and switching to the right side in the second half, Weaver went back to the left side in the extra session. “We’re just trying to find open seams for her,” said Burnside. “Trying to get her lost. If she moves around, it becomes a little tougher for the defense. You can soften up a good team by putting your skilled players in different spots.” “I go wherever coach tells me to go,” said Weaver, who will play for FC United instead of the Eclipse in the upcoming club season. The Trevians once again received stellar defense up and down their lineup with defenders Parker, Urban, Megan Murdoch and Caroline Iserloth; midfielders Hope Baisley, Avery Schuldt and Lily Conley; and goalie Katy Symanietz. They allowed their first goal in four games, when Collinsville’s Dayle McEwen slipped in a goal off Andrea Frerker’s corner kick in the 29th minute of the game. Symanietz ended up with five saves, including a couple of real dandies. Lerch made seven stops. New Trier, which has won three Class 3A state titles in a row, will face Barrington in the title game on June 3 at 7 p.m. The Fillies, who beat NT 1-0 during the regular season, edged Downers Grove North 1-0 in Friday night’s other state semifinal. “We need to come out a little stronger tomorrow night,” said Urban. “We need a better mentality. “Four-peat sounds a lot better than three-peat,” she added.   « Previous Post Next Post » Mobile ad container – below post Today’s top Stories Flock of Eagles: 16...

It used to be that a good Windows 10 device cost an arm and a leg, and the cheap ones were rubbish. But that's the past. Today there are plenty of affordable, quality Windows 10 tablets to choose from, so picking the best one for you is more difficult than ever before. Be it a small tablet to toss in your bag or a big one to replace your aging laptop, you don't have to spend a ton to get what you need. There are some pricey options that aren't worth your money, so we rounded up the best affordable Windows 10 tablets. All of them are worthy of your attention. Updated June 1, 2017: We removed a couple of older tablets that are no longer on sale and replaced them with some excellent new choices from Chuwi and Fusion 5. Chuwi Hi10 Plus Chinese brand Chuwi is doing some great work in providing affordable, yet good quality Windows 10 products. The Hi10 Plus is a 10.8-inch tablet with a full HD IPS display powered by an Intel Atom x5 processor. Add to that 64GB of storage and 4GB of RAM and you've got a fair amount of power for $200. You even get USB-C. You also get a dual-boot option for Android, if that sort of thing appeals to you. See at Amazon Chuwi Hi8 Pro If you're prepared to take a risk on a product from a brand about which you've no idea on reputation or customer service, you might actually be surprised. And that's not only because the Hi8 Pro boots into both Android and Windows. It's packing a 1920 x 1200 resolution display, USB-C and an Intel x5 processor for little more than $100. That is crazy value. You can get an official, optional keyboard case, but you can also do better by finding your own. If you're chasing a bang-for-your-buck tablet, the Hi8 Pro should place high up on that list. See at Amazon Lenovo Miix 310 This tablet has 64GB of storage, optional LTE, a great keyboard and excellent battery life. Lenovo's Miix 310 may look a little plain but it delivers where it counts. You also get the benefit of a 10-inch display, which means it's plenty possible to actually use the Miix 310 to get some light work done. The display is 1280 x 800 resolution, which isn't the highest, but given the price point it's about right. And the quad-core Atom processor and 2GB of RAM should lead to a fairly smooth Windows 10 experience. The 33Wh battery supposedly gets up to 10 hours of life, and even though it's pretty slim and compact, there's a Micro-HDMI output to plug into a bigger display. You get that all for around $200. See at Amazon NuVision 8-inch You may not get the same build quality here as with a Lenovo, Dell or HP tablet, but what you do get is an incredible price for the hardware. For under $100, you get an Intel Atom x5 processor, 2GB of RAM, 32GB of storage and an 8-inch, 1920 x 1200 resolution display. Throw in a microSD card slot, around six hours of battery life and something that weighs not much more than half a pound, and you have a great, inexpensive Windows 10 tablet to throw in your bag and take anywhere you go. See at Amazon Fusion 5 10-inch This 10-inch tablet from Fusion 5 costs less than $200 and is powered by a quad-core Intel Atom processor. It's not the greatest looking device out there, but with 32GB of storage, 2GB of RAM and plenty of ports to connect things, as well as HDMI out, you've got a sleek, lightweight little PC for not a lot of cash.

Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) engaged in "unmasking" requests similar to those Nunes has since characterized as an abuse of power, The Washington Post reported Friday. Late last year, Nunes' panel asked U.S. spy agencies to unmask or reveal the names of Americans in classified intelligence reports, according to the Post. A tally by U.S. spy agencies found the panel made five to six requests pertaining to U.S. organizations or individuals related to the campaigns of President Trump and Hillary ClintonHillary Rodham ClintonHouse Intel chair made requests to unmask Americans: report Conway: John Kerry's criticism of Paris decision 'shows why he lost' Ahead of Senate testimony, Comey 'angry' over firing: report MORE. In May, Nunes said he was "very concerned" about unmasking requests by the Obama administration, and called for "major changes" to federal law guiding who can unmask U.S. citizens. ADVERTISEMENT Nunes' recused himself in early April from the House investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election amid a House ethics probe into whether he divulged classified information. Despite that, he has continued working on the investigation into unmasking attempts by Rice and other Obama White House officials. This week, Nunes served subpoenas to the CIA, FBI and NSA over unmasking requests by Obama administration officials including former national security adviser Susan Rice, CIA Director John Brennan and United Nations Ambassador Samantha PowerSamantha PowerHouse Intel chair made requests to unmask Americans: report Seven subpoenas issued in House Russia probe No, Assad is not good for Israel, and he never will be MORE.  Nunes has said he's "very concerned" about accusations that Rice asked for the identities of certain U.S. citizens incidentally surveilled by intelligence agencies to be "unmasked" in reports delivered to her. Rice characterizes these requests as “not uncommon” and “absolutely not for any political purpose, to spy, expose, anything." House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has called Nunes' continued work on the probe "beneath the dignity" of his position as chair of the House Intelligence Committee.  “If he recused himself on subject Russia, then he shouldn't be having access to documents relating to subject Russia," Pelosi said Friday.

The agreement had nearly universal support, but Trump said withdrawing is good for American business. But American business leaders disagree. President Donald Trump demonstrates for the cameras how little thought he gave to withdrawing the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) CEOs from companies in practically every sector of American life issued statements yesterday denouncing Trump's decision. Business leaders such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Disney CEO Robert Iger even signalled that this was the last straw, and announced that they'd no longer act as advisers to the US president. Even before Trump's decision yesterday, the Paris Accord had broad support in the business community. On 26 April 2017 a group of companies wrote an open letter to the president, asking him to stay in the agreement. Companies as diverse as Walmart and DuPont and Intel all signed the letter. Even energy companies like ExxonMobil, Shell and Chevron also implored Trump not to drop the Paris Accord in the lead up to yesterday's announcement from the White House Rose Garden. But he didn't listen. Members of the Trump regime clap along like subservient children as President Donald Trump announces America's withdrawal from the Paris Accord (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Below we have a list of the companies that have thus far reacted directly to Trump's decision. We can only imagine that this list will continue to grow in the coming weeks. Twenty years from now, we have no idea what the defining moment of Trump's shameful presidency will be. But with climate change already impacting the world in disastrous ways, his decision to needlessly shun the environment should at least crack the top 10. But who knows? Trump still has so much time to inflict very real damage on both the United States and the rest of the world — a world that increasingly sees America as a joke that elected a neo-fascist reality TV star as its president.

Here's what they had to say. The Climate Deniers Have Won Sidney Fussell 02 Jun 2017 6:00 AM At President Trumps' behest, the US is joining Syria and Nicaragua in abdicating from the Paris Agreement, a coalition of 147 nations to combat climate change by reducing carbon emissions. While Trump faced heavy international pressure to remain within the agreement, from the Pope during his trip to the Vatican, China's President Xi and European leaders during the G7 summit, the GOP overwhelmingly opposed Paris from the get-go. EPA head Scott Pruitt has long argued that the United States' emissions reduction goal under Paris weakened the US economy. Want Gizmodo's email newsletter?

Shanthi Rexaline , Benzinga Staff Writer   {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} June 02, 2017 3:59pm   Comments Share: Related AMD Hooked On Horsepower: Intel To Sell 18-Core Processor For Speed Freaks 4 Takeaways From Advanced Micro Devices' Recent Trade Show Product Update Stocks Advance, But Pare Gains; This Fiber-Optics Maker Breaks Out (Investor's Business Daily) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD)'s high profile Ryzen 7 desktop processors launched in early March amid much fanfare and expectations is made cheaper in about three months following its commercial launch. Ryzen Rising Ryzen 7 is AMD's 8-core desktop processor, which has a Zen core and comes in three models, namely the flagship 1800X model and the 1700X and 1700 models. The company had then demonstrated the Ryzen 7 1800X's superiority over a similarly configured 8-core, 16-thread core Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) i7-6900K in Cinebench R15 multi-threaded and Handbrake-based video transcoding, while also showing comparable 4K gaming performance. The launch pricing of the Ryzen 7 models: 1800X: $499. 1700X: $399. 1700: $329. After First 'Ryzen Quarter' Results, Stock Tumbled Following the release of its first-quarter results, which revealed largely in-line results and positive second-quarter guidance, the stock plunged 24.2 percent to $10.32 on May 2. This is despite the hype-surrounding the first Ryzen quarter. Analysts attributed the weakness to profit taking after the strong run up seen since early 2016. In 2016 alone, the stock gained 295.1 percent. Source: Y Charts Subsequently, in April, AMD launched its Ryzen 5 processors, with experts claiming the 6-core, 12-thread Ryzen 5 1600X gaming processor would give Intel's K-series Corr i5 chip a run for its money. Upcoming Launches Abound With several upcoming catalysts, namely the impending launch of Ryzen 3 series meant for Mainstream consumers, Naples server processor and RX Vega gaming card to be released at the end of July, it looks like the stock would recover from its post-earnings swoon in the near-to-medium term. Vega is AMD's high-end graphics architecture pitted against NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA)‘s GTX 1080. It is against this backdrop the news concerning AMD slashing prices of its Ryzen 7 series emanated. The new pricing reads: 1800X: $450. 1700X: $350. 1700: $315. Why Announce The Price Cut Now? At its Financial Analyst Day on May 16, AMD announced details of its Ryzen Threadripper CPUs — that it would have 16 core, 32 threads, built on an "all new HEDT platform." The company also indicated that it would be launched in the summer. The Ryzen Threadripper is seen as a competing product to Intel's Core i9 line up, which would cost $2,000 for the 18-core model and $1,700 for a 16-core mode, according to Digital Trends. Given the Ryzen Threadripper has double the count of the Ryzen 7 chips and AMD's focus on performance-price ratio, Digital Trends estimates that the Threadripper could be priced at $900. It is not uncommon for companies to slash prices when a new series of the product is to be launched. However, Digital Trends does not see this as the case. AMD's wont of offering an appealing performance-price ration could have driven the decision to cut prices ahead of the Threadripper launch. There is also a view that the price cut is the company's attempt to find out how consumers react to various price points. With a lot going on with the company, it remains to be seen if AMD regains its lost glory and emerge as the frontrunner in the chip market.

Much like all Intel board partners Supermicro is cooking up something nice as well. And I do say nice with a reason, as previously the designs (aesthetically) have been lacking a bit in our opinion. Things are about to change. And that chance is for the better alright, we spot a nice black CB series, metal shielded PCI-Express slots, Realtek ALC1220 audio and hey now, even a 5 gbit Ethernet jack, Jack! The C7X299-PG obviously has Socket LGA 2066 for the new Intel  Core X-Series processor family. It supports up to 128GB DDR4 memory, has four reinforced PCI-E slots, one Gbit and one 5Gbit LAN port, USB3.1a and c ports, two M.2 and two U.2 ports. In addition, the latest Realtek chip (ALC1220). The C7X299-PG Supero series will be reelased in two models: C7X299-PG C7X299-PGF – includes remote management via IPMI IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface) is a server feature that allows remote control and monitoring of the PC. Supermicro is the brand behind Supero. SMC traditional makes servers and part of that quality translates itself towards their motherboards. More information will become available soon including details on pricing and availability. Here is a sneak peek. I requested some more photos which hopefully I can in the next hour or so.

Introduction, value and design 2. Performance, features and verdict Our Verdict With smooth graphics and high performance, the Leopard Pro makes gaming look good both in and out of VR – just be sure to bring headphones. For Responsive 120Hz screen Loaded with brand name parts Relatively inexpensive Against Short battery life Noticeably loud fans Don’t expect Ultra all the time Perhaps one of the greatest benefits of the supposed VR-era is the increase in affordable high-performance technology for gaming. This being the case, the 17-inch MSI GP72VR Leopard Pro packs plenty of gaming power for a mid-range gaming PC. The notebook represents a significant value even if you have little interest in taking advantage of its VR capabilities.  However, it sports a suite of name brand components inside, such as a SteelSeries gaming keyboard, 4-position surround sound powered by Dynaudio, and a Killer Gaming Networks Ethernet card to reduce latency during online games. All of it is topped with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GPU backing a 120Hz, 1,920 x 1,080 FHD display for liquid smooth graphical performance. Other components include a 2.8GHz Intel Core i7 CPU, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB NVMe SSD. You might not always be able to push your game settings to ultra, but you can enjoy all the still-beautiful mid-to-high settings most games currently have to offer. Spec Sheet Here is the MSI GP72VR Leopard Pro configuration sent to TechRadar for review: CPU: 2.8GHz Intel Core i7-7700HQ (quad-core, 6MB cache, up to 3.8GHz with Turbo) Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 (3GB GDDR5 VRAM) RAM: 16GB DDR4 Dual Channel SDRAM (1,201MHz) Screen: 17.3-inch FHD screen, 1,920 x 1,080, 120Hz, 5ms, wide viewing angle Storage: 512GB NVMe M.2 SATA SSD; SD card reader; Super Multi DVD drive Ports: 1 x USB 3.1 Type-C; 2 x USB 3.0; 1 USB 2.0; 1 mini DisplayPort; 1 x HDMI 1.4 (4K supported); 1 Killer Gaming Networks Gigabit RJ-45 Ethernet port; 1 headphone jack; 1 microphone jack Connectivity: 802.11ac Wi-Fi; Bluetooth 4.2 Camera: 720p webcam Weight: 5.95 pounds (2.7kg) Size: 16.49 x 11.29 x 1.14 inches (41.9 x 28.7 x 2.9cm; W x D x H) Pricing and availability You can pick up an MSI GP72VR Leopard Pro for around $1,399 (about £1,090, AU$1,880) depending on the configuration, which represents a significant value when compared to some similar systems. For example, the Gigabyte Aero 15 goes for around $1,899 (about £1,471 and AU $2,541) with very similar hardware, including the memory, SSD storage and GPU.  The Gigabyte’s smaller 15-inch screen supports a higher QHD (3,840 x 2,160) resolution, but that might not be enough to balance out the significant price difference.  Neither system can match the Dell Inspiron 15 Gaming’s maximum $1,099 (£1,299, AU $1,999) price tag, and you can get a well-configured version for the bargain cost of $849 (£1,099, AU$1,999).  However, this 15-inch gaming notebook would have an Intel i5 processor, an Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti video card, 8GB of memory and a 256GB SSD. In other words, the savings get you quite a downgrade. Design At a glance, the GP72VR Leopard Pro doesn’t stand out among other MSI gaming notebooks. It sports MSI’s signature minimalistic black aluminum chassis, shaped to look like the hood of a sports car, decorated with a backlit dragon shield logo. However, the understated appearance works well for MSI, because it’s what’s under the hood that counts. Players are greeted with the multicolored backlighting of the SteelSeries-designed gaming keyboard, accented by a rather large wrist rest area underneath, and two hard buttons below the touchpad. Although the keyboard is ideal for first-person shooters, like Overwatch, the entire top row of keys are half-sized, and all the keys are positioned very closely together. It can take some getting used to unless you’re already familiar with SteelSeries’ design because the layout could lead to higher typo rates when talking in chat or performing other everyday tasks, like web browsing or email. Everything from the keyboard lighting to overclocking and fan speeds can be easily managed using the MSI Dragon Center, an application that can be launched at the push of a dedicated key on the upper right side. Next to it is a separate key that forces the cooling fans to run at max speed indefinitely.  Although they aren’t the loudest fans we’ve ever heard, the noise is very noticeable even on automatic mode. They kick in very quickly during gaming sessions, and their sound may interfere with the enjoyment of the otherwise superb 4-point surround sound system. Even with the fans going at full blast, we can feel a small amount of warmth coming through the keyboard. Perils of weight loss Generally speaking, the mid-range notebook weighs almost 6 pounds (2.7kg), which is about expected for a notebook of its size, but we hardly feel it when carrying it around. The configuration we tested is lighter than others because it doesn’t include a spinning drive, thereby reducing its weight to 5.5 pounds (2.49 kg) with a DVD-ROM drive.  That’s surprisingly lighter than the Dell Inspiron 15’s 5.76 pounds (2.61kg), but not by much, and heavier than the Gigabyte Aero 15’s 4.62 pounds (2.1kg).  However, the weight reduction comes with a big trade-off. A single 512GB SSD means lower weight and lightning fast boot and load times, but it also means that you can’t install more than a handful of high-end games onto the system. Together, Overwatch, Mass Effect: Andromeda and Grand Theft Auto V ate up about 126GB, which is about one-quarter of the SSD. That doesn’t even account for for the space needed for Windows 10, other apps, and downloading game installers and updates.  This issue is compounded by how the SSD comes partitioned into two halves, further limiting what you can install without tweaking the settings.   A need for speed Given its hardware and features, it’s clear that the MSI GP72VR Leopard Pro is designed with gaming specifically in mind, especially first-person shooters. Although it does have the power to support virtual reality headsets, such as the Oculus Rift of HTC Vive, it seems like an incidental effect of the system’s overall capabilities.  What’s more impressive to those of us who decide to stay in actual reality is the 120Hz screen, which has excellent left and right viewing angles.  The colors start to look washed out when the display is tilted back too far, which is a problem that presents itself when watching videos while the notebook is on your lap, but it is an otherwise slick and quite bright screen.  Graphics are liquid smooth during gaming sessions, making the Leopard Pro’s multi-monitor capabilities (where you can attach two external displays) seem either completely superfluous or completely appetizing.  1 2 Current page: Introduction, value and design Next Page Performance, features and verdict Tech deals, prizes and latest news Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!

The device packs Intel’s 7th-gen Core i7 (7600U) processor, Intel’s HD Graphics 620 for the GPU, and up to 16GB of LPDDR3 RAM. The display of the ThinkPad X1 Yoga is a 14-inch WQHD OLED panel — but an IPS panel and an FHD variant are also available. For the internal storage, Lenovo has packed a whopping 1TB of SSD PCIe storage. The device’s battery is also very good, and Lenovo says it can offer up to 15 hours of battery life. The ports of the device include 2 Thunderbolt 3 ports, 3 USB 3.0 ports, one HDMI port, one MicroSD slot and a MicroSIM slot as well. Interestingly, Lenovo initially announced that the device would pack n IR camera with face recognition support for Windows Hello at CES but that no longer seems to be the case as the device only includes a fingerprint scanner now.

The move means Mueller’s politically charged inquiry will now look into Flynn’s paid work as a lobbyist for a Turkish businessman in 2016, in addition to contacts between Russian officials and Flynn and other Trump associates during and after the Nov. 8 presidential election. Federal prosecutors in Virginia are investigating a deal between Flynn and Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin as part of a grand jury criminal probe, according to a subpoena seen by Reuters. Alptekin’s company, Netherlands-based Inovo BV, paid Flynn’s consultancy $530,000 between September and November to produce a documentary and research on Fethullah Gulen, an exiled Turkish cleric living in the United States. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan blames Gulen for a failed coup last July. Alptekin, an ally of Erdogan, told Reuters he hired Flynn to provide research on how Gulen is “poisoning the atmosphere” between Turkey and the United States. Gulen has denied any role in the coup and dismisses Turkey’s allegations that he heads a terrorist organization. The grand jury in Virginia has issued subpoenas to some of Flynn’s business associates involved in the work for Inovo, two people familiar with the probe say. The subpoena seen by Reuters seeks bank records, documents and communications related to Flynn, his company, Flynn Intel Group, Alptekin and Inovo. Flynn’s lawyer, Robert Kelner, did not respond to questions about Flynn’s work for Inovo or Mueller’s investigation. A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment. Alptekin declined to comment when asked about the investigation into Flynn and whether he or anyone he knows has been subpoenaed. BROAD POWERS Mueller’s move to take over the Virginia grand jury’s criminal investigation highlights his broad powers as special counsel. Reuters could not determine when the grand jury was first convened, but its existence has been previously reported. Until now the investigation has been led by Brandon van Grack, an espionage prosecutor in the Justice Department, and federal prosecutors from the Eastern District of Virginia. It is not clear whether Van Grack and others who have been working on the case will continue to do so. Deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller, a former FBI director, on May 17 to oversee an investigation into any links or collusion between Russia and individuals associated with the Trump campaign. Rosenstein also gave him authority to pursue “any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.” Some members of Congress have asked the Justice Department to define the scope of Mueller’s inquiry. Mueller’s appointment followed an uproar over Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey, who had been investigating alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Democrats and some of the president’s fellow Republicans had demanded an independent probe of whether Russia tried to sway the outcome of November’s election in favor of Trump and against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump, who has said there was no coordination between his campaign and Russia, has decried the investigation as a “witch hunt.” One of Trump’s most trusted aides during the election campaign, Flynn had a long career in the military. He set up the Flynn Intel Group, an Alexandria, Virginia-based intelligence consultancy, after President Barack Obama dismissed him as head of the military’s Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014. UNFINISHED DOCUMENTARY Mueller, who takes over leadership of an FBI investigation that began last July, can present evidence to grand juries and hear testimony from witnesses. Trump fired Flynn in February after it became clear that he had falsely characterized the nature of phone conversations he had with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak in December, just after the Obama administration imposed new sanctions on Russia for what U.S. intelligence agencies had concluded was a Kremlin-led effort through computer hacking, fake news and propaganda to boost Trump’s chances of winning the White House. Flynn’s work for Inovo came under scrutiny after he published a commentary on a political news website on Election Day calling Gulen a “radical Islamist” who should be extradited to Turkey. Along with the editorial, the Flynn Intel Group also produced a 75-page report on Gulen based mainly on news reports and some video footage for a documentary that was never made, according to three people familiar with the project. Alptekin, who is chairman of the Turkey-U.S. Business Council, told Reuters he was satisfied with Flynn’s research because it had helped him understand how Gulen’s network operates in the United States. He said the $530,000 payment to Flynn’s firm came “mostly” from his personal funds. On Nov. 18, the day after Flynn was appointed Trump’s national security adviser, Trump transition team lawyer William McGinley raised concerns on a call with the Flynn Intel Group and others involved in the Inovo project over who had paid for Flynn’s commentary, according to two people with knowledge of the conversation. Flynn did not participate in that call, they said. At the time of the call, Flynn had not disclosed that his work for Alptekin meant he was being paid to represent Turkish interests during the election campaign. Flynn Intel Group had said in a September 2016 filing that it was lobbying for Inovo but did not disclose its Turkish links. In March, Flynn retroactively registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. In a letter accompanying the March filing, Flynn’s lawyer, Kelner, said the disclosure was being made because Flynn’s work for Inovo “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey,” which he noted was seeking to extradite Gulen. The House of Representatives intelligence committee, which is also investigating Russian interference in the election, subpoenaed records from Flynn on Wednesday. The Senate’s intelligence committee, which has a separate probe under way, has also served subpoenas on Flynn and two of his businesses, and earlier this week Flynn indicated that he would start turning over relevant materials.—Reuters Tagged Flynn Turkey ties Turkish President Post navigation Previous Previous post: Nisar vows to implement decision of merging FATA into KP Next Next post: Editorial: Stunning blow to Paris agreement Tweet Related Posts Bush says offensive in Iraq just beginning Malaysia gets new transport minister amid MH370 crisis World sends sympathy, offers aid to quake-hit Italy Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Democrats and some of the president's fellow Republicans had demanded an independent probe of whether Russia tried to sway the outcome of November's election in favor of Trump and against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump, who has said there was no coordination between his campaign and Russia, has decried the investigation as a “witch hunt.” One of Trump’s most trusted aides during the election campaign, Flynn had a long career in the military. He set up the Flynn Intel Group, an Alexandria, Virginia-based intelligence consultancy, after President Barack Obama dismissed him as head of the military’s Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014. UNFINISHED DOCUMENTARY Mueller, who takes over leadership of an FBI investigation that began last July, can present evidence to grand juries and hear testimony from witnesses. Trump fired Flynn in February after it became clear that he had falsely characterized the nature of phone conversations he had with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak in December, just after the Obama administration imposed new sanctions on Russia for what U.S. intelligence agencies had concluded was a Kremlin-led effort through computer hacking, fake news and propaganda to boost Trump’s chances of winning the White House.  Flynn's work for Inovo came under scrutiny after he published a commentary on a political news website on Election Day calling Gulen a “radical Islamist” who should be extradited to Turkey. Along with the editorial, the Flynn Intel Group also produced a 75-page report on Gulen based mainly on news reports and some video footage for a documentary that was never made, according to three people familiar with the project. Alptekin, who is chairman of the Turkey-U.S. Business Council, told Reuters he was satisfied with Flynn’s research because it had helped him understand how Gulen’s network operates in the United States. He said the US$530,000 payment to Flynn’s firm came "mostly" from his personal funds.     On Nov. 18, the day after Flynn was appointed Trump’s national security adviser, Trump transition team lawyer William McGinley raised concerns on a call with the Flynn Intel Group and others involved in the Inovo project over who had paid for Flynn's commentary, according to two people with knowledge of the conversation. Flynn did not participate in that call, they said.     At the time of the call, Flynn had not disclosed that his work for Alptekin meant he was being paid to represent Turkish interests during the election campaign. Flynn Intel Group had said in a September 2016 filing that it was lobbying for Inovo but did not disclose its Turkish links. In March, Flynn retroactively registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. In a letter accompanying the March filing, Flynn's lawyer, Kelner, said the disclosure was being made because Flynn's work for Inovo "could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey," which he noted was seeking to extradite Gulen.    The House of Representatives intelligence committee, which is also investigating Russian interference in the election, subpoenaed records from Flynn on Wednesday. The Senate's intelligence committee, which has a separate probe under way, has also served subpoenas on Flynn and two of his businesses, and earlier this week Flynn indicated that he would start turning over relevant materials.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About WWDC 2017 preview: Everything Apple is expected to announce on Monday Events WWDC 2017: Everything Apple is expected to announce on Monday Chris Mills @chrisfmills June 2nd, 2017 at 11:38 AM Share Tweet Andy Williams actually got it wrong. The most wonderful time of the year isn’t Christmas; it’s the two weeks around the end of May when Apple holds its annual developer conference. In one speech, we normally get a mix of new hardware and software updates, and Apple lays out the direction it’s going to take for the next 12 months. This year, we’re expecting a big one when WWDC 2017 starts on Monday at 1:00PM Eastern. In this post, we’ll roundup all of the most notable WWDC 2017 rumors so you know what to expect during Apple’s big WWDC keynote next week. Don't Miss: It’ll be a long time until the Amazon Echo and Echo Dot are priced this low again New MacBooks Right now, the safest best for new hardware at WWDC 2017 is an update to the MacBook lineup. It might be a little odd, considering Apple just launched an all-new MacBook Pro back in November, but all the leaks, rumors and retail supply chain leaks have pointed towards some kind of new model. That’s the good news. The bad news is that we’re probably not going to see a new MacBook Air or a MacBook Pro with a few more ports. Instead, the smart money is on the current MacBook range getting a spec bump on the inside, most likely with Intel’s new Kaby Lake processor. Improvements have also been made to the graphics cards for portable machines, so you could also expect the MacBook Pro to get a graphics bump. Siri Speaker We’re also expecting to see a new Siri-powered home speaker to pop up looking a lot like the Amazon Echo. Smart speakers have emerged as the obvious portal for controlling the smart home, so Apple can’t let Amazon and Google run away with the prize. It’s challenging to innovate on the concept of “kitchen speaker with an AI and a microphone built in,” so Apple has two options here: launch a keep-up-with-the-Joneses product that demonstrates its commitment to the product and lays the groundwork for something revolutionary to come; or try the classic Apple move, and make a much more expensive version to capture the high end of the market. It’s unclear what a “high-end” home speaker would look like, but a focus on audio quality using Beats branding isn’t out of the question. New iMacs Just like the new MacBooks, it’s possible that we’ll see a spec bump for the iMac. Intel’s new processors sure would look good inside, and it would lessen some of the cries we’ve been hearing that Apple doesn’t produce ‘“pro” computers any more. New iPads Finally, there’s rumors going around that we’ll see a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro at WWDC. It likely won’t be a “new” form-factor, as there’s already a 9.7-inch iPad Pro on the market (and it recently went on sale!) Instead, look for much thinner bezels enabling a bigger screen in the existing body. Software iOS 11 Apple uses WWDC to show off the newest version of iOS every year like clockwork, and there’s zero reason to imagine that this year will be different. Bloomberg rumors suggest that iOS 11 will see a design overhaul, not as severe as the iOS 7 update that scrapped skeuomorphic design, but still significant. One of the biggest new features could be the introduction of a “dark” mode across the entire OS, something that jailbreakers have been doing for years. It’s a quick and easy way to save a little battery life and appease some of the more hardcore fans. We’re also expecting updates to apps, including a possible peer-to-peer payment function in Apple Pay, and more videos in Apple Music to tie in with Apple’s first original series launching soon. One thing we haven’t heard much about are updates to Siri. Google’s recent developer conference focused heavily on the Google Assistant, and how it’s finding its way across the entire platform. If Apple is expecting the Siri Speaker to do anything well, Siri’s going to need some major updates, and fast. One of the big interface differences between the Assistant and Siri is the ability to have written conversations and type queries; it’s quite possible that Apple builds that functionality right into iOS 11. macOS Of course, we’re expecting to see a new version of macOS, but it’s unlikely to be anything big. We said above that Siri needs to be a focus of WWDC overall this year, so that’s one obvious thing for Apple to focus on for the Macs. Siri found its way to the desktop at WWDC last year, so some new features could be in order. “Hey Siri” functionality could be expanded, and third-party features don’t currently work for Siri on MacOS. What we won’t see Some bad news: we almost definitely won’t see a new iPhone. Although the iPhone SE is technically due an update, the timing would be terrible. Apple is expected to announce three new phones of some kind this fall; the last thing it needs is a new cheap iPhone undercutting the “super-cycle” of people upgrading to the iPhone 8. A new Mac Pro is also probably off the table. Although the timing for a preview announcement makes sense, Apple execs previously hinted that a new Mac Pro would come by the end of the year. That also gives Apple time to integrate Intel’s newly-announced Core i9 chips, which are an obvious thing for Apple to stick inside its premiere video-editing machine.

The move means Mueller’s politically charged inquiry will now look into Flynn’s paid work as a lobbyist for a Turkish businessman in 2016, in addition to contacts between Russian officials and Flynn and other Trump associates during and after the Nov. 8 presidential election. Federal prosecutors in Virginia are investigating a deal between Flynn and Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin as part of a grand jury criminal probe, according to a subpoena seen by Reuters. Alptekin’s company, Netherlands-based Inovo BV, paid Flynn's consultancy $530,000 between September and November to produce a documentary and research on Fethullah Gulen, an exiled Turkish cleric living in the United States. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan blames Gulen for a failed coup last July. Alptekin, an ally of Erdogan, told Reuters he hired Flynn to provide research on how Gulen is “poisoning the atmosphere” between Turkey and the United States. Gulen has denied any role in the coup and dismisses Turkey’s allegations that he heads a terrorist organization. The grand jury in Virginia has issued subpoenas to some of Flynn’s business associates involved in the work for Inovo, two people familiar with the probe say. The subpoena seen by Reuters seeks bank records, documents and communications related to Flynn, his company, Flynn Intel Group, Alptekin and Inovo. Flynn's lawyer, Robert Kelner, did not respond to questions about Flynn's work for Inovo or Mueller's investigation. A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment. Alptekin declined to comment when asked about the investigation into Flynn and whether he or anyone he knows has been subpoenaed. BROAD POWERS Mueller’s move to take over the Virginia grand jury’s criminal investigation highlights his broad powers as special counsel. Reuters could not determine when the grand jury was first convened, but its existence has been previously reported. Until now the investigation has been led by Brandon van Grack, an espionage prosecutor in the Justice Department, and federal prosecutors from the Eastern District of Virginia. It is not clear whether Van Grack and others who have been working on the case will continue to do so. Deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller, a former FBI director, on May 17 to oversee an investigation into any links or collusion between Russia and individuals associated with the Trump campaign. Rosenstein also gave him authority to pursue “any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation." Some members of Congress have asked the Justice Department to define the scope of Mueller’s inquiry. Mueller’s appointment followed an uproar over Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey, who had been investigating alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

News & Analysis Qualcomm Enters Intel PC Stronghold Alan Patterson 6/2/2017 11:01 AM EDT 1 Comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet TAIPEI — With Qualcomm’s announcement of its Snapdragon 835 Mobile PC platform, the company is entering Intel’s CPU turf, where the world’s biggest chipmaker has held more than half of the market for more than three decades. The new Snapdragon draws on ARM’s processor portfolio, fulfilling a plan that Microsoft announced for Windows 10 with Qualcomm at a Shenzhen, China event late last year. For the first time, Windows will work with all the usual apps, peripherals and enterprise capabilities on a mobile, power efficient, always-connected cellular PC, Microsoft said at the time. Windows 10, released in 2015, introduces what Microsoft calls "universal apps" that can run on multiple Microsoft product families with nearly identical code‍, ‌including platforms such as PCs, tablets, smartphones, embedded systems and Xbox One. (Photo: Qualcomm) While Qualcomm rolled out endorsements from a number of PC OEMs, including Asus and Lenovo at this week’s Computex show in Taipei, some analysts had reserved praise for the new Snapdragon chip. “On paper, it's quite promising if it can really achieve such long battery life and always-on connectivity that x86-based systems might struggle with,” said Bryan Ma, vice president of devices research with market researcher IDC. “The trick, though, is in the emulation. I actually just got a demo this morning, and it was better than I thought it would be, but wasn't perfect.” The Snapdragon 835 is a work in progress, Ma said, adding that he’s waiting for more test results after PC systems finally reach the market. It may still take as many as five years before there’s a noticeable impact on Intel from the Qualcomm chip, according to Ma. In the meantime, Intel can count on strong OEM marketing programs that Qualcomm isn't accustomed to. Intel is likely to dominate the hardcore desktop space that Qualcomm isn't touching with this solution. Even so, Qualcomm appears to be winning over OEMs with this latest effort that exploits Intel’s weakness in the mobile systems market. "The PC ecosystem continues to evolve, and this evolution requires new innovations in an ever-increasing mobile computing world," said Jerry Shen, chief executive officer of Asus. "With the Snapdragon Mobile PC Platform powering our new lineup of Windows 10 devices, our users now can take advantage of new always on, always connected experiences available to them." The world’s largest PC maker, Lenovo, also endorsed the new Qualcomm chip. "We're excited to work with Microsoft and Qualcomm Technologies to bring a whole new class of devices to consumers that will change the future of personal computing," said Jeff Meredith, a Lenovo senior vice president. The Snapdragon 835 SoC built into the Mobile PC Platform features the Qualcomm Kryo 280 CPU, the Adreno 540 GPU and the Hexagon 682 DSP to manage separate heterogenous workloads. The 10nm Snapdragon 835 provides devices with superior thermal handling and greater power efficiency, enabling fanless designs with longer battery life, according to Qualcomm. With an integrated Snapdragon X16 Gigabit LTE modem, devices will be able to support peak download speeds of up to 1Gbps. The Snapdragon 835 Mobile PC Platform will also feature 2x2 802.11ac MU-MIMO for optimal Wi-Fi connectivity on the go, Qualcomm said. The Qualcomm-Microsoft partnership widens a split between Intel and Microsoft, the two companies that have up to now dominated the PC business in what has come to be known as the Wintel alliance. "We are thrilled that OEMs are sharing our vision to bring the Windows 10 experience to the ARM ecosystem, powered by Qualcomm Technologies," said Matt Barlow, corporate vice president of Windows marketing for Microsoft. "This collaboration offers consumers something new that they have been craving – the best of a mobile computing experience with the best of Windows 10, all in one thin, light, connected device." —Alan Patterson covers the semiconductor industry for EE Times.

X Close World Home > News > World < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 2 June 2017 | MYT 10:54 PM Exclusive - Special counsel Mueller to probe ex-Trump aide Flynn's Turkey ties by nathan layne, mark hosenball, andjulia edwards ainsley WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating possible ties between the Trump election campaign and Russia, is expanding his probe to assume control of a grand jury investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, three sources told Reuters. The move means Mueller’s politically charged inquiry will now look into Flynn’s paid work as a lobbyist for a Turkish businessman in 2016, in addition to contacts between Russian officials and Flynn and other Trump associates during and after the Nov. 8 presidential election. Federal prosecutors in Virginia are investigating a deal between Flynn and Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin as part of a grand jury criminal probe, according to a subpoena seen by Reuters. Alptekin’s company, Netherlands-based Inovo BV, paid Flynn's consultancy $530,000 between September and November to produce a documentary and research on Fethullah Gulen, an exiled Turkish cleric living in the United States. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan blames Gulen for a failed coup last July. Alptekin, an ally of Erdogan, told Reuters he hired Flynn to provide research on how Gulen is “poisoning the atmosphere” between Turkey and the United States. Gulen has denied any role in the coup and dismisses Turkey’s allegations that he heads a terrorist organisation. The grand jury in Virginia has issued subpoenas to some of Flynn’s business associates involved in the work for Inovo, two people familiar with the probe say. The subpoena seen by Reuters seeks bank records, documents and communications related to Flynn, his company, Flynn Intel Group, Alptekin and Inovo. Flynn's lawyer, Robert Kelner, did not respond to questions about Flynn's work for Inovo or Mueller's investigation. A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment. Alptekin declined to comment when asked about the investigation into Flynn and whether he or anyone he knows has been subpoenaed. BROAD POWERS Mueller’s move to take over the Virginia grand jury’s criminal investigation highlights his broad powers as special counsel. Reuters could not determine when the grand jury was first convened, but its existence has been previously reported. Until now the investigation has been led by Brandon van Grack, an espionage prosecutor in the Justice Department, and federal prosecutors from the Eastern District of Virginia. It is not clear whether Van Grack and others who have been working on the case will continue to do so. Deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller, a former FBI director, on May 17 to oversee an investigation into any links or collusion between Russia and individuals associated with the Trump campaign. Rosenstein also gave him authority to pursue “any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation." Some members of Congress have asked the Justice Department to define the scope of Mueller’s inquiry. Mueller’s appointment followed an uproar over Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey, who had been investigating alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Democrats and some of the president's fellow Republicans had demanded an independent probe of whether Russia tried to sway the outcome of November's election in favour of Trump and against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump, who has said there was no coordination between his campaign and Russia, has decried the investigation as a “witch hunt.” One of Trump’s most trusted aides during the election campaign, Flynn had a long career in the military. He set up the Flynn Intel Group, an Alexandria, Virginia-based intelligence consultancy, after President Barack Obama dismissed him as head of the military’s Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014. UNFINISHED DOCUMENTARY Mueller, who takes over leadership of an FBI investigation that began last July, can present evidence to grand juries and hear testimony from witnesses. Trump fired Flynn in February after it became clear that he had falsely characterized the nature of phone conversations he had with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak in December, just after the Obama administration imposed new sanctions on Russia for what U.S. intelligence agencies had concluded was a Kremlin-led effort through computer hacking, fake news and propaganda to boost Trump’s chances of winning the White House.  Flynn's work for Inovo came under scrutiny after he published a commentary on a political news website on Election Day calling Gulen a “radical Islamist” who should be extradited to Turkey. Along with the editorial, the Flynn Intel Group also produced a 75-page report on Gulen based mainly on news reports and some video footage for a documentary that was never made, according to three people familiar with the project. Alptekin, who is chairman of the Turkey-U.S. Business Council, told Reuters he was satisfied with Flynn’s research because it had helped him understand how Gulen’s network operates in the United States. He said the $530,000 payment to Flynn’s firm came "mostly" from his personal funds. The rest came from Inovo's corporate revenues, Alptekin said. On Nov. 18, the day after Flynn was appointed Trump’s national security adviser, Trump transition team lawyer William McGinley raised concerns on a call with the Flynn Intel Group and others involved in the Inovo project over who had paid for Flynn's commentary, according to two people with knowledge of the conversation. Flynn did not participate in that call, they said. At the time of the call, Flynn had not disclosed that his work for Alptekin meant he was being paid to represent Turkish interests during the election campaign. Flynn Intel Group had said in a September 2016 filing that it was lobbying for Inovo but did not disclose its Turkish links. In March, Flynn retroactively registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. In a letter accompanying the March filing, Flynn's lawyer, Kelner, said the disclosure was being made because Flynn's work for Inovo "could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey," which he noted was seeking to extradite Gulen. The House of Representatives intelligence committee, which is also investigating Russian interference in the election, subpoenaed records from Flynn on Wednesday. The Senate's intelligence committee, which has a separate probe under way, has also served subpoenas on Flynn and two of his businesses, and earlier this week Flynn indicated that he would start turning over relevant materials.

Cricket is hardly synonymous with technological innovation, but the sport is taking strides to smarten up its game – starting with the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy. For starters, the tournament – which kicked off on June 1 – sees Intel's Falcon 8 drone being used for pre-match pitch analysis. The UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) is equipped with HD and infrared cameras, which allow it to capture images and feedback reports on pitch conditions, including grass cover, health, and topology. As well as helping groundskeepers better maintain the pitch, it also means commentators are armed with more information for their broadcasts, and fans can glean additional insights. Speaking of which, the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy also heralds the arrival of the Speculur BatSense, an intelligent cricket accessory that features Intel's Curie technology. It mounts on to any cricket bat and generates rich data for every stroke played, covering parameters like back-lift, bat speed, and follow through. During the Champions Trophy, this stands to further add to the punditry arsenal, with a number of top players deploying the sensor. It might sound a bit superflous to all but the most diehard cricket enthusiast, but I saw it in action during the opening England vs Bangladesh match, and even as a casual fan, it genuinely enriched the experience – by which I mean, helped me make smarter bets. Better still, Speculur plans to launch a consumer version of the BatSense later in the year, so it stands to aid cricketers of all ability levels – a bit like the Zepp Golf 2 sensor does on the driving range. It'll be launching in Australia, India, the US and the UK in H2 2017, according to the company. Lastly, this year's tournament will see fans able to enjoy new VR experience on match days at Edgbaston and the Oval, where HMDs (head mounted displays) will allow punters to test their batting skills against virtual bowlers and even receive a mock score, in addition to various data on their strokes. If you want to see the new tech in action, the ICC Champions Trophy runs until June 18, and the latest ticketing info can be found here.

The activities focused on nutritional education for children to improve their height and health for the next generation, especially in rural areas. On May 27 around 900 students of Bình Khánh Primary School in HCM City’s Cần Giờ District received 3,600 free glasses of milk. Đặng Thái Bình, principal of the school, said donating milk is very useful for the school’s students because a large number are malnourished and stunting is very high. Many of them are children from poor and near-poor families, he said. The school’s teachers were also trained in nutrition education, he added. Three thousand glasses of milk were also provided to children attending Bay Vào Thế Giới (Fly into the World), a programme held in HCM City’s District 1 on May 28 by Mathnasium Việt Nam, which runs centres to teach maths to children. Another 40,000 glasses of milk were provided to students of 20 schools built nationwide under the Đèn Đom Đóm programme by FrieslandCampina Việt Nam since 2012. The activities, carried out by FrieslandCampina, are a part of its campaign called Drinking Milk- Exercising-Healthy, which has been expanded this year. The development and growth of a child is affected greatly by its daily diet, nutrition and exercise, according to the company. Quang Ninh to host int’l conference on sexual health The ninth Asia Pacific conference on reproductive and sexual health and rights (APCRSHP) will be held from November 27-30 in the northern province of Quang Ninh. The Vietnam Public Health Association (VPHA) announced the information at a press conference on June 2 in Hanoi, adding that it is the first time Vietnam host the biggest forum on reproductive and sexual health in the Asia – Pacific region. Young people will gather in the first day of the conference themed “Leave no one behind! Justice in sexual and reproductive health”. The days after, representatives will discuss issues, such as overcoming social, cultural and regional barriers; towards an economic order, strengthening the justice system, making good quality education and advancing justice and equality in sexual and reproductive health and rights.  The event is expected to welcome 1,500 representatives from over 40 countries and organisations, of whom some 200 researchers will be speakers. The conference will be the biggest sexual and reproductive health and rights dialogue to be viewed at different angles like culture, religious policy, healthcare system and education, said Dr. Le Vu Anh, President of VPHA. He added that as a host, Vietnam will introduce five typical solution models for sexual and reproductive health at the event. The conference will offer an opportunity for Vietnam’s health sector to introduce its achievement and exchange experience with other countries in region and the world, according to a representative of the country’s health ministry. Initiated by civil society organisations in 2001, the biennial APCRSHP has been held in the Philippines (twice), Thailand, India, Malaysia, China, Indonesia and Myanmar.  Deputy PM Dam urges reduction of hospital overcrowding in Ho Chi Minh City Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam worked with leaders of the Ho Chi Minh City People’s Committee to discuss solutions to reduce high-level hospital overcrowding as well as improve the quality of medical facilities. Speaking at the meeting, Deputy PM Dam appreciated the trial of health stations in Ho Chi Minh City as well as urged the managers to draw lessons and experience from this model. He asked relevant agencies to continue to invest more in infrastructure, equipment and human resources to meet the requirements of caring for people’s health. The Deputy PM called for more investors to promote their investment in the development of medical facilities towards the non-profit model. The trial of health facilities should ensure the proper function and tasks as well as service of medical facilities at the grass-roots level, added Deputy PM Dam. The City’s healthcare sector should create favourable conditons for medical facilities at the grass-roots level to create dossiers in managing and monitoring the health of all local people, noted the Deputy PM. Two overpasses near Tan Son Nhat airport ready this month Two overpasses at Truong Son Intersection and Nguyen Thai Son-Nguyen Kiem Roundabout can be partly opened to traffic late this month, helping ease chronic traffic congestion in Tan Son Nhat International Airport area. Work on the Y-shaped concrete overpass at Truong Son Intersection is being sped up so that it can be in place two months ahead of schedule, according to Urban Traffic Management No.1 under the HCMC Department of Transport. Its first bridge beams have just been installed after nearly four months of construction. Meanwhile, the N-shaped steel overpass at Nguyen Thai Son-Nguyen Kiem Roundabout has had the first bridge beams installed. Urban Traffic Management No.3 expected the first branch connecting Hoang Minh Giam and Nguyen Thai Son streets to be completed two months earlier than planned. Work on its second branch linking Nguyen Kiem and Hoang Minh Giam streets starts early this month. It is scheduled for completion in September. But work on the last branch from Nguyen Kiem to Nguyen Thai Son has been delayed by the longer-than-expected land compensation process for 30 affected households. The project is slated for completion at the end of this year. Another priority project is to construct two overpasses connecting Nguyen Van Cu Bridge and Vo Van Kiet Avenue. They may be opened to traffic later this month, reducing traffic congestion around the nearby intersection of Nguyen Van Cu and Tran Hung Dao streets. Two branches of Nguyen Van Cu will be in place by June 30 while the riverside road section and other construction items will be done by August 30, according to the Saigon River Tunnel Management Center. When the two exits are in place, they will directly link downtown districts 1 and 5 with districts 4, 7, and 8 to the south of the city. Nha Nam joins Children’s Book Festival Nha Nam Media and Publishing House will bring its new works to the Children’s Book Festival organized by Hanoi City’s Department of Information and Communication from June 1 to 7 at Hanoi book street on December 19 Street, adjacent to the Hanoi People’s Court and Ly Thuong Kiet Street in Hoan Kiem District. As part of the festival, Nha Nam in collaboration with the French Cultural Center L’Espace and the book club Sach oi mo ra (Open Book) will hold a meeting on literature called “La Fontaine in the eyes of children” at 3 p.m. on June 3 at L’Espace, 24 Trang Tien Street in Hanoi. During the festival, Nha Nam will bring young readers hundreds of new publications as well as promotional programs on the occasion of International Children’s Day (June 1). The event will also feature two noteworthy books, namely “A handbook for children’s safety” and “A handbook to teach courtesy for kids” written by artist Vu Tuan Anh and his companions. The author will exchange with and give autographs on his books to fans at Nha Nam book stall at the book street from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. on June 4. Localities asked to be well prepared for coming rainy season Many mountainous localities suffered heavy losses from natural disasters in 2006 due to their failure to take account of forecast, prevention, monitoring, risk assessment and communication work, according to an official of the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control.  Van Phu Chinh, head of the committee’s standing office, made the assessment at a meeting in Hanoi on June 1 that looked into natural disaster prevention and control in 18 mountainous provinces from the northern region to the central province of Ha Tinh. He noted in 2016, the mountainous areas were affected by 24 strong cold spells, four storms and follow-up floods, along with whirlwinds and hailstorms.  Up to 109 people were killed and went missing in these disasters while about 940 houses collapsed or washed away and 44,220 others were inundated, more than 134,000ha of rice and other crops were devastated. Natural calamities also killed 37,180 livestock and 127,530 poultry and damaged 56km of canals and ditches. Material damage exceeded 5.8 trillion VND (255.4 million USD), Chinh said. He blamed authorities at all levels, especially grass-roots level, for the problem, adding that their supervision activities are still lax. While there remain many obstacles in the resettlement of residents in vulnerable areas, the planning of residential areas has yet to take into account disaster risks. Communication activities to raise public awareness of flash floods in many mountainous provinces haven’t been effective. Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Hoang Van Thang, who is a deputy head of the central steering committee, said human and property damage caused by natural disasters in mountainous provinces remains a challenge for many years and haven’t been settled thoroughly as expected. Meanwhile, Director of the National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Hoang Duc Cuong said the forecasting of natural disasters in mountainous areas, especially in the north, is flawed and hasn’t completely satisfied the growing demand in disaster prevention and control. To minimise human and property losses, the localities should be well-prepared in terms of leadership, forces, means and materials, and logistics. They also have to appropriately exploit natural resources to ensure sustainable socio-economic development, he added.  To respond to this year’s rainy season, the central steering committee ordered the provinces to review all residential areas and structures to locate flood- and landslide-prone areas while adamantly relocating households at risk.  It said they must devise flood response plans and pay special attention to communication methods to ensure all residents will be updated with disaster information. Rescue staff and vehicles also need to be geared up in case of emergencies.  Gia Lai ensures settlement for 3,000 nomad ethnic households Nearly 3,000 ethnic minority households have been resettled in the Central Highlands province of Gia Lai thanks to the province’s efforts to complete more than 100 resettlement projects during 2013-2016. Over 52 billion VND (2.3 million USD) was splashed out on ten concentrated resettlement projects for more than 660 ethnic minority families. The money was used to level 24 hectares of land, reclaim 29 hectares of production land, construct 13,000 kilometres of road, ten electricity facilities and 21 water facilities and erect six community houses and seven classrooms. With efficient infrastructure and a production zone, H’Lang village in Chu R Cam commune, Krong Pa district is a standout resettlement area helping alleviate poverty among ethnic minorities. The village was established in 2012 with total investment of 11 billion VND (484,000 USD). Meanwhile, 94 alternative resettlement projects were carried out to benefit another 2,260 households. Nearly 60 billion VND (2.6 million USD) was spent to build 37 kilometres of roads, four water facilities, 12 community houses and four kindergartens.  Ta Chi Khanh, Vice Chairman of the Krong Pa district People’s Committee, said that ten alternative resettlement areas were built for more than 270 households and two concentrated resettlement zones were completed for some 500 families in the district.  The resettlement sites have adequate facilities for production, he said, adding that capital has been cut for some resettlement projects, posing challenges for the locality. More than 123 billion VND (5.4 million USD) was allocated to Gia Lai province to implement resettlement projects during 2013-2016.  According to the ethnicity board of the provincial People’s Council, resettlement projects are significant to ensure a stable life for minorities. Upgrades of infrastructure together with high-tech economic models have helped tackle poverty in the province. However, the board also stated drawbacks when carrying out the projects, with financial support lacking and disbursement of that support slow. Italy’s Republic Day marked in Hanoi The Vietnam – Italy Friendship Association organised a friendship exchange in Hanoi on June 1 to celebrate Italy’s 71st Republic Day (June 2, 1946 - 2017). Speaking at the event, Chairman of the association Nguyen Van Nam lauded Italy’s development and contributions to world peace and cooperation in the past 71 years, particularly as a founding and key member of the EU and a responsible member of the UN and many other multi-lateral organisations.  He said his association is proud to help strengthen the friendship between the two countries. He also praised the Hanoi University’s Faculty of Italian Studies, which is emerging as an Italian language and culture centre in Vietnam. Italian Ambassador to Vietnam Cecilia Piccioni said Vietnam and Italy are enjoying a fruitful period of their relationship, with cooperation opportunities opening up in defence and security. She said students, researchers and artists are ideal ambassadors of each nation. Quang Tri honours US invention prize winner High school student Pham Huy from Quang Tri province has won third prize in the robotics and intelligent machine category for a prosthetic arm designed for the disabled at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair 2017 in the US. He was honoured at a ceremony held in the locality by the provincial Department of Education and Training With a prosthetic arm designed for people with disabilities, Pham Huy’s work was one of the eight selected to attend the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair 2017 held in the US, eventualy winning third prize at the prestigious science competition. The arm is operated based on a sensor system in the shoe and the joint between the calf and the food.

The market will open from 9am to 1pm at the Green Shoot International School at 414/7 Cua Dai Road.  Czech President to pay State visit to Vietnam President of the Czech Republic Milos Zeman will pay a State-level visit to Vietnam from June 6-8. The visit will be made at the invitation of President Tran Dai Quang, the Foreign Ministry announced on June 1. HCM City leader hosts Slovak Deputy Prime Minister Chairman of the Ho Chi Minh City People’s Committee Nguyen Thanh Phong has called on Slovak and Vietnamese businesses to step up their cooperation in such areas as chemical industry, electric equipment, food industry and tourism.  HCM City is willing to create the best possible conditions for Slovak firms to run long-term business in the locality, the official told visiting Slovak Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Robert Kaliňák on June 1.  Phong said Robert Kaliňák’s visit contributes to enhancing the fruitful time-honoured cooperation between Slovakia and Vietnam and Ho Chi Minh City as well.  He called on the Slovak Government to continue facilitating the Vietnamese’s integration into the Slovak society as well as their role of bridging the two countries.  Robert Kaliňák said he was impressed by achievements Vietnam has recorded over the past time, saying with a lot of similarities, the two countries can support each other in national construction and development.  The long-standing cooperation and friendship should be demonstrated through specific, effective economic projects and programmes, he said.  Slovakia stands ready to cooperate with Vietnam, including HCM City, in fields like machinery and tourism in order to turn the two sides’ potential into practical projects, thus contributing to tightening the bilateral ties. Quang Tri celebrates World Oceans Day with exhibition on islands The central province of Quang Tri marked World Oceans Day (June 8) on Cua Tung beach with the opening of a mobile exhibition on historical and legal evidence affirming Vietnam’s sovereignty over Hoang Sa (Paracel) and Truong Sa (Spratly) archipelagos. The exhibits include a large number of maps, documents and photos of different periods, which were collected by international and domestic researchers. The materials demonstrate Vietnam’s continuous exercise of sovereignty over and safeguarding of the archipelagos, rejecting China’s distorted versions of history. The same day, the province held a meeting in response to the World Oceans Day and the Vietnam Sea and Islands Week 2017. Speaking at the opening ceremony, Vice Chairman of Quang Tri People’s Committee Ha Sy Dong said the Vietnam sea and islands week, themed “for future of next generations”, sends out an appeal for communal efforts in protecting the marine environment. During the week, local authorities and agencies will hold communications campaigns on policies and laws on sea and islands, and the role and potential of sea and islands in national development. Thua Thien – Hue spends 5 billion VND to aid fishermen The central province of Thua Thien – Hue has released a decision to allocate more than 4.96 billion VND to assist fishermen in offshore fishing. Accordingly, Phu Vang district will receive over 4.2 billion VND (184,800) and Phu Dien 762 million VND (33,528 USD) to help local fishermen buy fuel for fishing trips, communications devices, and ship insurance. Meanwhile, under the Government’s Decree 67/2014/ND-CP on policies for fisheries development, the province in the past two years have provided preferential loans worth 177.49 billion VND (7.8 million USD) for the upgrade and building of 40 fishing vessels. In Phu Vang alone, 29 boat owners have gained approval for their applications seeking concessional loans for building and upgrading fishing boats under the decree. Can Tho prepares for APEC week on food security The Mekong city of Can Tho has finalised a coordination plan on the hosting of the APEC week on food security and high-level dialogue on food security and sustainable agriculture development in response to climate change. Addressing a meeting on June 1, Vice Chairman of the municipal People’s Committee Dao Anh Dung asked the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development to complete the plan to launch it in early June. He also stressed the need to strengthen communications and ensure security and safety for the event, while promoting the economic and tourism potential and strengths of the city. Within the framework of the events, about 14 workshops and conferences as well as bilateral meetings between leaders of Can Tho and ministers of some APEC members will take place from August 18-25. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development will chair two major events, the APEC Week on Food Security and high-level dialogue on food security and sustainable agriculture development in response to climate change on August 21-25. The events are good chances for Can Tho to introduce the nation and people of Vietnam and Can Tho in particular to foreign friends. On the occasion, the Can Tho Centre for Trade Promotion-Investment and Exhibition will hold a safe farm produce fair from August 20-24 with about 300 booths to boost trade on the products. Denmark helps clear leftover ordnance in Thua Thien-Hue The People’s Committee of central Thua Thien-Hue province and the Danish Demining Group (DDG) signed a memorandum understanding on a project to minimize risks of ordnance left by the war in the province on June 1. The project is funded by the Embassy of Japan in Vietnam and the A.P Moller Support Foundation of Denmark with a total sum of about 1.2 million USD. The project will cover ten communes of A Luoi district and other prioritized areas as suggested by the provincial People’s Committee. It will survey bomb and mine pollution in the communes and launch activities to handle ordnance there. In addition to that, it will make further surveys to define and classify areas with ordnance, and assess post-demining impacts. The project will also help enhance capacity in information management and connecting plans of action in the province. The MoU also allows DDG and Thua Thien Hue to set up cooperative relations to settle leftover explosives from the war, contributing to improving safety to locals and socio-economic development in affected communities through the humanitarian mine action programme. Addressing the event, Vice Chairman of the provincial People’s Committee Nguyen Van Phuong thanked the Japan Embassy in Vietnam, the A.P Moller Support Foundation and the DDG for helping the province overcome the war aftermaths. He expressed his hope that activities of the project will be implemented effectively, benefiting localities’ people and socio-economic development. Workshop talks energy transition in connection with social equity The Central Institute for Economic Management (CIEM) and the German Friedrich Ebert Stiftung (FES) foundation co-organized a workshop on energy transition in connection with social equity in Hanoi on June 1. The event is part of the FES’s comparative study on energy transition and social equity targeting eight Asian countries, including Vietnam. Deputy Director of the CIEM Nguyen Thi Tue Anh said apart from hydropower, renewable energy is little used in Vietnam. Meanwhile, the utilization of fossil fuels to develop industrial sectors and transport is increasing rapidly. Vietnam has built a number of programmes and policies to cope with climate change and develop the energy sector, she said, noting that energy transition could ensure social equity by increasing quality of energy services for everyone, generating jobs, modernizing industry, improving economic efficiency and growth, enhancing environmental quality, and mitigating climate change. Experts suggested Vietnam developing a new long-term energy vision to enhance the capacity of accessing energy and improve the efficiency of energy in addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and striving toward using 100 percent of renewable energy. It is necessary to invest in energy storage capacity and the electricity grid, experts said, also stressing the need to enhance technical and financial transparency of State groups in the field of energy to ensure fair competition, raise productivity and benefit consumers more. Besides joining policy dialogues on energy development, Vietnam should devise fiscal policies and regulations to promote the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency, especially in remote and ethnic minority areas and labour-intensive sectors, as well as among women and low income earners. Creating playgrounds in urban area It would seem that children’s playgrounds are a ‘luxury’ in big cities, when all available areas are used either for trading or parking. But through their efforts, the Think Playgrounds group has called upon the community to create playgrounds, bringing joy to children. Since beginning operations 2 years ago, the group has built 60 playgrounds in many regions across the country. In the first few days of June, a new 300 metres square playground has been opened in Chuong Duong ward, Hoan Kiem district, Hanoi, with many games such as climbing system and swings. Nguyen Thanh Thuy in Phuc Tan Street, Hoan Kiem district, said “the playground is not very wide, but to us this is a very precious thing. For a long time, urban kids have lacked the space in which to play. During the summer vacation, their parents have to work and can’t always take them out. With the aim of helping children to stay away from social evils, many families have "detained" their children in the house, forcing them to make friends with television and play video games all day. With the playground, we worry much less". The playground at Lane 1, Vong Ha street, Chuong Duong ward is the result of a month of construction by the Think Playgrounds group’s members, with the financial support of the HealthBridge Foundation of Canada and the help of the local government. In large cities, the construction of children's playgrounds has not been properly addressed. Specifically, at some wards in Dong Da and Hoan Kiem districts, the population has risen by tens of thousands, but public spaces only cover several hundred square meters. The city is currently building more flower gardens and parks. However, the distance from home to the flower garden or the park is a barrier and not every child has a chance to go and enjoy them. With young kids, the playgrounds in residential areas are most accessible, but these playgrounds are always used for a variety of purposes, from sales and parking to badminton or adult football. Chu Kim Duc and Nguyen Tieu Quoc Dat, two members of the Think Playgrounds group, have long entertained the idea of creating spaces for children in the city. However the idea was only gradually turning into reality until they met Judith Hansen, a 70-year-old American visitor who holds a deep love for Vietnam. She has since helped the young people to create a playground, providing financial support. These young people formed the Think Playgrounds group. ‘Think Playgrounds’ formed their first playground for children of migrant workers or peddlers, who call the alluvial ground along the Hong River their home. The playground, which cost over VND10 million was open to the elation of the kids and their parents alike, who could now rest assured that their children would steer clear from perilous ‘water games’ in the river. As was the hope of the two founding members Kim Duc and Quoc Dat, the success of this playground has "awakened" the minds of many people. Such a shortage of outdoor play areas has left urban kids growing increasingly dependent on digital devices for leisurely activities, resulting in their imbalanced mental and physical growth as well as creating other issues. Acutely aware of such problems, many communities have sought to "reclaim" public space. However, the group members have encountered immense hurdles ‘reclaiming’ public land from illegal occupants, who generally would not return the plots to public use. Undaunted, these young people sought out help from local authorities and residents in the specific neighborhoods to talk the illegal occupants into giving the plots back to the public, for the group to build playgrounds on. Speaking about the activities of the group, Nguyen Tri Quoc Dat shared that the group operates under the social enterprise model, using revenue from the sale of playground designs to agencies, in order to maintain an income for the team members and raise funds to build the playground. The playground in the street is a bridge between social organisations, benefactors and communities who need to build a playground. Some organisations and businesses have made a great contribution in building their playgrounds, including HealthBridge, ACCD, or Hoang Vu enterprise. In addition, the group usually makes use of recycled materials and self-design and construction to ensure safety and sustainability. After more than three years of operation, the group has 11 members and has coordinated with other agencies and social organisations to successfully build 40 playgrounds in Hanoi. Not only in Hanoi, the group has also coordinated with social organisations and other volunteer groups to build more than 20 playgrounds in various localities, including remote and mountainous areas such as Ha Giang or Ly Son Island (Quang Ngai). Some playgrounds cost up to VND65 million, as with the new playground inaugurated in Chuong Duong ward. Through their activities, these young people have shown great effort and have managed to change public perceptions concerning the need for child entertainment. Hospitals in HCMC review kidney dialysis process After the medical incident killed seven dialysis patients in the northern province of Hoa Binh, health authority in Ho Chi Minh City asked hospitals to review the process. As per the department of Health’s document to facilities, medical staffs at the artificial kidney department in hospitals must follow the Ministry of Health’s guideline on dialysis process to ensure patients’ safety.  Deputy Head of the municipal Department of Health Dr. Tang Chi Thuong said that medical institutions providing kidney dialysis services are requested to review their technical process, examine patients’ health condition, clean and test all their equipment in accordance with instructions from the health ministry on kidney dialysis to avoid medical complications. After seven out of 18 kidney patients receiving dialysis at Hoa Binh Province General Hospital died of suspected anaphylactic shock and ten of them were sent to Hanoi-based Bach Mai Hospital for further treatment, hospitals in HCMC have reviewed dialysis techniques and process. Dr. Luong Hoang Liem of a hospital in Thu Duc District said that the hospital has checked all dialysis process on 130 patients and 10 other patients in its satellite infirmary in Binh Chieu Ward. However, the hospital transferred dialysis patients in the satellite hospital to Thu Duc Hospital five days ago for patients’ safety. Nephrology and dialysis medical experts said that anaphylactic shock complication is likely to happen in dialysis patients with low rate. Importantly, medical workers must early detect and provide timely treatment. Prior to the incident, a patient’s heart with kidney failure stopped beating on dialysis process in Hoa Binh Hospital.  Loan level for students lifted The Prime Minister decided to lift the loan for a student to VND1.5 million a month.   The Vietnam Bank for Social Policies said that from June 15, 2017, the maximum loan for a student will be VND1.5 million a month as per the circular 751. The rate increased by VND250,000 a student  for a month compared to the old level taking effect on January 9, 2016. The PM asked the Ministry of Investment and Planning to balance and pour capital to the bank as per the law. The bank is responsible for providing loan and recovering the debts. Exhibition on Paracel, Spratly archipelagos in Quảng Trị An exhibition showcasing evidence that affirms Việt Nam’s sovereignty over Hoàng Sa (Paracel) and Trường Sa (Spratly) archipelagos opened on June 1 in Quảng Trị Province’s Cửa Tùng Town. The exhibition, held to celebrate 2017 Việt Nam Seas and Islands Week, displays historical and legal evidence in the form of maps, documents and pictures, collected in Việt Nam and other countries. “The Việt Nam Seas and Islands Week themed, For Our Future, has significant meaning. It  conveys the message to people to join hands to protect the marine environment, to be aware of their responsibility in cleaning beaches and seas, and to not sacrifice the marine environment for economic gain,” said Deputy Chairman of Quảng Trị province’s People’s Committee, Hà Sỹ Đồng. “Seas and islands have an especially significant role in the cause of country’s establishment and protection as well as in the socio-economic, security, defence development strategy of the country. Therefore, for generations, Vietnamese people have been united together to protect the country,” said Đồng. It is also important to do awareness campaigns about the role, importance and potential of the seas and islands of Việt Nam in terms of protecting the nation, Đồng added. The exhibition, which opens till Sunday, displays historical evidence that affirms Việt Nam’s sovereignty, which will help other countries, including China, form a deeper understanding of Việt Nam’s history as well as the legitimate desire of Vietnamese people to protecting their territory and sovereignty. On the occasion, the central province asked all localities and their authorities to continue promulgating Việt Nam’s policy, stance and law on its seas and islands; and to strengthen communications regarding the historical and legal evidence that affirms its sovereignty over Hoàng Sa (Paracel) and Trường Sa (Spratly) archipelagos.

Life is Strange is getting a sequel, but it might be getting a prequel too Intel’s Compute Card wants to keep devices smarter for longer By Alessandro Barbosa Posted on June 2, 2017 2 min read 1 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Pinterest Share on Linkedin Share on Tumblr Technology is advancing at a blistering pace, and as a result, it’s pretty easy for your shiny new tech of today to look a little less impressive tomorrow. Advances in processing and computing make devices obsolete pretty quickly, which is a problem when everything is being injected with some smart functionality. You wouldn’t want to replace your all-in-one PC two years after purchase, nor would you want to get a new fridge because its brain just isn’t ticking the way it used to. Intel’s Compute Card is attempting to solve those problems. Shown off again at Computex, the Intel Compute Card is essentially what the name implies. Intel has managed to squeeze a fully functioning PC into the space that a credit card sized power bank usually occupies, with the device interfacing over USB-C to slot into a number of devices. Intel showed off laptop shells, smart appliances, and large all-in-one monitor setups that simply required the card to operate. Slide it in, and you’re good to go with a fully functioning, Windows-powered device, albeit with some slight drawbacks. Given the size, Intel’s Compute Cards aren’t meant to set your world on fire when it comes to performance. But for the uses Intel is envisioning – Chromebooks, smart TVs and slower all-in-ones – they more than fit the bill. They start with anything from Celeron or Pentium processors with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage and scale up to m5 and m5 processors with 128GB of storages. Intel expects the cards to cost anywhere between $140 and $450 depending on your specifications, which is a lot lower than you might expect from an electronic marvel of this size. Read  Samsung introduces HDR10+, in case you weren’t already confused Still, it needs adoption, and that’s where Intel might face the biggest hurdles. Manufacturers like Dell, Asus, MSI and more will need to get onboard with this new standard, but the idea of it all is promising. Intel expects each card to last as long as 10 years, but if all it takes is simply popping out the old one and replacing it, it’s an enticing offer for nearly every type of consumer.

At Newegg, one of the biggest online retailers in the US, AMD's whole 8C/16T range has benefitted from moderate pricing cuts, improving their price to performance ratios even further. To be clear, this is a retailer-lead cut rather than new pricing by AMD. In brief the US dollar price action is as bullet pointed below: AMD Ryzen 7 1800X down from $499.99 to $459.99 AMD Ryzen 7 1700X down from $399.99 to $349.99 AMD Ryzen 7 1700 down from $329.99 to $314.99 You can see above that Newegg is delivering greater price cuts to the more expensive 1700X and 1800X processors. The 1700X gets the biggest price cut of all with a full $50 chop. However, the Ryzen 7 1700 provides plenty of 8C/16T goodness with a lower 65W TDP, and comes with AMD's Wraith Spire RGB cooler in the box. Looking at the price adjustments, I'd guess that the cheapest Ryzen 7 was already easily outselling its more expensive brethren. The price cuts, which retailers are free to instigate without interference from AMD, provide a quick retort to Intel's recent launch of the Core-X Series processors. As a reminder, new Intel 'Extreme' processors within this kind of price range will include the 4C/8T Core i7 7740X, listed at $339, and the 6C/12T Core it-7800X, listed at $389. To purchase an Intel processor with 8C/16T you are looking at recommended pricing of $599. Of course Intel processors have their own particular strengths and at this price level the Core i7 7740X has broken several OC and benchmarking world records at Computex this week (scalping several Pi and Prime number calculation benchmarks, several 3DMark0X benchmarks, Geekbench, Cinebench and more). The current AMD Ryzen 7 discounts on Newegg aren't highlighted as time limited or on promotion, so hopefully we will see similar level cuts at other retailers, and here across the pond.

Posted by scaryjim - Fri 02 Jun 2017 11:43 afiretruck Wouldn't that just be something incredible, eh? 10 cores/20 threads, clock speeds comparable to a 1700 (if you believe the rumours), for $499? Interestingly, once you balance out the extra threads with the lower clock speed, I reckon you'd end up with a chip that has lower single threaded and similar multithreaded performance to an 1800X. It'd only really be worth the money if you *needed* the extra memory channels and PCIe lanes X399 is going to offer. That or if you want to overclock, but with the TDP at 125W already, you might be better off going for the 1700….? *shrug* However it falls out, it looks like it's going to be good value high core counts and lots of PCIe lanes all round. Competition is good, right? ;) Posted by MercutioUK - Fri 02 Jun 2017 11:50 afiretruck scaryjim Making pricing room so the low end threadripper CPUs can come in ~ $499, perhaps? Wouldn't that just be something incredible, eh? Well, I'm holding out on a purchase till X399 and threadripper launches, just to see what occurs. I have PCIe lane requirements (+ maybe cores+memory for PC test lab/virtuals) but… no way I'm paying what Intel are asking so it's this or Ryzen and be happy with it/throw some stuff in a second box. $499 for a low end threadripper would be kinda special.

Coined the “Passenger Economy” by Intel and prepared by analyst firm Strategy Analytics, the study predicts an explosive economic trajectory growing from $800 billion in 2035 to $7 trillion by 2050. New digital business models ushered in by personal computing, the internet, ubiquitous connectivity and smartphones gave birth to whole new economies. Autonomous driving will do the same, Intel says. Companies should start thinking about their autonomous strategy now Less than a decade ago, no one was talking about the potential of a soon-to-emerge app or sharing economy because no one saw it coming. This is why we started the conversation around the Passenger Economy early, to wake people up to the opportunity streams that will emerge when cars become the most powerful mobile data generating devices we use and people swap driving for riding. —Intel CEO Brian Krzanich Intel and Strategy Analytics suggest that Autonomous driving and smart city technologies will enable the new Passenger Economy, gradually reconfiguring entire industries and inventing new ones thanks to the time and “cognitive surplus” it will unlock. The new report frames the value of the economic opportunity through both a consumer and business lens and begins to build use cases designed to enable decision-makers to develop actionable change strategies. Autonomous technology will drive change across a range of industries and define a new landscape, the first green shoots of which will appear in the business-to-business sector. The emergence of pilotless vehicle options will first appear in developed markets and will reinvent the package delivery and long-haul transportation sectors. This will relieve driver shortages around the world and account for two-thirds of initial projected revenues. —study co-author Harvey Cohen, president, Strategy Analytics The research firm further points out that autonomously operated vehicle commercialization will gain steam by 2040—generating an increasingly large share of the projected value and heralding the emergence of instantaneously personalized services. Key report highlights include: Business use of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) is expected to generate $3 trillion in revenues, or 43% of the total passenger economy. Consumer use of Mobility-as-a-Service offerings is expected to account for $3.7 trillion in revenue, or nearly 55% of the total passenger economy. $200 billion of revenue is expected to be generated from rising consumer use of new innovative applications and services that will emerge as pilotless vehicle services expand and evolve. Conservatively, 585,000 lives can be saved due to self-driving vehicles in the era of the Passenger Economy from 2035 to 2045. Self-driving vehicles are expected to free more than 250 million hours of consumers’ commuting time per year in the most congested cities in the world. Reductions in public safety costs related to traffic accidents could amount to more than $234 billion over the Passenger Economy era from 2035-2045. The Passenger Economy report was sponsored by Intel and developed by Strategy Analytics. June 2, 2017 in Brief | Permalink | Comments (2) Comments By 2050, Autonomous Vehicles will also have to be Amphibious. Posted by: dursun | June 02, 2017 at 07:16 AM Driverless, UBER like (1 to 10-15 passenger) called on size BEVs/FCEVs, could greatly reduce A to Z travel cost, to reduce pollution, accidents and casualties. The smaller units (1 to 2 passengers) could be very small and very light 3 wheelers, to reduce energy consumption.

Home Archives Ed Morrissey Show Newsletters   Did Samantha Power ask for American citizens to be “unmasked” in intelligence reports? posted at 6:41 pm on June 1, 2017 by Allahpundit Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES A leftover from yesterday that shouldn’t be missed. Thanks to Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intel Committee and the man who first raised suspicions about improper “unmasking” in March, subpoenas have been issued to three Obama-era officials. Two are natsec people — Susan Rice and John Brennan, both of whom might have had good cause to “unmask” the identities of Trump staffers in the course of reviewing intelligence reports. But the third was a surprise. It’s Samantha Power, formerly the U.S. ambassador to the UN. Why would she be caught up in an “unmasking” review? She’s a diplomat, not an intelligence specialist. “Unmasking” is the revealing in intelligence reports of the identities of Americans whose communications (or information about whom) have been “incidentally” intercepted during foreign-intelligence-collection operations. Of course, the fact that a subpoena demanding information is issued does not necessarily mean the information exists. Nevertheless, the issuance of a subpoena implies that the issuer has a good-faith basis to believe it does. On that score, it has previously been reported that the committee’s chairman, Devin Nunes (R., Calif.), has reviewed intelligence reporting and detected instances of unmasking. Were there to be information indicating that Ms. Power was involved in unmasking American identities in intelligence reports, significant questions would be raised. As ambassador to the U.N., Power, a long-time Obama adviser, held a diplomatic position. She was not an intelligence analyst. It is not immediately clear why the U.N. ambassador would be involved in the disclosure of American identities in intelligence reports — after the agencies that collected and analyzed the intelligence had decided such identities should be masked. “Unmaskings are supposed to be rare,” noted the Wall Street Journal in an editorial, “and if the mere ambassador to the U.N. could demand them, what privacy protection was the Obama White House really offering U.S. citizens?” Watch the report Fox News ran on this embedded below. At 2:00, James Rosen flags an unusual question that Trey Gowdy asked Brennan at a hearing recently: “Do you recall any U.S. ambassadors asking that names be unmasked?” Hmmmm. Brennan doesn’t give him a categorical “no” either. Double hmmmm. One big wrinkle, though. Technically, neither Power nor anyone else can “demand” that American citizens be “unmasked.” They can request it; the decision then falls to the NSA or FBI (whichever agency has the relevant surveillance transcript), which can deny the request if it has no obvious intelligence purpose. That is, if it’s true that Power was keeping tabs on Trump staffers, this scandal would be much bigger than her. It would implicate the NSA and/or the FBI in approving a dubious request, especially if, as Nunes has claimed, the “unmaskings” he saw had no obvious foreign intelligence rationale. There’s another possibility, though. Maybe, notwithstanding Gowdy’s question, Power’s not being looked at because she requested an “unmasking.” Maybe someone else in a more plausible natsec position requested it and the unmasked transcript somehow found its way into Power’s hands. Remember, one of Nunes’s complaints in March about the intelligence he’d seen was that unmasked material had been “widely disseminated” within the Obama administration. If even someone as far-flung from the IC as Power had gotten hold of the material, that might explain what he meant. Power may have been subpoenaed so that the committee can find out who was passing intelligence to whom once they’d received it, properly, from the NSA or FBI. Since we’re on the subject of improper sharing of intelligence, an intriguing report (also left over from yesterday) via John Crudele of the New York Post: The Justice Department has gotten a warrant from the US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court — also known as the FISA court — to conduct electronic surveillance on a group of journalists who’ve been the recipient of leaked information, the source said. The journalists are not the target, according to my source — and I say, thank goodness for that. Instead, the Trump administration is looking for the leaker. Who could it be? Some in the administration are focusing on a retired, high-ranking military officer who held important posts in the intelligence service, according to the source. A retired, high-ranking former military officer who held important intelligence posts and is supposedly being fed info by “holdovers from the Obama administration” in the White House? That points to James Clapper or Michael Hayden, and Hayden didn’t serve in the Obama administration (except for a few weeks very early on while he was waiting to be replaced). Triple hmmmm.

In the gaming laptop space, you can usually be sure of two things: Stuff's gonna be powerful, (slightly) ridiculous-looking, and suitably expensive. But with the Nitro 5, first announced shortly before Computex and publicly shown for the first time on the show floor in Taipei, is different. You could call it a budget gaming laptop, but it's not really deserving of the negative connotations that go along with that description. The idea is to ship an attractive, gaming-centric rig that looks the part but doesn't murder your bank account — hence the liberal use of red chassis lighting and colored accents, and subtle wedge-like angles. The overall message is: This is a serious gaming laptop with some serious power behind it. This looks, feels and performs like a solid gaming laptop. Upon closer inspection, there are certainly aesthetic and build quality differences compared to laptops that sell in the $2,500-3,000 price range. When you're working within a more constrained budget, particularly with higher-end internals, there will inevitably be compromises. But the Nitro 5 doesn't look or feel cheap. Your choice of Intel/NVIDIA or AMD. There are actually two versions of the Acer Nitro 5 to choose from depending on your favored pairing of CPU and GPU. The first has an NVIDIA GTX 1050 Ti GPU and seventh-generation Intel Core processors, and there's another with seventh-gen AMD A-series CPUs and RX550 GPUs. For what it's worth, we're looking at the Intel/NVIDIA version here, which was the only one on show at the Acer booth at Computex. On the outside at least, both models should be identical. The use of an GTX 1050 Ti in the NVIDIA version is particularly promising. That chip doesn't rival the GTX 1060 used in more expensive models like the Razer Blade, but it represents a decent bump past the more common non-Ti variant. You'll likely have to settle for a less dazzling spec loadout to pick up an Acer Nitro 5 for the baseline price of $799 in the U.S., but even so, this machine could be a fantastic entry-level gaming machine for college students, or anyone who doesn't want to part with a huge amount of cash to play PC games on the go. Tempted by what Acer's cooking up here, or would you buy something more premium? Let us know in the comments!

USA-STOCKS-WEEKAHEAD:Wall St Weekahead: As large cap gets larger, can the tech rally continue?Reuters | Jun 3, 2017, 08.45 AM IST By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK (Reuters) - Technology shares have led U.S. stocks to record highs and are expected to continue to rise, but as market value becomes concentrated in the largest companies, some are beginning to look for the next rally leader. The technology sector of the S&P 500 has risen roughly 20 percent so far in 2017, led by Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft. The only other company with comparable gains in market value this year is Amazon, a market darling not in the tech sector despite being a big player in cloud services and data storage. "These are the dominant players in their specific spaces and the hottest areas in tech," said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta, highlighting their exposure to the cloud and artificial intelligence. "You will continue to see money flowing into those names. People want to be exposed to the hottest areas," he said. Active funds have continued to throw their money behind the leaders with a record overweight on the technology sector, according to BofA/Merrill Lynch data going back to 2008. But more than a third of the 2017 gains in the S&P 500 have come from these five companies, and the concentration of the advance has some investors jittery. "Given how significant the (large cap) leadership has been year to date, I kind of think you need to find another group to produce that leadership," said Jim Tierney, chief investment officer of concentrated U.S. growth at AllianceBernstein in New York. Echoing Dell, Cisco, Intel and yes, Microsoft itself, the leaders of the Y2K tech boom, these new "five horsemen" have added more than $612 billion in value to the stock market this year. Their 2017 gains alone could buy the 85 smallest companies of the S&P 500. Their combined value, near $3 trillion, is not far from the market value of all the other components of the Nasdaq 100. NOT THAT EXPENSIVE, BUT... This tech rally has come hand in hand with heightened expectations for profits. Investors are currently paying $18.50 for every $1 in earnings expected over the next 12 months in the sector, compared to the more than $40 they paid during the dot-com bubble and even the $20-plus seen during the most recent market peak in 2007. Tech sector earnings are expected to grow 11 percent in the second quarter after rising near 21 percent in the first, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data. However, with gains of more than 33 percent for Apple, Facebook and Amazon, near 25 percent for Alphabet and 15 percent in Microsoft, compared to a gain of 8.5 percent for the S&P 500, the room for more upside is declining. Despite expecting gains upward of 20 percent for the rest of the year on the so-called FANG stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet - and their ilk, analysts at Fundstrat recommended in a Friday note balancing portfolios by scooping up the year's underperformers: banks, energy and telecoms. They are not alone in searching for exposure outside technology. "We're most overweight in technology but I don't want to stay too long at the party," said Alan Gayle, director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta. "What I'm watching for is an opportunity to lighten up on tech exposure and put it into some of the more cyclical areas," he said. "Financials are going to be catching a tailwind." AllianceBernstein's Tierney bets beyond tech on healthcare, the second-largest sector weight on the S&P 500. "Healthcare has really lagged the last 18 months or so. They could certainly pick up the mantle."

In a highly anticipated statement from the White House Rose Garden, Trump said the United States would abandon the current deal -- but was open to negotiating a new one. "As of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country," Trump said. "We're getting out but we'll start to negotiate and we will see if we can make a deal that's fair. And if we can, that's great. And if we can't, that's fine." Although details and the timeframe are still unclear, Trump argued that the agreement was a bad deal for Americans and that he was keeping a campaign promise to put American workers first. "I cannot, in good conscience, support a deal that punishes the United States, which is what it does," Trump said. The White House has told allies the 2015 deal was signed by President Barack Obama out of "desperation." Trump faced last-minute pressure from business tycoons, foreign allies and from inside his own White House not to pull out of the 196-party accord. Ever the showman, the 70-year-old gave his decision a reality-TV-style tease, refusing to indicate his preference either way until his announcement. His decision could seriously hamper efforts to cut emissions and limit global temperature increases. The United States is the world's second largest emitter of greenhouse gases, after China. Opponents of withdrawal -- said to include Trump's own daughter Ivanka -- have warned that America's reputation and its leadership role on the world stage are also at stake, as is the environment. Nicaragua and Syria are the only countries not party to the Paris accord, the former seeing it as not ambitious enough and the latter being racked by a brutal civil war. - Diplomatic pressure - Trump's long wind-up prompted fierce lobbying, with his environmental protection chief Scott Pruitt and chief strategist Steve Bannon urging the president to leave. A dozen large companies including oil major BP, agrochemical giant DuPont, Google, Intel and Microsoft, have also urged Trump to remain part of the deal. Tesla and SpaceX boss Elon Musk said he would have "no choice" but to leave White House-backed business councils if Trump pulls out. On the diplomatic front, German Chancellor Angela Merkel led the "remain" camp, publicly describing the deal as "essential," and suggesting other countries would press ahead regardless. Trump raised alarm bells when he refused to sign up to a pledge on the deal at last week's G7 meeting in Italy. Merkel on Saturday labelled the result of the "six against one" discussion "very difficult, not to say very unsatisfactory." European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was less diplomatic, all but accusing the US president of being ill-informed. "I am a transatlanticist. But if the US president in the next hours and days says that he will get out of the Paris accord, then it's the responsibility of Europe to say: that's not acceptable." He noted that it would likely take three or four years to exit from the Paris deal, and revealed that world leaders had sought to explain that to Trump at the G7 summit. "As it appears, that attempt failed," said Juncker. - China pledge - Hours ahead of Trump's announcement, China's Premier Li Keqiang also pledged to stay the course on implementing the climate accord, and urged other countries to do likewise. "China will continue to implement promises made in the Paris Agreement, to move towards the 2030 goal step by step steadfastly," Li said in a Berlin joint press conference with Merkel. "But of course, we also hope to do this in cooperation with others." China has been investing billions in clean energy infrastructure, as its leaders battle to clear up the choking pollution enveloping its biggest cities, including Beijing. China and the US are responsible for some 40 percent of the world's emissions and experts warn is vital for both to remain in the Paris agreement if it is to succeed. The leader of Asia's other behemoth, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said this week failing to act on climate change would be "morally criminal". - Contradictory signals - Trump's announcement comes less than 18 months after the historic climate pact was adopted in the French capital, the fruit of a hard-fought agreement between Beijing and Washington under Obama's leadership. The Paris Agreement commits signatories to efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming, which is blamed for melting ice caps and glaciers, rising sea levels and more violent weather events. They vowed steps to keep the worldwide rise in temperatures "well below" two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) from pre-industrial times and to "pursue efforts" to hold the increase under 1.5 degrees Celsius. Since taking office on January 20, Trump, who has called climate change a "hoax", has sent contradictory signals on the Paris deal.

Digital Trends MSI Radeon RX 550 Aero ITX review AMD’s well-intentioned Radeon RX 550 doesn’t have it where it counts Share The Radeon RX 550’s price is attractive, but it doesn't make games look beautiful -- even at just 1080p resolution. The Radeon RX 550’s price is attractive, but it doesn't make games look beautiful -- even at just 1080p resolution. The Radeon RX 550’s price is attractive, but it doesn't make games look beautiful -- even at just 1080p resolution. Highs Compact size Strong warranty Lows Poor performance for the price Limited connectivity Can’t keep up at 1080p DT Editors' Rating 5.0 Scores Explained Home > Product Reviews > Video Card Reviews > MSI Radeon RX 550 Aero ITX review By Brad Bourque Posted on 06.02.17 Research Center: MSI Radeon RX 550 Aero ITX As professional gaming swells from a joke to a serious, international business, hardware companies have found ways to appeal to this new breed of gamer. One example is the eSports-focused video card, intended to play games like League of Legends or Overwatch at decent framerates without breaking the bank. Of course, what games qualify as eSports titles, and how much power they need, varies greatly, and these low-budget cards tend to only address part of the professional gaming market. At just $85, the MSI Aero ITX version of the Radeon RX 550 may fall dangerously close to this peril. Is AMD’s new entry-level graphics solution right in the sweet spot for budget gaming, or too slow for its own good? Under the (tiny) hood Before digging into performance, let’s take a look under the Radeon RX 550’s hood. The reference design draws just 50 Watts of power, with 8 Compute Units and 512 Stream Processors, with up to 4GB of GDDR5, depending on the board partner. AMD states a 1,100MHz base clock and 1,138MHz boost clock, but again, that will vary based on card and cooling options. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Our review unit is an MSI Aero ITX version, with a simple, short cooler and no external power demands. There are no reference models this time around, and most other AIB partner models will have one fan and similar power requirements. MSI bumped the maximum boost clock up to 1,203MHz — not too shabby, considering this particular model end of the Radeon RX 550’s price spectrum. It only has 2GB of GDDR5, which we think is the right choice for a video card in this price bracket. However, a 4GB model is available for $100, too. Like a lot of cards its size, this version of the Radeon RX 550 only has a single HDMI port, a single DisplayPort, and a lone DVI-D. Those ports give users options, but only for one screen. Multi-monitor setups can be a bit tricky without two of the same port. Performance With the boring stuff out of the way, let’s dig right into our performance testing. We benchmarked the Radeon RX 550 on our high-end test rig with an Intel Core i7-6950X, 16GB of RAM, and an Intel 700 Series SSD. It’s certainly overkill for the card, but we have a wealth of test data for it, and it should allow every graphics solution to reach its full potential, unencumbered by potential bottlenecks. Even in our synthetic testing, things don’t look good for the Radeon RX 550. It’s almost 50 percent slower than the GTX 1050 we last reviewed, which was also an MSI offering. The GTX 1050 sports a slightly higher 75W TDP, but it’s able to draw enough power from the board, so the difference isn’t likely to have an effect on overall system capabilities. Ouch. The Radeon RX 550 continues to fall well behind the GTX 1050, and that’s a serious problem. While the GTX 1050 is a bit more expensive, the cards are already in a precarious position market-wise, and they don’t come close to producing playable framerates at 1080p in modern games. Yes, it’s true the RX 550 will run Counter-Strike or League of Legends without issue, but that’s true of any video card. Most gamers are not going to want to stick to just one game. And some modern competitive titles, like Overwatch, can be demanding. MSI Radeon RX 550 Aero ITX Compared To Asus Strix Radeon RX 570 OC 4G MSI GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Armor 11G OC MSI GeForce GTX 1050 2G OC AMD Radeon RX 480 AMD Radeon R9 380X NVIDIA GeForce GTX 950 Nvidia GeForce GTX Titan X Nvidia GeForce GTX 980 AMD Radeon R9 295X2 NVIDIA DualTV MCE ATI All-In-Wonder X1900 MSI RX800 XT MSI GeForce FX5700-VT2DR256 ATI Radeon 9800 XT 256MB ATI All-In-Wonder Radeon 9800 Pro Value is also an issue. As you can see, the RX 550 is demolished even by the GTX 1050. A more serious card like the RX 570 will prove several times quicker in many games. Yes, it’s more expensive, but you’re getting more FPS per dollar. Warranty information MSI covers all of its graphics solutions for a full three years from manufacturer defects and issues. That’s a premium warranty for a GPU at any price, with most OEMs just offering a one year warranty. Our Take The least expensive Radeon in the RX 500 series may be affordable, but you get what you pay for. Our MSI Aero ITX review unit was unable to keep up a 60 FPS average at 1080p in any of our modern games, even with the settings turned down to medium. It’s a card meant for casual MOBA players, or the odd Rocket League match on the couch, and that’s about it. Is there a better alternative? Yes. With settings at modest levels, the GTX 1050 comes a lot closer to our ideal scores in more games, and iterations are frequently available under $100. MSI’s GTX 1050, with a similar cooler, was on sale for $85, the same as the Radeon RX 550, at time of this writing. Even when it’s not on sale, the added performance is well worth another $20. How long will it last? While the movement to higher resolution panels than 1080p has been more of a crawl than we expected, no card at this price is going to set you up for gaming, even at the current standard. You’re trading a lot of performance to save some dollars and keep from upgrading your power supply, and it really shows when it comes to longevity. Should you buy it? No. The Radeon RX 550 tries to strike at a niche market, and doesn’t manage to do it better than cards at exactly the same price. Users shouldn’t head into a sub-$100 GPU hoping to play brand new titles at smooth frame rates, and that’s doubly true here. If that’s all you have to spend, the GTX 1050 is just a better choice.
Digital Trends Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 review Xiaomi’s affordable Mi Pad 3 is a tablet everyone can enjoy Share A no frills tablet that excels at the essentials, but is overshadowed by Apple’s cheap new iPad. A no frills tablet that excels at the essentials, but is overshadowed by Apple’s cheap new iPad. A no frills tablet that excels at the essentials, but is overshadowed by Apple’s cheap new iPad. Highs Hits the tablet size sweet spot at 7.9-inches High-resolution screen Attractive design Lows Frustrating software and operation quirks Mediocre camera DT Editors' Rating 6.0 Scores Explained Home > Product Reviews > Tablet Reviews > Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 review By Andy Boxall Posted on 06.02.17 Research Center: Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 Do tablets still have a place in the world? They’re not the trend they once were, and even Apple — the one company making tablets that sell in any quantity — has dropped the price on its 2017 entry-level iPad model to encourage people to buy or upgrade. At $330, the iPad is an all-around affordable option, but you’ll have to search for an Android tablet if you want something cheaper. Xiaomi has released a new version of its Mi Pad, called the Mi Pad 3. It’s an iPad Mini-sized device with Xiaomi’s MIUI user interface over the top of Google’s operating system. It’s cheaper than the iPad Mini 4 and the new iPad, at around $270; but you’ll have to import one if you want it in the U.S. Is it worth the import? No. While there’s nothing horribly wrong with the Mi Pad 3, its small quirks and issues do not justify the $270 price tag, especially when the new iPad is just $60 more. Let’s take a closer look. This looks familiar What does the Mi Pad 3 look like? Well, picture an iPad Mini 4 without the Apple branding, and you’re pretty much there. The two are shockingly similar. The 6.9mm thick aluminum body has a flat back with a camera lens in the top right, the corners are smooth and rounded, and the overall dimensions are almost identical. The screen is the same size at 7.9-inches, as is the 2048 x 1536 pixel resolution. Andy Boxall Andy Boxall Andy Boxall Andy Boxall There are some differences. The dual speakers are mounted on the back of the tablet, facing away from you when looking at the screen, and the sleep/wake button is on the side of the body, not the top. It doesn’t have a fingerprint sensor, or any physical home button — instead the Mi Pad 3 uses capacitive navigational icons below the screen. We miss the tactility of a physical home button, largely because  the Android keys aren’t especially responsive, and do require very precise taps to operate. It’s a comfortable device to hold, and those with average or larger hands will have no problem holding it in one hand, thanks to its low weight. The texture on the back is pleasant to touch, but although the Mi Pad 3 is beautifully made, there is a slight flex in the center of the aluminium back panel. It’s not enough to cause concern, but enough to notice when it’s pressed. There’s little to fault the way the Mi Pad 3 looks, mainly because it’s very close to the established and attractive style of the iPad Mini. It’s not something that overly concerns us — styling it after something hideous would do that — and we find the smaller 7.9-inch tablet size to be convenient, while still being suitably larger than our phone to make using it worthwhile. Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 Compared To Apple iPad 9.7 Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 Chuwi Hi12 Windows 10 2-in-1 Dell Venue 8 7000 Nvidia Shield Tablet Apple iPad Air 2 LG G Pad 7.0 Dell Venue 8 Pro Apple iPad Mini 2 Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 (8-inch) Smart Devices SmartQ U7 Barnes & Noble Nook HD+ Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 Plus Amazon Kindle Fire Acer Iconia Tab A100 Crisp screen that needs better color calibration Xiaomi’s Mi Pad 3 has a 7.9-inch, 2048 x 1536 pixel, IPS LCD screen on the front, which is good enough for a 326 pixel-per-inch density, and a wide 178-degree viewing angle. It’s very bright, and we rarely needed to increase the brightness over 50 percent, which is good for battery life. There’s a reading mode for nighttime use, which lowers the amount of sleep-damaging blue light emitted by the screen. It’s easily activated from the Android notification shade, and adds a yellowish look to the display, but there’s a slider to adjust the degree of intrusion. Dig through the menu and you’ll find an unusual black and white mode, which not only extends the battery life, but does a decent job of reducing eye strain when reading. The Mi Pad 3’s size really does make it a great video-consuming machine. The screen’s color and contrast can be tweaked under a separate menu, and we found it was worth taking the time to calibrate. Out of the box, in standard configuration, the whites didn’t appear crisp enough; but things improved when the display was switched to “cool.” Everyone will see it differently, which is why we welcome the chance to tailor the display’s look to our own taste. Playing HD video from Netflix and Crunchyroll produced great images filled with color, and while we enjoyed the viewing experience, the 4:3 aspect ratio adds black bars to the top and bottom of most videos.  Still, the Mi Pad 3’s size really does make it a great video-consuming machine. It’s not too big that it’s annoying to hold, but is still much more watchable than a 5.5-inch screen on a phone. Text looks excellent — crisp and well-defined — especially when browsing the web and reading ebooks. The screen looks great, but we have one annoyance. The tablet doesn’t compensate for your palm resting on one side while scrolling with another finger. At first, it’s like the touchscreen isn’t working at all, then you realize it’s because the hand you’re holding the tablet with is also touching the edge of the screen. Remove it, and everything’s fine. Other times, it can activate certain features. It depends on how you’re holding the Mi Pad 3 — so doesn’t happen all the time — but when it does it’s highly irritating. Fluid software, few tablet-friendly apps Our Mi Pad 3 came with Android 7.0 Nougat installed, complete with an Android security patch from February, and Xiaomi’s global MIUI version 8.2, so everything is in English. Google Play and associated apps came pre-installed on our imported Mi Pad 3, along with a variety of standard apps including a calendar, a weather app, a calculator, an FM radio, and a browser. Surprisingly, the tablet offers a slightly different user experience to a Xiaomi phone. Because it’s very smooth, and MIUI is supremely uncluttered, the tablet has a very Apple-like feel to it. The menus aren’t messy and it’s not filled with superfluous apps, making fast, daily use a pleasure. The most obvious additional feature Xiaomi has added is a widget page, viewable by swiping right on the main home screen. The widgets can be altered to your preference, making it a handy and attractively presented shortcut page. Using Netflix, YouTube, popular games, Google apps, and several big-name social network apps downloaded from the Google Play store provide a tablet-friendly experience, but stray too far from the best known apps, and things aren’t so good. You don’t even have to look that hard either, the Instagram app doesn’t feel like it has been adapted for use on a tablet very well, for example. The more obscure, or dated, your favourite app is, the less likely it’ll look that fantastic on the Mi Pad 3. This isn’t a problem with the device, but a problem with Android on tablets as a whole. There are other quirks unique to the Mi Pad 3. Even though it runs Android 7.0 Nougat, there’s no split window multi-tasking available with MIUI 8. Adequate performance Xiaomi previously used an Intel processor for its Mi Pad tablet, but this time it has chosen a MediaTek chip — the MT8176 — to power its slate, along with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage space. It’s not a common processor, having been used in few mainstream tablets sold in the U.S. and Europe. Put through some benchmarking workouts, the scores are uninspiring. In our general use, the MediaTek chip performed adequately, happily powering games such as Danmaku Unlimited in HD mode, and casual titles like Crossy Road. Graphically-intensive and faster-paced games like Reckless Racing put some strain on the tablet, and slow downs did occur. Put it through some benchmarking workouts, and the scores are uninspiring. AnTuTu returned a score of 74,646, and 3DMark’s Sling Shot Extreme gave it just 749. The Intel Atom-powered Lenovo Yoga Book managed 1,192, for comparison. Unfortunately, there’s no MicroSD memory expansion, and 32GB of internal memory isn’t very much. Be prepared to slim down movie and music collections stored on the device itself, or stick with streaming services. There is a 3.5mm headphone socket though, and the 6,600mAh battery is charged through a USB Type-C port. We’ve been using the Mi Pad 3 for almost two weeks, and it has needed charging twice, not including the initial charge. Leaving it on standby overnight saw around 7 or 8-percent of the battery disappear. Mediocre camera The rear camera on the Mi Pad 3 is packed with 13 megapixels, autofocus, and an f/2.2 aperture. It’s highly unlikely the Mi Pad 3 will ever be someone’s primary camera, and it’s probably a good thing. The pictures it takes are only acceptable, and nothing more. Colors do pop, and plenty of detail is revealed zooming in on close-up images; but it doesn’t have an HDR mode, and overcast skies were washed out. Around the front, there’s a 5-megapixel camera with the same aperture, and it’s good for video calls and selfies. Warranty, availability, and price The Xiaomi Mi Pad 3 isn’t sold in the U.S. or Europe, and must be imported through a specialist. Our review Mi Pad 3 was supplied by Geekbuying, a well-known importer of Chinese electronics. At the time of writing it costs $270 with free shipping. The tablet was sent to us with a courier, did attract a small customs charge in the U.K., and arrived securely packaged. Geekbuying offers a one-year warranty on the products it sells, including tablets, but doesn’t cover them if there has been water damage, mistreatment, or abuse. It’ll repair returned hardware for free within the warranty period, and has a warehouse in California that can be used instead of sending the device back to China. To take advantage of this, a $3 charge has to be paid at checkout during the original purchase. There’s also an English-speaking customer service helpline available. Our Take Unlike the company’s smartphones and their lack of wide U.S. network support, the Mi Pad 3 is a premium Xiaomi product everyone can enjoy, and its screen is great for video and reading. Is there a better alternative? The Mi Pad 3’s natural competitor is the Apple iPad Mini 4, which is at least $130 more; however, potential tablet buyers should really be looking at the new 2017 9.7-inch iPad, which starts at $330. That’s close enough to the Mi Pad 3’s price to make it attainable, and the iPad has a far more varied catalog of fully tablet-compatible apps that makes it a wiser choice if you’re planning to use the device a lot. We’d strongly recommend the iPad. If you’d prefer not to buy an Apple product, our favourite Android tablet at the moment is the Galaxy Tab S3, but this is more than twice the price of the Mi Pad 3. Outside of this, the world’s awash with mediocre to average Android tablets, including the $300 Samsung Galaxy Tab A and the Asus ZenPad Z10, or even the $135 Amazon Fire 8. We wouldn’t recommend any of them in particular, and feel the Mi Pad 3 is a more premium device that’s at least on a par with the Galaxy Tab A, provided you’re happy to import one. How long will it last? The Mi Pad 3 isn’t water resistant, but the body is well-built and the metal back won’t shatter if it gets accidentally knocked. That said, if you’re planning on handing the Mi pad 3 over to your kids, you may want to find a sturdy child-proof case. Xiaomi isn’t the fastest with supplying Android version updates, as they usually require its UI to be reworked first, which takes time. This does change if you’re happy to use Xiaomi beta releases though, but we doubt everyone will be happy to do so. Tablets aren’t the same as phones, and rarely need replacing. A three-year old tablet is far more capable than a three-year old smartphone. Many tablet owners just want to play video, browse the web, and check social media accounts. For this, the Mi Pad 3 will last for some time. Should you buy it? No. There’s nothing horribly wrong with the pretty, fast, and capable Mi Pad 3, but with Apple offering the new iPad for only $330, there’s not much of a reason to go for the Mi Pad 3. If Apple is a dirty word in your household, then it’s a different story, and the Mi Pad 3 stacks up nicely against the many similar options out there.

ADVERTISEMENT On Our Radar Refresh Close On Our Radar Load More Wall Street week ahead: As large cap gets larger, can the tech rally continue? By Rodrigo Campos Published June 02, 2017 Markets Reuters Facebook Twitter Print Traders Gregory Rowe, left, and William Lawrence work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Tuesday, May 23, 2017. Stocks are opening slightly higher on Wall Street as technology companies post more gains. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) (AP) Technology shares have led U.S. stocks to record highs and are expected to continue to rise, but as market value becomes concentrated in the largest companies, some are beginning to look for the next rally leader. Continue Reading Below The technology sector of the S&P 500 has risen roughly 20 percent so far in 2017, led by Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft. The only other company with comparable gains in market value this year is Amazon, a market darling not in the tech sector despite being a big player in cloud services and data storage. "These are the dominant players in their specific spaces and the hottest areas in tech," said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta, highlighting their exposure to the cloud and artificial intelligence. "You will continue to see money flowing into those names. People want to be exposed to the hottest areas," he said. Active funds have continued to throw their money behind the leaders with a record overweight on the technology sector, according to BofA/Merrill Lynch data going back to 2008. But more than a third of the 2017 gains in the S&P 500 have come from these five companies, and the concentration of the advance has some investors jittery. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT "Given how significant the (large cap) leadership has been year to date, I kind of think you need to find another group to produce that leadership," said Jim Tierney, chief investment officer of concentrated U.S. growth at AllianceBernstein in New York. Echoing Dell, Cisco, Intel and yes, Microsoft itself, the leaders of the Y2K tech boom, these new "five horsemen" have added more than $612 billion in value to the stock market this year. Their 2017 gains alone could buy the 85 smallest companies of the S&P 500. Their combined value, near $3 trillion, is not far from the market value of all the other components of the Nasdaq 100. NOT THAT EXPENSIVE, BUT... This tech rally has come hand in hand with heightened expectations for profits. Investors are currently paying $18.50 for every $1 in earnings expected over the next 12 months in the sector, compared to the more than $40 they paid during the dot-com bubble and even the $20-plus seen during the most recent market peak in 2007. Tech sector earnings are expected to grow 11 percent in the second quarter after rising near 21 percent in the first, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data. However, with gains of more than 33 percent for Apple, Facebook and Amazon, near 25 percent for Alphabet and 15 percent in Microsoft, compared to a gain of 8.5 percent for the S&P 500, the room for more upside is declining. Despite expecting gains upward of 20 percent for the rest of the year on the so-called FANG stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet - and their ilk, analysts at Fundstrat recommended in a Friday note balancing portfolios by scooping up the year's underperformers: banks, energy and telecoms. They are not alone in searching for exposure outside technology. "We're most overweight in technology but I don't want to stay too long at the party," said Alan Gayle, director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta. "What I'm watching for is an opportunity to lighten up on tech exposure and put it into some of the more cyclical areas," he said. "Financials are going to be catching a tailwind." AllianceBernstein's Tierney bets beyond tech on healthcare , the second-largest sector weight on the S&P 500. "Healthcare has really lagged the last 18 months or so. They could certainly pick up the mantle."

By Michelle JamriskoBloomberg Share Comment Read Article President Trump argued that leaving the Paris climate accord would save jobs at home, yet possible trade wars sparked by his decision could nullify any additional benefit to American workers. Complying with the deal “could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025,” he said Thursday at the White House, citing a litany of other dire economic forecasts aimed at supporting his decision. “Believe me, this is not what we need – including automobile jobs and the further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities rely.” But job and growth estimates at the heart of the climate debate have varied so widely, some analysts viewed them as unreliable. Supporting the pro-pullout side was one estimate saying $3 trillion in gross domestic product and 6.5 million in jobs will be lost over the next quarter century – numbers Trump also mentioned in the Rose Garden ceremony without noting the extended timeline. Another tally puts the GDP hit at more than $8 trillion through 2100 – but that’s the damage estimated if the U.S. exits the deal. “Those numbers are exercises in imagination,” Kevin Book, managing director of Washington-based research firm ClearView Energy Partners, said of the jobs estimates. “If the United States pulls out of Paris, it sets in motion potentially an acceleration of the original Paris prognosis we had, which is that this probably ends with trade-based measures,” particularly because the agreement didn’t include enforcement provisions, Book said before the president’s announcement. More worrisome than the long-term guesses could be the expected tariffs on U.S. carbon emitters slapped on by other countries. Twenty-five companies, including Intel, Microsoft and PG&E, have signed on to a letter running as a full-page advertisement in The New York Times and Wall Street Journal on Thursday arguing in favor of the climate pact, and warning of potential “retaliatory measures” by other nations. “By expanding markets for innovative clean technologies, the agreement generates jobs and economic growth,” the letter says. “U.S. companies are well positioned to lead in these markets. Withdrawing from the agreement will limit our access to them and could expose us to retaliatory measures.” The move leaves the U.S. as the third country, with Syria and Nicaragua, outside the massive international pact. While some see the fear of retaliation as a stronger, if less quantifiable, economic case around the Paris agreement than hard estimates, numbers on GDP and jobs have gotten much of the attention. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce points to a study by NERA Economic Consulting, which cites a $3 trillion hit to America’s GDP and the loss of 6.5 million industrial jobs by 2040 if the U.S. were to make good on its promises under the Paris accord. The World Resources Institute contends that those figures are misleading because the group based projections on an unnecessarily expensive route to achieving the 2025 targets agreed to under the Paris deal. While the industry is split on their stance toward the Paris agreement, some coal executives like Bob Murray, chief executive officer of Murray Energy, have supported Trump’s talking points on the U.S. economic implications of the Paris agreement. U.S. growth would take a $2.5 trillion hit over 10 years with “factories and plants closing all over our country,” Trump said at an April rally in Pennsylvania. The reality, however, is that the boom in energy jobs has come in gas, wind and solar industries. The electric power industry’s transition away from coal has created hundreds of thousands of jobs in renewables, making solar companies the largest employer, with twice as many workers as coal, according to the U.S. Energy Department. Those urging the Trump administration to keep the U.S. promise on the Paris agreement have made opposite charges around the potential jobs impact. Environmental Entrepreneurs, an environmental advocacy group, said the withdrawal would put 3 million clean-energy jobs at risk. American Bridge 21st Century, a progressive political action committee, called the potential withdrawal “catastrophic” in a statement earlier this week, saying it threatens 11 million jobs being supported by made-in-America exports. Marshall Burke, a resource economist at Stanford University who’s been modeling the effects of climate change on world and national GDPs over the course of the century, is taking an even longer view. His estimate is that pulling out of the Paris agreement would cost the U.S. economy $8.2 trillion through 2100. Share Read or Post Comments Send questions/comments to the editors.

Additionally, 83 mayors have signed the Climate Mayors Agreement, similarly with the goal of independently reducing carbon emissions. AP Yesterday, President Trump announced the US is joining Syria and Nicaragua in abdicating from the landmark agreement, ratified by former President Obama in 2016 and signed by 195 nations. Trump peddled dozens of wildly disproved falsehoods in justifying exiting the agreement, which prompted swift backlash from the international community; diplomats; Trump's own Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson; and major US companies such as Apple, Microsoft and Intel. US state and local leaders have also made it clear they're fighting the decision and will continue to fight climate change, with or without federal support. The Climate Mayors Agreement is a commitment between now 80+ cities including Austin, Palo Alto and San Francisco to ignore Trump's March executive order that weakened the Clean Power Plan, which would have compelled states to set power plant emissions reductions goals. They want to keep those goals intact. Several of these same cities have jointly signed onto former Mayor Bloomberg's new plan, which is a coalition of cities, states and companies who plan on coordinating with the UN directly to come up with carbon emissions targets. For now, it's unclear how that coordination will actually work. The Paris Agreement was designed to accommodate entire nations, not individual cities. The point was for countries to have individual targets, then draw up their own policy measures in order to meet them. This new effort would seemingly involve a wide range of localities within a country all coordinating with an international body, which is brand new diplomatic territory. To remain aligned with the Paris Agreement, cities will be focusing on expanding renewable energy sources for utilities, launching infrastructure projects that are more energy efficient, and offering subsidies for customers buying electric cars and solar panels. The US is roughly halfway to its initial Paris Agreement goal of reducing carbon emissions by about 25 per cent by 2025, and was set to meet its goal before Trump's rapid-fire deregulations. While researchers projected the US will fail its climate goal, former Mayor Bloomberg said in a letter to the UN that he believes his coalition will help the US achieve its reduction target. Moreover, the new coalition signifies that while America's leadership may have abdicated its responsibility to fight climate change, its people are not.

Here's what they had to say. The Climate Deniers Have Won Sidney Fussell 02 Jun 2017 6:00 AM At President Trumps' behest, the US is joining Syria and Nicaragua in abdicating from the Paris Agreement, a coalition of 147 nations to combat climate change by reducing carbon emissions. While Trump faced heavy international pressure to remain within the agreement, from the Pope during his trip to the Vatican, China's President Xi and European leaders during the G7 summit, the GOP overwhelmingly opposed Paris from the get-go. EPA head Scott Pruitt has long argued that the United States' emissions reduction goal under Paris weakened the US economy. Want Gizmodo's email newsletter?

By Michelle JamriskoBloomberg Share Comment Read Article President Trump argued that leaving the Paris climate accord would save jobs at home, yet possible trade wars sparked by his decision could nullify any additional benefit to American workers. Complying with the deal “could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025,” he said Thursday at the White House, citing a litany of other dire economic forecasts aimed at supporting his decision. “Believe me, this is not what we need – including automobile jobs and the further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities rely.” But job and growth estimates at the heart of the climate debate have varied so widely, some analysts viewed them as unreliable. Supporting the pro-pullout side was one estimate saying $3 trillion in gross domestic product and 6.5 million in jobs will be lost over the next quarter century – numbers Trump also mentioned in the Rose Garden ceremony without noting the extended timeline. Another tally puts the GDP hit at more than $8 trillion through 2100 – but that’s the damage estimated if the U.S. exits the deal. “Those numbers are exercises in imagination,” Kevin Book, managing director of Washington-based research firm ClearView Energy Partners, said of the jobs estimates. “If the United States pulls out of Paris, it sets in motion potentially an acceleration of the original Paris prognosis we had, which is that this probably ends with trade-based measures,” particularly because the agreement didn’t include enforcement provisions, Book said before the president’s announcement. More worrisome than the long-term guesses could be the expected tariffs on U.S. carbon emitters slapped on by other countries. Twenty-five companies, including Intel, Microsoft and PG&E, have signed on to a letter running as a full-page advertisement in The New York Times and Wall Street Journal on Thursday arguing in favor of the climate pact, and warning of potential “retaliatory measures” by other nations. “By expanding markets for innovative clean technologies, the agreement generates jobs and economic growth,” the letter says. “U.S. companies are well positioned to lead in these markets. Withdrawing from the agreement will limit our access to them and could expose us to retaliatory measures.” The move leaves the U.S. as the third country, with Syria and Nicaragua, outside the massive international pact. While some see the fear of retaliation as a stronger, if less quantifiable, economic case around the Paris agreement than hard estimates, numbers on GDP and jobs have gotten much of the attention. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce points to a study by NERA Economic Consulting, which cites a $3 trillion hit to America’s GDP and the loss of 6.5 million industrial jobs by 2040 if the U.S. were to make good on its promises under the Paris accord. The World Resources Institute contends that those figures are misleading because the group based projections on an unnecessarily expensive route to achieving the 2025 targets agreed to under the Paris deal. While the industry is split on their stance toward the Paris agreement, some coal executives like Bob Murray, chief executive officer of Murray Energy, have supported Trump’s talking points on the U.S. economic implications of the Paris agreement. U.S. growth would take a $2.5 trillion hit over 10 years with “factories and plants closing all over our country,” Trump said at an April rally in Pennsylvania. The reality, however, is that the boom in energy jobs has come in gas, wind and solar industries. The electric power industry’s transition away from coal has created hundreds of thousands of jobs in renewables, making solar companies the largest employer, with twice as many workers as coal, according to the U.S. Energy Department. Those urging the Trump administration to keep the U.S. promise on the Paris agreement have made opposite charges around the potential jobs impact. Environmental Entrepreneurs, an environmental advocacy group, said the withdrawal would put 3 million clean-energy jobs at risk. American Bridge 21st Century, a progressive political action committee, called the potential withdrawal “catastrophic” in a statement earlier this week, saying it threatens 11 million jobs being supported by made-in-America exports. Marshall Burke, a resource economist at Stanford University who’s been modeling the effects of climate change on world and national GDPs over the course of the century, is taking an even longer view. His estimate is that pulling out of the Paris agreement would cost the U.S. economy $8.2 trillion through 2100. Share Read or Post Comments Send questions/comments to the editors.

A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., June 2, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid By Rodrigo Campos | NEW YORK NEW YORK Technology shares have led U.S. stocks to record highs and are expected to continue to rise, but as market value becomes concentrated in the largest companies, some are beginning to look for the next rally leader. The technology sector of the S&P 500 .SPLRCT has risen roughly 20 percent so far in 2017, led by Apple (AAPL.O), Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Facebook (FB.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O). The only other company with comparable gains in market value this year is Amazon (AMZN.O), a market darling not in the tech sector despite being a big player in cloud services and data storage. "These are the dominant players in their specific spaces and the hottest areas in tech," said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta, highlighting their exposure to the cloud and artificial intelligence. "You will continue to see money flowing into those names. People want to be exposed to the hottest areas," he said. (To view a graphic on 'The Five Horsemen: growing influence of largest technology companies' click reut.rs/2sntpYb) Active funds have continued to throw their money behind the leaders with a record overweight on the technology sector, according to BofA/Merrill Lynch data going back to 2008. But more than a third of the 2017 gains in the S&P 500 have come from these five companies, and the concentration of the advance has some investors jittery. "Given how significant the (large cap) leadership has been year to date, I kind of think you need to find another group to produce that leadership," said Jim Tierney, chief investment officer of concentrated U.S. growth at AllianceBernstein in New York. Echoing Dell[DI.UL], Cisco (CSCO.O), Intel (INTC.O) and yes, Microsoft itself, the leaders of the Y2K tech boom, these new "five horsemen" have added more than $612 billion in value to the stock market this year. Their 2017 gains alone could buy the 85 smallest companies of the S&P 500. Their combined value, near $3 trillion, is not far from the market value of all the other components of the Nasdaq 100. NOT THAT EXPENSIVE, BUT... This tech rally has come hand in hand with heightened expectations for profits. Investors are currently paying $18.50 for every $1 in earnings expected over the next 12 months in the sector, compared to the more than $40 they paid during the dot-com bubble and even the $20-plus seen during the most recent market peak in 2007. Tech sector earnings are expected to grow 11 percent in the second quarter after rising near 21 percent in the first, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data. However, with gains of more than 33 percent for Apple, Facebook and Amazon, near 25 percent for Alphabet and 15 percent in Microsoft, compared to a gain of 8.5 percent for the S&P 500, the room for more upside is declining. Despite expecting gains upward of 20 percent for the rest of the year on the so-called FANG stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet - and their ilk, analysts at Fundstrat recommended in a Friday note balancing portfolios by scooping up the year's underperformers: banks, energy and telecoms. They are not alone in searching for exposure outside technology. "We're most overweight in technology but I don't want to stay too long at the party," said Alan Gayle, director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta. "What I'm watching for is an opportunity to lighten up on tech exposure and put it into some of the more cyclical areas," he said. "Financials are going to be catching a tailwind." AllianceBernstein's Tierney bets beyond tech on healthcare .SPXHC, the second-largest sector weight on the S&P 500. "Healthcare has really lagged the last 18 months or so. They could certainly pick up the mantle."

Subscribe to feed Share on Facebook Share on Twitter ShareEmail  Print Since well before former President Barack Obama signed onto it as an executive agreement (because he knew the Senate wouldn’t ratify it), a number of large American corporations have supported the Paris climate accord. As the time neared when President Donald Trump would announce whether he would keep his campaign promise to withdraw from it, some signed an open letter advising him not to. Many corporations are household names – Adobe, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Facebook, Gap, Google, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Intel, Johnson Controls, Levi Strauss, Microsoft, PG&E (Pacific Gas & Electric) and Unilever among them. Why would they do that? Let’s take their stated reasons one by one. First, “Strengthening Competitiveness: By requiring action by developed and developing countries alike, the agreement ensures a more balanced global effort, reducing the risk of competitive imbalances for U.S. companies.” The trouble is, Paris, with no enforcement mechanism, doesn’t “require” action by any countries, and the “Intended Nationally Determined Contributions” (INDC) by most developing countries committed themselves to no, or next to no, emission reductions. In contrast, the Obama-submitted U.S. INDC committed the U.S. to major reductions by 2025 – long before giant emitters like China and India would even begin any change in their projected emissions growth. (And India demanded over $2 trillion in subsidies or it would do nothing.) Second, “Creating Jobs, Markets and Growth: By expanding markets for innovative clean technologies, the agreement generates jobs and economic growth. U.S. companies are well positioned to lead in these markets. Withdrawing from the agreement will limit our access to them and could expose us to retaliatory measures.” But if the “innovative clean technologies” were economically competitive, they wouldn’t need the Paris agreement. This is nothing but crony corporatism. Of course anyone can “generate jobs” if governments subsidize them, mandate their products and protect them from competition. But that practice fails the economic test of “That Which is Seen, and That Which is Not Seen.” The money to create those jobs is no longer available to create jobs in other industries. That recipients need government to invest in them indicates that investors risking their own money don’t consider them a good risk. The result? Misallocated resources and less economic growth than without the program. Third, “Reducing Business Risks: By strengthening global action over time, the agreement will reduce future climate impacts, including damage to business facilities and operations, declining agricultural productivity and water supplies, and disruption of global supply chains.” Yet full compliance with Paris would reduce global temperature at the end of the century by at most 0.17 degree C, far too little to reduce any of the harms mentioned. Meanwhile, the loss of $70 to $140 trillion – the cost of implementation – to the global economy over the period would certainly harm businesses and consumers and reduce the economic growth claimed in their second excuse. So if none of the state reasons explains why these and many other businesses opposed withdrawing from Paris, what does? A variety of reasons, varying from business to business. Corporations that stand to benefit from mandates and subsidies to renewable energy – wind, solar, geothermal, and biofuels (and best of all, hydro, but greens oppose new dams) – would naturally object. Exiting Paris puts those mandates and subsidies at risk. For example, Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, resigned from the president’s council of business advisers after Trump’s announcement. Duh. He stands to lose big. Large corporations that see Paris as protection against smaller competition that can’t afford the technologies needed to reduce CO2 emissions (e.g., ExxonMobil and Conoco Phillips) would object. It’s standard practice for big firms that can stand the cost of regulations to champion regulations that will strangle small competitors. As Robert Kuykendall of 2ndvote.com points out, some companies see nothing to lose by siding with the environmental left on the issue. It costs them nothing to sign a letter supporting the agreement, and no matter how meaningless the gesture, it signals solidarity with the left and wins a few points. Pure PR, this is called “Greenwashing.” Executives of many of the country’s largest corporations identify more now with the “global elite” – the Davos crowd – than with their own stockholders, employees and customers. They see exiting Paris as jeopardizing their cache in those crowds. Other corporate executives, especially among major international banks and investment firms, are more dedicated to governmental globalism than to American sovereignty. That, as former ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton said on Fox Business News the day Trump announced the withdrawal, is Paris’s greatest danger. “Because of the failure of the predecessor agreements, Kyoto and Copenhagen,” Bolton said, “What [organizers] wanted was an agreement on anything, to create the foundation for what they’re really interested in, which is more international control over national decision making. This is really a global governance issue, which the Europeans just love, which Barack Obama just loved, which Donald Trump has now rejected. … To me the overarching, ultimately most important, more than constitutional question was, ‘Do we govern ourselves here, or are we going to cede governance authority to international organizations?'” Some business leaders also think – or at least say they think – that by exiting Paris America loses a place at the negotiating table, or loses its leadership in the world, or jeopardizes its mutual defense relationships, etc., all of which were touted as reasons not to reject the Kyoto Protocol but failed to materialize when we did. As Bolton put it, “We’ve heard these arguments before. In the Bush administration, my first job was to get us out of the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty. ‘Oh my God!’ the Europeans said. ‘Oh my God!’ Joe Biden, John Kerry, Barack Obama, Chris Dodd said, ‘It’s the end of international strategic stability.’ We got out. Nothing happened. We got out of the statute creating the International Criminal Court. Nothing happened. And nothing will happen here, either. …” Finally, of course, there are the sincere but uninformed who believe that CO2 emissions are driving catastrophically dangerous warming and that implementing Paris would significantly reduce that at a reasonable cost. They simply have no idea that the vaunted “97 percent scientific consensus” extends only to the agreement that the world has warmed since the Industrial Revolution (the end of the Little Ice Age) and that human activity has probably contributed “significantly” (which for scientists can mean as little as a few percent). It doesn’t extend to the notion that human activity is the majority cause, or that the warming is historically unprecedented or dangerous, or that it’s so dangerous as to warrant spending trillions trying to mitigate, money that could be spent instead on providing electricity, pure drinking water, infectious disease control, sewage sanitation, industrialization and lots of other things that lift people out of poverty, disease and premature death and enable them to adapt to any future climate – warmer or cooler. They don’t know that human contribution to global warming is actually real but tiny, (probably so small as to be undetectable). And they don’t know that full implementation of the Paris agreement would, by its own supporters’ estimates, reduce global temperature in 2100 by at most 0.17 degree C but would cost roughly $41.2 to $82.4 trillion per tenth of a degree of cooling. That makes it what the author of “The Art of the Deal” rightly recognized as “a bad deal” – not just for America, but for the world. Keep these things in mind when climate activists, including some big business leaders, come back demanding that the U.S. re-enter Paris or negotiate some other deal to fight global warming.

"If he recused himself on subjects, Russia, then he shouldn't have access to documents relating to subject, Russia, and he shouldn't be issuing separate subpoenas attaching them to a bipartisan subpoenas that were issued this week," Pelosi said Friday. Play Video CBSN Trump faces controversy over Russia investigation and climate deal Former FBI Director James Comey will testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee a week from today. Meanwhile, President Trump is set to ann... The House Intel Committee issued four subpoenas related to its Russia investigation this week, and three others to the FBI, CIA and NSA that were related to "unmasking," the exposure of Trump campaign officials mentioned in classified intelligence reports, based on intercepts of conversations.  Pelosi also told reporters, "[M]y dismay, my objection has been conveyed to the Speaker on more than one occasion."  A GOP staffer on the committee countered that the unmasking subpoenas aren't related to the Russia probe. Nunes recused himself when several groups filed complaints against him with the Office of Congressional Ethics and the House Ethics Committee launched an investigation, after Nunes reviewed controversial intelligence documents on White House grounds in March.  On Thursday, ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, explained on MSNBC's "Andrea Mitchell Reports" that "the committee rules provide that the Chair has to sign the subpoenas unless that authority is delegated to someone else." Schiff feels that Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, who is filling Nunes' role as head of the Russia investigation, is the person who should have that authority. "That hasn't happened yet," Schiff said, adding that he thinks it's a "violation of the recusal" by Nunes. Nunes tweeted about unmasking Thursday. Seeing a lot of fake news from media elites and others who have no interest in violations of Americans' civil liberties via unmaskings.— Devin Nunes (@DevinNunes) June 1, 2017 President Trump also tweeted about unmasking Thursday. The big story is the "unmasking and surveillance" of people that took place during the Obama Administration.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 1, 2017 A senior committee aide told CBS News that the discussions over the timing and language of the bipartisan subpoenas in the Russia probe -- those involving former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and Trump lawyer Michael Cohen -- were specifically discussed for several weeks. But Democrats were only informed about other subpoenas -- those related to unmasking -- at the last minute. "I only learned about this late the night before, and that's a problem," Schiff told Mitchell. "And these were sent out unilaterally by the chairman." Although Nunes has stepped away from the Russia investigation, he's still the chairman, Speaker Ryan's spokeswoman, Ashlee Strong, points out.   "While Mr. Conaway leads the Russia investigation, Mr. Nunes remains the Chairman of the Intel Committee and has the right and responsibility to conduct oversight of the intelligence community," she told CBS News in a statement, "especially as it relates to the potential misuse of intelligence agencies against Americans." Democrats on the committee largely oppose these subpoenas because they believe the intelligence agencies have been cooperative.  The congressional and FBI investigations into Russian election meddling appear to be ramping up, and getting more uncomfortable for the White House. Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, is under scrutiny in the FBI's investigation, fired FBI Director James Comey will testify before Congress next week about a conversation he had in which the president asked him to drop the FBI's investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.  © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., June 2, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid By Rodrigo Campos | NEW YORK NEW YORK Technology shares have led U.S. stocks to record highs and are expected to continue to rise, but as market value becomes concentrated in the largest companies, some are beginning to look for the next rally leader. The technology sector of the S&P 500 .SPLRCT has risen roughly 20 percent so far in 2017, led by Apple (AAPL.O), Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Facebook (FB.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O). The only other company with comparable gains in market value this year is Amazon (AMZN.O), a market darling not in the tech sector despite being a big player in cloud services and data storage. "These are the dominant players in their specific spaces and the hottest areas in tech," said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta, highlighting their exposure to the cloud and artificial intelligence. "You will continue to see money flowing into those names. People want to be exposed to the hottest areas," he said. (To view a graphic on 'The Five Horsemen: growing influence of largest technology companies' click reut.rs/2sntpYb) Active funds have continued to throw their money behind the leaders with a record overweight on the technology sector, according to BofA/Merrill Lynch data going back to 2008. But more than a third of the 2017 gains in the S&P 500 have come from these five companies, and the concentration of the advance has some investors jittery. "Given how significant the (large cap) leadership has been year to date, I kind of think you need to find another group to produce that leadership," said Jim Tierney, chief investment officer of concentrated U.S. growth at AllianceBernstein in New York. Echoing Dell[DI.UL], Cisco (CSCO.O), Intel (INTC.O) and yes, Microsoft itself, the leaders of the Y2K tech boom, these new "five horsemen" have added more than $612 billion in value to the stock market this year. Their 2017 gains alone could buy the 85 smallest companies of the S&P 500. Their combined value, near $3 trillion, is not far from the market value of all the other components of the Nasdaq 100. NOT THAT EXPENSIVE, BUT... This tech rally has come hand in hand with heightened expectations for profits. Investors are currently paying $18.50 for every $1 in earnings expected over the next 12 months in the sector, compared to the more than $40 they paid during the dot-com bubble and even the $20-plus seen during the most recent market peak in 2007. Tech sector earnings are expected to grow 11 percent in the second quarter after rising near 21 percent in the first, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data. However, with gains of more than 33 percent for Apple, Facebook and Amazon, near 25 percent for Alphabet and 15 percent in Microsoft, compared to a gain of 8.5 percent for the S&P 500, the room for more upside is declining. Despite expecting gains upward of 20 percent for the rest of the year on the so-called FANG stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet - and their ilk, analysts at Fundstrat recommended in a Friday note balancing portfolios by scooping up the year's underperformers: banks, energy and telecoms. They are not alone in searching for exposure outside technology. "We're most overweight in technology but I don't want to stay too long at the party," said Alan Gayle, director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta. "What I'm watching for is an opportunity to lighten up on tech exposure and put it into some of the more cyclical areas," he said. "Financials are going to be catching a tailwind." AllianceBernstein's Tierney bets beyond tech on healthcare .SPXHC, the second-largest sector weight on the S&P 500. "Healthcare has really lagged the last 18 months or so. They could certainly pick up the mantle."

Heads of delegations at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. (Wikimedia Photo / Presidencia de la República Mexicana). Dozens of the country’s biggest corporations are mounting a last-ditch attempt to dissuade President Donald Trump from abandoning the Paris Agreement, a pledge to reduce carbon emissions and stem the tide of global warming. In full-page ads running in today’s New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and New York Post, 25 companies have signed an open letter detailing the economic benefits of adhering to the agreement. Those companies include Microsoft, Apple, Google, Adobe, Facebook, Intel, and Salesforce. In a related TV ad, “America’s biggest CEOs,” including the leaders of JPMorgan Chase, GE,  Johnson & Johnson, and Disney, make a similar case. Both ads claim the Paris Agreement will lead to job creation and will boost the U.S. economy. Tesla and SpaceX chief Elon Musk is one of the CEOs named in the TV ad. An outspoken supporter of the Paris Agreement, Musk has pledged to abandon his post as an advisor to Trump if the president pulls out of the climate deal. Don't know which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH & via councils, that we remain — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 31, 2017 Under President Barack Obama, the U.S. committed to reducing carbon emissions by 26 to 28 percent by 2025. If Trump exits the Paris Agreement, the U.S. will join Syria and Nicaragua as the only non-participants. The entreaties from the business community appeal to Trump’s sense of nationalism, stressing the economic and financial benefits of remaining in the agreement while underplaying the environmental factors. “By expanding markets for innovative clean technologies, the agreement generates jobs and economic growth,” the newspaper ad says. “U.S. companies are well-positioned to lead in these markets. Withdrawing from the agreement will limit our access to them and could expose us to retaliatory measures.” Two of the world’s biggest oil producers, Exxon Mobile and ConocoPhillips, also oppose pulling out of the agreement, arguing it’s better to have a seat at the table to influence global climate policy, according to Bloomberg News. The Guardian reports EPA chief Scott Pruitt and Trump advisor Steve Bannon support an exit. Most reports say Trump is leaning toward leaving the Paris Agreement. He is expected to deliver his decision this afternoon.

President Trump announces his intention to pull the United States out of the Paris accord on climate change. (Facebook screen grab / The White House) President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord was rippling through the tech community on Thursday as Amazon, Microsoft, Elon Musk and others weighed in with reactions to the news. Despite pleas from those ranging from fellow heads of state to leaders of some of the world’s biggest tech companies, Trump acted to initiate the process of backing out of the landmark agreement aimed at reducing carbon emissions and stemming the tide of global warming. “In order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord but begin negotiations to re-enter either the Paris accord or an entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States,” Trump said Thursday. “We are getting out. But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. And if we can, that’s great.” Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, was perhaps the most high-profile tech leader to express his displeasure with Trump’s decision, and he did so by following through on his threat to abandon his positions on the president’s advisory councils. Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2017 Under Paris deal, China committed to produce as much clean electricity by 2030 as the US does from all sources today https://t.co/F8Ppr2o7Rl — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2017 Musk, who has previously defended his access to the president as a way to work through disagreements from the inside, was serving on White House advisory councils that focus on manufacturing and infrastructure, as well as on Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum. He was also assisting a White House office aimed at boosting American innovation, led by Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law. In a short tweet storm of its own, Amazon’s official news feed stressed its continued support for action on climate change. 1/4 Amazon continues to support the Paris climate agreement and action on climate change. — Amazon News (@amazonnews) June 1, 2017 2/4 We believe that robust clean energy and climate policies can support American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth. — Amazon News (@amazonnews) June 1, 2017 3/4 We remain committed to putting our scale and inventive culture to work in ways that are good for the environment and our customers. — Amazon News (@amazonnews) June 1, 2017 4/4 For more information on our commitment to sustainability, visit our website https://t.co/LrnVdML0el — Amazon News (@amazonnews) June 1, 2017 Microsoft President Brad Smith tweeted disappointment on behalf of the Redmond, Wash.-based software giant. Earlier, Smith posted a letter, signed by Microsoft and other companies such as Facebook, Google, Apple and Intel, urging Trump to stick with the agreement signed by President Obama in 2015. We’re disappointed with the decision to exit the Paris Agreement. Microsoft remains committed to doing our part to achieve its goals. — Brad Smith (@BradSmi) June 1, 2017 Smith also shared a LinkedIn post in which he wrote, “We all live on a small planet and every nation needs to work with others to protect it.” He said that Microsoft is of the belief that continued U.S. participation in the agreement “benefits U.S. businesses and the economy in important and multiple ways” including creating “new markets for innovative clean technologies, from green power to smart grids to cloud-enabled solutions.” Reiterating a commitment to embrace sustainability across every aspect of its business, cloud computing company Salesforce tweeted its displeasure with Trump — complete with an illustration of two bears standing in the woods. Salesforce Statement on U.S. Withdrawal from Paris Agreement: https://t.co/SeBTRteXDC pic.twitter.com/77reuijN2B — Salesforce (@salesforce) June 1, 2017 Washington Sen. Patty Murray released a statement calling the president’s “short-sighted” action “especially cruel” for her home state. “It is truly a sad commentary that when faced with two choices — to either uphold the Paris climate deal to combat perhaps the most significant challenge of our time, or, to abdicate all responsibility and walk away — President Trump chose the latter. This is especially cruel as Washington state is already grappling with the harsh effects of climate change, from ocean acidification and shrinking glaciers on Mt. Rainier, to more intense droughts and crop damage, and bigger, more devastating wildfires. Our children, and our children’s children, will remember the moment when the President of the United States of America chose the short-sighted political payoff despite scientific fact, overwhelming global support, long-term financial stability, and the will of millions of families he vowed to represent. To say I’m disappointed with President Trump’s decision is an understatement.” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee issued several tweets on the “shameful course of action” and announced the state’s intention, along with others, to be part of a United States Climate Alliance. Leaving the Paris agreement is a shameful course of action that will jeopardize the health and prosperity of our children and grandchildren. — Governor Jay Inslee (@GovInslee) June 1, 2017 Washington state has, is, and will continue leading the way on climate issues for our people while Trump and Washington, D.C. fails. — Governor Jay Inslee (@GovInslee) June 1, 2017 Along with @NYGovCuomo and Calif. Gov. Jerry Brown, we're forming the United States Climate Alliance. https://t.co/opGiz01Ntu — Governor Jay Inslee (@GovInslee) June 1, 2017 Seattle Mayor Ed Murray said that “going backward is not an option” and that cities like Seattle will keep their commitment to the Paris Agreement and even pass a resolution to that effect. As President Trump retreats on the #ParisAgreement and shirks responsibility, cities like ours will fill the void and #ActOnClimate. pic.twitter.com/C9B2rEvorl — Ed Murray (@MayorEdMurray) June 1, 2017 Meanwhile, the folks at weather.com — who perhaps know a thing or two about whether it’s getting hotter — dedicated a good chunk of their website, below news of Trump’s actions, to illustrating what it could all mean. Starting with “So, what happens to Earth now?” the site linked to proof of global warming’s effects such as Antarctica turning green and California’s coastline disappearing. (Weather.com screen grab) And in the end, Astronaut Scott Kelly, a man who has seen and reflected on Earth from a place most can only dream about, called the news “devastating” while sharing an image of the home planet from outer space. Withdrawing from the #ParisAgreement will be devastating to our planet. Paris and Pittsburgh share the same environment after all. pic.twitter.com/QNO5vHtmEF — Scott Kelly (@StationCDRKelly) June 1, 2017 The White House streamed Trump’s statement on the Paris accord live on Facebook.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Top Computer Stocks to Buy in 2017 Investors looking for a play on computers -- as well as their software and hardware -- should consider these three companies this year. Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Jun 2, 2017 at 3:09PM In the first quarter of 2017 the PC market reported its first growth in the past five quarters, but just barely. PC sales, which include desktops, notebooks, and workstations, hit 60.3 million units in the first quarter, up 0.6% year over year according to research from IDC.  Despite this snail-like growth, there are still several solid opportunities for investors looking to snatch up the best computer stocks this year. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) are all longtime players in the computer market, and each is poised to benefit in its respective segment this year.  Image source: Apple. Apple Apple reported Mac unit sales of 4.2 million in its fiscal second quarter 2017, an increase of 4% year over year, and said the net revenue from those sales hit $5.8 billion, up 14% year over year. Apple's PC sales pale in comparison to its iPhone business, but that doesn't mean Apple should be written off as a solid computer investment.  Image source: Apple. Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the earnings call that its new Macbook Pro helped spur Mac revenues in the quarter, and that Mac business has generated over $25 billion of revenue over the past four quarters. "We're investing aggressively in its future, and we are very excited about the innovation we can bring to the platform," Cook added.  Apple will likely keep the good times rolling for its Macs this year when it releases updates to both the Pro and regular Macbook lineups next month. The company is expected to bring new, 7th-generation Intel Kaby Lake chips into both the Macbook and Macbook Pro lineups, which should boost processing speeds and increase battery life. Apple is the fourth-largest PC vendor in the world. It just raised it's dividend by 10.5% in the second quarter, and continues to prove that incremental upgrades to its Macs and other devices are more than enough to drive more growth from this longtime computer stock.  Abobe Pivoting to the software side of computer stocks, Adobe is a great example of a company transitioning from one-time software sales to recurring revenue through a subscription-based model -- and it's paying off enormously for the company.  Adobe just reported its strongest first quarter ever, with revenue up 21.6% year over year to $1.68 billion and GAAP net income jumping 56.7% to $254.3 million. The company's Digital-media segment, driven by subscriptions to Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, deserve most of the credit for the stellar quarter, as it grew 22% year over year.  Image source: Adobe. Even with sales of PCs slowing down, Abobe is proving there is still substantial need for creative software that users are willing to pay for on an ongoing basis. Adobe CFO Mark Garrett indicated in a press release that there's likely more for investors to look forward to this year as well. Our solid execution and business momentum combined with strong market tailwinds give us confidence in our ability to continue to deliver strong financial results. We remain bullish about our prospects for the rest of 2017 and beyond. NVIDIA NVIDIA may not be what you consider a traditional computer stock, but the company makes the vast majority of its revenue -- about 53% -- from sales of its graphics processing units (GPUs) that go into PCs, which, I think, is a solid computer stock bonafide. NVIDIA has caught the attention of investors for its growing opportunities in driverless cars and virtual reality, but the company's GPUs are also being used to power complex data centers for artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities.  Image source: NVIDIA. Intel may dominate the server business right now, but NVIDIA's chips are already helping Facebook, Alphabet, and others take the next step into visual computing and neural network learning. NVIDIA's DGX-1 supercomputer is a prime example of this -- it can learn 12 times faster than the company's previous machine learning computers.  Aside from AI computing, NVIDIA's GPUs are the go-to choice for PC makers' graphics processing needs for gaming and virtual reality. That bodes very well for NVIDIA, as IDC has noted that PC gaming growth is helping to stabilize the broader PC market and VR is shaping up to be a nearly $34 billion business by 2022.  Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Scan & Sign CloudPrivate Back to Home The Great OpenStack Delusion – how open source cloud infrastructure can overcome a crisis Increase / Decrease text size James Nunns   - Deputy Editor 2nd June 2017 Add to favorites Canonical founder Mark Shuttleworth delivers some tough love in his assessment of OpenStack and what needs to happen to get it out of a crisis. OpenStack is in a state of flux. The open source cloud infrastructure has always been dogged by issues regarding its value, complexity, cost, and a lack of skills. But now it faces a new challenge within its community that could herald a make or break period for the technology. The cloud infrastructure has to some extent overcome many of the challenges it has faced, and dispelled many a myth in the process, but moves from some of the largest vendors in the ecosystem have threatened to de-rail the project. HPE and Cisco are two of the most notable companies to have shifted their position with OpenStack, whilst Intel has also withdrawn funding in the past year. Mark Shuttleworth, founder of Canonical and soon to return to the position of CEO, spoke to CBR recently about the health of OpenStack.  On HPE’s position Shuttleworth said: “Here’s the simple fact, HPE was never going to sell an HPE OpenStack because no one was ever going to buy an HPE OpenStack and HPE has zero f*****g clue how to operate software. But HPE will do a great job at selling servers under a Canonical OpenStack.” Shuttleworth said that OpenStack will thrive and because of that there will be a need for servers, which HPE, Dell EMC, Cisco and others will provide and build a great business off of it, but some of the big vendors have “taken a big punch to the face,” due to a delusion that they would own the entire stack. “The delusion that magically they would own the entire stack was what had to fail,  so the mixed messages is that they’ve taken a big punch to the face but at the end of the day they will end up selling a bunch of servers into OpenStack and I think that’s great, and they will be successful and we will help them with that,” said Shuttleworth. “This sounds like tough love but that’s exactly what this is. There is a bunch of delusion behind the vendor strategy.” Cisco is similar, while the Canonical founder says that his company deploys a lot of its OpenStack on Cisco UCS the vendor along with others have learned that they can’t own the whole stack. “There’s a difference between a vendor owning the whole thing, which is what they wanted, and participate with things that make sense, which is what will happen. “In all of that right now is the crisis, but what will emerge is that people will want to buy servers from HPE and they will buy from HPE and they’ll push a button and there Canonical OpenStack will get bigger with those servers  and that’s great for HPE.” In the past, Shuttleworth has, in his own words, “somewhat controversially” called out OpenStack for having lots of things in it that don’t really matter, that can essentially be ignored because they are going to die. That isn’t necessarily a bad thing for OpenStack because it will help to move it to a place where everyone agrees on what exactly OpenStack is. The OpenStack Foundation is also seemingly starting to recognise this and has started to move towards wrapping up projects that no one is interested in or using, but it’s been a long time coming and there’s a reason for that – money. Read more: OpenStack Summit: The second generation of private cloud At least that’s according to Shuttleworth who said it is: “because each one of those has a vendor that pays a sponsorship and a subscription.” But if these projects are closed then will it force companies out and damage the ecosystem? Shuttleworth said that words like ecosystem are associated with winning, hence why they are used so often and that “noise is not associated with winning but they can often be the same thing.” “So the foundation went through a phase where adding vendors added money and the perception of ecosystem, but it also added noise. So the painful thing that is going to have to happen is that some vendors will have to accept that they fit into a world where the only things that matter are Nova, Cinder, Swift, Neutron, KVM…” The soon to be CEO said that his point is that it’s none of the vendor specific “stuff.” “You’re already seeing Mirantis has multiple of those projects they just can’t sustain them, HPE has abandoned multiple of those projects and with that sponsorships will go. That’s ok, it’s the old how many people does it take to change a lightbulb, well if it should only take one then why would you want 20 in a room?” Shuttleworth doesn’t want to see a single vendor story and urges careful thinking from the Foundation as to how it moves forward without ending up in a single vendor situation, “because they’ve allowed throwing money at the problem to carry a very big stick and there are some people that have money.” Fundamentally he believes that getting virtual networks, virtual machines, and virtual discs right, doesn’t take 300 vendors.  “We can build ecosystems around OpenStack, very viable ecosystems around OpenStack without making the core contested, that will take real leadership,” said Shuttleworth. He does feel that the Foundation is getting ready to make the hard decisions but that in the end it will be forced upon them because vendors will leave as they haven’t made money. “That’s not a bad thing for OpenStack, if you look at what we said three years ago, a lot will go away so don’t fall in love with it. What you should fall in love with is the core that is what will survive and thrive,” he said. Although it may come across as Shuttleworth being quite doom and gloom about the state of ecosystem, he was actually very positive. His company is doing well, as highlighted by a recent OpenStack user survey that showed Ubuntu as being just behind Red Hat for commercial traction. He’s also seeing increasing traction when it comes to businesses being open to having multiple operating systems – with Ubuntu becoming the new Linux in the building. While there are positives for Canconical, Shuttleworth still wants to see open source cloud infrastructure’s operations become crisper and more automated in order to get in to line with the public cloud vendors like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure , and Google. Read more: Mark Shuttleworth, Canonical founder: Dot-com bubble collapse set to hit Openstack as the Big Tent comes falling down Shuttleworth said: “As long as the operations of OpenStack are crisp and automated the way we do them, that is a beautiful thing. There a lot of people in the OpenStack community who can’t do that, they can’t operate OpenStack, their OpenStack can’t be operated, so operating it is kind of crazy and therefore unpredictable in terms of cost. “So businesses look at that and see they have a predictable thing from Amazon and this crazy and unpredictable thing from Mirantis, well that’s a shit choice. Whereas if you can get it to the point where Amazon is predictable, Google is predictable and OpenStack is predictable the way it is from Canonical with a managed service like BootStack or with just doing it yourself with MAAS and Juju that is a great thing.” One thing that could help OpenStack is the upcoming Microsoft Azure Stack which is due to compete with OpenStack when it is fully released. “That’s an interesting one and I think it’s really good,” said Shuttleworth. “So yes, I think Azure Stack is a serious competitor to OpenStack and I suspect Azure Stack will be good. Historically, version three will be very good and I think that’s good for OpenStack.” The reason why he thinks it will be good is because it will help to force OpenStack to get rid of the things that don’t matter. There’s a lot of changes that are going to be on in OpenStack, some necessary, some that will be forced on them by external forces. Increased competition in the market should be a good thing, but it will be up to the Foundation and vendors to make sure they get it right. Shuttleworth isn’t critical of the Foundation, he said he admires them but that there are things that that they need to learn, not in a way of calling anyone an idiot, but there are a lot of decisions ahead that need to be made.

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Sploid Paleofuture io9 Science Reviews Field Guide Dozens of Cities and States Are Initiating Rogue One, Planning to Independently Rejoin the Paris Agreement  Sidney FussellYesterday 3:05pm Filed to: political climate change Paris agreement climate change 144 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink AP Former New York City major, Michael Bloomberg, is coordinating an effort among 30 mayors, three governors, 80 university presidents and over 100 businesses to independently align with the Paris Agreement’s goal of curbing US carbon emissions, the New York Times reported Friday. Additionally, 83 mayors have signed the Climate Mayors Agreement, similarly with the goal of independently reducing carbon emissions. On Thursday, President Trump announced the US is joining Syria and Nicaragua in abdicating from the landmark agreement, ratified by former President Obama in 2016 and signed by 195 nations. Trump peddled dozens of wildly disproven falsehoods in justifying exiting the agreement, which prompted swift backlash from the international community, diplomats, Trump’s own Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, and major US companies like Apple, Microsoft and Intel. State and local leaders have also made it clear they’re fighting the decision and will continue to fight climate change, with or without federal support. The Climate Mayors Agreement is a commitment between now 8o+ cities including Austin, Palo Alto and San Francisco to ignore Trump’s March executive order that weakened the Clean Power Plan, which would have compelled states to set power plant emissions reductions goals. They want to keep those goals intact. Several of these same cities have jointly signed onto former Mayor Bloomberg’s new plan, which is a coalition of cities, states, and companies who plan on coordinating with the UN directly to come up with carbon emissions targets. Advertisement For now, it’s unclear how that coordination will actually work. The Paris Agreement was designed to accommodate entire nations, not individual cities. The point was for countries to have individual targets, then draw up their own policy measures in order to meet them. This new effort would seemingly involve a wide range of localities within a country all coordinating with an international body, which is brand new diplomatic territory. To remain aligned with the Paris Agreement, cities will be focusing on expanding renewable energy sources for utilities, launching infrastructure projects that are more energy efficient and offering subsidies for customers buying electric cars and solar panels. The US is roughly halfway to its initial Paris Agreement goal, of reducing carbon emissions by about 25% by 2025, and was set to meet its goal before Trump’s rapid-fire deregulations. While researchers projected the US will fail its climate goal, former Mayor Bloomberg said in a letter to the UN that he believes his coalition will help the US achieve its reduction target. Moreover, the new coalition signifies that while America’s leadership may have abdicated its responsibility to fight climate change, its people are not.

Reuters: Mueller Now Looking Into Flynn’s Turkey Lobbying, Too SHARE TWEET PIN-IT Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP By Allegra Kirkland Published June 2, 2017 12:29 pm Views Ousted national security adviser Michael Flynn’s well-compensated lobbying for a Turkish businessman during the 2016 campaign is now part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s election interference, Reuters reported Friday. Three sources told Reuters that Mueller was assuming control over an ongoing federal grand jury investigation into Flynn’s lobbying work, which forced him to retroactively register as a foreign agent after leaving the White House. Flynn’s consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, was paid $530,000 by Inovo BV, a Dutch firm owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin, to research and produce negative PR materials about exiled Turkish cleric Fetullah Gulen. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan believes Gulen orchestrated a failed coup against him last summer from his compound in Pennsylvania. Reuters reported that the grand jury investigation, run out of the Eastern District Court of Virginia, has issued subpoenas for Flynn and his business associates. The subpoenas requested bank records, documents and communications related to Flynn, Flynn Intel Group, Alptekin and Inovo, per the report. Mueller’s investigation, which includes determining whether there was any collusion between Trump campaign associates and Kremlin operatives, is also looking into Flynn’s conversations with Russian officials. Flynn had multiple conversations with the Kremlin’s ambassador to the U.S. about lifting the Obama administration’s economic sanctions against Russia. Former acting attorney general Sally Yates testified that the Justice Department believed Flynn was “compromised with respect to the Russians” because he knowingly misrepresented those conversations to other Trump administration officials.

Human drivers 1 / 3 Back to Gallery DETROIT - In just a few years, well-mannered self-driving robotaxis will share the roads with reckless, law-breaking human drivers. The prospect is causing migraines for the people developing the robotaxis. A self-driving car would be programmed to drive at the speed limit. Humans routinely exceed it by 10 to 15 mph (16 to 24 kph) - just try entering the New Jersey Turnpike at normal speed. Self-driving cars wouldn't dare cross a double yellow line; humans do it all the time. And then there are those odd local traffic customs to which humans quickly adapt. In Los Angeles and other places, for instance, there's the "California Stop," where drivers roll through stop signs if no traffic is crossing. In Southwestern Pennsylvania, courteous drivers practice the "Pittsburgh Left," where it's customary to let one oncoming car turn left in front of them when a traffic light turns green. The same thing happens in Boston. During rush hours near Ann Arbor, Mich., drivers regularly cross a double-yellow line to queue up for a left-turn onto a freeway. "There's an endless list of these cases where we as humans know the context, we know when to bend the rules and when to break the rules," says Raj Rajkumar, a computer engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University who leads its autonomous car research. Although autonomous cars are likely to carry passengers or cargo in limited areas during the next three to five years, experts say it will take many years before robotaxis can coexist with human-piloted vehicles on most side streets, boulevards and freeways. That's because programmers have to figure out human behavior and local traffic idiosyncrasies. And teaching a car to use that knowledge will require massive amounts of data and big computing power that is prohibitively expensive at the moment.

Driving customs and road conditions are dramatically different across the globe, with narrow, congested lanes in European cities, and anarchy in Beijing's giant traffic jams. In India's capital, New Delhi, luxury cars share poorly marked and congested lanes with bicycles, scooters, trucks, and even an occasional cow or elephant. Then there is the problem of aggressive humans who make dangerous moves such as cutting cars off on freeways or turning left in front of oncoming traffic. In India, for example, even when lanes are marked, drivers swing from lane to lane without hesitation. Already there have been isolated cases of human drivers pulling into the path of cars such as Teslas, knowing they will stop because they're equipped with automatic emergency braking. "It's hard to program in human stupidity or someone who really tries to game the technology," says John Hanson, spokesman for Toyota's autonomous car unit. Kathy Winter, vice president of automated driving solutions for Intel, is optimistic that the cars will be able to see and think like humans before 2030. Cars with sensors for driver-assist systems already are gathering data about road signs, lane lines and human driver behavior. Winter hopes auto and tech companies developing autonomous systems and cars will contribute this information to a giant database. Artificial intelligence developed by Intel and other companies eventually could access the data and make quick decisions similar to humans, Winter says. Intel's Winter expects fully autonomous cars to collect, process and analyze four terabytes of data in 1 ½ hours of driving, which is the average amount a person spends in a car each day. That's equal to storing over 1.2 million photos or 2,000 hours of movies. Such computing power now costs over $100,000 per vehicle. But that cost could fall as more cars are built. Someday autonomous cars will have common sense programmed in so they will cross a double-yellow line when warranted or to speed up and find a gap to enter a freeway. Carnegie Mellon has taught its cars to handle the "Pittsburgh Left" by waiting a full second or longer for an intersection to clear before proceeding at a green light. Sensors also track crossing traffic and can figure out if a driver is going to stop for a sign or red light. Eventually there will be vehicle-to-vehicle communication to avoid crashes. Still, some skeptics say computerized cars will never be able to think exactly like humans. "You'll never be able to make up a person's ability to perceive what's the right move at the time, I don't think," says New Jersey State Police Sgt. Ed Long.

Getting good at that exercise of data synthesis and interpretation ought to open new, quicker routes to identifying threats, tracking disease outbreaks, and otherwise answering questions and solving problems that previously were intractable. Now for a reality check. “Today’s hardware is ill-suited to handle such data challenges, and these challenges are only going to get harder as the amount of data continues to grow exponentially,” said Trung Tran, a program manager in DARPA’s Microsystems Technology Office (MTO). To take on that technology shortfall, MTO last summer unveiled its Hierarchical Identify Verify Exploit (HIVE) program, which has now signed on five performers to carry out HIVE’s mandate: to develop a powerful new data-handling and computing platform specialized for analyzing and interpreting huge amounts of data with unprecedented deftness. “It will be a privilege to work with this innovative team of performers to develop a new category of server processors specifically designed to handle the data workloads of today and tomorrow,” said Tran, who is overseeing HIVE. The quintet of performers includes a mix of large commercial electronics firms, a national laboratory, a university, and a veteran defense-industry company: Intel Corporation (Santa Clara, California), Qualcomm Intelligent Solutions (San Diego, California), Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (Richland, Washington), Georgia Tech (Atlanta, Georgia), and Northrop Grumman (Falls Church, Virginia). “The HIVE program is an exemplary prototype for how to engage the U.S. commercial industry, leverage their design expertise, and enhance U.S. competitiveness, while also enhancing national security,” said William Chappell, director of MTO. “By forming a team with members in both the commercial and defense sectors, we hope to forge new R&D pathways that can deliver unprecedented levels of hardware specialization. That can be a boost for commercial players but also can advance our military electronics supply to make sure the national defense infrastructure is empowered with the best capabilities in the world.” Central to HIVE is the creation of a “graph analytics processor,” which incorporates the power of graphical representations of relationships in a network more efficiently than traditional data formats and processing techniques. Examples of these relationships among data elements and categories include person-to-person interactions as well as seemingly disparate links between, say, geography and changes in doctor visit trends or social media and regional strife. In combination with emerging machine learning and other artificial intelligence techniques that can categorize raw data elements, and by updating the elements in the graph as new data becomes available, a powerful graph analytics processor could discern otherwise hidden causal relationships and stories among the data elements in the graph representations. If HIVE is successful, it could deliver a graph analytics processor that achieves a thousandfold improvement in processing efficiency over today’s best processors, enabling the real-time identification of strategically important relationships as they unfold in the field rather than relying on after-the-fact analyses in data centers. “This should empower data scientists to make associations previously thought impractical due to the amount of processing required,” said Tran. These could include the ability to spot, for example, early signs of an Ebola outbreak, the first digital missives of a cyberattack, or even the plans to carry out such an attack before it happens. The words in the program’s name, Hierarchical Identify Verify Exploit, indicate a sequence that begins with the multi-layer graphical representations of data. This opens the way for graph analytic processing to identify relationships between data within and perhaps between the layers. A key next step is the applications of verification filters and tests that can distinguish between relationships that have causal connections from meaningless correlations among the data. “Taken together, these elements should allow us to exploit the enormous amount of data being generated today, to make better decisions about if, when, and how to act in furtherance of the public good and national security,” Tran said.

(GuruFocus) Citron Research's Andrew Left made a bold call this week: Canada-based BlackBerry Ltd (NASDAQ: BBRY) could be the next NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA). After publishing a research report, Left was a guest on Bloomberg's "Bloomberg Markets" segment Thursday to follow up on his report. He's Not Alone, And Here's Why Left was quick to acknowledge he isn't the only BlackBerry uber-bull, and the case to buy the stock has been made by some Wall Street analysts. But what drew his attention to BlackBerry is a case study involving Mobileye NV (NYSE: MBLY), a stock he had shorted but was acquired by Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) for $15.3 billion, although it is currently still trading on the NYSE. The Potential Of Mobileye Technology Mobileye's driver assistance technology was installed in 15 million cars, but the valuation behind the stock didn't make much sense, Left said. This showed the underlying value of having a technology that is millions of cars which led Left to find BlackBerry attractive since its QNX products is found in 60 million cars. QNX 7.0 could be the operating platform that "your car runs on thinking that your car is a computer," Left added. ...And What It Means For BlackBerry As Left mentioned in his research report, BlackBerry's huge exposure to the car makes it a target for a high-premium buyout. He suggested that the list of potential companies interested in acquiring BlackBerry is vast and includes "anyone who has remorse that they did not get the operating platforms in either computers or cars." Bottom line, Nvidia's enterprise market capitalization has moved from around $5.5 billion to $85 billion at a time when revenues just doubled as the Street gave the company credit for just entering new business lines. In BlackBerry's case, a focus and emphasis on the QNX segment or on the Internet of Things will generate a higher multiple for BlackBerry's stock and push the stock higher. At last check before publication, shares of BlackBerry were down 3.64 percent at $10.98.

Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2017 You might be surprised Elon was a Trump advisor in the first place — I certainly was when I first heard of this prospect. After all, the Silicon Valley has been anything but friendly to Trump, and their ideals greatly differ from those of the US president. But nevertheless, Musk (and several other tech tycoons, we’ll get to them) said that they can only make a change by sitting at the table. So they tried to make a difference from within. They failed. It must have gotten Musk very angry, because he proceeded to tweet how India and China (blamed by Trump as the “big polluters,” even though the US is the world’s second largest polluter) are keeping their side of the deal and are much more ambitious than the US. India commits to sell only electric cars by 2030. It is already the largest market for solar power. https://t.co/EGBNTPzmE5 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2017 Under Paris deal, China committed to produce as much clean electricity by 2030 as the US does from all sources today https://t.co/F8Ppr2o7Rl — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2017 ADVERTISEMENT In fact, pretty much all of Silicon Valley’s tech giants tried to stop Trump from withdrawing from the Paris Agreement (more on that here and here). The CEOs of Google, Facebook, Microsoft, HP and Intel wrote an open letter to Trump, which he ignored. “As other countries invest in advanced technologies and move forward with the Paris Agreement, we believe the United States can best exercise global leadership and advance US interests by remaining a full partner in this vital global effort,” the letter read. But it didn’t work — nothing did. Trump made his intentions abundantly clear, and despite the international backlash and national uproar, he did what he wanted. Now, Trump’s inner circle is also starting to thin. Aside from Musk, Disney’s CEO Bob Iger also announced his resignation, and was retweeted by Elon Musk in a show of support. As a matter of principle, I've resigned from the President's Council over the #ParisAgreement withdrawal. — Robert Iger (@RobertIger) June 1, 2017 It’s a matter of principle, Iger says, and he’s right. There is a deeply established scientific consensus on man-made climate change, and it is also becoming increasingly clear that we can protect the planet while also increasing the economy. Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement is not only reckless and unethical, it just doesn’t make any sense. “Protecting our planet and driving economic growth are critical to our future, and they aren’t mutually exclusive. I deeply disagree with the decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and, as a matter of principle, I’ve resigned from the President’s advisory council.” Apple CEO Tim Cook, who is also an adviser, slammed the decision and said that no only is climate change real, but each of us has a responsibility to tackle it. However, no talk of resignation. Disappointed with today’s decision on the Paris Agreement. Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government. — Jeff Immelt (@JeffImmelt) June 1, 2017 It’s not unlike Trump to go against what people are advising him to do, but there’s something highly symbolic in the US president shunning the leaders of Earth’s largest innovation center. It’s like he’s turning away from innovation, looking away from the future. Like he’s doing by withdrawing from the Paris Agreement.Click here for reuse options!

Vanity Fair hive Sign In/Up business technology politics the players hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Magazine Search Business Politics Technology The Players Sign In/Up Trump's America Silicon Valley Finally Admits How Much It Hates Trump Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Trump's America Silicon Valley Finally Admits How Much It Hates Trump Leaders of nearly every major tech company slammed Trump for withdrawing from the Paris climate accord. by Maya KosoffJune 2, 2017 11:10 am Email Facebook Twitter By Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images. Leaders of some of the world’s most valuable tech companies were apoplectic after President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that the United States would withdraw from the Paris climate accord, a landmark global agreement to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and prevent the planet from heating to dangerous levels. Tesla C.E.O. Elon Musk, who had threatened to leave the president’s advisory boards if he did not uphold President __Barack Obama's__environmental commitments, promptly resigned. “Am departing presidential councils,” he tweeted Thursday afternoon. “Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.” Apple C.E.O. Tim Cook, who had pleaded with Trump earlier in the week, also issued a blistering statement. “I spoke with President Trump on Tuesday and tried to persuade him to keep the U.S. in the agreement. But it wasn’t enough,” he wrote in an e-mail to employees. “Climate change is real, and we all share a responsibility to fight it.” Although Silicon Valley has feuded with Trump before—particularly over his attempts to ban immigration from Muslim-majority countries and place limits on visa programs—the president’s decision to abandon the historic, 195-nation climate deal seemed to push tech leaders over the edge. Marc Benioff of Salesforce, which was among 25 companies (including Adobe, Intel, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, and Google) that placed full-page, pro-Paris agreement ads in The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, wrote that he was “deeply disappointed” and declared that his company would “double our efforts to fight climate change.” Google’s Sundar Pichai, Microsoft’s Brad Smith, and a representative for Uber also said they were “disappointed,” while Twitter C.E.O. Jack Dorsey called the decision “an incredibly shortsighted move backwards by the federal government.” Amazon released a series of tweets asserting the company’s commitment to combatting climate change, and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg slammed Trump’s announcement as “bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children's future at risk.” https://twitter.com/Benioff/status/870377802553475072 https://twitter.com/cwarzel/status/870382607971647488 https://twitter.com/uber/status/870391505915174914 https://twitter.com/levie/status/870368865083052032 Not every tech company is taking as passionate a stand. IBM, Intel, and Dell all said that their C.E.O.s will remain on the president’s business advisory council, even though they support staying in the Paris agreement. Still, temperatures are running high in Silicon Valley, where the vast majority of executives, entrepreneurs, and venture capitalists already had a fraught relationship with the president. Nor is it clear whether that relationship is salvageable. The Trump administration is currently trying to convene a second major tech summit on June 19 with industry leaders to brainstorm ways to modernize the government’s I.T. infrastructure. But with C.E.O.s like Musk and Disney’s Bob Iger resigning from the president’s advisory councils, pressure will likely be intense on other corporate heavyweights to stop working with the White House in protest.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman COMPUTEX 2017’s InnoVEX Global Innovation and Tech Startup Ecosystem Ends on High Note TAIPEI, Taiwan–(BUSINESS WIRE)–COMPUTEX 2017’s InnoVEX exhibit attracted 272 startups from 23 countries/territories, showcasing innovations from around the world in IoT, AI, health management, VR/AR, cloud computing, wearables, and mobility. InnoVEX featured startups, VCs, and accelerators collaborating to build a new ecosystem for the information and communications technology (ICT) industry. A packed schedule of keynotes, panels, forums, and demos provided a rare opportunity for startups to efficiently connect with international VCs, angel investors, incubators and accelerators, potential strategic partners, and future customers–all in a single venue. InnoVEX included five elements critical to start-ups: display, demos, forums, pitch contests, and matchmaking. InnoVEX was introduced to COMPUTEX in 2016; in two years, it has become one of the leading global innovation events. In InnoVEX 2017, there were eight U.S. startups such as BioInspira, Holojam, SparkAmplify and VaGenie. In addition to individual startup exhibitors, prominent U.S. companies such as Amazon, IBM, and Intel were among the show’s speakers. Several American high-profile venture capital firms and accelerators such as Acorn, Fenox, Indiegogo and Alchemist participated. The Netherlands Trade and Investment Office featured a Dutch Startup Showcase. The French Tech Space also had a significant presence at InnoVEX this year. Gartner predicted by 2017, 50 percent of all IoT solutions would originate in startups less than three years old, signaling that innovative business models are becoming the focus of R&D in the global ICT industry. “In recent years, emerging technologies have revolutionized ICT sectors and business models around the world. TAITRA recognized this trend, and added the InnoVEX exhibit last year. Now, it is one of the leading global innovation events. COMPUTEX is a platform to match resources for innovators and startups globally to drive the industry’s growth and development,” said Walter Yeh, president and CEO of COMPUTEX organizer TAITRA. The culminating event of InnoVEX—the “Startup Pitch Competition,” at Center Stage on June 1 was a highlight of InnoVEX at COMPUTEX 2017. Around 100 startup teams around the world registered and competed for the five categories of award prizes plus the InnoVEX Grand Prize of US$30K. International juries from U.S. and Taiwan provided insightful questions and practical comments before an enthusiastic and engaged audience. Eight startups were selected as finalists and six startups received awards provided by companies and organizers. This year’s InnoVEX Grand Prize of US$30K was awarded to security-as-a-service start-up Amaryllo from the Netherlands. When Amaryllo President and Founder Marcus Yang was asked what advice he would give future start-ups wanting to enter the pitch contest, he said, “Don’t focus on touting your products. Focus on your business model—that’s what the judges look for—it has to be tangible and sustainable. I’ve found InnoVEX to be an excellent opportunity to meet investors and VCs from around the world and to meet (and even secure deals with) potential partners and large customers. I attended InnoVEX last year and will be back again next year. It is an honor to receive this year’s Grand Prize recognition, thank you.” Although Amaryllo still qualifies as a start-up, the company has already achieved significant success and landed some large clients. This is one start-up to watch. InnoVEX 2018 will be held June 5 to 7. Start-ups who wish to be considered for InnoVEX 2018 should visit http://www.innovex.com.tw/ for updates.

Cutting (pictured) is well known as the founder of Hadoop at Yahoo, where he and his colleagues took the MapReduce idea of parcelling out data workloads and then reducing the results back from Google and applied it more widely to a software framework, then named after his child’s toy, Hadoop. On this occasion, he spoke about a new cyber security application of his company’s technology, the role of Spark, and of open source more generally. What follows is an edited transcript of that interview. Computer Weekly: What are you working on? Cutting: I’ve been helping Cloudera and Intel with the Apache Spot project, which is an open source, big data style of doing cyber security. This is instead of the classic approach of having filters that are scanning for particular kinds of behaviour that someone has manually coded in terms of prior attacks. It’s hard to catch new attacks that way. Whereas if you build models that define usual behaviour, you can catch anomalies. Computer Weekly: But that is an old information security approach – anomaly detection. How has it moved on? Cutting: We now have the horsepower to store and process a lot more data, with Hadoop and [parallel processing framework] Spark. Also, we are trying to have a standard format for network data, so that different firms can build different applications that are detecting intrusions, so that we can have a cyber security ecosystem, an open data model for cyber security. We have been a horizontal play as Cloudera, but in this case we do want to support industry-specific data, and there could be opportunities to do that for other industries, such as telcos, or in the IoT [internet of things]. Computer Weekly: Open source might be a source for good, but is it a force for business? CIOs have an interest in their open source suppliers not going under. Cutting: No, open source is a requirement for business. Companies are more and more reluctant to adopt technology that is not open source for their basic storage and processing of data. But it is also a better model for developing software because you have more people participating in the process. When you get technology controlled by a single institution, it becomes a cash cow. The company can’t make fundamental changes easily without threatening its existing business. For example, with Cloudera we have had the MapReduce element of Hadoop as a core component from the beginning. But Spark has come along, and is a better tool. Computer Weekly: Has Spark now eclipsed MapReduce? Cutting: In many cases, it has. And the interesting thing is that it does not threaten our business; rather, it makes it stronger, even though it is a technology from outside. Oracle would find that very hard – to replace its database with Spark, and convince customers to replace it. We saw a lot slower progess in database technology when it was proprietary than we are seeing now. Read more about Doug Cutting and Hadoop At the Strata + Hadoop World 2016 conference in San Jose, SearchDataManagement’s Jack Vaughan talked with Hadoop co-creator Doug Cutting to find out more about the big data technology’s origins and where it is headed. In a Q&A as Hadoop reaches one 10-year milestone in its development, co-creator Doug Cutting talks about the adoption of the big data framework, and the history and future of Hadoop. A reminder of what Hadoop is. Computer Weekly: How much, then, of the original Hadoop technology stack is in Cloudera? Cutting: HDFS, MapReduce and Yarn are still used heavily. For example, Uber uses MapReduce. It is not dead, but doing, say, machine learning algorithms with MapReduce is clumsy. There are libraries for doing machine learning in Spark. Or if you are doing streaming, you might use [messaging system] Kafka or Spark streaming. Computer Weekly: Where are we now with Hadoop’s evolution, in 2017? We’ve spoken before about shifting from taking out costs, using Hadoop, to facilitating more innovative business models. Is it still mainly about taking out costs from storage? Cutting: In the first year of use, it is mainly about taking out costs from storage. Or combining data sources that you were unable to combine before – that is another way to get started. Fairly rapidly, we see people having two or three applications, using the platform to experiment and innovate. That will be the future. It used to be that you built an application to satisfy a business need, and you ran it for 20 years. You didn’t deploy a platform whose purpose was innovation. Now you want to get a win first, and then start exploring. Computer Weekly: Back in 2012, I was asking you about big data technologies “crossing the chasm” of adoption, from Californian software engineering companies through Wall Street and the City to more mainstream companies. You said then it would be steady growth. Cutting: And that is what we have seen. I am very optimistic long-term, but it is deceptive when you look at it short-term. You’ll see various analysts saying “people have used Hadoop and it has failed”. It is not easy to see the progress unless you are in the business of working with it. Computer Weekly: Coming back to the cyber security effort, does that come under the heading of machine learning? What is your take on that area, which is all the rage? Cutting: It does. My take on it is that there is real stuff there. But there is also a lot of value to be had from using simpler methods. If you look at the industry over the next decade, I think machine learning will be a smaller part of our business and of the industry than more conventional data management methods. Just being able to get more data more integrated and being able to count things you could not count easily before. Most companies still can’t do that, and when they can, they get a lot of value out of that. There is a lot of room there to deploy ML and AI, but it won’t eclipse more traditional database, search and analytics technologies.

Following President Donald Trump’s announcement of the United States’ withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, the world can now only look on with dismay, at a country whose words and commitments as a global leader were once worth more. WHITHER AMERICAN LEADERSHIP? This position as global leader, developed in the 70 years since World War II, was anchored on three things: First, influence; some military, but equally important, strong doses of moral, political, economic and financial suasion. Advertisement Advertisement Second, that leadership was predicated on American presence and commitment. Presence in being at any and all tables of global importance, commitment in standing by its word. Third, an underlying global consistency and predictability that endures and undergirds changes in policy and Administration. With his speech at the Rose Garden, Trump has more definitively than ever changed the calculus. But what is important, however, is that the Paris Agreement will survive the American exit. The global fight against climate change will be harder, but it will go on. Even within the country, the fight will go on. Immediately after Trump’s announcement, the governors of California, New York and Washington State all signaled their intention to uphold the agreement, and continue the fight. The three states represent nearly one-fifth of Americans and account for at least 10 per cent of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. "Today’s announcement by the president leaves the full responsibility of climate action on states and cities throughout our nation,” they said. “While the president’s actions are a shameful rebuke to the work needed to protect our planet for our children and grandchildren, states have been and will continue to step up.” Since then, others have joined in. As many as 61 other mayors of cities - from New York City in the east to Seattle in the west - have since also committed to upholding the country’s commitments in the Paris Agreement. The pact’s signatories, and especially those most affected by climate change will hope that they do. There is even promise that the private sector and American business will step up. In the lead-up to Trump’s announcement, 25 companies ranging from Apple, Facebook and Google to Unilever and Intel appealed to the Administration, in the belief that the US “can best exercise global leadership and advance US interests by remaining a full partner” in the global fight against climate change. Now that the deed is done, it will still be in their interest to continue to build climate resilience and invest in green technology. It is a simple business imperative. Domestically, therefore, there is hope that others will step up, as the federal government has stepped away. Internationally, the United States government has now stepped away from 193 other countries who had come together in historically unprecedented common cause. The agreement to start negotiations on a new global climate agreement was hard-won in 2011, and through years of hard work by governments, business and NGOs, the deal was finally sealed in Paris in 2015. “So we’re getting out,” the US president said, about a deal that was perceived to be bad for the country, and probably better for the 193 others. “But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair.” There will be no such new deal. Many may decry America’s withdrawal, but governments will move on. In a rare common statement, the leaders of Italy, France and Germany said that the Paris Agreement “cannot be renegotiated”, deeming the momentum generated in Paris as “irreversible”. More pointedly, as the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) itself said, the “Paris Agreement remains a historic treaty signed by 194 and ratified by 147 counties. Therefore it cannot be renegotiated based on the request of a single Party.” Even if that one party is the United States of America. That one party also stepped away from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and 11 other countries in January. Again, these were hard, long-drawn negotiations that the 12 countries started in 2008. (Earlier negotiations among a smaller group, including Singapore, started even earlier in 2005.) But the 11 will move on, whether through a reformulation of what is on the TPP negotiating table, or with other partners in a separate forum, or both. In a joint statement from a meeting of the remaining 11 in May, trade ministers re-committed to bringing the TPP into force, and possibly even expanding, to include other economies into the club. DISPENSABLE OR NOT? It’s been all about making America great again. And indeed, in the eyes of many, moves to regain equity on the global arena, to correct instances where the US has paid more than its fair share, will make America great again. But the reality will be quite different for friends and foe looking in, for as far as its global engagement is concerned, the message is that if the United States is in – it may not necessarily be for long. And if it is out, life will go on; others can and will step in. This message therefore also has deeper implications on how the country sees itself, its role in the world and its foreign policy. Whether it was in the name of “American exceptionalism” or being an “indispensable nation” (the words of former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright), the conception of itself has always been wrapped up in its role in the world, which allowed past administrations to at least ostensibly conduct foreign policy as more than a transactional “What is in it for me, and how much?” It is clear now, that with its recent decisions, this is precisely the new normal in US foreign policy. With that, whether or not it even intended to be an exceptional or indispensable nation, making America “great” at home could mean being unexceptional and possibly dispensable outside.   Source: CNA/ek Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail More stories for you More information about Channel News Asia jump to top of page Sections Asia Pacific Singapore World CNA Insider Business Sport Lifestyle Technology Health Commentary About Us About Channel NewsAsia Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Advertise with us Contact Sales Online Advertising TV Advertising Get the news that matters in your inbox every morning!

Rik Henderson2 June 2017Laptops Pocket-lint Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment A crowd-funded tablet/laptop hybrid might not usually catch the eye, but clearly Microsoft feels there's something special about the Eve V. It highlighted the relatively unknown product during its Computex keynote. This is especially significant considering it is broadly in the same market as Microsoft's own Surface Pro. We caught up with the developer to learn a little more about the unusual design process and a little about its ethos. And perhaps the most unusual aspect is the small company's determination to remain independent of any investors. The Eve project started off as an experiment in 2015 to see if an unknown PC/tablet brand could be successful, launching and selling its products online. Pocket-lint It originally made an 8-inch Windows tablet, the Eve T1. And after that sold reasonably well, a WhatsApp group formed with users giving feedback directly to its developers. This grew into a forum and the development team used consumer responses to find out what their fans wanted to see in a follow-up device. Best of Computex 2017: The top 5 tech products on show Computex 2017: All the announcements that matter Eve claims that the now 4,800-strong forum is a friendly and positive place for the most part, even though responding to all the issues can be time consuming. It still maintains some of the original WhatsApp groups too, growing the user-base so much the company has recently added a Community Manager to the team. This approach has led to a very interesting device. The community wanted USB-A, USB-C and Thunderbolt capability. The Eve therefore has two USB 3.0, one Thunderbolt-capable USB-C and a 3.5mm audio jack with dedicated audio amplifier. Straight off the bat it starts to become apparent how much attention Eve has spent on design. The ports are all geometrically aligned and to achieve this with the audio jack they had to put it in at a slant. That was expensive, but the overall effect is lovely. Pocket-lint The Bluetooth keyboard is another strong point. The whole thing is wrapped in soft, lightly-textured Contra Italian fabric. It looks stunning. The company also discovered that users wanted a keyboard they could use on the lap - to be used during presentations and so on. The pogo pin handles charging (for up to 16 hours of typing using Bluetooth 4.2). It's also an RGB backlit affair which looks great with the fabric cover. The community was very specific about the key travel they wanted: 1.2mm. There are some nice quirks too, such as the "Oops!" key and the V key being the Eve Logo (an inverted triangle). The developer asked the community what they preferred: thin and light with a smaller battery or thicker and heavier with a bigger battery? The community pumped for the latter and so it put in a very impressive 48Wh battery - the highest of any device in this form factor. There seemed to be some vagueness about how this translates to battery life but the dvelopers did mention they had watched the entire first season of Game of thrones on one charge. In terms of the CPU, the community – which is not made up of gamers – went for the Y series of Intel's Core i7 and Core i5. There are a couple of options for RAM – either 8GB or 16GB plus a 128, 256 or 512GB SSD. Cooling is handled through a copper heat sync and Intel heat pipes which dissipate the heat through the curved cushion style aluminium chassis. The developer says that this is how the Eve V running on a Core i5 outperforms an Asus Transformer 3 running Core i7. The choice of going for 8GB or 16GB RAM actually pushes up the licence costs from Microsoft but once again the developer fed that information back to the community and they made the call. Pocket-lint The community were also given an option of a better pen and an 'okay' screen or vive versa. They plumped for the latter so the Eve comes with 12.3-inch IGZO LCD (2763 x 1824, 450 nit) screen. It's covered in Gorilla Glass 3 and, again by request, has anti-reflection coating. Two-and-a-half thousand devices were snapped up on Indiegogo between November and mid-December 2016 with the first 500 devices being shipped to 84 different countries. Eve's largest market is the US, with the UK coming in third. The Finnish company has received support from Microsoft, Intel and the Finnish government. Its commitment to the project is clear, as is its determination to stay investor free. "We want to do cool stuff and have fun doing it, stay in control and never have to compromise on user experience," we were told by the development team. The Indiegogo version shipped from $699 (£621) to $1,399 for the community members that initially signed up. There's no word on the price for the higher spec'ed versions when they are on general release but the lower end should start at around $799.

Intel CEO Brian Krzanich believes self-driving cars will useful for not only hauling goods and bringing families to dinner, but also for surveillance work, the executive said on CNBC Thursday. Specifically, Krzanich thinks that autonomous cars could be put to use when children go missing or if police are searching for a specific car. "I always say that the cars are going to be out there looking, so the next time an Amber Alert comes up and they're looking for a license plate, the cars should be able to find that license plate quite rapidly," said Krzanich on CNBC.

REUTERS/Erik De Castro    Dozens Dead After Gunman Torches Philippine Resort Ryan Pickrell China/Asia Pacific Reporter 10:09 AM 06/02/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP Dozens of people perished at an entertainment resort in the Philippines Thursday after a gunman set fire to the facility. A heavily-armed male began firing off shots and setting casino tables on fire after entering Resorts World Manila in Pasay, a suburb on the southwest side of the capital. Thirty-seven people died of suffocation and smoke inhalation, and many others were injured in the resulting stampede, according to multiple reports. Casino security shot the gunman, who then barricaded himself in a room, set himself on fire, and shot himself. The suspect was a white, English-speaking male who reportedly attempted to flee with a bag full of casino chips, leading authorities to call the attack a robbery. There are concerns that the fatal attack is linked to the Islamic State, but police are pushing back. “Don’t panic, this is not a cause for alarm. We cannot attribute this to terrorism,” Philippine National Police (PNP) Chief Director-General Ronald dela Rosa said Thursday evening.  The SITE Intel Group, which monitors jihadi activity worldwide, revealed that an ISIS operative in the Philippines had said that the group was responsible for the attack. “We are looking into a robbery angle because he did not hurt any people and went straight to the casino chips storage room, Dela Rosa told reporters, “He parked at the second floor and barged into the casino, shooting large TV screens and poured gasoline on a table setting it on fire.” The PNP chief said that a terrorist would have opened fire on guests, but that did not occur in this case, thus reinforcing the robbery angle. The gunmen reportedly tried to make off with about $2.6 million in casino chips. While authorities argue that there are no indications that the attack was an act of terrorism, ISIS claimed responsibility Friday for the assault on the resort on its Amaq News Agency, according to the Site Intel Group. ISIS identified the attacker as Abu Khair al Luzonee. 1) Breaking: ISIS’ Amaq claimed attack @ Resort World #Manila , #Philippines was carried out by #ISIS fighters according to its source pic.twitter.com/W1n9673y5T — Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) June 2, 2017 ISIS’ official Nashir channel has also claimed responsibility for the attack. Authorities suggest that the terrorist group may be claiming responsibility for propaganda purposes, but there could be more to the attack that has yet to come to light.

Smith II (@MichaelSSmithII) June 2, 2017 The magazine also encouraged fighters to use fire to carry out terrorist attacks, noting that flammables are “a quick option for anyone intending to join the just terror campaign.” Police are still investigating.

We may also see refreshes to the MacBook, MacBook Pro, a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro and more. Apple's also said to unveil a new Siri-powered smart speaker. Todd Haselton | @robotodd 17 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Here's what to expect from Apple's big event next week    13 Hours Ago | 01:15 Apple's going to have a lot of big news to share next week. The company's developer conference, known as WWDC, kicks off with a keynote on Monday at 10 a.m. PST, when we expect Apple to discuss new hardware and software. This is the time of year when Apple typically unveils new software that will power its upcoming Macs, iPhones and iPads — but we may also get a taste of new products we've never seen before. iOS 11 and macOS Todd Haselton | CNBC CNBC: iPhone-clean It's almost a certain that Apple will reveal its new iOS 11 operating system ahead of its new iPhone launch later this fall. The tech giant typically unveils the fresh version of iOS during WWDC and then runs it through developer testing to around September when it pushes it out for everyone to use. Little is known about what Apple will include in iOS 11, but we're hoping to see improvements to Siri, which has started to lag behind competitors like Google Assistant and even Amazon Alexa. Apple will also likely unveil the next version of macOS. The current version, macOS Sierra, was introduced last year when Apple officially departed from the "OS X" moniker for its operating system. Again, like iOS 11, we're not quite sure what to expect in terms of new features just yet. I hope to at least see Siri play an even deeper role in the desktop operating system, too, with more new controls that could make it easier to manage your Mac with voice. Those two, the iOS and macOS updates, are the safest bets. Now let's talk a bit about hardware, which may or may not happen. MacBook and MacBook Pro refreshes Stephen Lam | Getty Images An Apple employee points to the Touch Bar on a new Apple MacBook Pro laptop Apple's MacBooks are overdue for a refresh to Intel's latest seventh-generation processors, which are already in machines from PC makers. We should see Apple update the MacBook Pro, the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and the thin-and-light MacBook with the new chips, Bloomberg said earlier this month. We might even see the MacBook Air updated with the new chips, though that computer is showing its age with an old display and ports that aren't as fast as newer ones. Apple may just kill it off entirely. Also, Apple's iMac and Mac Pro desktop computers are desperately in need of a refresh. Apple has said it'll refresh the Mac Pro, but I don't think we'll see it next week. New 10.5-inch iPad Pro and refreshed 12.9-inch iPad Pro Todd Haselton | CNBC Supply chain reports have long suggested Apple is working to build a 10.5-inch iPad Pro that would replace the existing 9.7-inch iPad Pro. It's the first time Apple has ever launched a 10.5-inch iPad Pro, so we'll be curious to hear what the company's argument is for boosting the size. Apple is also expected to announce a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro, replacing last year's model. Expect more powerful graphics, faster processors and maybe even redesigns where the screen takes up more space on the front of the iPad. I wouldn't be surprised if Apple talked about the Apple Pencil, too, perhaps with a refresh to a newer model. A Siri smart speaker Todd Haselton | CNBC The big news could be Apple's entrance into the smart home assistant market. Bloomberg said earlier this week that Apple may unveil a new smart home speaker that's powered by Siri and will compete with Google Home and Amazon Alexa. The speaker will reportedly offer surround-sound effects and better audio than the Echo or Home, which suggests it may also be more expensive. Part of me is hoping it'll sound as good as a Sonos Play:1 speaker. Unlike Google and Amazon, however, Siri doesn't really allow for ordering of goods or support for playing tunes through third-party music applications like Spotify. I'm curious to see how Apple will position this if it's locked down to the Apple ecosystem of products, like Apple Music. tvOS, webOS, watchOS, HomeKit and HealthKit Apple Given the software focus of a developer conference, Apple may dive into a variety of other topics including its smart home platform HomeKit, its health platform HealthKit, tvOS for the Apple TV, watchOS for the Apple Watch and maybe a bit on Apple CarPlay. Speaking of the Apple TV, Apple has been reportedly trying to establish streaming TV deals for a while now, but I'd be surprised if anything came to fruition next week. Finally, my guess is we'll hear a bit more about original content, like Apple's first shows "Carpool Karaoke" and "Planet of the Apps." No iPhones Regis Duvignau | Reuters Finally, if you're hoping for new iPhones, you'll need to wait a few more months. Apple will probably stick to its regular schedule of launching new iPhones in September.

Image: Timofeev Vladimir/Shutterstock It was a busy week for IoT technologies, with Russia preparing its networks for quantum computer hacks through blockchain. Earlier this week, Irish forestry organisation Coillte revealed its latest effort to get into the ‘internet of trees’ space following a €1.2m deal with the European Space Agency to roll out a tree growth analytics system, including a unique tree sensor device. When operational, the sensors will create a kind of mesh network that maps out a digital forest. The resulting data will be transmitted via satellite to provide real-time analytics for forest managers. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic Ocean, Android co-founder Andy Rubin was discussing the prevalence of smart home assistants on the market, and how they are creating a disjointed ecosystem. Rubin was speaking as part of the launch of Android’s new Essential Home device and a new open source, smart assistant operating system called Ambient OS. “All of these [companies] have ecosystem envy and want to create their own ecosystem,” Rubin said. “But consumers don’t want just Samsung stuff in their house. They want diversity.” World’s first unhackable blockchain for quantum computers The fields of blockchain and quantum computing are fascinating and complex in their own regard, but new research from Russia claims that a merger between the two could be very interesting. According to the International Business Times, a team from the Russian Quantum Center in Moscow has developed quantum blockchain technology that would prevent any hacker from accessing connections, despite the computing technology still being experimental. As has been explained before, blockchain is the technology that makes a transaction of currency or information traceable and transparent to both parties and, by its nature, is supposed to be incredibly secure. However, when quantum computers enter the mainstream, this might not be the case as their incredible processing power would be able to crack any encryption. “Parties that communicate via a quantum channel can be completely sure that they are talking to each other, not anybody else,” said Alexander Lvovsky, group lead of the research. “This is the main idea. Then we had to reinvent the entire blockchain architecture to ‘fit’ our new authentication technology, thereby making this architecture immune to quantum computer attacks.” Tekelek signs $1.4m deal on Canada trade mission Earlier this week (29 May), Enterprise Ireland held a trade mission in Canada with a focus on IoT, led by Minister Sean Canney, TD. The biggest success at the event was with Clare-based Tekelek, which signed a $1.4m deal with PayGo, a company that provides sensors for businesses to monitor fuel consumption remotely and make changes where necessary. As part of the deal, Tekelek will begin developing an intrinsically safe sensor to facilitate the expansion of PayGo’s service offering in the US and Canadian markets. Oliver McCarthy, general manager of Tekelek, said: “We’re very excited to apply this thinking and our technology to the industrial fuels marketplace, and we’re similarly pleased to partner with an organisation of PayGo’s calibre to bring our technologies to the North America market.” Dublin tests smart solutions to address city flooding Dublin City Council’s (DCC) Smart Dublin initiative has announced a partnership with the Connect Centre and Intel to deploy low-cost sensors across the capital to monitor rainfall, weather conditions and river levels. The new sensors will communicate data wirelessly to DCC’s operations team, which will analyse water levels and use Connect’s Pervasive Nation IoT network to provide city authorities with an early warning of potential flooding. Jamie Cudden, DCC’s Smart City programme manager, said: “Dublin is emerging as a leading location for smart city and IoT innovations. “Intel’s Dublin Living Lab programme has already carried out some initial flood monitoring activity across the city, which has led to the prototyping of a set of river and rainfall sensors.” New autonomous car test method could cut costs by 99.9pc Autonomous cars are gradually heading onto our open roads, albeit with a driver behind the wheel to make sure everything goes OK during the trials. Now, a new method of testing these cars developed by the University of Michigan may have found a way to drastically cut the amount of time it could take to make them road-legal. Developed using data from more than 40m km of driving in the real world, a team of researchers believes that they can save 99.9pc of the testing time and costs with their system. The evaluation process breaks down typical driving situations into components that can be tested or simulated over and over again, exposing autonomous vehicles to a condensed set of the most challenging driving situations. This, the researchers argue, means that 1,600km of testing would equate to 1.6m km in real-world testing, but, in order to make the public feel safe being in these vehicles, as much as 20bn km of testing will need to be done. The team’s white paper is published here. Want stories like this and more direct to your inbox? Sign up for Tech Trends, Silicon Republic’s weekly digest of need-to-know tech news.

Moore’s Law, named after Intel cofounder Gordon Moore, reflects his observation in 1965 that transistors were shrinking so fast that every year twice as many could fit onto the same surface of a semiconductor. In 1975, the pace shifted to a doubling every two years. The enablers of an architectural advance every generation — increasing the size of pipelines, using superscalar tweaks and speculative execution — are among the techniques that are now lagging in the effort to keep pace with the expected 50 percent increase in transistor density each year, Huang told a gathering of reporters and analysts at the Computex show in Taipei.

AMD Begins Cutting Prices On Ryzen CPUs Written by Michael Larabel in AMD on 2 June 2017 at 06:33 AM EDT. 28 Comments If you have been waiting to pick up an AMD Ryzen CPU until the prices drop, they are beginning to do so. It's not clear if they are permanent price cuts, but likely so, given these drops come just days after Intel announced its new high-core competition with the Core-X Series that will be shipping in June. The price cuts so far entail the Ryzen 7 1800X dropping from $499.99 USD to $459 (or $439 at Amazon), the Ryzen 7 1700X from $399 to $349 and the Ryzen 7 1700 from $329 to $314 (or at Amazon is now $299). These are some pretty nice discounts considering the Ryzen 7 CPUs still appear to be selling well and are still some competitive offerings. The Ryzen 5 CPUs haven't received much in the way of a price adjustment yet. The marked-down Ryzen 7 CPUs can be found at Amazon.com and NewEgg. If now picking up a Ryzen 7 processor from either shop, we kindly ask you use our affiliate links above as a portion of the sale then goes on to support Phoronix and our Linux hardware testing operations.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Smartphones Cybersecurity Innovation Social Media Games Motoring Technology From Apple to IBM: How the world's biggest tech firms reacted to Trump's climate deal exit Zuckerberg, Dorsey, Musk and Cook join the high-profile names to slam US president's decision. By Jason Murdock June 2, 2017 12:06 BST Close Donald Trump announces withdrawal from Paris Climate Accord: 'We're getting out' IBT On 1 June, US president Donald Trump confirmed the worst fears of many United Nations countries, businesses, scientists and technologists: he was pulling out of a landmark deal designed to reduce carbon emissions, mitigate the effects of global warning and generally save planet Earth. Trump said he wanted to renegotiate the terms of the agreement and said the previous deal had resulted in "draconian financial and economic burdens" on the US. Critics, including high-profile technology executives, are now speaking out against the seemingly unpopular decision. In an open letter to the president, 25 firms, including tech giants Adobe, Apple, Google, Facebook, HPE, Intel and Microsoft, had begged Trump to leave the deal intact. "Continued US participation in the agreement benefits US businesses and the US economy," it read. Ultimately, he ignored the warnings of the many. "As someone who cares deeply about the environment, which I do, I cannot in good conscience support a deal that punishes the United States, which is what it does," Trump said in his speech announcing the country's exit. As the dust settled, social media erupted with activity and, behind the scenes, some tech bosses were issuing internal letters to employees. From Apple to Microsoft, a pattern of condemnation emerged. Here is a list of the initial reactions from the biggest technology firms operating today. Tim Cook: "I know many of you share my disappointment." Apple CEO Tim Cook tweeted on 1 June: "Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet. Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver." In a more descriptive separate letter to employees, obtained by Axios, Cook wrote: "Climate change is real and we all share a responsibility to fight it. I want to reassure you that today's developments will have no impact on Apple's efforts to protect the environment." "I know many of you share my disappointment with the White House's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement. I spoke with President Trump on Tuesday and tried to persuade him to keep the US in the agreement. But it wasn't enough. "We're going to keep working with our suppliers to help them do more to power their businesses with clean energy [...] knowing the good work that we and countless others around the world are doing, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about our planet's future." Pictured (L/R): Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg, Tesla and SpaceX boss Elon Musk. Each voiced criticism of Paris Accord exit. Credit (L/R): Bernd Thissen/AFP/Getty Images, Reuters Microsoft: "Disappointed with today's decision." Microsoft's president and chief legal officer Brad Smith, known for his lengthy blog posts published via LinkedIn, did not refrain from the topic of climate change. "[The deal] creates new markets for innovative clean technologies, from green power to smart grids to cloud-enabled solutions. And by strengthening global action over time, the Agreement reduces future climate damage to people and organisations around the world. "We are disappointed with today's decision by the White House to withdraw the United States from the landmark, globally supported Paris Agreement on climate change. "We remain steadfastly committed to the sustainability, carbon and energy goals that we have set as a company and to the Paris Agreement's ultimate success. Our experience shows us [...] investments and innovations are good for our planet, our company, our customers and the economy." Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, added on Twitter: "We believe climate change is an urgent issue that demands global action. We remain committed to doing our part." You can read the full Microsoft statement here. IBM: "It is easier to lead outcomes by being at the table." Unlike its competitors, IBM has chosen to remain at the side of the Trump administration through tough times. Now, it has condemned the decision to abandon the Paris Accord but yet again has declined to use the moment to criticise the US government – a potentially huge customer. In a statement, it said: "Climate change is an international problem that requires an international solution, and we believe it is important for the world to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore IBM supported — and still supports — US participation in the Paris Agreement. "This agreement requires all participating countries to put forward their best efforts on climate change as determined by each country. IBM believes that it is easier to lead outcomes by being at the table, as a participant in the agreement, rather than from outside it." Other executives issued shorter statements via social media. Here is the run-down: Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook: "Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children's future at risk. "For our part, we've committed that every new data centre we build will be powered by 100% renewable energy. Stopping climate change is something we can only do as a global community, and we have to act together before it's too late." Jack Dorsey, Twitter: "This is an incredibly shortsighted move backwards by the federal government. We're all on this planet together and we need to work together." Sundar Pichai, Google: "Disappointed with today's decision. Google will keep working hard for a cleaner, more prosperous future for all." Elon Musk, Tesla & SpaceX: "Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world. I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH [White House] & via councils, that we remain." Amazon: "Amazon continues to support the Paris climate agreement and action on climate change. We believe that robust clean energy and climate policies can support American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth. We remain committed to putting our scale and inventive culture to work in ways that are good for the environment and our customers." This list will be updated as more comments and statements are released. Trump has a long and established history of climate change denial. In one tweet from 2012, he said: "The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive." More recently, in a 2015 interview, he noted: "I believe in clean air. Immaculate air...But I don't believe in climate change." The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012 @realDonaldTrump The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the leading climate change body, has said: "Warming [...] is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice and rising global average sea level."

Image: VanderWolf Images/Shutterstock A new report into the potential for the autonomous vehicles sector has predicted that by 2050, a ‘passenger economy’ could develop, worth $7trn. We’ve heard plenty over the past few years about the ‘sharing economy’ with the growth of companies such as Uber and Airbnb, but, in the decades to come, we will all be talking about a ‘passenger economy’. That is the opinion of Intel, which has just released a new study looking at the long-term economic effects of a society in which driving is being handed over to autonomous vehicles. It is believed that a new passenger economy will develop, which could be worth as much as $800bn by 2035, and even a staggering $7trn by 2050. Of that latter number, the area of mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) will dominate, with a value of $3.7trn – or 55pc of the economy – as people ditch their cars in favour of ride-hailing services. Such a trend was predicted in a report last month, which warned that the US car industry could totally collapse by 2030 if self-driving cars became mainstream. Meanwhile, business use of MaaS through package delivery and freight delivery will be worth approximately $3trn. Finally, the remaining $203bn will comprise other uses for autonomous driving, such as hospitality and tourism, with additional options for healthcare and entertainment. On-board salons? Some other interesting financial estimates suggest that a fully functional world of autonomous vehicles would save $234bn between 2035 and 2045 in public safety costs related to traffic accidents, saving half a million lives. With 250m hours of commuting time cut each year as a result, suggestions for advertisers to fill the gap include location-based advertising on the road, custom commuting movies and even on-board beauty salons. “Companies should start thinking about their autonomous strategy now,” said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. “Less than a decade ago, no one was talking about the potential of a soon-to-emerge app or sharing economy because no one saw it coming.” Peugeot autonomous car concept.

ADVERTISE SUBSCRIBE CONTACT ABOUT COMPANIES Tech giants in uproar as Trump pulls US out of Paris climate agreement by John Kennedy 1 hour ago1 Share US president Donald Trump. Image: akatz/Shutterstock In a move that will reset efforts to save the planet, US president Donald Trump has announced he will withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement. Tech leaders have responded in shock to US president Donald Trump’s retrograde decision to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement on combatting climate change. The decision to take the US out of the pivotal global accord has prompted Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to pull out of presidential councils that he was involved in. ‘Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy and it puts our children’s future at risk’ – MARK ZUCKERBERG Top Silicon Valley leaders, including Salesforce’s Marc Benioff and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, have urged the president to reconsider his actions. Yesterday, on the White House Lawn, Trump announced: “We’re getting out.” He described the agreement as draconian, claiming that it placed unfair financial and economic burdens on the US. “In order to fulfil my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord,” he confirmed. Trump said the US would begin negotiations to re-enter either the Paris Agreement or a “new transaction” on terms more advantageous to the country. The Paris Agreement is a global action plan by nearly 200 countries to work together on what is arguably the biggest issue endangering life on Earth: global warming. The end of the world as we know it? Tech giants from Apple to Facebook have made environmental protection their top stated goals, using renewable energy to power offices, stores and data centres. In response to Trump’s announcement, 25 tech companies including Adobe, Apple, Salesforce and Intel took out newspaper ads urging the US president to reconsider. In a letter signed by the 25 companies, they said: “Continued US participation in the agreement benefits US businesses and the US economy in many ways. “US business is best served by a stable and practical framework facilitating an effective and balanced global response.” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg implored Trump not to walk away from the accord: “Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy and it puts our children’s future at risk. For our part, we’ve committed that every new data centre we build will be powered by 100pc renewable energy. “Stopping climate change is something we can only do as a global community, and we have to act together before it’s too late.” The March for Science group, an organisation set up to defend science integrity at a time when politicians are attempting to discredit scientists, also decried Trump’s decision. “Science was ignored today. The decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement stands in stark opposition to the overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change is a real and active threat to communities around the world and to future generations. The group said that the decision is out of step with the views of the majority of Americans in all 50 states who support US actions in this field, and surrenders the role of America as a leader in the fight against climate change. It warns that vulnerable communities will suffer disproportionately in the face of US inaction. “In addition, the fact that this decision was made without the input of a presidential science adviser – a position that, like most of the key scientific leadership positions in the administration, remains unfilled – is deeply troubling to all those who care about the role of science in informing policy.” In Ireland, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment Denis Naughten, TD, hit out at Trump’s decision. “We are all vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and we all have a responsibility to address climate change within our respective capabilities,” Naughten said. “I am therefore extremely disappointed and concerned that the United States has decided to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. “The previously strong ambition shown by the United States played a major role in mobilising global ambition and achieving the agreement reached by 195 parties in Paris in 2015. “This is a major setback for the international community and it is essential that the decision of the United States does not weaken global resolve,” Naughten said. Tech leaders such as Benioff, Apple’s Tim Cook, Twitter’s Jack Dorsey, Google’s Sundar Pichai and others also spoke out on Twitter against Trump’s decision. Here are some of their reactions: Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2017 Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet. Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver. — Tim Cook (@tim_cook) June 2, 2017 We believe climate change is an urgent issue that demands global action. We remain committed to doing our part. https://t.co/Gfu7P2ESlL — Satya Nadella (@satyanadella) June 1, 2017 Disappointed with today’s decision. Google will keep working hard for a cleaner, more prosperous future for all. — Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) June 1, 2017 Deeply disappointed by President's decision to withdraw from ParisAgreement. We will double our efforts to fight climate change. pic.twitter.com/cmCLf9CoVY — Marc Benioff (@Benioff) June 1, 2017 This is an incredibly shortsighted move backwards by the federal government.

Tesla-Gründer Musk will Trump nicht mehr beraten Quelle: N24 AUTOPLAY Zahlreiche US-Konzerne haben sich bereits seit Jahren dem Klimaschutz verpflichtet. Tesla-Chef Elon Musk drohte nun im Falle eines Ausstiegs mit seinem Rückzug aus Beratergremien der Regierung. Quelle: N24 „Ein Rückschlag für die Führungsrolle der USA in der Welt“: Wenn der Goldman-Sachs-Chef seinen ersten Tweet absetzt, muss die Lage ernst sein. Und Blankfein ist bei Weitem nicht der Einzige, der Trumps Klima-Entscheidung hart kritisiert. Comment 0 Kommentare Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Anzeige Hunderte US-Unternehmen haben in einem offenen Brief US-Präsident Donald Trump für seine Entscheidung kritisiert, sich aus dem Pariser Klimaabkommen zurückzuziehen. Technologiefirmen wie Intel, Hewlett-Packard und Tesla sowie große Lebensmittelkonzerne und Kleidungsunternehmen unterzeichneten den Brief. Die Firmen unterstrichen, sie fühlten sich dem Klimaschutz weiterhin „zutiefst verpflichtet“. Ihr Ziel sei eine energieeffiziente und wenig Treibhausgase ausstoßende US-Wirtschaft. „Kosteneffiziente und innovative Lösungen können uns dabei helfen, diese Ziele zu erreichen“, heißt es in dem Brief. „Sich vom Ziel einer emissionsarmen Wirtschaft zu verabschieden, setzt den amerikanischen Wohlstand aufs Spiel.“ „Der Klimawandel ist real“ Anzeige Zuvor hatten der Chef des Unterhaltungskonzerns Walt Disney, Robert Iger, und Tesla-Chef Elon Musk ihre Tätigkeit als Berater Trumps beendet. „Aus Prinzip bin ich nach dem #ParisAgreement-Rückzug aus dem Beraterkreis des Präsidenten ausgeschieden“, schrieb Iger auf Twitter. Musk ließ mitteilen, er habe „keine andere Wahl“, als seine Beratertätigkeit zu beenden. „Der Klimawandel ist real“, schrieb er auf Twitter. Aus dem Abkommen auszusteigen sei weder für die USA noch für die Welt gut. Goldman-Sachs-Chef Lloyd Blankfein schrieb seinen ersten Tweet überhaupt: „Die heutige Entscheidung ist ein Rückschlag für die Umwelt und für die Führungsrolle der USA in der Welt.“ Anzeige Facebook-Gründer Mark Zuckerberg schrieb in dem sozialen Netzwerk, der Austritt aus dem Klimaabkommen sei „schlecht für die Umwelt, schlecht für die Wirtschaft und riskiert die Zukunft unserer Kinder“. Der größte US-Autohersteller General Motors erklärte, das Unternehmen würde weiter daran festhalten, eine bessere Umwelt zu schaffen. Auch US-Autobauer Ford beteuerte Engagement für den Umweltschutz. Trump löst Wahlkampfversprechen ein Trump hatte zuvor den Ausstieg der weltgrößten Volkswirtschaft aus dem Pariser Klimaabkommen bekannt gegeben und dies damit begründet, amerikanische Interessen an die erste Stelle zu setzen. Man wolle nun sofort mit Verhandlungen für ein besseres Abkommen beginnen, sagte Trump. Lesen Sie auch Donald Trump „Die anderen Länder lachen über Amerika. Sie werden aufhören“ Das jetzige Abkommen lade die Kosten bei den amerikanischen Bürgern ab, sagte Trump. Es müsse klar sein, dass ein neuer Vertrag besser für die amerikanischen Arbeiter sei. „Der Rückzug liegt im ökonomischen Interesse und wird für das Klima keine Rolle spielen.“ Der Republikaner löst damit ein zentrales Wahlkampfversprechen ein und setzt seine harte Linie unter der Devise „Amerika zuerst“ fort. Er hatte immer wieder beteuert, Arbeitsplätze in der Kohleindustrie erhalten und neue schaffen zu wollen. So verkündet Trump das Raus aus dem Klimaabkommen Das Video konnte nicht abgespielt werden. Bitte versuchen Sie es später noch einmal. Donald Trump hat den Ausstieg aus dem Pariser Klimaabkommen verkündet. Gleichzeitig kündigte er an, in neue Verhandlungen treten zu wollen.

Is this the future of travel? The Pal-V flying car; available from next year Credit: Pal-V Jonny Cooper 2 June 2017 • 6:00am Regular visitors to the Goodwood Festival of Speed speak of a certain tang in the air. The annual four-day event sees a fleet of classic race cars and modern supermachines take it in turns to compete up the festival’s ‘Hillclimb’, a 1.16- mile track that winds its way through Lord March’s 11,500-acre estate. Intoxicating whiffs of throaty exhaust mingle with fresh, South Downs oxygen, creating a potion that’s joyfully inhaled by hundreds of thousands of spectators, who watch while soaking up the early summer sun. However, go down to Goodwood this year and you might be in for a surprise. In among all the combustion engines, there will be a collection of vehicles that call into question the future of mobility as we know it. Future Lab, an exhibition instigated by Lord March himself, promises to collate the big ideas that are jostling to shape the next generation of human travel, from driverless cars to hypersonic underground travel. The big players | Driverless cars It’s as though the ghosts of automobiles past and present are about to meet the spectre of what’s to come. What will the Goodwood air smell of in the future? ‘Driverless cars alone have the potential to completely change the way we travel,’ says Future Lab’s curator, Lucy Johnston. ‘And they’re closer than we think. 'In his most recent TED talk, Elon Musk (the entrepreneur who co-founded US carmaker Tesla) said that by the end of this year, an autonomous car will be able to leave a parking space in Los Angeles, navigate all the way across America, and park in a space in New York. If you promise that on the TED stage, you have to be pretty sure it’s going to happen.’ Indeed, driverless technology is a battleground for the world’s wealthiest companies, attracting eye-boggling investment from Silicon Valley and beyond. Name a big company and they’ve probably got a foot on the pedal: Uber and Volvo arguably lead the field, with a pilot scheme already running in Pittsburgh; Google has completed over two million miles of testing on public roads; Intel just sunk £12.5 billion into an autonomous-car tech company; Amazon is said to be looking at harnessing the cars for deliveries; and that’s before we’ve even mentioned the traditional car manufacturers – the BMWs and Audis, who all want a slice of the pie. Everyone went crazy when the Google car crashed into the bus, but if any human had driven that many miles, there would have been more accidentsJustin Cooke So it’s interesting that rather than use one of these big names to represent the future of driverless cars in her exhibition, Johnston has chosen the Robocar –  a madly futuristic, autonomous, electric car that was unveiled earlier this year by a British company of just 50 people. Robocar looks like a remote-controlled supercar that’s lost its top half: there’s no windscreen, no steering wheel, and nowhere for a human to sit. It can reach speeds of 200mph and is being tested on racetracks around the world – but spectators would be forgiven for struggling to identify Robocar as a car at all. And that, says Johnston, is part of the point. It forces spectators to appreciate the sheer capability of the technology. ‘When you first see Robocar, it spins you out  a bit. You realise the future is now real. We read a lot about driverless cars by companies such as Google, but they still look like cars. There’s a seat for a driver to take control, so your brain doesn’t have trouble joining the dots. With Robocar, your brain really does freak out – in a good way!’ The Robocar is seatless, driverless and can reach speeds of up to 200mph Credit: Benedict Redgrove    Johnston is confronting a problem that the driverless car industry knows only too well: that the computer technology for these vehicles is far ahead of our readiness to accept them into our lives. Elon Musk may be ready to send a car across America with no driver, but that doesn’t stop the idea sending a shiver down our collective spine. Which is why stories about driverless crashes, like the one between a Google car and a human-driven bus last year, travel so fast around the internet. We want to see the devil in computer-controlled cars, rather than the detail. ‘Everyone went crazy when the Google car crashed into the bus, but the reality is that it was the first crash after millions of miles of testing,’ says Justin Cooke, chief marketing officer of Kinetik, the company behind Robocar. ‘If any human had driven that many miles, there would have been more accidents.’ Other challenges include a game of chicken, where two Robocars speed towards a central line and have to stop as close to it as possible without hitting one another To help bridge this trust gap, Kinetik will next year launch Roborace, a competition designed to showcase its car’s capabilities, with teams of programmers striving to devise the most effective software and then running Robocar in front of spectators. In theory, Roborace will be to the driverless car what F1 is to the manual car: the supreme testing ground for technology that will ultimately trickle down to the consumer. Only in this instance, speed isn’t necessarily of the essence. ‘Roborace isn’t going to be your traditional race,’ explains Cooke. ‘Safety is top of the agenda for this technology, so we’re looking at setting tasks. Maybe the car has to reach 200kmh [125mph], then stop perfectly in a box.’ cars Goodwood 75MM gallery puff Other challenges being discussed include a game of chicken, where two Robocars speed towards a central line and have to stop as close to it as possible without hitting one another, and the introduction of robotic dogs on the racetrack – an idea borne from a testing session in February, when a real-life dog ran out on to the track and the Robocar swerved to avoid it. Roborace promises entertainment, but that’s not to say its real-world application is anything less than extraordinarily serious. With the hardware (the driverless cars themselves) already able to navigate city spaces and improving daily, an algorithm that can safely and efficiently control an entire car network has become the holy grail of autonomous transport. Find it, and the 97 per cent of accidents on our roads that are caused by human error disappear (Cooke says that, by comparison, a computer’s margin for error is ‘0.000something’). The HyperLoop ‘train’, funded by Tesla’s Elon Musk, proposes near-supersonic ‘tube’ travel  Credit: Hyperloop So too do traffic lights – instead, the computer can sort the most efficient flow of cars at any junction. No more sitting at red lights; no more slowing down as other drivers rubberneck a crash. The social implications are as startling. While some of us would regain the time we currently spend behind the wheel, others would lose their jobs. Estimates suggest there are around 400,000 HGV drivers in the UK alone; in the US, driving a vehicle is the most common job in 29 of the 50 states. All would face redundancy in the driverless epoch. We can also expect the face of our towns and cities to change significantly. The average car currently spends 95 per cent of its time parked in a drive or by the side of the road; that gets flipped on its head in a connected, autonomous system, where your next ride can be summoned at the touch of a button (much like Uber now, so you can see why it is keen to invest). How do Uber self driving / driverless cars work? ‘You’d only need main roads,’ says Cooke. ‘All those side streets running off B roads, where we currently park our cars, could be gardens for families. Kids could grow up in air that has more oxygen.’ Combine all this with advances in manufacturing techniques – 3D printing offers an alternative to the traditional production line – and Johnston thinks it’s no exaggeration to say that we could be looking at the next industrial revolution. However, she’s adamant that we shouldn’t be scared by the speed at which tech develops. ‘When people spell out the doom and gloom, that robots and AI are going to replace humans, I always say: “Yes, but it will also produce more roles in other places that don’t yet exist.” When Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the web, we didn’t know that 20 years later one of the biggest industries in Britain would be digital design. We’re humans. We think creatively and we’re good at adapting.’ Italdesign and Airbus unveil Pop.Up  Credit: Airbus The obvious question that hangs over all this is: when? When will our trust of driverless cars catch up with their potential? Cooke suggests we could see an autonomous network within the next five years. Design company Italdesign, at Goodwood to show off its concept of detachable travel pods that use engines on the ground and propellers to fly through the air, says the radical vision could become reality within 10 years. Embrace the technology and it seems the possibilities become endless. But are we really so close to taking the handbrake off the future of travel? Transport entrepreneur Robert Dingemanse is sceptical. ‘Some of the concepts we see in transport were there in the 1930s. Of course, we’ve improved the concept since then, but making something safe and accepted by regulators is another thing.’ Tech trends | An acceleration in driverless cars He cites the example of two relatively minor regulation changes for three-wheeled vehicles in Europe, which were first discussed in 2002, agreed in 2011, and are yet to be fully implemented. ‘These things move in decades, not years.’ Dingemanse’s own project is Pal-V, a flying car that can reach 112mph on the ground and in the air, and will be commercially available next year (pre-orders start around £260,000, in case you’re wondering). It’s one of a handful of exhibits at Future Lab that look to use the ‘Third Dimension’ of travel – away from flat, congested roads and up into the air or down into the ground, where space isn’t at a premium. Pal-V is perhaps the most easy to understand: a small gyro plane-cum-car that will offer rural communities and the super-wealthy an efficient way to travel from door-to-door. The quickest way to travel a mile At the loopier end is HyperLoop, a Musk-funded project that’s trying to shoot capsules of people through tunnels at near-supersonic speeds. If that one takes off, we’re looking at London to Manchester in 18 minutes flat. Does all this mean that the humble car as we know it is dead? Is that tang in the air above Goodwood soon to be a thing of the past? ‘Not at all,’ asserts Dingemanse. ‘We’re still driving cars that are 100 years old and it will be the same in 100 years’ time. Autonomous cars and flying cars and tunnels will offer different modalities, but people will still want to drive themselves. Humans like to determine their own destiny. That’s freedom.’  The Goodwood Festival of Speed runs from  29 June-2 July 2017   Share this article Follow Telegraph Science & Tech Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram Follow on Pinterest View comments If you would like to add a comment, please register or log in Register Log in Please review our commenting policy Follow Telegraph Science & Tech Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on Instagram Follow on Pinterest Related Topics Tesla Humans Driverless cars Amazon Flying cars Robotics Artificial Intelligence Luxury motoring BMW Elon Musk 3D Printing Space Goodwood Festival of Speed Volvo Roads Audi Google Race Uber Goodwood Fast cars Internet Motoring Show more Technology latest 03 Jun 2017, 3:09am A wizard idea?

The U.S. will join just two other nations—Syria and Nicaragua—left out of the agreement. The President isn’t just denying the scientific consensus on the direct links between greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. He is also ignoring calls by big business—including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Intel, Unilever, and many others—to remain in the agreement, who argued that participation benefits U.S. companies and the economy. Announcing his decision to pull out, Trump made reference to the voters who supported him in America’s coal country: “I was elected by the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.” The move is the latest in a series of decisions made by Trump since taking office that have been met with scathing criticism by the political left, the scientific community, and environmental activists, including his appointment of climate change denier Scott Pruitt to head the US Environmental Protection Agency and his recent budget that proposes deep cuts to numerous research agencies, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). While the Paris Agreement focuses on climate, it also notes that “it is important to ensure the integrity of all ecosystems, including oceans.” Greenhouse gas emissions and the rise in global temperatures are already having a devastating impact on the oceans and its inhabitants. With the change in seawater chemistry due to the uptake of carbon dioxide, the health of countless calcifying species from plankton to corals is at serious risk, while the increase in seawater temperature is causing catastrophic coral bleaching events which threaten the survival of the planet’s reef systems.

By Sean Portnoy for Laptops & Desktops | June 2, 2017 -- 02:16 GMT (19:16 PDT) | Topic: PCs Dell Inspiron Gaming Desktop PC gamers should be thrilled about the renewed interest that's being given to performance desktops, as AMD's Ryzen processors have been matched by Intel's new Core i9 and Core-X CPUs. While the high end is always claiming the most attention, most gaming isn't done by those who can afford $3,000 systems. Computex 2017 First 'Always Connected' Windows 10 on ARM PCs are coming from ASUS, HP, Lenovo Always Connected PC sounds great, but we'll have to wait Intel unveils monster 18-core Core i9: 'First teraflop-speed' consumer PC chip Intel i9 vs Ryzen ThreadRipper: Now AMD hits back with more on its 16-core beast AMD stakes its claim to the high ground Dell is hoping to cater to gamers whose wallets contain a more modest pile of cash with its new Inspiron gaming desktop, launched this week at Computex. The computer giant has long had its XPS line of high-performance desktops, and has previously rolled out an Inspiron gaming laptop (not to mention its Alienware lineup of boutique PCs). But this is the first time it's released a gaming-oriented desktop in its mainstream Inspiron family. AMD's new chips are the centerpiece of this Inspiron, but you won't see them in the base $599.99 configuration, according to The Verge. That's because that model will come with an AMD A10 processor, instead, along with 8GB of RAM, a terabyte hard drive, and a budget AMD Radeon RX560 graphics card. There will be plenty of opportunities to upgrade, as the Inspiron can handle up to 32 gigs of RAM, an SSD in additional to a hard drive, and better-performing processors and graphics cards. Those cards include ones that support virtual reality apps, such as the Radeon RX580 or the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060, and the chassis can support a second graphic card. Other options include liquid cooling that can be illuminated by the blue LED lighting that's included. One other advantage to choosing a Ryzen processor is that you get a USB Type-C port that an A10 configuration lacks. Dell's website says the Inspiron gaming desktop will be shipping starting on June 13. As with all Dell systems, you'll be able to customize it, so if you want some of the advantages from the new Ryzen chips, you'll have to pony up a bit extra.

The Wall Street Journal first reported this week the documentary, which was shelved in November, was to discredit Fethullah Gulen, the exiled cleric whom Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has accused of masterminding last year's coup attempt. Flynn Intel Group was paid by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin to "polish the country's image after a botched military coup," the Journal reported. Production of the documentary was underway as Flynn campaigned for President Donald Trump throughout the United States. The company's contract with the businessman has placed Flynn in legal jeopardy. The contract is drawing scrutiny by U.S. officials conducting several investigations into Flynn's business activities. Flynn, who resigned under pressure as Trump's national security adviser in February, failed to inform the federal government until March that his firm was paid to represent the Turkish government. Numerous probes into Flynn's activities Flynn is now the subject of criminal, congressional and military probes into allegations of improperly concealing his financial links to Turkey and Russia. Investigators are also trying to determine whether the alleged ties influenced Flynn's decisions as an advisor to Trump. The report said work on the documentary began last summer, shortly after the failed military coup in Turkey. It also said Flynn's company signed a three-month contract with Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin a few weeks later. Flynn Intel Group hired Rudi Bakhtiar, a former CNN anchor, former VICE News correspondent, and also a former correspondent for VOA's Persian Service, to do on-camera work for the documentary. Bakhtiar said she was given the impression the film would be an objective news documentary. David Enders, a former VICE News employee, told the Journal that the head of Flynn's company, Bijan Kian, attempted to conceal the company's role in the documentary's production. The latest disclosures about Flynn's work on behalf of Turkey comes as he is under investigation for any possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia to influence last year's U.S. presidential election.

June 03 2017 Fox Sports news.com.au Home 2017 National Elections National News World News Top Stories Sports Latest News Business Drum Editorial Yu Tok Bougainville World News Global diarrhoea deaths down by a third The number of children dying worldwide of diarrhoea fell by a third between 2005 and 2015, researchers have found. June 2, 2017 The number of children dying worldwide of diarrhoea fell by a third between 2005 and 2015, researchers have found. The Lancet study says better access to clean water and sanitation is key, with fewer weak and malnourished children becoming infected. New vaccines have also had a positive impact. However, diarrhoea is still the fourth-biggest killer of children globally, with almost 500,000 a year dying before their fifth birthday. This figure could well be a significant under-estimate because of the lack of data in sub-Saharan Africa, where most cases occur. Preventable and treatable Diarrhoea is also indirectly responsible for large numbers of deaths, through exacerbating the effects of other diseases, such as pneumonia and measles. The US researchers, who analysed data from the new Global Burden of Disease study, found well over a third (42%) of deaths happen in Nigeria and India. Diarrhoeal diseases, such as rotavirus and cholera, are spread by water contaminated with faeces. They are preventable and treatable. “Diarrhoeal diseases disproportionately affect young children,” said lead author Dr Ali Mokdad, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. “Despite some promising reductions in mortality, the devastating impact of these diseases cannot be overlooked.” Diarrhoea cases in 2015 2.39 billion episodes of diarrhoea Almost half of those (957.5 million) involved children. 1.3 million deaths Including 499,000 child deaths The highest death rates were in Chad and Niger Source: Lancet World Health Organization: Diarrhoea While deaths from diarrhoea have dropped by just over 20% overall, and 34% in children, the rate of infection has been falling far more slowly. For children it dropped by just over 10% between 2005 and 2015. Of all the diarrhoeal diseases, rotavirus remains the biggest killer of under-fives, according to this study. But death rates for the disease were down by 44% in 2015. The researchers attribute much of this to a relatively new vaccine. ‘Unacceptable’ “We’re encouraged to see fewer children dying of diarrhoea,” said Yael Velleman, senior policy analyst on health and hygiene at WaterAid. “But it is unacceptable that diarrhoea still claims the lives of nearly half a million children under five each year. “Up to 50% of under-nutrition is linked to chronic infection, diarrhoea and worm infestation caused by dirty water and poor hygiene.” She said those children’s life chances were limited by preventable illness – “all for the lack of conditions we have been taking for granted in the UK for over 100 years”.

By Tiernan Ray June 1, 2017 9:48 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Shares of automotive chip maker Mobileye (MBLY) today closed up 2 cents at $61.92, after the company this morning reported fiscal Q1 revenue and profit that topped analysts’ expectations, ahead of its purchase by Intel (INTC) for $15.3 billion, announced back in March. Revenue of $125 million topped the average $118 million estimate, and the EPS of 25 cents, excluding some costs, was also a penny better than expected. David Kelley with Jefferies & Co. writes that the results show the company making progress with autonomous driving in China: We believe ADAS market adoption is accelerating with noted robust Q1 China regional growth from industry peers. We believe MBLY's early mover advantage and REM positioning favor the leading auto technology supplier as a likely major player in the developing active safety market.  Tavis McCourt with Raymond James takes note of a couple of details in the report: Mobileye "sold just over 2 million EyeQ chips in the quarter, up more than 50%” from the prior-year period, and its "stated ASP [average selling price] per EyeQ chip was $45.10, up ~$0.90." And RBC Capital’s Joseph Spak notes the gross profit margin results, noting that the margin of 75.8% expanded by half a percentage point was 70 basis points better than he’d expected, 40 better than the Street. "Expanding gross margin performance impressive,” he writes, "considering the still robust y/y growth in the lower-margin Aftermarket business." Intel has said it expects the Mobileye deal to close nine months from the announcement, which should make it sometime this December.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 2 June 2017 | MYT 7:00 AM Microsoft pushes a mixed reality, connected future at Computex Matt Barlow, corporate vice president, Windows marketing; and Peter Han, vice president, partner devices and solutions show off mixed reality headsets from some of the world's leading PC companies at Computex 2017. — AFP Relaxnews At the annual tech extravaganza in Taipei, Microsoft is talking up headsets and the Internet of Things but, more importantly for consumers, how its close working relationship with most of the world's leading electronics firms is going to make these new technologies and devices an affordable reality for all.  "Our partner model is unique in the industry as we collaborate, end-to-end, from design, through all phases of the product lifecycle and across consumer and device channels," said Nick Parker, corporate vice president, consumer and device sales. "Together, we are building new experiences for customers, generating demand and ultimately, creating growth in existing and new categories including Mixed Reality, Internet of Things, and Always Connected PCs with Intel and Qualcomm." Until Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone, the only time most people encountered the term ‘ecosystem' was when flicking through a copy of National Geographic. However, today we all understand that no matter how good a digital device, unless it has a supporting ecosystem of services and companies, it is destined to become an also-ran. It's why the Windows operating system is the world's most popular but is also why Microsoft's phone business failed to find a wider market – no ecosystem of apps or accessories. So, when Microsoft's mixed reality headset and associated platform go live later this year, consumers will be able to buy in confidence as the likes of Acer, Dell, ASUS, HP and Lenovo are all going to support the technology and will be launching their own headsets before the end of 2017. Likewise, the world's biggest PC makers are committed to Microsoft's new always-connected PC category. These will be mobile computers that are always online via LTE/4G connectivity, that use the cloud for software and applications, and that will use processors developed in partnership with Intel and Qualcomm. They will have what the company describes as "a great battery life" and could for some prove an attractive, productivity-based alternative to a phablet or tablet. ASUS, HP, Lenovo, VAIO and Xiaomi have already confirmed that they'll be launching devices based on the concept. As for the Internet of Things, Microsoft's showcase at Computex was aimed at businesses and highlighting how it is already revolutionising the energy, manufacturing and retail sectors. — AFP Relaxnews Related Stories You May Be Interested Snapchat’s ‘Spectacles’ go on sale in Europe Ethiopia cuts off Internet after high school exam leaks Blame game for cyberattacks grows murkier as spying, crime tools mix Fretting over savings, Mrs Watanabe turns to bitcoin How to avoid dehydration during Ramadan Racing for a better tomorrow Others Also Read Outcry after elderly woman pulls hair off zoo camel’s coat and stuffs it in her handbag AirAsia warns of ticket scams Taman Senangin residents want the state to solve their flood woes quickly advertisement Latest News Why parents’ tech obsession may mean kids misbehave If a game key bargain looks too good to be true, it probably is Cost vs convenience: is it worth having your own printer?

He is right that the world is united: Nearly 200 countries back the 2015 Paris deal, with only Syria, Nicaragua and now the U.S. opting out. But fact checkers had a field day with Trump's justification: his claim (against all evidence to the contrary) that the treaty imposes “onerous energy restrictions” on the U.S. that would beget “lost jobs, lowered wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production.”  Nicaragua opted to stay out because it viewed the treaty's reliance on voluntary national pledges rather than binding greenhouse gas reduction targets as “a path to failure” that would allow human-caused global warming in this century to surpass the agreed limit of 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius. Trump said yesterday he would keep the U.S. in the Paris deal only if he can renegotiate it to be weaker still, though his language belied a lack of conviction. “If we can, that’s great. If we can’t, that's fine,” equivocated Trump. The President's retreat from one the great technological challenges of the 21st Century marked a sad day for America’s innovation leaders, and a breaking point for Elon Musk. The tech titan behind such fast-growing engineering powerhouses as Tesla Motors and SpaceX insisted on Tuesday that he had worked mightily, both directly with the President and through his membership on three Presidential economic councils, to convince Trump to stick with Paris. Within minutes of Trump’s speech yesterday, Musk tweeted that he was pulling himself from Team Trump: Here are three reasons why such resistance to the U.S. retreat from climate action makes sense: (1) Climate change science is solid and scary, (2) U.S. emissions are huge, and (3) ducking a global technological challenge is not in the interest of a technological powerhouse. Reasons (1) and (2) were left unacknowledged yesterday by both Trump and his EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt, who spoke briefly after the President. Scientists continue to struggle to specify precisely how much warming and disruption will result from a given atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. However, there is a very strong consensus that human activity is the primary force shifting Earth's climate. And those shifts come with myriad risks, including coastal flooding, aggravated international disputes, and acidified oceans.  There is similarly little debate left about America’s responsibility for the climate change threat facing the world community. The U.S. pumps out greenhouse gases at a rate second only to China, and remains the world’s biggest climate polluter historically thanks to CO2’s roughly 100-year atmospheric lifespan. U.S.-generated greenhouse gases caused one-fifth of the 1.1 degree C rise in global temperature since the Industrial Revolution, and the U.S. alone will likely warm the entire planet by an extra 0.5 C by 2100 if its emissions do not drop as pledged at Paris, according to modeling commissioned by the Associated Press.  Climate Change Explained: @AP Science Writer Seth Borenstein (@borenbears) breaks down the role of U.S. emissions in warming the planet. pic.twitter.com/WINlLCgsJA — The Associated Press (@AP) June 1, 2017 The third reason for forging on with Paris-level climate action, despite Trump's treaty rejection, centers around U.S. industries, which Donald Trump is counting on to create jobs. Globally-successful U.S.-based businesses—be they Silicon Valley startups or mainstays such as General Electric and Westinghouse — have science and engineering in their corporate DNA. Their leaders recoil at the notion that U.S. business can not compete in a global technology challenge such as the move towards low-carbon energy systems.  Hundreds of major corporations spoke out in recent months urging Trump to stay in Paris. ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods made a last ditch effort this week at the firm’s annual meeting, saying an orderly process for addressing climate change is in Exxon's best interest. Woods is facing pressure from global investors, who passed a resolution (over the board's objection) calling on Exxon to provide more disclosure on climate-related economic risks.  Many CEOs spoke up again yesterday in addition to Musk, including Apple's Tim Cook, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Google’s Sundar Pichai as well as Jeff Immelt, GE's chairman. Immelt tweeted: “Disappointed with today’s decision on the Paris Agreement. Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government.” Intel issued a statement saying, “Climate change is a real issue, and we firmly believe that the US should continue to participate in the Paris Climate Accord.” The statement said Trump's withdrawal would not change their investments in renewable energy, which are ramping up across corporate America. Intel is the top consumer of renewable energy in the U.S., securing 3.4 million megawatt-hours during a recent 12 month period—enough to meet 100 percent of its power needs according to EPA. Microsoft secured 3.3 million MWh, also meeting 100 percent of its power demand. Other companies including Apple, General Motors, and Wal-Mart are committed to reaching 100 percent renewable power through an alliance called the RE100. The median target date to hit 100 percent is 2024.  Outspoken attitudes and carbon-cutting action from companies such as GM and Wal-Mart show climate consciousness to be well ahead of what President Trump assumed in his discourse yesterday. Take Pittsburgh, which the President called out, declaring: “I was elected to serve the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.” But today's Pittsburgh is not the dirty-energy poster child in need of protection from global greenies that Trump evoked.   Pittsburgh's age of coal mines and spurting oilfields has given way to a hub of energy innovation (thanks to Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh). It is also a hotbed for natural gas production via the hydraulic fracturing technology, helping to supply the cheap and comparatively clean-burning fuel that is shuttering U.S. coal-fired power plants and trimming U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.  The city is working towards a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2023 (compared with 2003 levels). Mayor Bill Peduto made it clear yesterday that he did not welcome Trump’s shout out to his city, tweeting: “As the Mayor of Pittsburgh, I can assure you that we will follow the guidelines of the Paris Agreement for our people, our economy & future.”  Learn More smart grid renewable energy Paris Agreement climate change clean tech Paris Accord climate science demand response Donald Trump cleantech Comments Comment Policy Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a> Comments powered by Disqus Advertisement Energywise IEEE Spectrum’s energy, power, and green tech blog, featuring news and analysis about the future of energy, climate, and the smart grid.

In a sharply nationalistic address from the White House Rose Garden, Trump announced the United States would immediately stop implementing the “bad” 195-nation accord. “I cannot, in good conscience, support a deal that punishes the United States,” he said, decrying the “draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.” Trump repeatedly painted the pact — struck by his predecessor Barack Obama — as a deal that did not “put America first” and was too easy on economic rivals China, India and Europe. “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,” he said. “We don’t want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore. And they won’t be.” Trump offered no details about how, or when, a formal withdrawal would happen, and at one point suggested a renegotiation could take place. “We’re getting out but we’ll start to negotiate and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. And if we can, that’s great. And if we can’t, that’s fine,” he said. That idea was unceremoniously slapped down by furious allies in Europe, who joined figures from around the United States and the world in condemning the move. “The agreement cannot be renegotiated,” France, Germany and Italy said in a joint statement. – ‘Reject the future’ – The United States is the world’s second largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China, so Trump’s decision could seriously hamper efforts to cut emissions and limit global temperature increases. Amid Trump’s domestic critics was Obama, who said the United States was “joining a handful of nations that reject the future.” Nicaragua and Syria are the only countries not party to the Paris accord, the former seeing it as not ambitious enough and the latter being racked by a brutal civil war. Hillary Clinton, Trump’s opponent in last year’s White House race, called the decision to pull out a “historic mistake.” “The world is moving forward together on climate change. Paris withdrawal leaves American workers & families behind,” she said in a tweet. The Democratic governors of New York, California and Washington states formed a quick alliance, vowing to respect the standards agreed on under the Paris deal. In New York, some major buildings, like the World Trade Center and City Hall, were lit green in solidarity with the climate agreement, echoing a move in Paris. With much of the implementation of the accord taking place at the local level, the Paris accord’s supporters hope the deal will be in hibernation rather than killed off entirely. Trump’s decision is likely to play well with the Republican base, with the more immediate damage on the diplomatic front. The US president called his counterparts in Britain, Canada, France and Germany to explain his decision. But traditional US allies were uncharacteristically blunt in their condemnation of the move, which comes amid already strained relationships with the hard-charging president. Germany said the US was “harming” the entire planet, and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called the decision “seriously wrong.” – Reality TV-style – Ever the showman, the 70-year-old Trump had given his decision a reality TV-style tease, refusing to indicate his preference either way until his announcement. Opponents of withdrawal — said to include Trump’s daughter Ivanka — had warned that America’s leadership role on the world stage was at stake, along with the environment. A dozen large companies including oil major BP, agrochemical giant DuPont, Google, Intel and Microsoft, had urged Trump to remain in the deal. Ultimately, the lobbying by Trump’s environmental protection chief Scott Pruitt and chief strategist Steve Bannon urging the president to leave won out. In the wake of the announcement, Tesla and SpaceX boss Elon Musk and Disney chief Robert Iger announced they would no longer take part in presidential business councils. “Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,” Musk said. GE head Jeff Immelt said he was “disappointed” with the decision: “Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government.” – China pledge – White House officials acknowledged that under the deal, formal withdrawal may not take place until after the 2020 election. Hours ahead of Trump’s announcement, China’s Premier Li Keqiang pledged to stay the course on implementing the climate accord in a joint press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and urged other countries to do likewise. China has been investing billions in clean energy infrastructure, as it battles to clear up the choking pollution enveloping its cities. China and the US are responsible for some 40 percent of the world’s emissions and experts had warned it was vital for both to remain in the Paris agreement if it is to succeed. The leader of Asia’s other behemoth, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi — who is due to visit the White House shortly — has said failing to act on climate change would be “morally criminal.” – Mixed signals – Trump’s announcement comes less than 18 months after the climate pact was adopted in the French capital, the fruit of a hard-fought agreement between Beijing and Washington under Obama’s leadership. The Paris Agreement commits signatories to efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming, which is blamed for melting ice caps and glaciers, rising sea levels and more violent weather events. They vowed steps to keep the worldwide rise in temperatures “well below” two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) from pre-industrial times and to “pursue efforts” to hold the increase under 1.5 degrees Celsius. -AFP simangele RELATED ARTICLES World Lebanon election needs at least 6 months preparation-minister World Merkel: Paris climate pact needed for sake of Mother Earth World Trump asks Supreme Court to reinstate Muslim travel ban World Ananya Vinay wins the 2017 U.S. Scripps National Spelling Bee World Philippine casino gunman likely a foreigner: police NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

Subscribe to Newsweek from $1 per week Trump announced Thursday that the U.S. would withdraw from the agreement signed in 2015 by Barack Obama. America joins only Syria and Nicaragua. He said that he would be open to negotiating the deal but only it was fairer to U.S. interests. In the U.S., Wall Street saw a record close on Thursday, with markets boosted by the release of U.S. private payrolls data for May, which showed private companies added 253,000 jobs throughout the month. But U.S. manufacturing and energy companies will be concerned that the withdrawal will negatively impact the market for products that can cut greenhouse gas emissions. There are also concerns that businesses who remain in the accord could impose “retaliatory tariffs” on American companies, the FT reported. Companies including Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Intel took out an advert in U.S. newspapers Thursday warning that a U.S. withdrawal could limit access to markets focused on environmentally friendly technologies. David MacLennan, chief executive of Minnesota-based Cargill, the world’s leading agricultural commodities trader, told the FT: “Signing the accord means being a champion for US economic growth and job creation. If the US exits international accords like the Paris agreement it will negatively impact trade, economic vitality, the state of our environment and relationships among the world community.” Macron rejected any possibility of a renegotiation with Trump: “There are no more negotiations. There is no plan B. There is no planet B.” Chinese domestic markets remained unaffected, closing at 0.09 percent Friday.

What to know before you borrow. Load Error Need cash? Now might be a good time to apply for a small-business loan. It's a notoriously time-consuming and headache-inducing process, but it's gotten better since the recession: Banks are gradually lending more, a crop of online lenders are offering much more credit--at a price--and regulators have been looking for ways to make it easier for you to get a loan. Which is not to say it's completely easy or risk-free, especially if you're applying to one of the newer fintech lenders. INC. TODAY'S MUST READS: These Entrepreneurs Are Making Sure Cocktail Parties Are Never Awkward Again "Right now is actually quite a good time for small businesses to borrow, but getting a loan that works for you and is affordable and has terms you can understand is still a challenge," says Karen Mills, a former head of the Small Business Administration under President Obama and now a senior fellow at Harvard Business School. In November, Mills and Brayden McCarthy, vice president of strategy at online lending startup Fundera, published "The State of Small Business Lending: Innovation and Technology and the Implications for Regulation," a comprehensive look at the current market for small-business credit. What they found can help you figure out where to look for a loan, if and when you're ready to expand your business. The Slow, If Spotty, Recovery The number of small-business loans fell dramatically during the recession, as big banks cut off credit to customers they considered risky and many smaller and regional banks that once lent to local business owners shut their doors. It's better now. In 2016, eight years after the crash, 45 percent of small-business owners reported applying for credit, up from 22 percent in 2014, according to the Federal Reserve. As these two charts show, pessimism about the lending atmosphere is currently low--but getting all the money you need remains a problem. INC.

TODAY'S MUST READS: How to Create a Great Product Without Hiring a Team© Provided by Mansueto Ventures, LLC The Shifting Pool of Lenders Banks are probably never going to lend you all the money you need. For one thing, there are fewer of them--5,900 at the end of 2016 versus 8,500 at the end of 2007, according to the FDIC. Many of those that closed or got bought were the friendly local lenders that knew you and your business. Newer online lenders, including Lending Club, OnDeck, Kabbage, and Funding Circle, offer quick and easy loans, but sometimes at nosebleed interest rates. "As the online marketplace evolves, those [lenders] who succeed will be the ones that have access to low-cost capital and those who can best serve the small-business customer, creating products that fit their needs," Mills and McCarthy write. Where the Money's Moving Despite online lenders' growth, banks still receive the most small-business credit applications:© Provided by Mansueto Ventures, LLC > More Money, More Problems Customer satisfaction at online lenders is still pretty low, "in part due to high costs," Mills and McCarthy write. Customer satisfaction by lender type, according to the Federal Reserve:© Provided by Mansueto Ventures, LLC The Washington Wild Card For bank loans, don't expect big changes. It remains to be seen how the proposed rollbacks in crisis-era financial regulations will affect small-business lending (see "How Businesses Are Dealing with Washington's Unprecedented Uncertainty"). But Mills and other experts don't expect banks to change their risk-averse policies. Nor are the small banks that closed during the recession likely to return. Meanwhile, last year was a bumpy one for online lenders: Lending Club, the onetime standard-bearer of the online startups, fired its founder; rising interest rates made it more expensive for these startups to do business; and funding for the fintech sector has dropped off. Yet some regulatory measures could help expand online small-business lending, including an OCC proposal for a banklike charter for fintech lenders.

This year, the event runs from June 5 to June 9 (June 6 to June 10 in Australia) and is expected to serve as the launching point for major updates to iOS and macOS, as well as some new hardware. Image: Apple This will be the first time in roughly 15 years that Apple will not be hosting the event at the Moscone West Convention Center in San Francisco. Instead, the event will take place at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose. We'll be on the ground at the conference, so be sure to check back for our coverage beginning Tuesday morning. There's plenty to be excited about this year, so let's dive right in. A new iPad Pro Image: Gizmodo / Alex Cranz WWDC is typically centred around software like iOS and macOS, but this year we're expecting some hardware too. The extremely credible KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says there's a good chance Apple will announce a new iPad Pro at this year's conference. The new iPad Pro is rumoured to have a 10.5-inch screen that will fit comfortably between the existing 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch models. It will also reportedly feature a new design with slimmer bezels. There's no indication of exactly how much the new device will cost — but there's a very good chance it will be priced similarly to existing models (starting at about $850). Siri speaker Image: Apple The new iPad Pro isn't the only piece of hardware expected to debut at the conference. Kuo also predicts that Apple is planning to launch a smart speaker to compete with the Amazon Echo and Google Home. In a research note viewed by MacRumors, Kuo reportedly said there is "over [a] 50 per cent chance" that Apple will announce its new smart home speaker and begin selling them later in the year. Kuo said the speaker will likely produce excellent sound quality and will positioned for a higher end market (that is, it will be more expensive) than the Amazon Echo. Adding to swirling rumours, the extremely credible Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman reported this week that Apple "started manufacturing a long-in-the-works Siri-controlled smart speaker". Gurman reports that the speaker will differ from the Amazon Echo and Google home by offering virtual surround sound technology and deep integration into Apple products. The speaker will essentially serve as a hub to automate smart home devices through Apple's (currently underdeveloped) HomeKit platform. It will also help lock customers into Apple's walled garden as people begin to add more automation to their homes and subscribe to services like Apple Music. Gurman also reports that the speaker will have advanced acoustics that give it an edge over competing products such as the Echo and Google Home, and that Apple considered adding virtual surround sound technology similar to Sonos Trueplay. It will also have comparable hardware to the Sonos Play:5 according to Kuo's research note, which says the speaker will have one subwoofer, seven tweeters, and computing power similar to the iPhone 6/6S. By comparison, as Mac Observer points out, the Echo only has one woofer and one tweeter. The Sonos Play:5 only has three woofers and three tweeters. In short, the soon-to-be-announced Siri speaker sounds much more powerful than Google Home or Amazon Echo. New MacBook and MacBook Pros Image: Gizmodo / Alex Cranz It looks all-but-certain that we'll be getting a new MacBook lineup at the conference. French website Consomac is reporting that it found a Russian-language regulatory filing in the Eurasian Economic Commission database that points to at least five new models running macOS Sierra launching soon. In addition to the filing, Bloomberg reports Apple will be releasing a new MacBook lineup to stave off competition from Microsoft's striking new Surface Laptop. The new MacBook Pro will get a bump to the latest seventh-generation Intel Core processors, giving it a significant hardware boost. One of the more remarkable rumours is that Apple could revive the 12-inch and 13-inch MacBook Airs by giving them a nice hardware bump, according to Bloomberg. Analysts aren't expecting any major design changes to either the MacBook or MacBook Pro, but say the new MacBook Air could have a new look. John Gruber reported in April that Apple is working hard on a "completely rethought" Mac Pro with a modular design. The new design is supposed to accommodate high-end CPUs and GPUs, and make it easier for people to update the computer with new components on a regular basis. The company is also working on pro displays to ship with the new desktops. Unfortunately, Gruber reports that the next-gen Mac Pros "will not ship this year", meaning they likely will not make an appearance at WWDC. A first look at iOS 11 Image: Gizmodo Don't get your hopes up for new iPhone models. They probably aren't coming until later this year. What you can expect at WWDC, though, is a big focus on Apple's new mobile operating system, iOS 11. We don't know much about the OS ahead of the show, but we're expecting a bunch of updates that focus on artificial intelligence. A sketchy rumour from Israeli publication the Verifier suggests that Siri will add contextual learning and better integration into Apple services like iMessage and iCloud. Other updates to the operating system, according to 9to5Mac, could include features like group FaceTime, meaning that you'll be able to video conference multiple people from your phone. There's also a rumour that iMessage will add multi-person calls, making it easier to have up to five people join a single call. The most dramatic changes will be specifically tailored to the iPad. 9to5Mac reports that things such as multi-user login are to be added to the operating system, while other blogs like MacRumors suggest Apple is working on expanded Apple Pencil support for the iPad Pro. Updates to macOS, WatchOS and tvOS Last year, Apple decided to drop the "X" from its desktop operating system's name, instead calling it simply macOS. As part of the update, Apple started integrating even more iOS features into the desktop with things such as Siri for Mac and Apple Pay for the web. This year, we're expecting to see the second iteration of macOS (10.13), but there aren't any hard details about what exactly. We should also see updates to other operating systems including WatchOS for the Apple Watch and tvOS for the Apple TV, according to the Telegraph. This essentially means that every operating system in the Apple ecosystem will receive a significant update, and that seems like a reasonable expectation considering the event is specifically tailored to get developers excited about building apps for Apple products. As always, we'll be covering the conference as news breaks, so be sure to check back here June 6 to June 10 for more info about the latest updates. Comments Be the first to comment on this story!

Here's what they had to say. The Climate Deniers Have Won Sidney Fussell 02 Jun 2017 6:00 AM At President Trumps' behest, the US is joining Syria and Nicaragua in abdicating from the Paris Agreement, a coalition of 147 nations to combat climate change by reducing carbon emissions. While Trump faced heavy international pressure to remain within the agreement, from the Pope during his trip to the Vatican, China's President Xi and European leaders during the G7 summit, the GOP overwhelmingly opposed Paris from the get-go. EPA head Scott Pruitt has long argued that the United States' emissions reduction goal under Paris weakened the US economy. Want Gizmodo's email newsletter?

NDTV Business Hindi Movies Cricket Good Times Food Tech Auto Apps Prime Art Weddings Sections Home | World COMMENTS Sections Live TV Videos Latest India Opinion Cities World Sports Photos Schedule Trends OffBeat People Health Indians Abroad South Cheat Sheet Voices Forums Weather News Alerts World Forges Ahead With Paris Climate Deal Without Donald Trump Donald Trump announced Thursday that his administration would immediately stop implementing the 195-nation Paris climate accord. World | Agence France-Presse | Updated: June 03, 2017 05:24 IST 73 Shares EMAIL PRINT COMMENTS US President Donald Trump pulled out the US out of the Paris climate deal. Brussels, Belgium:  The world forged ahead Friday with the Paris climate deal after President Donald Trump pulled the US out of the pact, triggering bitter condemnation from all corners of the globe. Trump announced Thursday that his administration would immediately stop implementing the 195-nation accord brokered by Barack Obama in 2015 in tandem with Chinese leaders. The European Union said it was increasing efforts with China, the world's biggest polluter, to galvanise global efforts to implement the deal while India vowed to stick to the pact regardless of the United States. Trump also faced a backlash at home where Democratic state governors, city mayors and powerful companies drew up plans to meet the pact's greenhouse gas emission targets. "Americans will honour and fulfill the Paris agreement by leading from the bottom up -- and there isn't anything Washington can do to stop us," former New York mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg said. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin spared Trump more withering criticism and urged the world to work with the New York tycoon on climate. In Brussels, European Council President Donald Tusk said the EU is "stepping up our cooperation on climate change with China" following a summit with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.   But EU officials said the two sides failed to formally endorse a joint statement on the issue due to a lingering but separate trade row. Expressions of shock and regret poured in from around the world, including from Pacific islands at risk of being swallowed by rising seas, who accused Washington of "abandoning" them. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the EU's most powerful leader, pledged "more decisive action than ever" to protect the climate after Trump's "highly regrettable" decision. 'Nothing to renegotiate' In a nationalistic "America First" announcement from the White House Rose Garden, Trump said he was withdrawing from a UN-backed deal that imposes "draconian financial and economic burdens" on the United States while going too easy on economic rivals China, India and Europe. "We don't want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore. And they won't be." Trump offered no details about how, or when, a formal withdrawal would happen. At one point he suggested a renegotiation could take place, an idea that was unceremoniously slapped down by partners. "There is nothing to renegotiate here," EU climate commissioner Miguel Arias Canete told reporters in Brussels. The United States is the world's second-largest greenhouse gas emitter, after China, so Trump's decision could seriously hamper efforts to cut emissions and limit global temperature increases. Nicaragua and war-torn Syria are the only countries not party to the Paris accord, the former seeing it as not ambitious enough. Trump's decision is likely to play well with the Republican base, with the more immediate damage likely to appear on the diplomatic front. Vice President Mike Pence said that Trump "has demonstrated his commitment... to put American workers, American consumers, American energy, and the American people first." Echoes of reality TV Ever the showman, the 70-year-old Trump gave his decision a reality TV-style tease, refusing to indicate his preference either way until his announcement. Opponents of the pullout -- said to include Trump's daughter Ivanka -- had warned that Washington's global leadership role was at stake, along with the environment. A dozen large companies including oil major BP, agrochemical giant DuPont and tech heavyweights Google, Intel and Microsoft had urged Trump to stick to the pact. Following the announcement Tesla boss Elon Musk and Disney chief Robert Iger said they would no longer participate in presidential business councils. "Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Musk said. 'Morally criminal' White House officials acknowledged that under the deal, a formal withdrawal might not take place until after the 2020 election, and leaders will certainly push Trump to reconsider his decision in the meantime. India's environment minister Harsh Vardhan said his country is committed to the Paris accord "irrespective" of the position of other nations. Prime Minister Narendra Modi -- who has said failing to address climate change would be "morally criminal" -- is due to visit the White House shortly. Trump's announcement comes less than 18 months after the climate pact was adopted, the fruit of a hard-fought agreement between Beijing and Washington under Obama's leadership. The Paris Agreement commits signatories to efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming, which is blamed for melting ice caps and glaciers, rising sea levels and an increase in extreme weather events. They vowed to take steps to keep the worldwide rise in temperatures "well below" two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) from pre-industrial times and to "pursue efforts" to hold the increase under 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Cricket Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education Health TRENDING# ICC Champions Trophy 2017 Cow Slaughter Kulbhushan Jadhav Narendra Modi Exam results 2017 News Technology News Wall St Week Ahead-As large cap gets larger, can the tech rally continue? Shares0 Sat, 3 Jun 2017-05:04am , Reuters The only other company with comparable gains in market value this year is Amazon, a market darling not in the tech sector despite being a big player in cloud services and data storage. Technology shares have led U.S. stocks to record highs and are expected to continue to rise, but as market value becomes concentrated in the largest companies, some are beginning to look for the next rally leader. The technology sector of the S&P 500 has risen roughly 20 percent so far in 2017, led by Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft. The only other company with comparable gains in market value this year is Amazon, a market darling not in the tech sector despite being a big player in cloud services and data storage. "These are the dominant players in their specific spaces and the hottest areas in tech," said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta, highlighting their exposure to the cloud and artificial intelligence. "You will continue to see money flowing into those names. People want to be exposed to the hottest areas," he said. Active funds have continued to throw their money behind the leaders with a record overweight on the technology sector, according to BofA/Merrill Lynch data going back to 2008. But more than a third of the 2017 gains in the S&P 500 have come from these five companies, and the concentration of the advance has some investors jittery. "Given how significant the (large cap) leadership has been year to date, I kind of think you need to find another group to produce that leadership," said Jim Tierney, chief investment officer of concentrated U.S. growth at AllianceBernstein in New York. Echoing Dell, Cisco, Intel and yes, Microsoft itself, the leaders of the Y2K tech boom, these new "five horsemen" have added more than $612 billion in value to the stock market this year. Their 2017 gains alone could buy the 85 smallest companies of the S&P 500. Their combined value, near $3 trillion, is not far from the market value of all the other components of the Nasdaq 100. NOT THAT EXPENSIVE, BUT... This tech rally has come hand in hand with heightened expectations for profits. Investors are currently paying $18.50 for every $1 in earnings expected over the next 12 months in the sector, compared to the more than $40 they paid during the dot-com bubble and even the $20-plus seen during the most recent market peak in 2007. Tech sector earnings are expected to grow 11 percent in the second quarter after rising near 21 percent in the first, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data. However, with gains of more than 33 percent for Apple, Facebook and Amazon, near 25 percent for Alphabet and 15 percent in Microsoft, compared to a gain of 8.5 percent for the S&P 500, the room for more upside is declining. Despite expecting gains upward of 20 percent for the rest of the year on the so-called FANG stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet - and their ilk, analysts at Fundstrat recommended in a Friday note balancing portfolios by scooping up the year's underperformers: banks, energy and telecoms. They are not alone in searching for exposure outside technology. "We're most overweight in technology but I don't want to stay too long at the party," said Alan Gayle, director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta. "What I'm watching for is an opportunity to lighten up on tech exposure and put it into some of the more cyclical areas," he said. "Financials are going to be catching a tailwind." AllianceBernstein's Tierney bets beyond tech on healthcare , the second-largest sector weight on the S&P 500. "Healthcare has really lagged the last 18 months or so. They could certainly pick up the mantle." (This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)

Conventional physical data center security architectures are complex and rigid. It has relied on static machine & network identities and devices which are difficult to change and challenging to work with. In contrast, software defined network security is simple to work with. Software defined security is a sister technology of software defined networking. SDSec allows businesses to automate and deploy intrusion detection, network segmentation and other network security controls with software. Furthermore, SDSec works on the logical policies for providing protection. With SDSec, mitigation of risks can be applied close to source of attack. Organizations can alleviate their network from diverting traffic to a central location and allow for dynamic removal and insertion of security points when and where needed. Virtualization of network security applications reduces or eliminates need to deploy and buy specialized vendor appliances. Virtually configuring connection points will replace the traditional vendor specific and resource intensive method of using static pre-configured policies. Growing market of cloud based infrastructure is expected to drive the software defined security market. Rising concerns among enterprises for security of virtualized infrastructure and growing demand for managing unstructured data are also expected to drive the SDSec market.

With the United States virtually isolated on the world stage, a string of administration officials went on the offensive Friday to justify the Republican president's decision to abandon the 195-nation Paris deal curbing global emissions. Trump's top climate advisor Scott Pruitt was indignant: "The world applauded when we joined Paris. And you know why? I think they applauded because they knew it would put this country at a disadvantage." "The European leaders, why do they want us to stay in? They know it will continue to shackle our economy," said Pruitt, who serves as Trump's Environment Protection Agency administrator. That combative tone came amid a wave of bitter condemnation from around the world and as Trump and his aides refused to say whether he believes climate change is real, in line with the global scientific consensus. Trump ignored the question when asked by journalists during an unrelated event with law enforcement officers, although he did joke that Thursday's decision had proven "controversial." Along with Trump, Pruitt and White House press secretary Sean Spicer were among those who refused to answer repeated questions on the subject. Instead, Pruitt lashed out, saying "we have nothing to be apologetic about as a country," despite the United States being the world's second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China. "We have taken significant steps to reduce our CO2 footprint," he said. That message is likely to play well with Trump's Republican base, which reveled in defeating what Pruitt called the "environmental left" and "climate exaggerators." - Backlash at home - Expressions of shock and regret poured in from around the world, including from Pacific islands at risk of being swallowed by rising seas, who accused Washington of "abandoning" them. AFP / Brendan Smialowski Donald Trump's top climate advisor Scott Pruitt went on the offensive to justify the Republican president's decision to abandon the Paris climate deal As well as world outcry, Trump's decision prompted a domestic backlash, with state governors, city mayors and powerful companies already drawing up plans to meet the Paris pact's greenhouse gas emission targets. At least two Republican governors announced Friday they were partnering with Democratic-run states to combat climate change. US billionaire, philanthropist and UN envoy for climate change Michael Bloomberg pledged $15 million to support the Paris agreement's coordinating agency if necessary -- the sum it stands to lose should the United States refuse to pay its share. "Americans will honor and fulfill the Paris agreement by leading from the bottom up," he said, flying to the French capital to meet President Emmanuel Macron in an expression of solidarity. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the EU's most powerful leader, pledged "more decisive action than ever" to protect the climate after Trump's "highly regrettable" decision. In Brussels, European Council President Donald Tusk said the EU was "stepping up" cooperation on climate change with Beijing following a summit with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, while India said it was committed to the Paris accord "irrespective" of the position of other nations. - 'Nothing to renegotiate' - In a nationalistic "America First" announcement from the White House Rose Garden on Thursday, Trump said he was withdrawing from a UN-backed deal that imposes "draconian financial and economic burdens" on the United States while going too easy on economic rivals China, India and Europe. "We don't want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore. And they won't be." AFP / John SAEKI The scientific consensus is that global warming is real Trump offered no details about how, or when, a formal withdrawal would happen. At one point he suggested a renegotiation could take place, an idea that was unceremoniously slapped down by partners. "There is nothing to renegotiate here," EU climate commissioner Miguel Arias Canete told reporters in Brussels. Nicaragua and war-torn Syria are the only countries not party to the Paris accord, the former seeing it as not ambitious enough. White House officials acknowledged that under the deal, a formal withdrawal might not take place until after the 2020 election, and leaders will certainly push Trump to reconsider his decision in the meantime. - 'Leaders don't leave' - Trump's announcement comes less than 18 months after the climate pact was adopted, the fruit of a hard-fought agreement between Beijing and Washington under Barack Obama's leadership. The Paris Agreement commits signatories to efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming, which is blamed for melting ice caps and glaciers, rising sea levels and an increase in extreme weather events. They vowed to take steps to keep the worldwide rise in temperatures "well below" two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) from pre-industrial times and to "pursue efforts" to hold the increase under 1.5 degrees Celsius. Opponents of Trump's withdrawal -- said to include his daughter Ivanka -- had warned Washington's global leadership role was at stake, along with the environment. Many American business leaders have voiced disappointment at Trump's decision to leave, latest among them Dow Chemical chairman and CEO Andrew Liveris, who heads the president's manufacturing council. "Leaders don't leave tables, leaders stay," he told CNBC. 3 Jun 2017 Previous Back to summary Next AFP's worldwide network The global network of Agence France Presse covers 150 countries Find out more Find out more Contact us If you have news to share or a question, comment or suggestion, contact us via...

"We have taken significant steps to reduce our CO2 footprint," he said.

BACKLASH AT HOME Expressions of shock and regret poured in from around the world, including from Pacific islands at risk of being swallowed by rising seas, who accused Washington of "abandoning" them. As well as world outcry, Trump's decision has already prompted a domestic backlash, with state governors, city mayors and powerful companies drawing up plans to meet the Paris pact's greenhouse gas emission targets. "Here's what is most important for the world to understand: In the US, emission levels are determined far more by cities, states, and businesses than they are by our federal government," said former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the EU's most powerful leader, pledged "more decisive action than ever" to protect the climate after Trump's "highly regrettable" decision.

(Photo: AP/Virginia Mayo/Pool) In Brussels, European Council President Donald Tusk said the EU is "stepping up our cooperation on climate change with China" following a summit with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, although EU officials said the two sides failed to endorse a joint statement due to a separate trade row. India's environment minister Harsh Vardhan also said his country is committed to the Paris accord "irrespective" of the position of other nations. 'NOTHING TO RENEGOTIATE' In a nationalistic "America First" announcement from the White House Rose Garden on Thursday, Trump said he was withdrawing from a UN-backed deal that imposes "draconian financial and economic burdens" on the United States while going too easy on economic rivals China, India and Europe.

White House officials acknowledged that under the deal, a formal withdrawal might not take place until after the 2020 election, and leaders will certainly push Trump to reconsider his decision in the meantime. ECHOES OF REALITY TV The 70-year-old Trump gave his decision a reality TV-style tease, refusing to indicate his preference either way until his announcement. Opponents of the pullout - said to include Trump's daughter Ivanka - had warned Washington's global leadership role was at stake, along with the environment. A dozen large companies including oil major BP, agrochemical giant DuPont and tech heavyweights Google, Intel and Microsoft had urged Trump to stick to the pact. Following the announcement Tesla boss Elon Musk and Disney chief Robert Iger said they would no longer participate in presidential business councils. Trump's announcement comes less than 18 months after the climate pact was adopted, the fruit of a hard-fought agreement between Beijing and Washington under Barack Obama's leadership.

(QCOM) Stock’s Feud With Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is an Opportunity Qualcomm stock has not yet recovered from Apple's legal attack in January By Dana Blankenhorn, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Jun 2, 2017, 10:13 am EDT Get AAPL alerts: Submit     View All   Popular Posts: Buy Broadcom Ltd (AVGO) Stock for Hock Tan’s Genius Is Ford Motor Company (F) Stock Recession-Proof? Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Will Succeed Where Microsoft Was Stopped Recent Posts: Bitcoin Is Cryptocurrency, But It’s Not Currency Nokia Oyj (ADR) (Nok) Stock Is a Case of Image vs. Reality Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) Stock’s Feud With Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is an Opportunity View All Posts Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) has a government-approved monopoly on radio chips, has patents going back over a quarter century and is the biggest producer of them. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), meanwhile, holds a monopsony, for it is a buyer large enough to control costs, forcing suppliers to dance to its tune. When monopoly meets monopsony, trouble often follows, and so it has been in this case. Apple and Qualcomm are suing one another, ostensibly over patents and pricing but really over the cost of Qualcomm’s monopoly power. Qualcomm asserts that the price of that power has not changed, but when spread over billions of devices Apple sees it as excessive. Governments in China and South Korea have made the same argument. Qualcomm settled with China and is fighting with Korea. Apple has brought the U.S. government in on its side. Both sides have lawyered up for a siege. Legal war is not healthy for corporations and other living things. The Cost of Conflict Since the start of 2017 Qualcomm shares are down 10%. The drop came on Apple’s lawsuit in January, and the stock has not really recovered. The suit shaved $10 billion off Qualcomm’s market cap, and resulted in it showing just $5.015 billion in sales for the quarter ending in March, against $5.551 billion a year earlier, as Apple cut off payments. Net income was also down, to $749 million from $1.1.64 billion a year earlier. The stock has recovered a bit because it’s assumed the feud will end. The question is when peace might come, and at what cost. Analyst Rob Enderle thinks Qualcomm has the upper hand but that Apple could still “go nuclear,” turning its marketing department on Qualcomm’s brand. He notes that both companies have recently hired executives from Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), known for playing hardball, and this may be behind the conflict’s escalation. The issue is that Qualcomm’s royalty rates for its patents are based on the cost of finished goods, and since iPhones are pricey it pays more. Apple says it can’t play QCOM against other chip suppliers because of Qualcomm’s “no license, no chips” policy, which guarantees it will pay more that way. It’s an argument that has been repeated by the Federal Trade Commission, which filed its complaint against Qualcomm right before Apple filed suit. The suit doesn’t just pit two companies against one another, in other words, but companies and governments. Don’t worry about QCOM stock, though. It has played this game before, with China, and won.

It emerged last month that a grand jury in northern Virginia is examining former national security adviser’s work on behalf of a Turkish entrepreneur and has issued subpoenas to businesses that worked with him. The findings will become part of Mueller’s investigation, Reuters reported on Friday, an early indication of the extent of his reach as special counsel. Later on Friday, the Associated Press reported that Mueller has also assumed oversight of an ongoing investigation involving former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was forced to resign in August 2016 amid questions over his past business dealings in Ukraine. Flynn set up an intelligence consultancy in Alexandria, Virginia, after Barack Obama fired him as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014. Nigel Farage is 'person of interest' in FBI investigation into Trump and Russia Read more Among his deals under scrutiny is one with Ekim Alptekin, a Turkish businessman whose company, the Netherlands-based Inovo BV, paid Flynn’s consultancy $530,000 to produce a documentary and research on Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric living in exile in a small Pennsylvania town. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the president of Turkey, blames Gulen for a failed coup last July, an allegation that Gulen denies. Alptekin, chairman of the Turkey-US Business Council, told Reuters he had hired Flynn to provide research on how Gulen was “poisoning the atmosphere” between Turkey and the US. The fee given to Flynn’s company came “mostly” from his personal funds, he added. The grand jury in Virginia has issued subpoenas to some of Flynn’s business associates involved in the work for Inovo, Reuters said. The subpoena seen by the agency seeks bank records, documents and communications related to Flynn, his company, Flynn Intel Group, Alptekin and Inovo. Flynn’s work for Inovo came under scrutiny after he published a commentary on a political news website calling Gulen a “radical Islamist” who should be extradited to Turkey. The House of Representatives intelligence committee, also investigating Russian interference in the election, subpoenaed records from Flynn on Wednesday. The Senate intelligence committee has served subpoenas on Flynn and two of his businesses, and this week Flynn indicated that he would start turning over relevant materials. The deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, appointed Mueller, a former FBI director, on 17 May to oversee an investigation into any ties between Russia and individuals associated with the Trump campaign ahead of last November’s presidential election. This followed Trump’s decision to fire James Comey as director of the FBI. Comey will testify next Thursday before the Senate intelligence committee in both an open session and behind closed doors, another potential political minefield for Trump. In theory, the president could seek to invoke executive privilege in an attempt to block Comey from testifying, albeit at the risk of huge political blowback. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said: “That committee hearing was just noticed and I think, obviously, it’s got to be reviewed.” A reporter interjected: “That’s not a no!” Spicer replied: “I was just saying, literally, my understanding is the date for that hearing was just set. I have not spoken to counsel yet. I don’t know how they’re going to respond.” Spicer repeatedly parried questions about Trump and Russia, insisting that from now on he would now concentrate on the president’s agenda and refer all such inquiries to legal counsel.

Sponsored content is written by Global News' without any editorial influence by the sponsor. If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen Canadians are barely getting used to cheering for BlackBerry (formerly Research in Motion) again, after the company’s stock price soared in recent weeks. But could Canada lose its technology champion just as it seems poised to make a comeback? That’s not an unlikely scenario if you listen to one research report that’s recently sent BlackBerry shares on yet another hot streak. Story continues below READ MORE: Is BlackBerry back? Why the company’s stock just hit a 4-year high “When Wall Street shifts its frame of expectations toward the future, and gets over [BlackBerry’s] legacy business, watch out,” wrote U.S.-based Citron Research, which argued the company is ripe for a takeover. Indeed, Citron’s case for BlackBerry has nothing to do with KEYone, the firm’s latest smartphone, which debuted in Canada this week to very little fanfare. What makes BlackBerry a likely buyout target is its secure software for autonomous vehicles, QNX. READ MORE: 10 things we bet you didn’t know about BlackBerry “QNX [is] undoubtedly the most secure computer system installed in cars today,” wrote Citron. The software already runs on over 60 million cars from about 40 automakers — from Ford to BMW — making it a leader in the nascent market. With Google and Apple racing to build an operating system for self-driving cars and Samsung and Tesla also eyeing that space, BlackBerry looks like an attractive purchase for a number of technology companies with cash to spare, the report argued. Citron compared the BlackBerry to Mobileye, an Israeli auto startup for which Intel recently shelled out a whopping $15 million. Mobileye software at the time had been installed on only 16 million cars, Citron noted. WATCH: The little device that could – a brief history of the BlackBerry The future looks bright Regardless of whether or not a willing buyer steps forward, BlackBerry’s future looks bright, at least in the near term, according to the report. Citron also drew a parallel between BlackBerry and chipmaker Nvidia Corp., whose stock price has ballooned from less than US $50 a year ago to nearly $145. The stock surge started when “Wall Street stopped valuing NVDA as a graphic chip company and instead looked at its future in autonomous driving.” Much the same could happen to BlackBerry if investors stop perceiving it as a handset maker and start focusing on its strength as a provider of secure software, wrote Citron. The research firm expects BlackBerry’s stock value to double in the next two years. The company has almost completed its transition from handset manufacturer to software maker, after officially ditching its hardware business last fall, noted Citron. It has stopped hemorrhaging cash and recently received a financial shot in the arm from a billion-dollar settlement from technology giant Qualcomm. And CEO John Chen has proved to be a “talented” leader focused on long-term growth, reads the report. WATCH: BlackBerry opens autonomous vehicle hub A string of positive headlines Citron’s take on BlackBerry is just the latest in a string of positive news that has pumped the company’s stock. The firm’s share price started climbing in late March, after it released better-than-expected quarterly results. It continued through April and got a further bump in May, when the global WannaCry malware attack drew renewed investor attention to BlackBerry’s secure software offerings. The company’s stock price could reach $45 by 2020, according to long-time BlackBerry watcher Gus Papageorgiou of Macquarie Group.

The move has led to messages from a number of tech CEOs, who have expressed their disappointment at the move. “We are getting out,” Trump said. “But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. And if we can, that’s great. And if we can’t, that’s fine." Unlike Nicaragua, which believes the accord doesn’t do enough to protect the environment, and Syria, whose government struggles to take part because of sanctions, Trump's reason for withdrawing from the agreement is to “protect America and its citizens.” He says it's "very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States," and would impose "draconian financial and economic burdens." As reported yesterday, the decision has led to Elon Musk leaving the presidential councils. Not long after Trump finished his speech, the Tesla boss tweeted: “Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.” He was joined by Disney CEO Robert Iger, who also resigned from the council “as a matter of principle.” IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, however, will remain on Trump’s business advisory council. Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2017 Other leaders from the tech world also took to Twitter opposing the move. Apple CEO Tim Cook, who spoke to Trump on Tuesday to try and convince him to remain, wrote: “Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet. Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver.” Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet. Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver. — Tim Cook (@tim_cook) June 2, 2017 Cook also sent an internal note to his employees. “Climate change is real and we all share a responsibility to fight it. I want to reassure you that today’s developments will have no impact on Apple’s efforts to protect the environment,” it read. “Our mission has always been to leave the world better than we found it. We will never waver, because we know that future generations depend on us.” 25 firms including Microsoft, Intel, Apple, and Google, took out a last-minute full-page ad in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal yesterday, promoting the benefits of the agreement. Dear President Trump, as some of the largest companies in the US, we strongly urge you to keep the US in the Paris Agreement. pic.twitter.com/ztSXyYtRrm — Marc Benioff (@Benioff) June 1, 2017 Twitter boss Jack Dorsey, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and many more used social media to attack the President’s decision. Disappointed with today’s decision. Google will keep working hard for a cleaner, more prosperous future for all. — Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) June 1, 2017 This is an incredibly shortsighted move backwards by the federal government. We're all on this planet together and we need to work together. https://t.co/tLEdtG0n1o — jack (@jack) June 1, 2017 The last time CEOs rallied against Trump like this was after he introduced the immigration ban. With people now leaving his councils, and virtually every company condemning the withdrawal, the relationship between the President and the tech industry has hit a low point. It will, however, take years to fully exit the pact; November 4, 2020 – the day after the next presidential election – to be exact Related Reads Elon Musk says he will leave advisory councils if Trump withdraws from Paris agreement Donald Trump is holding a meeting with tech industry leaders next week Donald Trump meets with the tech elite, offers a helping hand 26 comments 213 interactions Share this article: Now Read This… Elon Musk says he'll leave advisory councils if Trump withdraws from Paris agreement Supreme Court makes it harder for patent trolls to hand-pick battlegrounds Bitcoin valuation tops $2,000 for the first time ever Popular 27 comments Intel Core X vs. AMD Ryzen Threadripper: What we know so far 26 comments Tech leaders denounce Trump's decision to leave Paris agreement 46 comments Elon Musk says he will leave advisory councils if Trump withdraws from Paris agreement 11 comments Corsair One Review 10 comments Microsoft co-founder shows off the world's biggest plane Load Comments 26 ...
