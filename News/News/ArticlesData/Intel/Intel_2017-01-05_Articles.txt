Intel kicked off CES with an announcement of Optane modules for the PC.  These m.2-format SSDs sport a speedy PCIe/NVMe interface and use the new Intel/Micron 3D XPoint memory to provide faster performance than can be achieved using NAND flash. Surprisingly the web page used for the kickoff hammers on a theme: “A hard disk drive coupled with Intel Optane memory affordably gives you SSD-like speed while maintaining large storage capacity.”  Given that Intel is a leading SSD supplier, it is odd that the company would work to sell a technology that would serve to undermine its SSD business. The idea of adding an SSD layer to accelerate HDD performance is not a new one to Intel.  The company tried unsuccessfully in 2011 to encourage PCs to use a similar approach with its Ultrabook initiative. Like this week’s announcement, the Ultrabook solution paired a low-capacity SSD with a standard HDD.  In the case of the Ultrabook the target capacity underwent some changes, ranging from 13GB to 20GB, a range similar to the 16GB and 32GB Optane modules being promoted today.   It appears that today’s Optane product, as did the Ultrabook, takes advantage of Intel’s Rapid Storage Technology to manage the SSD cache. The company has been working to insert a flash storage layer into PCs since its Robson/Turbo Memory initiative in 2005. Turbo Memory used Microsoft Windows Vista’s ReadyBoost and ReadyDrive software to manage a USB-connected flash cache. The effort was followed by Intel’s Braidwood initiative, an aborted 2009 effort to add flash modules, roughly similar to DRAM DIMMs, to the PC’s motherboard as a configurable flash layer.  It seems that both of these programs failed because of software issues. All in all, the notion of adding a fast storage layer to the PC is a good idea from the perspective of price/performance.  So far two problems have gotten in the way of its adoption in the PC: Execution, in the form of software support (which was finally solved in the Ultrabook), and marketing, where the value prospect of a costly addition to the PC was completely lost on the consumer. This last will be a key factor with the Optane m.2 card (shown below).  Optane is based on 3D XPoint memory, a new technology that is currently proving to be extremely challenging to bring to production. Intel showed at CES an m.2 Optane board plugging into PCs. (Image: Intel) In order for Optane DIMMs to make sense to the user this new memory technology must be sold for less than DRAM since its performance is lower than that of DRAM.  The trouble is DRAM’s awfully cheap since it’s produced in such enormous volumes. 3D XPoint memory will cost less to manufacture than DRAM once its shipment volume approaches that of DRAM.  The way to reach this shipment volume will be to sell XPoint at a lower cost than DRAM.  This is a classic chicken-and-egg issue. Another key drawback is that an Optane PCIe SSD is only 6-8 times faster than a NAND flash based PCIe SSD. The difference may sound significant, but the Optane SSD is based on the Intel/Micron 3D XPoint memory, a technology that is claimed to be 1,000 times as fast as flash. This huge disparity stems from the use of an SSD block storage interface to communicate with a memory technology.  A detailed explanation of the causes of this slowdown can be found in a blog post I wrote last June. Objective Analysis is not bullish on the prospects of Optane SSDs in PCs.  Between the high cost that can be expected early on in the program’s life and the lack of a clear benefit to the average PC purchaser this program is likely to appeal only to enthusiasts with an unlimited budget. On the other hand, we see a clear path to success for Optane DIMMs in servers, since 3D XPoint’s speed advantage will be unleashed by putting it on the memory bus and since the data center has a much stronger understanding of cost/performance than does the average PC user.  This is spelled out in our October 2015 report: “A Close Look at the Micron/Intel 3D XPoint Memory.” --Jim Handy follows storage technology at Objective Analysis (Los Gatos, Calif.)

It's an OEM play. Games are very large and so are serious apps and the input/output files. Hybrids are hard to benchmark in consumer and show their value even when they offer good value. With 16-32GB capacity, it would compete against DRAM not NAND as more DRAM would offer better value for enthusiasts or proffessionals in desktop. DRAM prices have somewhat doubled vs a year ago and likely to keep rising this year, that could help Xpoint a bit- a lot in server. On the other hand, midrange PCIe 3.0 x4 SSDs, retailing at bellow 50 cents per GB, are rather compelling. PCIe 4.0 should help Xpoint and ,soon enough, WD's 3D ReRAM as it would make it easier to show the difference vs NAND. The one odd part is that Intel is about to be kicked out of the enthusiast market in desktop. AMD seems about ready to offer twice the cores at same price point and if Intel ties to keep Optane Intel only, they would severely limit its potential.

Perhaps, in time, the PC business will split into two distinct markets: cloud-based and self-sufficeint.  Let's check back in a decade!

Although I do believe that some of the more sophisticated PC buyers that you mention (gamers, photographers, etc.) will like what Optane m.2 XPoint SSDs will do for their system, I am not convinced that this will drive enough volume to make your first two factors play out.  Time will tell. I agree that a block interface helps to hide a lot of sins.  That's why Samsung's been shipping all of its 3D NAND in SSDs. Thanks for the  info on limited m.2 sockets in notebooks.  I didn't know that. Jim   Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Author Re: Optane Poor Fit Due to Big HDDs? Jim Handy01   1/12/2017 5:35:37 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate Jeffrey,  Good thoughts. I don't think, though, that you need a "faster than DRAM" layer.  That's what the processor caches are for.  Since the speed difference between flash and XPoint is said to be 1,000:1 then XPoint will be a good layer to add between DRAM and an SSD.  Note that Intel is positioning it as a layer between an HDD and DRAM to bridge the same gap that is addressed by an SSD. In the near term we (at Objective Analysis) see 3D XPoint being used as memory, rathe than storage.  There isn't yet off-the-shelf software that can use its persistence.  Over time this will change, but in the near term XPoint should serve as a fast memory layer.  This should appeal to server users, but less so to PC users.

I am a lot more positive on the technology than you appear to be. As long as 3D XPoint memory can sell for less than DRAM and can perform faster than NAND flash then it's a reasonable technology to use as a new layer in the memory/storage hierarchy. My question in this article was whether the average PC buyer would feel comfortable spending money for this feature.  I don't expect for that to happen.  I do expect to see adoption in the server, though.

Shinobee   1/11/2017 8:04:20 AM NO RATINGS Login to Rate I think there needs to be a distinction whether Optane will try to compete in the storage or memory industry.  Both are quite different, but I will address issues for both. As a storage device, it will be competing with 3DVNAND which currently has a very strong hold on the market.  Even without knowledge of the pricetag, the announced capacities of 16 and 32 gb leaves a lot to be desired, as M.2 and SATA Flash SSDs have already broken the 1TB barrier at not unreasonable prices. Optane does boast some performance advantages such as byte level addressing, and if Optane uses some variation of PCRAM technology, its write/erase speed can be estimated to be in the 100 ns range which is significantly faster than Flash's 1 ~ 2 us erase speed.  Whether those advantages will have significant measurable performance increases to make up for its small capacity to be accepted in the mainstream market however, is extremely doubtful in my opinion. As a memory device, it does boast non volatility, but PCRAM's write speed of 100 ns is unsuitable as a memory application, whereas DRAM can have write speeds of less than 10 ns.  In addition, I haven't seen evidence that Optane has infinite write/erase endurance, which is a requirement for a memory application. While there could be surprises awaiting us, the way it looks now and based on my knowledge in this field, Optane will stand in the shadows of Flash and DRAM, making it a niche product at best.

On my client PC, when I first switched from a rotating hard drive to a first gen SSD at just 300 MB/second, the difference was dramatic.  But when I later upgraded to a 1.5GB/sec SSD, the incremental difference was just barely noticeable.  I only notice faster speeds when transferring large files, but then a cache system doesn't work - you need the entire hard drive to be that fast.       Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Rookie Re: Optane Poor Fit Due to Big HDDs? jgeldman570   1/10/2017 7:20:58 PM Login to Rate Jim,   While Optane (and QuantX) isn't a great fit for the PC market before the spigot turns on to 9, it may turn into one. To be clear, it will be hard for 3DXP to ever surplant NAND ever as cost/die size always matters. But consider the timing: a 2 TB 3DXP SSD this year would be as foolish a product as a 2 TB NAND SSD would have been in 1985 (a year after NAND first shipped). Factor one: From a memory maker's perspective, manufactured wafers must be shipped. This is a solid truth in solid state. There are few technical barriers in the PC market from adoption other than price/performance. The market for block controlled 3DXP will find an economic balance as the early devices want to be sold. Factor two: Nothing helps improve the manufacturing process more than the data of manufacturing. 3DXP (or any memory) needs to be manufactured to improve manufacturing to result in an eventual, volume-supported, high-value memory solution. What to do with the early wafer results? See Factor one. Factor three: The PC market and block usage (vs. memory usage) is more tolerant of 'good' early memory that doesn't meet all specifications as the block controller can do well-known 'magic' to correct many issues. Until the manufacturing process is dialed in to enable the high value memory market with volume, the PC market is a great win-win outlet. Gamers, video processors, pro photographers and other storage centric pro's will see a benefit from an 10x speed up at a cost less than DRAM for 'small' (e.g., 16, 32 GB) accelerators. There are multiple protocol specifications for storage cache/acceleration already developed for NAND/HDD that can be taken advantage of for this application (or a heck of a lot of learning already accomplished). NVMe has some too, One interesting physical barrier is how to shoe-horn a M.2 3DXP-based NVMe device into lap-top/2-in-1 designs (or XBox 2?). The one M.2 slot is often busy with the main M.2 NAND-based NVMe SSD. Perhaps the newer controllers enabling NVMe SSDs in BGA form (e.g., Phison E8T) will tend to free the one slot. Two slots isn't impossible, but this choice is possibly one that Intel is mulling over as we discuss this. (I'd expect the drop in peak performance from a four-lane PCIe NVME M.2 device moving to a two-lane PCIe NVMe BGA device would be more than offset by a four PCIe lane Optane/QuantX M.2) Balancing process/memory/SCM/Flash will happen over time, My educated guess is that Optane/QuantX will start as a performance plugin that will price itself into a supply-absorbing market.

HankWalker   1/10/2017 1:04:35 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate Perhaps the issue is that in a corporate environment, today's HDDs are way bigger than needed. It is hard to find a desktop with anything smaller than a 500-1000 GB HDD. But a typical install might be only 50-100 GB, since user files are on a file server. If speed is important, it is probably cheaper to go with 128 GB of SDD than HDD + Optane. For a home PC, fast startup from some flash is probably more cost effective. Even for home PCs the trend is for more cloud storage of user files, which makes all-SDD look attractive, especially considering that SDD instead of HDD and a slower processor might be faster for the same price.

This would mean a whole new breed of enthusiast builds. (Photo : eTeknix/YouTube) At CES 2017, MSI has launched more than 30 brand-new motherboards specifically manufactured to work well with Intel Kaby Lake processor. Lurking somewhere in the corner, a couple of motherboards are also featured, known to be the first desktop AM4 boards to suit the highly anticipated AMD Ryzen processors and the Bristol Ridge APUs. It was also reported that AMD announced just announced a handful of AM4 motherboards hours after the Intel Kaby Lake boards were revealed. That said, the scene at CES 2017 made PC enthusiasts delighted as AMD Ryzen boards go pound-for-pound with Intel Kaby Lake boards. AMD Ryzen Motherboards The MSI X370 Xpower Gaming Titanium for the AMD Ryzen, taking the name from the AM4 X370 chipsets, mimics its Intel Kaby Lake rival board Titanium Z270. The board has lots of first-time features, from DDR4 RAM support to a Game Boost Button, all of which overclocks the game's performance. The AMD Ryzen board also supports M.2 and U.2 solid state drives, holds up to three GPUs, USB 3.0 ports, and a lot more similar features. Another AMD board is the MSI B350 Tomahawk, a toned-down B350 chipset specifically redesigned for Bristol Ridge APUs. With that said, some features will be lacking. It will not have a U.2 slot and it can only fit one M.2 solid state drive as opposed to the Titanium, which can have two. It is also important to note that Bristol Ridge APUs are only available on pre-built systems. Intel Kaby Lake Motherboards A number of Intel Kaby Lake motherboards went on display at MSI's booth. Although there were only a portion of the whole 30 plus boards, the ones present on the show were still overwhelming. MSI displayed them by categories, according to their respective series and models. MSI Enthusiast Gaming series cram in all the bells and whistles gamers would love to have. Starting off with exotic SSDs, to a manual button for gaming performance boost, to Game Boost to superior heat sinks, gamers surely can't wait to have this bad-ass motherboard. On top of that, gamers can plug in up to 3 or 4 graphics cards. Going down to a lower tier, Performance Gaming series pack most of the MSI Enthusiast level boards but will be missing some features. However, this tier makes up for it with their awesome styles. Another set of boards is called the business-centric models. As the name speaks for itself, the purpose of these boards is for everyday computing. The PC specifications are similar to the Performance Gaming series with some deductions. © 2017 Auto World News, All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission.

The company has announced a host of gaming devices and peripherals that include 7 ROG laptops, 4 ROG PCs among gaming motherboards and peripherals. While the 2017 lineup of Asus ROG laptops support 7th gen Intel Core i7 processors, it is the only upgrade that some of the models carry. Though the company hasn't released any pricing information, it says all of its products showcased at the CES 2017 event are available across the globe. Also Read: From Drones to AI, top CES 2017 trends ROG's 2017 gaming notebooks include GX800VH, G701, G752, GL502, GL702, GL553 and GL753. The top of the line GX800VH comes with a tank attached to it, deploying Hydro Over-clocking liquid-cooling system for extreme over clocking performance. Suing the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 in 2-way SLI for graphics, Asus says it is the world's first gaming laptop with an 18-inch 4K UHD panel and NVIDIA G-SYNC. It also has a MechTAG mechanical-switch keyboard, which features anti-ghosting with 30-key rollover, and a customizable ROG Aura RGB LED effects for each key. ROG G752 and G701 are both VR-ready laptops sporting the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 GPU and unlocked Core i7 processors. The laptops deploy a '3D Vapour Chamber' cooling system that Asus claims is ROG-exclusive and keeps the GPU 7-degree Celsius cooler than the usual cooling mechanisms do. G752 and G701 have Full HD display with NVIDIA G-SYNC technology for 120Hz refresh rates, HyperDrive RAID 0, NVMe and PCIe storage and a backlit anti-ghosting keyboard. ROG G701The GL502 and GL702 are smaller in size and a more affordable offerings, that are however VR-ready, come with Intel 7th Generation processors and 120Hz NVIDIA G-SYNC panels, but miss out on the '3D Vapour Chamber' cooling system.

Credit: Blair Hanley Frank More like this Intel says standalone VR is coming by the end of this year Intel eyes chips for mixed reality headsets Intel's new PC, IoT chief brings fresh ideas to the veteran chip maker Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles Intel offered me a chance to try out its new Project Alloy mixed-reality headset prototype on Thursday. For about five minutes, I tried shooting some digital flying robots from the comfort of a replica living room inside the Las Vegas Convention Center. Project Alloy, first announced at Intel’s developer conference last year, is an untethered headset that blends virtual-reality content with information about the physical world around its wearer. It’s designed to give people more freedom of movement when playing games, and also save people from having to buy an expensive gaming rig to play VR games. Based on my brief experience playing the same game that Intel showed on stage Wednesday, the prototype shows a lot of potential. However, it’s hard to know exactly how that will translate into what consumers will get later this year. Intel revealed Wednesday that it’s working with selected manufacturing partners to make Project Alloy devices available in the fourth quarter of 2017. In the meantime, all we have is the Intel-made prototype. It packs in a pair of RealSense depth cameras positioned basically on either side of the user’s nose, along with two RGB cameras at roughly the user’s eye line, and a pair of fisheye cameras at the edge of the visor. Those sensors can be used to render the wearer's surroundings in virtual reality. Its band design is fairly reminiscent of the PlayStation VR headset, with a curved forehead plate attached to an adjustable headband. There’s a large plastic pack on the back of the headband as well. The shooter game that I played lasted only a few minutes, and the headset seemed comfortable enough at the time. It’s hard to know how comfortable the device would be for longer sessions. And again, because this is just a prototype, it’s possible that the commercial versions will feel completely different. In order to get the game up and running quickly, Intel preloaded all the objects in the room onto the Alloy headset. Unfortunately, my headset’s model of the room I was in had drifted slightly relative to the actual objects in the room. That led to me slamming my shin into a coffee table in the center of the room that was supposed to be several inches away. This problem is supposed to be fixed by using the RealSense cameras to detect the positions of objects in real time. In this case, the headset wasn’t set up to do that. There’s still a lot we don’t know about the final hardware, like exactly when it will be available, how much it will cost, and more. Eli Elhadad, the Intel RealSense studio manager, said during my demo that the shipping version of Alloy will have more powerful hardware than the prototype. It will feature a Kaby Lake-based processor, a 400-series RealSense camera and a graphics processing chip from Movidius, which Intel acquired last year. In each case, those upgrades are supposed to provide better performance. It will also be interesting to see if Intel ends up working with Microsoft. The prototype offers untethered mixed-reality experiences, which would fit nicely with Microsoft’s vision for its Windows Holographic platform. The two companies previously announced that they were working together on Alloy, so it seems likely more will come of that.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Intel More like this Lenovo's ThinkPad T570 will have Intel's superfast Optane storage Intel's silence on Optane SSDs raises questions about launch and focus Intel unveils its Optane hyperfast memory Video SanDisk crams 200GB onto MicroSD Intel is known for cranking up PC speeds to new highs, and it's doing the same for storage with the super-fast Optane. Optane, which Intel claims will replace today's SSDs and DRAM, is exciting for many reasons. Game play, PC booting, and productivity applications will be much faster with the new class of storage and memory. Intel has said Optane could be up to 10 times faster than conventional SSDs, but real-world tests on the storage have yet to be done. The first Optane storage was announced at CES, but it's only in the form of low-capacity 16GB and 32GB units to be used as cache and not as primary storage. The initial Optanes will not have a meaty capacity, but it will be a good start to test and play with the storage, said Pat Kannar, marketing director for Precision desktops at Dell. "You are going to see it roll in higher densities and capacities over the next few years, and different form factors too," Kannar said. Optane still remains a bit of a mystery, but here's what we know based on data gathered from Intel and PC makers. What is Optane? Optane is based on a technology called 3D Xpoint, in which memory cells sit in a three-dimensional mesh. Intel and Micron -- which share many memory manufacturing resources -- cooperated on the development of the technology. The first 16GB and 32GB storage will work only on PCs with Kaby Lake chips. It won't work on PCs with older Intel chips like Skylake or Broadwell or on PCs with AMD chips. While the new Optanes are exclusive to Kaby Lake, that could change in the future.  Ultimately, Intel will ship large-capacity Optane SSDs, which will replace conventional SSDs. Intel will also ship the versatile Optane as a DRAM replacement that could plug into DIMM slots. The Optane memory will be denser and retain data, unlike DRAM, which deletes data once a PC is turned off. When will Optane ship? Intel says the low-capacity Optane storage will ship in the second quarter of this year, and PC makers indicated it could be a while before large-capacity Optane SSDs are available. The large-capacity Optane SSDs will likely be installed in servers before coming to PCs. Facebook and IBM are already testing large-capacity SSDs in servers. Like any new storage technology, Optane won't be cheap. Optane technology is still being produced in limited quantities in a factory in Dalian, China. Production will ramp up over time, reducing the cost of making Optane. Intel is projecting a quick switch to mass production, when prices will start dropping. What systems will Optane be used in? Many PCs that will have the 16GB or 32GB Optane storage installed were announced at CES this week. The storage initially will go into sockets on motherboards. Ultimately, you'll be able to plug large-capacity Optane storage into m.2 or 2.5-inch slots. The first laptop announced was Lenovo's ThinkPad T570, with a price starting at $909. It'll have an optional 16GB Optane PCIe M.2 2242-S3, but the laptop's price will shoot up if you select that storage option. The laptop will ship in March, though the Optane option may be available later. HP's revamped Envy Curved All-in-One 34 with Kaby Lake will get Optane during the spring update to the product, said Mike Nash, vice president of product management for consumer PC and solutions at the company. Nash declined to provide a specific timeline, but it is in line with Intel's planned second-quarter release of Optane. Dell plans to install Optane in some of its Precision laptops and OptiPlex desktops around June. Intel's new "tall" NUC systems -- the NUC7i3BNH with 7th Generation Core i3, NUC7i5BNH with Core i5, and the NUC7i7BNH with Core i7 -- will support Optane. Supermicro also announced new SuperO motherboards for gaming and business PCs with support for Optane. Optane could make hard drives relevant again For Dell's Kannar, Optane will make it feasible to put traditional hard drives into laptops or desktops, especially if you are on a budget. A PC with a hard drive as primary storage and an Optane cache could load the OS and applications faster than an all-SSD system, Kannar said. The trick is that Optane -- which is closer to the CPU -- would need to hold images of the OS and key applications. "It's cheaper to do that in some cases than having an all-SSD system," Kannar said.  But, of course, having Optane alongside SSD as primary storage will be much faster, but more expensive. Optane is plug-and-play for Windows There are also questions of how Optane will work with various OSes. Intel has said software will need to be adjusted to effectively work with Optane. PC makers said it's likely Windows 10 will be aware of Optane, thanks to Intel drivers and technologies like the chipmaker's RST (Rapid Storage Technology), which will harness the speed of Optane. Questions still remain on whether Linux and MacOS will have similar plug-and-play capabilities. Linux is notorious for being late on adding support for new technologies.

Video provided by AFP Newslook Crowds gather to see a BMW concept vehicle at the BMW Group news conference Wednesday at CES in Las Vegas. (Photo: Walden Kirsch/Intel Corporation) LAS VEGAS — Not that long ago, checking in on the state of self-driving car technology meant asking Google's engineers how they were doing. The search company was virtually alone on the autonomous car highway. But in the last four years, that road has gotten crowded. The Consumer Electronics Show has served as a leading indicator of the growing interest in self-driving tech, eventually welcoming to what traditionally was a gadget-fest more than a dozen automakers. Two years ago, Ford CEO Mark Fields even delivered the keynote, a spotlight previously reserved for the likes of Bill Gates. This year, CES, which wraps here Sunday, again puts a spotlight on the mounting competition between not just the automakers but also the suppliers vying to provide the high-tech components that allow vehicles to navigate through a world of obstacles. It's clear now that engineers are able to make cars drive themselves. The bigger issue is how to scale this technology in a way that finds it both culturally embraced and scientifically sound — and is cost effective. As tech companies such as Nvidia, Intel, Harman join major auto brands such Audi, BMW and Volvo — 500 auto-tech companies large and small came to CES this year — in showing off their chips, sensors and smart cars, one has to wonder if this is a winner-take-all contest or if we're creating competing standards that could delay the arrival of a self-driving future. "There's a lot of desire to be the ones who can get there first and monetize this market for self-driving cars and it's causing almost a frenetic activity across the automotive industry, both from automakers and from tech companies," said Karl Brauer, executive publisher of Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book. If the various self-driving car booths here had a singular mission, it was to showcase how much safer the driving world can be thanks to technology. Delphi's Mary Gustanski explains the display inside a self-driving Audi SUV in Las Vegas.  (Photo: Mike Snider, USA TODAY) Auto parts supplier Delphi Automotive gave reporters rides in a 2017 Audi Q5 SUV. Its self-driving system was developed with sensors made by Mobileye and chips from Intel that automatically avoided a collision without input from its driver. "I see the potential for zero accidents and mobility for all simply because drivers have been taken out of the transportation equation," said Doug Davis, who leads Intel's automated driving group. Many automakers have set an eventual goal of zero deaths in their vehicles, remarkable considering that 30,000 die each year in the U.S. and more than a million worldwide. The competition to produce technology that can help car companies reach that milestone is intensifying quickly. AT&T, Intel, Nvidia: latest names in self-driving AT&T announced at CES that it was working with Delphi and Ford on improving vehicle communication with other cars and infrastructure. AT&T is also building a self-driving test center in Michigan with the American Center for Mobility. Intel and Mobileye are working with BMW to deploy 40 self-driving BMWs by the second half of 2017, the companies said here Wednesday. Intel, which announced that it plans to invest in high-definition mapping-firm Here, also is developing autonomous driving hardware and software platforms that could serve as a standard for other innovators to adopt. Meanwhile, Intel competitor Nvidia announced at CES Wednesday that it had landed Germany's ZF Group as its first customer for a car-computing platform powered by its chips that boasts both machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities. Big names in the chip game such as Qualcomm and AMD are also in the hunt. "We are going to see cars become the next major platform to battle over for the semiconductor makers," said Bob O'Donnell, president and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research.

"It is by far the hottest area in terms of tech," O'Donnell said. In Harman's demonstration area at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, the company showed off all the various aspects of autonomous vehicles, including smart ride-sharing cars that adapt the car's settings, display and personal audio zones based on riders' profiles.

Also on display was cybersecurity software to protect your car from hackers. Harman's partners in its autonomous car-tech quest include Apple, Daimler Chrysler, Google, IBM and Microsoft. All this collaboration would seem to bode well, but the truth is even those deeply enmeshed in the self-driving car world believe there are many miles to be driven before the masses enjoy this breakthrough. "No one company can do everything," said Dinesh Paliwal, Harman CEO and Chairman. Even though, "the autonomous car is almost here, we are 10 to 15 years out from the day when you have the majority of the cars with smarts that interact with each other through the cloud." In the meantime, expect auto-tech breakthroughs to trickle down into new vehicles in the form of increasingly sophisticated driver-assist features, just as driver-assisted parking and automatic braking have so far. USA TODAY Toyota car gives driver an artificial intelligence buddy And along the way, some companies may fall to the wayside, as did some in the transition from traditional cell phones to today's smartphones. "The next 10 years is going to be as influential in the car and personal transportation world as the smartphone has been in the past ten years," Autotrader's Brauer said. "You are going to see companies disappear because they can't adapt quickly enough." O'Donnell agrees and expects the industry to coalesce around multiple approaches. "It's an exciting area and it’s clear no one owns it. Frankly, it's big enough there may be multiple players."

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing AMD declares Ryzen will be a four-year architecture, details overclocking plans, emphasizes hard launch AMD declares Ryzen will be a four-year architecture, details overclocking plans, emphasizes hard launch By Joel Hruska on January 6, 2017 at 5:08 pm Comment AMD released some additional information about its upcoming Ryzen chips at CES this week. Having spent over four years designing the architecture, the company plans to keep it around for at least that long. That’s according to CTO Mark Papermaster, who was on-hand to discuss the chip. First things first — AMD is promising a hard launch for Ryzen, without any paper launches, limited availability, or limited product introductions. When Zen debuts it’ll debut in multiple (still unknown) configurations, not a single eight-core part. As PCWorld details, Papermaster also confirmed the four-year target and emphasized that it didn’t mean AMD wouldn’t iterate the core. “We’re not going tick-tock,” Papermaster said. “Zen is going to be tock, tock, tock.” There are several ways to read this sentence. Tick-tock refers to Intel’s previous practice of introducing new CPU architectures in one product cycle and new manufacturing nodes in the other. AMD has never strictly deployed an equivalent approach over multiple product cycles. I wouldn’t necessarily conclude that Papermaster is saying AMD won’t deploy Zen on new manufacturing nodes over time, but that AMD intends to implement an aggressive series of tweaks and improvements to the current core as time goes by. There’s a significant lag between when a design tapes out and when it ships to consumers. This means AMD’s CPU design team is almost certainly hard at work on Zen’s successor already, even though Zen hasn’t actually shipped yet. While I can’t make any concrete predictions about how Zen will compete against specific products in Intel’s lineup, the demos we’ve seen and the product information already available has convinced me that Ryzen will be at least a meaningful and significant improvement on AMD’s overall power efficiency, performance, and performance-per-watt. With Intel’s CPU performance largely stuck and performance gains relegated to single-digit increases year-on-year, there’s a great deal of excitement for Ryzen. Even if it doesn’t seize the pole position from every price point, there’s pent-up demand for strong parts at good pricing. AMD wants to capitalize on that, and the best way to do so is to keep delivering core improvements year-over-year. I think we can reasonably look forward to that. The first Ryzen APUs are probably going to be DDR4-based, but there’s no reason for AMD not to push into HBM2 as that standard becomes more affordable. Power consumption and efficiency will continue to be important targets in years to come because AMD is unlikely to match Intel clock-for-clock and core-for-core with its very first launch. Ryzen is the beginning of AMD’s comeback, not the end of it, and setting a four-year target for the architecture now makes sense. It also gives AMD time to think about what it wants to come next. Intel’s Kaby Lake debut this week didn’t do much to excite the enthusiast community, but we’ll have a much better sense of how the two chips compare once we get a little closer to Ryzen’s still-unspecified (Q1) launch date. Overclocking features, Crossfire Meanwhile, PCWorld’s Brad Chacos reports on some interesting news on the overclocking front. All AMD Ryzen CPUs will be unlocked and overclockable, but only three motherboard chipsets — X370, X300, and B350 will have overclocking support. If current rumors are accurate, that corresponds to the upcoming enthusiast-class chipset (X370), mainstream (X300), and small form factor (X300) chipsets. That’s most of the chipsets AMD is launching (most of the non-budget ones, at least) and should cover virtually the entire overclocking market. AMD motherboards have historically been cheaper than their Intel counterparts, so this shouldn’t be a major issue. Crossfire and SLI support will only be implemented on the X370, however. According to AMD, the relative handful of people who use multi-GPUs always use higher-end motherboards. Practically, this makes sense, since most people can’t afford or don’t want a second card, and if you do want one, you can probably afford a slightly more expensive motherboard. Given the typical price gap between AMD and Intel we don’t see this being a major issue, either.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 6, 2017 at 5:00PM Earlier this week, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) released a second wave of chips from its seventh-generation Core processor family, also commonly referred to by the code name Kaby Lake. Image source: Intel.  The company released an initial set of processors based on this architecture targeted at thin-and-light/2-in-1 computers late last year, but now the company is releasing chips to target the broader personal computer market. These chips will power desktop computers, high-performance notebooks, and other devices. Here are three things that investors should know about these new chips. They're built using 14-nanometer+ technology In the past, Intel would usually transition to a new manufacturing technology (named "[XY]-nanometer"), build two generations' worth of products using that technology, and then transition to an all-new manufacturing technology. These all-new technologies were expected to deliver benefits in terms of performance, power consumption, and chip area. However, due to the difficulties associated with transitioning to the company's upcoming 10-nanometer technology, the company's latest processors are built on a performance-enhanced variant of the company's 14-nanometer technology, known as 14-nanometer+. This technology allowed the company to deliver more performance with this product family without having to grapple with the challenges associated with an unhealthy manufacturing technology. The catch? Intel doesn't get a chip-area reduction with this new technology. The 14-nanometer+ technology is likely in good shape at this point, meaning that the company is unlikely to face cost-structure problems or supply constraints as it did in the early innings of the transition from 22-nanometer technology to 14-nanometer technology. Image source: Intel.  Big boosts for low-power laptops The biggest gains in performance relative to the prior-generation sixth-generation Core processors, or Skylake processor family, seem to come in power-constrained mobile form factors. For example, Intel's seventh-generation Core processor lineup includes a chip known as the Core i7-7560U. This is a dual-core processor rated at a 15-watt thermal-design power, complete with the company's Iris Plus graphics technology. The chip runs at a base speed of 2.4GHz, a single-core turbo speed of 3.8GHz, and a dual-core turbo speed of 3.7GHz. The direct predecessor to this chip, known as the Core i7-6560U, ran at a base speed of 2.2GHz, a single-core turbo speed of 3.2GHz, and a dual-core turbo speed of 3.1GHz. That's an 18.75% gain in single-core frequency and a 19.35% gain in dual-core turbo frequency -- both substantial uplifts in performance. In higher performance/power products, there are still gains, but they're less substantial. The company's workhorse in gaming laptops, the 45-watt Core i7-6700HQ, ran at a base speed of 2.6GHz and offered single-, dual-, and quad-core turbo speeds of 3.5GHz, 3.3GHz, and 3.1GHz, respectively. The follow-on to this part, the Core i7-7700HQ, runs at a base speed of 2.8GHz, and offers single-, dual-, and quad-core turbo speeds of 3.8GHz, 3.6GHz, and 3.4GHz, respectively. The frequency gains here are between 8.5% and 10% -- tangible performance increases, to be sure, but not quite as robust as the gains seen in the very low-power processors. Whatever improvements Intel made to the manufacturing technology and the chip design appear to have been geared more at lower-power chips -- the bulk of the market -- rather than the higher-power/performance models. The lineup is all done There have been rumors making the rounds that Intel is planning a processor known as Kaby Lake-Refresh U -- essentially, variants of the 15-watt Kaby Lake chips that just launched, but with four processor cores instead of just two. Given that these appeared to be called Kaby Lake, it wasn't clear whether or not these chips would be part of, perhaps, a third wave of seventh-generation Core processors that would launch later. However, thanks to a relatively new leak from generally reliable website BenchLife.info, it appears that Intel plans to kick off the eighth-generation Core processor family with these chips. This strongly suggests, then, that Intel has completed the rollout of its seventh-generation Core processors. Investor takeaway Intel has made it clear that it aims to deliver new products to the marketplace on an annual cadence, irrespective of any challenges that the company faces in trying to migrate to all-new manufacturing technologies. With the seventh-generation Core lineup, it looks as though the company has made good on bringing enhanced products to the marketplace, with the improvements most evident in the segments of the market that are most sensitive to power consumption/power efficiency. That said, a single data point doesn't make a trend -- it'll be interesting to see if Intel can sustain this annual product cadence over a longer time horizon. After all, Intel's prior Tick-Tock methodology worked great early on, but execution problems cropped up, leading the company to formally abandon the methodology after less than a decade -- with cracks in the armor showing up well before then.

It has a motherboard, memory, storage, Wi-Fi radio and can even pack Intel's latest Kaby Lake processor. Yet it's only about with size and thickness of a few credit cards. You insert it into any dumb monitor and instantly have a computer as powerful as your laptop. When I was first told about the Compute Card, I expected something a little smaller than a Raspberry Pi, with exposed circuit boards and ports, but this tiny computer is housed inside a thin case of metal. It can be dropped in a pocket or forgotten in your backpack with ease. And as far as Intel and many of its partners are concerned, the Compute Card is the future of computing. The Compute Card port, a new, as yet unnamed, standard. What's really extraordinary about the Compute Card isn't its minuscule size, but its consistency. No matter the specs of the Compute Card it will always the same 5mm thick device with the exact same port (as yet unnamed, but its similar to a PCI Express bus). Which means a smart fridge built with a Compute Card slot can instantly be upgraded. The same goes for a smart hub or smart TV — The Compute Card will allow you to make these devices smart again when their brains become obsolete after a couple of years. The size of the thing could also make it easy for people who split their work between a home computer and work computer. Instead of lugging home a 1kg-plus laptop you can just pop the Compute Card out of one dock, take it home and pop it into another, with all your files, processes and settings remaining unchanged. A dock concept built by Intel. That silver bar? That's the end of the Compute Card. But it's going to be a while before everyone in your family owns a Compute Card. The uber-tiny device was built in collaboration with Foxconn, a major electronics manufacturer (and as of recently, the owner of Sharp), and will first be appearing, not on the back of your monitor, or slotted into your phone, but inside Sharp displays, like those giant ones you see at shopping centres and hotels and schools. Sharp and Foxconn are thrilled at the development of the Compute Card, with Foxconn Executive VP & General Manager Mark Chien telling Gizmodo he expects to see it not just in Sharp products, but in other Foxconn devices such as smart vending machines and Foxconn's own automated factories. The dock built by Sharp and put on the back of it's displays meant for business and education markets. But Foxconn's involvement doesn't just mean more automated factories and cool Sharp displays. Foxconn builds the products for nearly every single major computer manufacturer in the US. Apple, Dell, Lenovo and HP all have their products pieced together in Foxconn factories, and Foxconn's enthusiasm over the Compute Card will absolutely trickle down to those mega-corporate customers. The Compute Card will be launching later this year, with major announcements promised at Computex in Taiwan in May. There's no word on pricing, and Intel stresses that although anyone can buy a Compute Card when they're available, you will still need to build the dock to power the device and cool it, and that will likely be outside the realm of possibilities for your average tinkerer.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Intel announces its first 5G modem, 5Gbps download speeds to launch late 2017 By John Hoff - January 6, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Intel is preparing for the influx of “billions” of IoT (internet-of-things) devices in 2017 and onwards, and for that the internet needs to be ready with a new standard. Intel is announcing a mature 5G modem which will be ready by end of 2017, a new standard to deal with the “things” that will connect to it. What is 5G? Well, if we’re talking of download speeds, the Intel 5G modem satisfies that standard – hitting 5Gbps download speeds through bandwidth aggregation and usage of ultra-low latency frequencies. This standard uses a gamut of technologies, including MIMO configurations, advanced channel coding, and interworking with 4G as fallback. See the video below for better information on the new standard. The main problem is that most of the world’s infrastructure is just now catching up to 4G even, and Intel says these “aren’t designed to accommodate the massive bandwidth required to support such an evolution, or the ultra-low latency needed to allow devices or even vehicles to react to split-second events.” The Intel 5G modem stands out in that the modem is able to work, after a fashion, with today’s infrastructure. Intel is eyeing a sample modem available by second half of 2017, and mass manufacturing to follow right after. Expect a number of tech companies to catch up with 5G as well starting at the middle of this year.

CyberPowerPC and Syber Gaming are certainly making the most of the moment, and have announced plans for refreshing their desktop and notebook lines with 2017's hot hardware. The Syber Gaming XL Series of desktops is coming in the second quarter of 2017. These rigs will be housed in a massive enclosure, spacious enough for elaborate liquid cooling systems and just about any combination of processor and graphics cards that buyers ask the company to install. Intel's Broadwell-E processors and the latest seventh-generation Intel Core processors are available, and even AMD's upcoming Ryzen CPUs are on the list. Next up is the CyberPowerPC Hyper Liquid Series, fitted with the company's hard-tube liquid cooling system. The company claims that its system is 14% better at cooling an overclocked CPU than a Corsair H55, and 27% better at cooling GPUs than regular coolers. There are over five models in this line, and like the Syber Gaming XL series, buyers chan choose among a wide range of internal hardware, including Intel's Kaby Lake CPUs and the upcoming Ryzen processors. Finally, CyberPowerPC has big plans for its gaming notebooks this year. It plans to refresh the majority of its gaming laptops to be ready for the heavy duties of powering virtual reality headsets. The company says it will release models with GeForce GTX 1060 and higher graphics cards for that purpose. CyberPowerPC also has two series of notebooks. The Vector II-Z laptops, available in 15.6" and 17.3" form factors, have 1080p IPS displays, a Core i7-7700HQ CPU, and get their graphics muscle from either GTX 1060 or GTX 1070 graphics cards. Meanwhile, the Tracer II laptops are designed to be ultraportable, though the company didn't specify their sizes. Those machines come equipped with a Core i7-7700HQ, and a choice of GeForce GTX 1050 Ti or GTX 1060 cards. The availability of these desktops and notebooks depends on the hardware inside, as AMD's Ryzen CPUs aren't exactly for sale yet. We don't have pricing on the company's notebooks yet, but the Syber Gaming XL series of desktops starts at $1,000, while the Hyper Liquid series ranges from $1,550 to $6,590. CyberPowerPC backs its full-assembled systems with a limited three-year warranty and liftetime technical support via chat, email or telephone.   Tags: Systems Mobile computing Gaming User name:  Password:  Remember me Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

But experts say preventing attacks like the one on Friday, when a gunman opened fire in a baggage claim area at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, is almost impossible given the large public areas at US airports, despite the billions of dollars spent on security.

More videos Multiple people dead in Florida airport shooting At least nine people have been wounded and multiple people killed in a shooting at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, with officials saying the shooter is in custody. "To the extent it was not in a secure area, it doesn't really identify any issues around airport security," said Robert Mann, an aviation consultant. "A guy walks into a bar, a guy walks into an airport baggage claim room - neither of them are secure." Friday's attack killed five people and injured at least eight, authorities said. Related Content Multiple fatalities, injuries in shooting at Fort Lauderdale Airport, Florida The gunman had arrived on a flight with a checked gun in his bag, Broward County Commissioner Chip LaMarca said on Twitter. The shooter claimed his bag and went to the bathroom to load the gun before coming out and firing, LaMarca said. The shooter was unharmed as law enforcement officers never fired a shot, Israel said, adding it was too early to assign a motive. Advertisement The shooter was identified as Esteban Santiago, 26, and had a US military identification, according to a spokesman for US Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, who spoke with officials at the Transportation Security Administration. Security at most major airports worldwide is generally focused on protecting aircraft from potential attackers and deadly devices, rather than the airports themselves. As a result, much of the space at terminals is easily accessible to the public, with no formal screening before passengers go through checkpoints to get to their departure gates. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Hundreds of people were evacuated to the tarmac amid the shooting at Fort Lauderdale.  Photo: AP The debate over whether to extend security screening to public areas intensified following the bombings inside a terminal at Brussels Airport in March 2016, which killed 32 people and injured hundreds. Some critics have cited as a model Israel's Ben Gurion Airport, where private security companies trained by the national security agency Shin Bet and backed by police officers profile passengers, question individual travellers and use bomb detectors at the airport's entrance.

"It is logistically impractical to try to protect these areas, unfortunately, and the reason is no matter how far you move the boundary out, you will always have some sort of soft target area," Henry Harteveldt, an airline industry analyst, said. It is logistically impractical to try to protect these areas, unfortunately. Henry Harteveldt; airline industry analyst The cost of implementing that type of screening would also be prohibitive, given the number of major US airports. In response to the Florida shooting, law enforcement agencies at several US airports said they beefed up security presence, including in Chicago and New York.

State officials said the riot in Roraima's largest prison was brought under control by elite police forces. Violence between rival drug gangs there had already led to 10 deaths in October. Advertisement Roraima's top security official Uziel de Castro blamed Friday's violence at the state-run prison on the PCC. He later added that it was believed most of the inmates killed Friday were not members of the group responsible for this week's attack on the PCC in Amazonas and indeed had no gang affiliations.

Roston - Jan 6, 2017 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit In addition to its new RennSeat Pro gaming station, Velocity Micro has unveiled new desktop computers offering 7th-generation Intel Core processors. The company hawks these desktops as solutions for gamers, as well as being suitable for office and home use, and for use as workstations. Unlike the RennSeat Pro, these new desktops are available to purchase now from Velocity Micro. It seems the new desktops are renditions of the company’s previous models, only with updated Intel processors, as well as Intel 200-Series chipset motherboards. The company says the clock speeds are faster than that of the previous models, and there’s also improved graphics included. The company’s website shows a bunch of desktop models with the newest Intel hardware, including the company’s Raptor Signature Edition with Intel Core i7 Extreme Edition processors, Intel 750 Series SSD and Samsung 950 Pro options, up to 10Gbps transfers with USB 3.1, as well as personalization options like laser engraving. Prices are all over the board, and depend on which model you get and what configuration it has. The website shows models priced ‘low’ such as the Raptor Z30 SmallBlock starting at $999 USD, and models priced substantially higher, such as the Raptor Signature Edition starting at $3,999 USD. The lowest priced model starts at $849 USD. The updated models are available on the company’s website now; note that not all models on the website list the 7th-gen Intel processors, however.

The release of the unclassified report comes one day after the role of Russia's role in the election of Donald Trump was the subject of a Senate hearing, an event in which senior Republicans urged a tough line on Russia over efforts to sway US political outcomes. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link President-Elect Donald Trump. Photo: AP Trump has repeatedly faced - and dismissed - questions about his relationship with Russia and Vladimir Putin. During his last press conference, Trump mockingly asked Russia to hack Hillary Clinton's emails. On Friday Trump continued to try to downplay accusations that he colluded with a foreign power to support his campaign for the White House. He dismissed concerns about the effect of Russia's hacking of the Democrats emails and subsequent dissemination of the emails as a political "witch hunt." He also said Russian hacking had no influence on the outcome of the 2016 election. Trump has made better relations a rare point of consistency in a campaign that has wilfully lied to and confused the American public as an apparent part of a media strategy to gain support from voters. Trump has used Twitter to criticise the conclusions of US intelligence agencies, an unprecedented behaviour from an incoming American president. Republicans, who maintained their majority in Congress on the coat tails of Trump's win, are left in an awkward position by the role Russia played in the election. In recent months, President Barack Obama has been criticised for not taking the threat of Russia seriously. Now that Republicans are in power, with a Republican soon in the White House, the GOP will be responsible for investigating Russian influence operations. Moreover, Trump's frequent denials suggest he has nothing to lose by a thorough investigation. Even before the US election, Russian influence and social media operations were well known through Europe.  "Russia, like its Soviet predecessor, has a history of conducting covert influence campaigns focused on US presidential elections," the report states, warning that the success of Russia in 2016 will likely embolden it. "We assess Moscow will apply lessons learned from its Putin-ordered campaign aimed at the US presidential election to future influence efforts worldwide, including against US allies and their election processes." Germany, for example, going into elections this year, has sounded increasing concern about the effect of social media-empowered misinformation on its politics.

The release of the unclassified report comes one day after the role of Russia's role in the election of Donald Trump was the subject of a Senate hearing, an event in which senior Republicans urged a tough line on Russia over efforts to sway US political outcomes. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link President-Elect Donald Trump. Photo: AP Trump has repeatedly faced - and dismissed - questions about his relationship with Russia and Vladimir Putin. During his last press conference, Trump mockingly asked Russia to hack Hillary Clinton's emails. On Friday Trump continued to try to downplay accusations that he colluded with a foreign power to support his campaign for the White House. He dismissed concerns about the effect of Russia's hacking of the Democrats emails and subsequent dissemination of the emails as a political "witch hunt." He also said Russian hacking had no influence on the outcome of the 2016 election. Trump has made better relations a rare point of consistency in a campaign that has wilfully lied to and confused the American public as an apparent part of a media strategy to gain support from voters. Trump has used Twitter to criticise the conclusions of US intelligence agencies, an unprecedented behaviour from an incoming American president. Republicans, who maintained their majority in Congress on the coat tails of Trump's win, are left in an awkward position by the role Russia played in the election. In recent months, President Barack Obama has been criticised for not taking the threat of Russia seriously. Now that Republicans are in power, with a Republican soon in the White House, the GOP will be responsible for investigating Russian influence operations. Moreover, Trump's frequent denials suggest he has nothing to lose by a thorough investigation. Even before the US election, Russian influence and social media operations were well known through Europe.  "Russia, like its Soviet predecessor, has a history of conducting covert influence campaigns focused on US presidential elections," the report states, warning that the success of Russia in 2016 will likely embolden it. "We assess Moscow will apply lessons learned from its Putin-ordered campaign aimed at the US presidential election to future influence efforts worldwide, including against US allies and their election processes." Germany, for example, going into elections this year, has sounded increasing concern about the effect of social media-empowered misinformation on its politics.

EVGA Z270 Motherboard Line-Up Across the three models that EVGA is currently launching, there are many similarities, and several different differences.   Let’s take a quick look at each one of them and see what some of the differences are.  We can spend a lot of time discussing the various motherboards and the differences, however we will just touch on several of the features. EVGA Z270 Classified K Starting with their top of the line, Z270 Classified K motherboard, we can immediately see that it is an E-ATX motherboard, so that means there are a few added features.  For storage support, you are looking at all of the most common types supported, with up to 8 SATA 6Gb/s, 2 SATA Express, 1 U.2, 2 M.2 Key-M and 1 M.2 Key-E.  In addition, it’ll support Intel’s Optane drive if you want the latest M.2 drive.  For dedicated graphics solutions, you are limited to 2-Way SLI.  Audio, is supplied by the Creative Sound Core 3D.  Its networking features are no slouch either, supporting two Ethernet ports one Killer E2500 and the other Intel i219 Gigabit NIC; the choice is up to you which you prefer. EVGA Z270 FTW K The EVGA Z270 FTW K is their main enthusiast grade motherboard, and is a standard ATX motherboard.  Storage, is a little less than the Classified K, the Z270 FTW K, EVGA removed the Marvell SATA controller, which causes you to lose two SATA 6Gb/s ports, so the FTW K has 6 SATA 6Gb/s, 2 SATA Express, 1 U.2, 2 M.2 Key-M and 1 M.2 Key-E.  Graphics support is still limited to 2-Way SLI.  Another change comes from the removal of the Creative Core 3D chip, taking you back to Intel HD Audio.  Ethernet is also the same between the two models with two Ethernet ports one Killer E2500 and the other Intel i219 Gigabit NIC.  However, for power, EVGA has reduced the power switching from a 13 Phase PWM system on the Classified K, to 11 Phase PWM on the FTW K. EVGA Z270 Stinger The last EVGA motherboard is the EVGA Z270 Stinger, a mini-ITX motherboard, that EVGA has squeezed on a lot of features.  DDR4 memory support is one obvious change, going from 4x DDR4 down to 2x DDR4.  Storage has also been decreased to 4 SATA 6Gb/s ports, 1 U.2, 1 M.2 Key-M and 1 M.2 Key-E (which is taken up by an included 802.11AC Dual-Band WiFi + Bluetooth card).  EVGA moved the M.2 Key-M slot to the back of the motherboard to save space on the front of the board.  Graphics has been changed to just one PCIe x16 slot, so no SLI (shouldn’t come as any surprise though).  Networking was also changed a little to support just the Intel i219 Gigabit NIC and the 802.1AC WiFi card. EVGA Z270 Stinger There is one big trend that is missing from the EVGA motherboards, which some like, and others won’t be too happy about;  the inclusion of RGB lighting on the motherboard!  EVGA has kept it simple, not only with just three models to choose from, but also keeping the color scheme neutral and without covering the motherboard in RGB LEDs. That wraps up a quick overview of the EVGA Z270 motherboard line-up, you can find out more information on the EVGA Z270 motherboard line-up by visiting their website here.

It's not restrictions," Brian Krzanich told CNBC. "It's really about making the U.S. more competitive." (AP photo) Print Email Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive By Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive The Oregonian Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 06, 2017 at 12:30 PM, updated January 06, 2017 at 5:48 PM comments Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich says last month's meeting between president-elect Donald Trump and a cadre of tech executives focused on cutting taxes and boosting high-tech manufacturing. Returning manufacturing jobs to the United States was a theme of Trump's campaign and his presidential transition. Trump has called out companies who shift production jobs abroad and demanded the U.S. should take a tougher line with China in particular. The chipmaker is unusual among its high-tech peers in that it makes most of its products in the U.S. The company's largest and most advanced operations are in Hillsboro, where Intel engineers and produces each new generation of microprocessor. In a Friday interview with CNBC at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Krzanich said Intel sells three-quarters of its chips abroad. He said China is the company's fastest-growing market and sought to discourage the prospect of a trade dispute. "The real answer is not a trade war. It's not restrictions," Krzanich said. "It's really about making the U.S. more competitive, lowering the tax rates, making it easier for people to do manufacturing here." Intel is Oregon's largest private employer. The company had 19,500 people working in Hillsboro before a series of layoffs and buyouts last year eliminated more than 13 percent of Intel jobs companywide. Intel won't disclose its current Oregon headcount. Intel has had a prominent role at the Consumer Electronics Show in each of the four years Krzanich has been CEO. In the prior three years Krzanich gave the opening keynote -- this time, Intel showed off virtual reality technology and touted other new products. On Wednesday, the company announced what it calls the world's first 5G modem. Having missed the smartphone and tablet revolution, Intel has all but given up on the current generation of 4G wireless technology. Instead, it's focusing on a forthcoming, faster wireless standard. Intel hopes 5G will do more than just enable faster smartphones. The chipmaker says 5G wireless technology will enable connected devices with very little lag, or latency, in their communication, linking devices in a wireless network that will operate almost as if they were a single machine. It will be at least a few years, though, before 5G wireless is ready for prime time, and it may be several years before it's commonplace. Intel also said Wednesday that it plans to roll out a fleet of 40 self-driving cars late this year through its partnership with BMW and Israeli camera company Mobileye. Intel hopes its processors will find a place in the emerging field of autonomous driving, and has a created a new group within the company to focus on that market. And earlier in the week Intel formally launched its latest generation of microprocessor. -- Mike Rogoway; twitter: @rogoway; 503-294-7699 Inside Silicon Forest About Mike Rogoway Email Mike Rogoway Follow @rogoway Most Read Active Discussions About Us About OregonLive.com Our Journalists Contact the newsroom Join our team Frequently Asked Questions Subscriber Services Advertise with us Subscribe Today The Oregonian Email Newsletters Already a Subscriber Manage your Subscription Delivery Feedback Place a vacation hold Make a payment OregonLive.com Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Opinion Obituaries Videos Weather Sitemap & search Your Regional News Pages Clackamas County Gresham Portland Washington County Mobile iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps More on OregonLive.com Classifieds Jobs Autos Rentals Real Estate Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sponsor Content Local Deals Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Pinterest | Instagram | Tumblr Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2016 Oregon Live LLC.

Daniel Cooper, @danielwcooper 01.06.17 in Wearables Comments 450 Shares Share Tweet Share Save At last year's CES Intel and New Balance announced that they would team up to develop a sports-focused smartwatch. One day shy of a year later, and the pair revealed it to the world with significantly less fanfare than before. Intel's press conference was all about VR, leaving all talk of wearables to a press release that crossed the wire before the event even kicked off. So what does that mean for the New Balance RunIQ? Gallery: Intel & New Balance RunIQ | 11 Photos 11 +7 It's a pretty neat-looking device -- certainly not out of place alongside other chunky running watches from other brands like Garmin with its 1.39-inch AMOLED display and fat bezels. If there's one thing that is disappointing, however, it's how chintzy the plastic device feels, betraying its intention as a rugged piece of running gear. It's also something of a mutt, with the fingerprints of four companies all over its DNA. Intel, for instance, used its hardware know-how to build the device itself while New Balance shaped its style and overall branding. Google obviously created Android Wear -- the first generation of the software, rather than version 2.0 -- and Strava is providing native access to its social network for runners. It's worth adding that this device is aimed squarely at marathoners and their ilk, with all the features geared toward slightly more serious athletes. One of the reasons the watch is shipping before the arrival of Google's redesigned watch OS is that Intel is confident it's done enough to stand apart from the crowd. Intel VP Dr. Jerry Bautista explained that his engineers have spent a long time tweaking the power management of the software for better battery life. One of the other innovations he's proud of is ensuring that the display will always show the time, if not the rest of the UI. New Balance, meanwhile, polled users to find out that runners apparently hate touching their watch's display during a run. So, the company insisted that there be physical controls on either side of the crown for one-touch lap times. As an added benefit, this allows runners to use the device even while wearing gloves. After all, if you're running in the Pacific Northwest in January, you don't want to have to expose your fingers to the elements. Another neat tweak that Intel is proud of is the raised curve that surrounds the optical heart rate monitor on the underside of the case. It apparently encourages the skin on your wrist to push up into the space immediately around the optical sensor. That way, you get less light interference and a better, more accurate heart rate track than you would with other devices. If Intel is to be believed, this is the best implementation of an Android Wear running watch, as the fitness features are mostly custom. The running app, which is Strava-branded, has been totally rewritten from the ground up for better performance and to be used without a smartphone. Once you've used your phone to pair the watch to your account, the device will then independently sync your stats whenever you hit WiFi. One thing the device is lacking is a better music function, mostly because Intel and New Balance held off on altering the software. Knowing that Android Wear 2 will open up implementation beyond Google Play Music users, the two companies chose to wait for the update before making meaningful changes there. Speaking of which, the device will get an over-the-air update to the latest OS, but not before Intel has had chance to tweak it where necessary. We'll reserve judgment on if the litany of small tweaks set the RunIQ ahead of other Android Wear devices in the same category. But while we wait to review the device, you can pre-order the watch for delivery on February 1st. Oh, and if you notice, we have images of a cool gold-and-gray model -- an alternative to the stock all-black edition. It's a limited paint job of just 1,500 that will be available on a first-come, first-served basis when the device hits stores. Click here to catch up on the latest news from CES 2017.

Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 6 January 2017 at 03:20 PM EST. 16 Comments This week Intel launched the desktop/socketed Kaby Lake CPUs. Over the next week will be many Linux CPU benchmarks on Phoronix so here is your last opportunity to put in any special benchmark requests. Intel is said to be sending over a Core i7 7700K next week while already I ended up buying a Core i5 7600K CPU after finding it for a deal and having a lot of other Core i5 CPUs to make it for an interesting comparison and that many Phoronix readers will probably find the i5-7600K to be interesting for around the $250 USD price-point. (You can currently find it retail for $243.) The i5-7600K arrived this morning and as alluded to in some other Phoronix articles already, I've begun upgrading all my benchmarking systems to Ubuntu 16.10 + Linux 4.10 kernel for running some fresh comparison data points. That will still be going on for the next few days and will have the Core i5 7600K followed by the Core i7 7700K numbers next week. I've already been running a number of CPU benchmarks, but as usual, looking for any last-minute test requests you'd like to see with Kaby Lake. Here's a look at some of the other CPU numbers so far, again, just a portion of what it will look like when all my available Linux systems are freshly tested: A lot of our usual test suspects for good CPU workloads... Of course, everything being compiled on-host and "-O3 -march=native" for each CPU. I also included some of our newer test profiles like Blender and Darktable to make things more interesting: And much more. You can see the benchmarks I am running so far on the systems I have tested so far with Ubuntu 16.10 + Linux 4.10 via this OpenBenchmarking.org result merge. On the systems with integrated graphics I also have separate Vulkan/OpenGL benchmarks being run that are not part of this OpenBenchmarking.org result file. Am I missing any other interesting tests? Let me know as soon as possible; particularly if you are a Phoronix Premium member or have tipped via PayPal now or in the past. Especially for premium members I try to honor all test requests. Available test profiles can be found here or if you're trying to recommend a new test be added, ideally accompanied by an example test script that automates the benchmark you desire and/or sufficient documentation to make it possible. Back to many more Linux CPU benchmarks... 16 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Companies lined up at CES 2017 to paint a future about super-fast mobile internet that doesn't yet exist. By Mary-Ann Russon January 6, 2017 18:25 GMT Close CES 2017: The best tech on show IBTimes UK The exact international standards to define 5G – the next generational leap in mobile internet technology – are yet to be set, but the work has begun to devise these specifications. The global mobile standards body GSMA has its heart set on 5G networks being rolled out around the world by 2020. Numerous mobile operators are now trialling different methods to get the ultra-fast speeds needed for 5G, such as using the "millimetre wave" radio frequency bands (30GHz to 300GHz). Millimetre waves, also known as extremely high frequency (EHF), offer much bigger bandwidths, but in the past it only worked for short distances (such as a few kilometres) due to high free space loss and atmospheric absorption. If you want to have super-fast mobile internet, you're going to need infrastructure, hardware and software to help run the network, and continued work on the 5G New Radio (NR) specifications by the 3GPP standards body means that tech companies now have a clearer idea of what they might need, which is why 5G announcements are now taking centre stage. Excitement over the promise of 5G is exploding at CES 2017. Here's what tech heavyweights had to say about the future of ultra-fast mobile internetGetty Images Join IBTimes UK as we highlight the most interesting 5G innovations mentioned at CES 2017. And in case you're wondering what we need it for, here's a guide to all the great things we can do with 5G. Ericsson, Qualcomm and AT&T trialling 5G on millimetre wave Ericsson has developed a prototype mobile base station using Multi-user, Multiple Input, Multiple Output (MU-MIMO) technology, and together with a prototype mobile device containing a chip by Qualcomm, the two firms are working with US mobile operator AT&T to conduct interoperability testing and over-the-air field trials using the 5G NR specifications. This is exciting because if it works, it would be an actual demonstration of a mobile device receiving 5G mobile speeds to upload and download data over the network. The trials would be useful to engineers working out the niggling issues in order to make millimetre wave work over long distances, and the results of experiments will probably help 3GPP with their work too. Intel launches the "world's first" 5G modem Intel has launched a 5G modem to enable 5G-enabled devices to work across a wide range of industriesIntel Semiconductor manufacturer Intel has announced that it has developed the world's first global 5G modem, designed to be used in everything from mobile devices and home routers to self-driving cars and drones. The modem supports millimetre wave, as well as radio spectrum bands below 6GHz and the 5G NR specifications. Intel also hopes to be able to offer useful feedback to 3GPP when it starts testing its modems in mid-2017. Intel has also created a 5G Mobile Trial Platform that is currently being used in active trials around the world and the modem will also be used to test out use cases for self-driving autonomous cars with a special automotive 5G platform. Intel announced that it would be working with mobile infrastructure provider Nokia, industrial IoT platform provider GE, car manufacturer BMW and mobile operator Vodafone to test out how 5G can work across many different fields. Nokia: We're working towards 5G and powering all your trials Nokia is teaming up with Intel and other partners to help provide the infrastructure needed for 5G technology testsTwitter / Peter Jarich Mobile infrastructure provider Nokia has its fingers in a lot of pies in a bid to help prepare mobile operators for 5G. You've probably heard of their 4.5G Pro and 4.9G solutions, which are a sort of early-stage 5G. These help operators to get the most out of their 4G networks using virtualisation and software defined networking (SDN), as well as preparing them to migrate their networks to 5G when the standards are ready. To that end, Nokia announced at CES that it managed to achieve mobile data speeds of close to 1Gbps using 4.5G Pro technology in a trial with T-Mobile in the US. The demonstration made use of existing technologies already live on the network including including carrier aggregation, 256 QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) and 4x4 MIMO. Currently T-Mobile's network offers up to 400Mbps, which means the boost can offer a faster network until 5G. Apart from working with mobile operators, Nokia is teaming up with Intel to help trial multiple use cases where 5G technology is needed, such as providing the base stations needed to make a connected road with self-driving cars possible. Nokia is also really interested in helping to make live virtual reality (VR) broadcasts a norm, and to that end it has been demonstrating event broadcasts at CES with Huffington Post using the Nokia OZO VR camera. Intel has provided the chip to help process the data, while Nokia has created a simulated 5G network to help send VR video wirelessly to smartphone-enabled VR headsets. Qualcomm: 5G will be huge and enable connectivity all the time As mentioned above, Qualcomm is teaming up with Ericsson and AT&T on 5G NR over-the-air field trials to prepare for and model wide-scale 5G deployments. And similar to Nokia, the semiconductor manufacturer also wants to help improve current mobile connectivity by extending the reach of what 4G can do for now. To help speed up connected car and self-driving car development, which will require a huge amount of reliable mobile bandwidth, Qualcomm has launched a connected car platform that works with the Snapdragon X16 LTE modem to offer peak download speed of up to 1Gbps for connected cars. In his keynote espousing the many benefits 5G will have on the world once it is ready, Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf touched on the fact that 5G will enable users to stream 4K and even 8K video, as well as being able to whip out smartphones to engage in AR and VR experiences on the go, and helping drones to process more data and make decisions faster in mid-flight. To make this possible, Qualcomm has launched the Snapdragon 835 next-gen smartphone chip that it claims will help deliver better VR and 4K video experience, as well as an improved overall experience and battery life performance. All of the processing and decision-making is happening on these drones in real time. #CES2017 pic.twitter.com/0SiNlzmcQt— Qualcomm (@Qualcomm) January 6, 2017 More from IBTimes UK F1-engined Mercedes AMG hypercar teased again at CES technology show No Windows car, but Microsoft's Cortana is coming to next-gen Nissan and BMW cars Google Assistant expands from Pixel smartphones to Android TV, cars and smartwatches Live over #5G.

The major updates for this year's NUCs include the latest seventh-generation Intel Core processors and support for Optane memory. Intel's Optane memory, co-developed with Micron, is a non-volatile memory technology that's faster than flash but denser than DRAM. It doesn't replace standard RAM in these NUCs, which have two familiar SO-DIMM sockets for up to 32GB of DDR4 at 2133 MT/s. Instead, Optane is meant to offer speedy storage, possibly in an M.2 format, to provide fast boot times and application launching. This year's NUC models offer a number of processor and storage options. The top of the line NUC7i7BNH is powered by a Core i7-7567U, a dual-core processor with a max turbo clock of 4.0GHz and a 28W TDP. Intel's Iris Plus Graphics 650 IGP runs the display. For storage, there's an M.2 slot and room for a 2.5" HDD or SSD up to 9.5mm tall. All this hardware fits into a chassis that's only 4.5" x 4.4" x 2" (or 11.5 cm x 11. cm x 5.1 cm).     The NUC models with Core i5 or Core i3 CPUs are available in two configurations: one with a slot for a 9.5-mm-tall drive, and a low-profile model that only has room for an M.2 unit. The low-profile variants (whose names end in K rather than H) have similar dimensions, but are only 1.4" (3.5 cm) tall. The kits labeled NUC7i5BNH and NUC7i5BNK are powered by Intel's Core i5-7260U, a dual core processor with a max turbo clock of 3.4GHz and a 15W TDP. This processor integrates Intel's Iris Plus Graphics 640 unit. The Core i3 variants of this year's NUCs, the NUC7i3BNH and NUC7i3BNK, have Intel's Core i3-7100U processor inside. This dual-core CPU has a base frequency of 2.4GHz, a 15W TDP, and offer up an Intel HD Graphics 620 IGP. The rest of the feature set in these NUCs remains quite solid. They have dual-array front microphones for taking advantage of Cortana, an HDMI 2.0 port, and Intel's 802.11ac dual-band wireless connectivity. There's also a Thunderbolt 3 port on tap that can offer USB 3.1 and DisplayPort connectivity. A Micro SDXC slot with UHS-I support and Bluetooth 4.2 support round out the list of features.   Tags: Systems User name:  Password:  Remember me Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Intel wants in on the IoT action, and to that end the company showed off its Compute Card at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The Compute Card contains all the necessary parts for a contemporary computer: a system-on-a-chip, RAM, some storage, and wireless connectivity. Intel says the Card has "flexible I/O options" that allow hardware makers to easily integrate the Card into their devices, and mentions "digital signage and kiosks, All-in-Ones, smart TVs and appliances" among the intended use cases. Intel will offer the Compute Card in multiple performance levels. Device designers pack Compute Card compatibility into their devices, then they can choose the Card with the performance level needed to meet the design goals. The big blue silicon guys say this gives third parties additional flexibility, since they don't need to worry about validation if they realize they need more computing power halfway through a project. The Compute Card will be available with a wide-range of SoCs, including units packing "seventh-generation Core processors." We have a feeling this phrasing might mean Y-series chips that used to be called "Core m" before consumers seemingly turned away from that particular sub-brand. The card's physical package measures a tidy 3.7" x 2.2" x 0.2" (9.5 cm x 5.5 cm x 0.5 cm). The Card connects to a host device with an extensible "new standard connector" that's based on USB Type-C and can handle USB, PCIe, HDMI, and DisplayPort connectivity. The partner list for the Compute Card includes big hitters like Dell, Lenovo, and Sharp, along with players like Seneca Data, InFocus, DTx, TabletKiosk, and Pasuntech. That list suggests that initial uses for the Compute Card may trend closer to traditional industrial and embedded applications, rather than consumer-focused IoT devices. Intel says the Compute Cards will start shipping in mid-2017.   Tags: Systems Mobile computing User name:  Password:  Remember me Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

The company’s two-headed battle against Intel on the CPU front and Nvidia on the GPU side has resulted in a lack of meaningful updates for either, and a general feeling of indifference among many AMD faithful. But 2017 could change all of that, and even though Nvidia and Intel have both built even more impressive leads over their competitor than they already had, AMD isn’t throwing in the towel just yet. Don't Miss: Two Google Homes are arguing on Twitch and thousands of people can’t look away AMD vs. Intel Intel’s i7 processors lead the charge for the majority of the PC gaming community, and enthusiasts are more invested in the company’s flagship chips — like the i7-6700k — than ever before. AMD has always played second fiddle, but its new “Zen” chip architecture is already looking very promising. Early tests on a pre-release version of the chip suggests that it will easily best Intel’s i7-6700k in many computing tasks, which is good news, but it also trailed many of Intel’s chips in gaming-specific tests. However, as the chip was running under the clock speed that it is expected to ship with, it’s hard to say how much those tests really matter. Add to that the fact that Intel’s next generation of desktop processors — namely the i7-7700k — wasn’t included in the comparison, and it’s impossible to predict how the final figures will actually pan out. All that said, AMD’s Zen architecture is indeed extremely interesting and could improve overall system performance and even frame rates in demanding games, if the software is properly optimized to take advantage of it. AMD vs Nvidia Potentially even more crucial to AMD’s overall success in the eyes of PC gamers will be how its new Vega GPUs perform against Nvidia’s 10XX, and Titan graphics card lineups. Nvidia has been absolutely killing it on the GPU front, and it’s hard to find an enthusiast-minded gaming build list on Reddit or elsewhere without an Nvidia card on the list. AMD desperately needs to hit a home run with its next generation of Radeon GPUs, and it thinks it’s done so. The new Vega GPU architecture (which replaces the current Polaris tech) boast double the high-bandwidth memory of their predecessors. AMD says that lets the cards render faster, and it’s been doing its best to convince everyone that Vega will top Intel’s cards handily. In a recent video demo, AMD showed off a Vega card running 2016’s Doom at between 60 and 70 frames per second, on “ultra” graphics quality and at 4k resolution. According to Techspot, Nvidia’s 1080 can’t even maintain 60fps under the same circumstances. But AMD has another trick up its sleeve when it comes to establishing graphics dominance: Getting cozy with developers. It’s not a new tactic by any means, and it’s something Intel has been doing for ages, but it’s starting to pay off for AMD. EA, which built its marquee shooter Battlefield 1 with AMD in mind, is just one example of how the company is pushing developers to consider that not all PC gamers are buying Intel and Nvidia machines. Running under Direct X12, Battlefield 1 often performed better on AMD’s cards than it did on Nvidia’s top-of-the-line GPUs, based on many user reports (and complaints). Then there’s the matter of cost. AMD’s hardware isn’t cheap by any means, but it doesn’t carry the same “Nvidia Tax” premium that its competitor’s cards do. If AMD can equal or even top Nvidia’s pure graphical muscle while offering its cards at a lower price point, we may be in for a very interesting 2017 in the PC gaming world.

DJIA S&P 500 NASDAQ Markets Today The Data Center Will Power the Intel of the Future, CEO Krzanich Contends Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said that while Intel is far from giving up on its PC business, the focus has shifted more towards data centers. Giovanni Bruno Jan 6, 2017 12:18 PM EST On a day in which the latest jobs report was issued, Intel (INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich discussed the future of jobs at Intel as the company announced last April a restructuring that would cut 12,000 jobs globally. "There was a portion of this that was about reduction and a portion that was about re-structuring how our workforce looked as we moved from a PC-focused company to focused on data centers, IOT and things like virtual reality," Krzanich told CNBC's "Squawk Alley" Friday morning. Krzanich reiterated that though the restructuring effort does carry the unfortunate implication of having to cut 12,000 jobs, there was "absolutely some hiring" involved in that process. He then explained Intel's long-term growth prospects in light of the re-structuring effort.  "It's all about data," Krzanich stated. "The thing that is explosive whether its virtual reality, or autonomous driving, is the massive amount of data. He explained that while the data centers of today are predicated on humans, the data centers of tomorrow will be built on machines. "So, it is the data center that really powers the Intel of the future," he said. But, don't be too quick to think Intel has abandoned PC. "It's not like we are giving up on the PC, but what we want to do is strengthen the other areas so that we are a more balanced company," Krzanich said. He argued that he remains "excited" about the new products Intel along with its OEM partners will launch in 2017.

Called 360 Replay, the tech puts you right by the action of live sports without even needing to leave the sofa, all thanks to the wonderful world of virtual reality (VR). 2 A view of the Intel showcase at CES, where it showed off the very latest VR technology Announced during the firm’s keynote at the conference , Intel boss Brian Krzanich said the merging of digital and physical worlds to create amazing immersive experiences will change the world of sports viewing. “This is the future of sports,” Krzanich said. The company gave Oculus Rift VR headsets to more than 260 reporters in the crowd, including The Sun Online, to show how this could work, taking them court-side of a basketball game in Indianapolis, via VR, from the comfort of a hotel conference room. By simply putting on an Oculus Rift VR headset, Intel was able to bring live sports to the audience never before. 2 Intel presents its VR tech to a roomful of helmet-clad journalists We watched the Villanova-Butler NCAA basketball game live on virtual reality headsets from the press conference. The experience includes a virtual score board that floats in your peripheral vision, and choices of different camera angles what you can select by hovering over different camera view buttons. You can then view the game like you are really there. And that’s exactly how it feels, it felt like we had been dropped court-side. You are able to look around in 360-degrees and watch the action like a spectator in the sports arena. This tech was made possible thanks to Intel’s acquisition of VOKE VR in November last year, a firm that had previously presented sports content including highlights of NFL games in VR. Intel said it will be among the first technology companies to enable this live sports experience on multiple VR devices, and said the option to view VOKE VR content on Oculus Rift will be available later this year.

Claudia Winkleman and pals look like the Ramones as they show off their matching fringes happy moanday Ten things to look forward to to help you survive Blue Monday - the most depressing day of the year “Viewers get to decide their point of view,” Krzanich said. “So you’re going to decide, do you want to be on the 50 yard line? Do you want to be court-side at a basketball game? "Do you want to be behind the basket to watch the next slam dunk? Do you want to be in the goalie’s position? All of that is possible.” Intel believes this is how we will view sports in coming years, giving us an opportunity to go to games that we’d never been able to before. We pay for your stories!

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 6, 2017 at 11:00AM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been working to become a major player in the cellular modem market since its acquisition of Infineon's (NASDAQOTH:IFNNY) wireless assets all the way back in 2010. Image source: Intel.  The company's cellular efforts struggled for years, as the company was late to deliver modems implementing important technologies such as 4G LTE and LTE Advanced. Indeed, the competition always seemed to be at least a step ahead -- if not a couple of steps ahead -- of Intel.  The chip giant seems to be determined to hit the "reset" button as the wireless industry transitions from 4G LTE and 4G LTE Advanced to 5G technologies, aiming to position itself as a "leader" rather than as a (fast?) follower. Only time will tell if Intel can ultimately succeed in becoming a leader, here, but the company recently announced its very first 5G modem, codenamed Gold Ridge. Let's take a closer look at the announcement. Pairs with XMM 7360, sampling in second half of 2017 Intel's Gold Ridge chip appears to be a "5G-only" modem that needs to be paired with a separate 4G chip (an Intel image posted by EETimes shows that the Gold Ridge modem paired with Intel's XMM 7360 LTE Advanced modem). This solution looks like wireless chip leader Qualcomm's (NASDAQ:QCOM) Snapdragon X50 5G modem, which the company says "can be paired with a Snapdragon processor with an integrated Gigabit Class LTE modem." The chip will reportedly sample in the second half of 2017, which suggests that it will find its way into the first commercially available devices sometime in the second half of 2018. Qualcomm has said that its own Snapdragon X50 5G modem will also sample to customers in the second half of 2017 and that "the first products integrating it are expected to surface throughout 2018." If Intel manages to keep to its publicly announced schedule, it could have a shot at achieving rough time-to-market parity with the industry leader. Built on the company's 14-nanometer technology All of Intel's modems released to date have been manufactured by third parties on older manufacturing technologies. Not only that, but those chips have been manufactured by third parties, rather than by Intel itself -- a company that routinely claims that owning and operating its own manufacturing plants is a significant competitive advantage. Per EETimes, the Gold Sand 5G modem will be manufactured in Intel's own 14-nanometer technology, making it the very first cellular modem that's both designed and manufactured by Intel. By manufacturing the modem in-house, Intel might be able to achieve a better cost/margin structure compared to a modem built by a third party since Intel won't have to pay a third-party chip manufacturer's profit margins. Additionally, if Apple adopts Intel's 5G modem in some portion of its 2018 iPhone shipments (Intel currently supplies XMM 7360 modems into some models of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus), then this would mean significant chip volumes for Intel's 14-nanometer chip factories. Indeed, since Intel is likely to begin transitioning much of its chip volumes away from its 14-nanometer technology toward its newer 10-nanometer technologies in late 2018, its 5G modems could be useful in keeping what 14-nanometer capacity that the company keeps online busy. Investor takeaway Intel has made it clear that it believes that connectivity technologies, such as cellular modems, will be critical to long-term success across many important areas of the computing market. The company is clearly putting its money where its mouth is by investing in next-generation wireless standards and chips that implement them. I suspect that over the next three to five years, we'll know whether Intel is destined to be a potent player in the cellular modem market or just another has-been.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

"The real answer is not a trade war, it's not restrictions. It's really about making the U.S. more competitive," the tech executive told "Squawk Alley." "Lowering the tax rates, making it easier for people to do manufacturing here ... that's what will bring manufacturing back to the U.S." Krzanich said that was a major topic of discussion at President-elect Donald Trump's December meeting with major U.S. tech CEOs, which Krzanich attended. When asked about the prospects for a new administration that runs the risk of heightening trade tensions with major players like China, Krzanich said he actually sees a lot of opportunity. "Our major manufacturing is in the U.S., yet we export 75 percent of our product. We're the second-largest exporter in the United States. So we consider ourselves kind of the role model manufacturer," he said. Krzanich also highlighted the company's ties to China, which has emerged as a target of the president-elect's criticism. "China's an important market for us, it's the fastest growing market we have, and so … for us it's constantly balancing between great relationships with China and growing there but also the manufacturing presence here in the U.S," Krzanich said. Krzanich spoke to CNBC from Intel's booth at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

Tech CES 2017 Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Super Bowl Ads     Intel's Compute Card Could Change The Smart Game Posted: Jan 6 2017, 10:22am CST | by Noel Diem, in News | CES   Credit: Intel   Intel was a little bit behind the times and never really jumped on the smartphone bandwagon, but now they are trying to establish themselves in the marketplace for smart technology. Their latest effort is called the "Compute Card," a small 94.5mm by 55mm by 5mm slab that includes a CPU and GPU, RAM, storage, and wireless connectivity, according to Ars Technica. Don't Miss: Super Bowl 2017 Ads The idea is to separate the "smart" parts of appliances and computers - TVs, refrigerators, all-in-ones, commercial equipment, etc - from the rest of the hardware. This will keep the price of things like smart TVs low because while the processing hardware goes quickly, the TV is still fine. With a Compute Card, you would simply have to eject the old card and put in a new one. Intel talked briefly about the Compute Cards are CES 2017, but you can expect the ones that are the fastest to perform like high-end, fanless laptops. Intel said that processors with a TDP of up to 6W could fit inside Compute Cards. They also said that the card uses a variant of the USB-C port called a "USB-C plus extension" to connect. The connector gives access to the USB and PCIe buses and the HDMI and DisplayPort video outputs. It will replace the Compute Stick, which will probably disappear in about 2018. The problem with the Compute Stick is that its input and output ports were limiting. The Card will be able to work with more enclosures so that it can use different ports and display interfaces.  Intel predicts that they will have more information available in June 2017, with the cards coming out soon after that. According to Ars Technica, Intel's Compute Card partners, including Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Sharp on the computing side and Seneca Data, InFocus, DTx, TabletKiosk, and Pasuntech on the commercial side, will all be making their own announcements and releases separately.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Intel rolls out the rest of the Kaby Lake CPU family Intel rolls out the rest of the Kaby Lake CPU family By Joel Hruska on January 4, 2017 at 7:30 am Comment Intel didn’t just launch the new Core i7-7700K desktop CPU, it made a comprehensive update to its entire product line. The initial Kaby Lake mobile refresh was limited to a handful of SKUs; with this launch Intel is bringing out a larger number of cores intended for every price point. The new chips are, for the most part, drop-in replacements for the Skylake SKUs Intel launched in 2015 and 2016, though most of the models feature at least a small clock jump over and above what Skylake offered. The slideshow below steps through each of Intel’s SKUs in some detail, but we’ll give you the 10,000-foot overview. Kaby Lake is priced nearly identically to Skylake in virtually every case, but the Core i5-7600K has a 3.8GHz base clock and a 4.2GHz turbo clock, whereas the Core i5-6700K was a 3.5GHz – 3.9GHz chip. These gains are preserved through most of the product stack; the 35W Core i5-7400T has a 2.4GHz base, 3GHz turbo, compared with the Core i5-6400T with its 2.2GHz base and 2.8GHz turbo. There’s a new nomenclature attached to many of Intel’s 15W and 28W CPUs. These new chips feature what Intel is calling “Iris Plus,” meaning they incorporate a 64MB EDRAM chip alongside the GPU core. The 128MB EDRAM cores that Intel has previously shipped with Skylake and Broadwell aren’t being carried over to the Iris Plus line, at least not for now. OEM uptake on these cores has never been high, even though they can improve integrated graphics performance by almost 100%. All of the new 7th-Generation chips support VP9 hardware decode, as well as supporting H.265 encode/decode completely in hardware. As a result, all of these cores are comparable with streaming 4K video from Netflix or any other service that agrees to use Windows PlayReady DRM via the Edge browser. Intel has already said it won’t bring its EDRAM to any desktop quad-core SKUs this cycle, so if you were hoping for a non-embedded chip with Iris Plus you’ll have to look for a Skylake-based core or consider the Broadwell-based Core i7-5775C, which does have the 128MB cache. Apart from improvements to media playback support, clock speed increases, and the Core i3-7350K (the first unlocked Core i3), the Kaby Lake refresh is a fairly standard update to Intel’s roadmap. A little more clock, a little more performance, and not much to specifically get excited about unless you’ve been waiting on an upgrade that was just a little faster than your 5-7 year-old system. Is it time for a new x86 architecture? I’m a bit torn over Kaby Lake. On the one hand, it’s a fine update as far as it goes. There’s not much reason for Skylake owners to upgrade, but review results from the 7700K show that it generally outperforms Devil’s Canyon from 2014, to say nothing of Sandy Bridge or even earlier chips. Squeezing an extra 8-10% out of Skylake in equivalent power envelopes is no small accomplishment given how hard it’s been to move the ball on x86 performance. At the same time, however, Intel has been working with Sandy Bridge-derived architectures since 2011 and doesn’t have much to show for it — at least, not compared with previous rates of performance improvements. A great deal of this is due to simple physics and the intrinsic difficulty of designing a core that is more efficient, draws the same amount of power (or less, ideally) and provides increased performance without resorting to clock speed gains to deliver it. In a talk several years ago, former Intel Chief Architect Bob Colwell estimated that modern chips are 50-60x more efficient than the original 8086 — but they clock 1,000x higher than that core (4GHz compared with 4MHz). For all the gains we’ve gotten from building better cores, the gains from clock speed are more than an order of magnitude higher. I mentioned this in the Core i7-7700K review, but it bears repeating: I have absolutely no inside knowledge that Intel is contemplating a new uarch and am not claiming it is. But it wouldn’t surprise me if the company does go this route, especially if Zen proves competitive against the 7th Generation core family. With Apple breathing down its neck with the iPad Pro and its old enemy preparing to return to the arena, it’s a good time to revisit old assumptions and see if new tricks can be found to boost perf, cut power, and deliver a superior product.

The credit card size device is a ‘compute module’ with all of the elements of a standard compute inside the tiny 95 x 55 x 5 mm thick device. That means there is an Intel SoC, storage drive, memory, Wi-Fi and  Bluetooth connectivity all tucked inside. Intel will offer a full range of 6 Watt Intel processors inside all the way up to and including Intel 7th Core ‘Kaby Lake’ processors with vPro. The concept behind this is that you can now add compute and connectivity to everything. Companies that make smart devices will be able to make a Intel Compute Card slot into their device and then every year companies can have a quick and simple way to upgrade their models every year. The Intel Compute Cards modular design will allow it to be used in virtually any product, anywhere and Intel is already working with companies to integrate the form factor in devices in the following fields; IoT, intelligent vending machines, digital signage, automobile, smart TVs, smart refrigerators, drones and more. The Intel Compute Card features a new connector that we have never seen before, but it’s basically USB-C with an extension and it is an industry standard and not a propitiatory connector. Basically it has a USB Type-C connection is able to handle USB, HDMI, DP and so on while the other extension connector will PCIe, USB and open lanes for future expansion. It also sounds like you can run multiple Intel Compute Cards in a single system, so more powerful devices can use multiple cards. The Intel Compute Card will be made available mid-2017. Right now Intel has been talking with divisions in Dell, HP, Lenovo, Sharp, InFocus, DTx, and TabletKiosk. Right now they are seeing a ton of interest in monitors and that many of the first design wins will likely be coming from that segment. The All-In-One monitor market is especially showing interest as you don’t have to throw away the entire device to upgrade. Ultimately, you’ll be able to swap out the Intel Compute Stick when an upgrade is desired. The only downside is the cost of modularity as there is an inherent cost to splitting this out and this device doesn’t cool itself. While the device itself doesn’t have any moving parts it will need to have a heatsink to help keep the tiny computer cool. Right now Intel is using a heatsink and fan to keep the external skin temperature at 61C, but it can technically go higher than that. Active cooling won’t work on all devices, so there is an embedded mode that will be used for thinner devices. We didn’t get all the details on how embedded mode works or how many Watts the entire solution consumes, but Intel will be giving us those details closer to launch. More information on the Intel Compute Card can be found on the product page that came out yesterday.   gerwingr i know i can incorporate small credit card size computer’s, beside control, or radio equipment, this is a good size, my concern though is more like 25 mm thick, so standard connectors can be used, 95x55x25 comes in mind, much like this. http://www.pcgamer.com/credit-card-sized-odriod-c1-is-a-quad-core-computer-for-only-35/ good, good idea.

The new VivoPC X packs Intel Core i5 CPU and NVIDIA GeForce GTX GPU into a 5-liter chassis. Traditionally, ASUS has positioned its Vivo-series computers as miniature PCs for mainstream tasks, whereas ROG systems were designed for gamers and multimedia enthusiasts. With the release of the VivoPC X, the computer maker changes that positioning and offers an SFF gaming-grade system under the Vivo brand. The reasons for the decision are simple: sales of small form-factor PCs are growing and so are sales of machines for gamers. ASUS wanted to address both markets with computers at more or less mainstream prices and the VivoPC X is a result of this decision. The mini PC is positioned below the ROG GR8 II and its performance is lower, however, ASUS thinks that the combination of price and performance will satisfy many people looking for a console-like gaming PC. The ASUS VivoPC X M80 is based on the Intel Core i5-7300HQ (4C/4T, 2.5 GHz/3.5 GHz, 6 MB cache, HD Graphics 630, 45 W) mobile processor, the Intel HM175 PCH as well as NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1060 graphics processor with G-Sync support. Since many gamers demand to have the performance of an SSD and capacity of a hard drive, the system will be equipped with a 512 GB M.2 SATA SSD as well as a 2 TB HDD with 7200 RPM spindle speed. The PC also comes with 8 GB of DDR4-2133 memory. To cool down the system components, ASUS uses a custom cooling system consisting of a blower for the GPU and a large aluminum heatsink for the CPU. ASUS VivoPC X Specifications   M80 CPU Intel Core i5-7300HQ Quad Core 2.5 GHz/3.5 GHz 6 MB cache HD Graphics 630 PCH Intel HM175 Graphics NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 with GDDR5 memory Memory  8 GB of DDR4-2133 Storage 512 GB SSD (SATA) 2 TB 2.5" HDD (7200 RPM) Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11ac Wi-Fi + BT 4.1 Ethernet GbE Display Outputs 2 × HDMI 2.0b 1 × DisplayPort Audio 5.1-channel audio USB 4 × USB 3.0 Type-A (5 Gbps) 2 × USB 2.0 Type-A Other I/O - Dimensions 75.94 mm × 259.8 mm × 279.9 mm 2.99 × 10.23 × 11.02 inches PSU 230 W OS Windows 10 When it comes to connectivity, the ASUS VivoPC X has four USB 3.0 Type-A ports, two USB 2.0 headers, Gigabit Ethernet, an IEEE 802.11ac Wi-Fi with BT 4.1 module, three display outputs (two HDMI and one DisplayPort), 5.1-channel audio with Sonic Suite software enhancements and so on. The computer uses mobile PC components in a bid to keep its physical size small and power consumption low: its volume is about five liters and its power consumption is less than 230 W (it uses an external power brick to feed itself). Meanwhile, usage of such components also means that its future upgrades will be rather complicated if possible at all (for example, the GPU is soldered to the motherboard and is thus not upgradeable). The ASUS VivoPC X will be available in March, 2017, for $799.

Reply close - Friday, January 06, 2017 - link Two (small) fans too many for HTPC perfection :). Reply Murloc - Friday, January 06, 2017 - link probably a bit noisy but I guess that if you want to game you don't have many choices, consoles have fans too. Reply forgot2yield28 - Friday, January 06, 2017 - link I wonder if they let you tweak the fan curves like they do on their motherboards. If so, you might be able to keep it quiet during HTPC operations and only have it kick on if you decide to game. Reply close - Friday, January 06, 2017 - link But it looks like there was plenty of space to install a more massive heatsink and maybe one bigger and quieter fan instead of 2 tiny laptop fans even if this made it a little heavier. This really looks like a missed opportunity since it's not like many people will actually carry it around in their backpack. https://youtu.be/6Y2zHzMKlFk?t=116 Reply Ro_Ja - Saturday, January 07, 2017 - link The fans in some consoles is louder I think. Reply Michael Bay - Friday, January 06, 2017 - link A bit too gaudy for that. Reply MonkeyPaw - Friday, January 06, 2017 - link Seems like a curiously spec'd product--loads of fast storage but uses mobile hardware. The big issue is that it Doesn't sound very serviceable. Even the PSU looks to be proprietary. If something goes bad, the whole thing is junked. This isn't a $250 console we're talking about. Reply Murloc - Friday, January 06, 2017 - link on the other hand, many people have this behaviour with their computers too. AIO computers for starters. Reply BrokenCrayons - Friday, January 06, 2017 - link Agreed on that. Even I did it when my desktop's motherboard failed. I just pulled the hard drive out and carted the rest of the system off to be recycled and this was a system I built myself from parts a bit less than a year ago. It's just not worth the time to mess around with one when a replacement can be had for under $400 and you can get a laptop instead of a desktop. I think a lot of people are learning that these days and just dumping their systems so the fact that something can't be serviced is a non-issue these days.

By Conner Forrest | January 6, 2017, 6:26 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Intel Intel's new credit card-sized computer, the Compute Card, could help businesses more rapidly connect their devices and grow their Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems. The card, which is only 5 mm thick, was unveiled at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) on Thursday. A press release announcing the Compute Stick refers to it as a "modular compute platform." Intel said that it will be working with a set of partners to build out solutions for the ecosystem, including Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Sharp. The goal is clear: Enable more connected devices and boost the speed of an IoT deployment. The Compute Card could be used to enable smart kiosks in an office or retail space, to add connectivity to personal appliances, or even to connect security cameras, the release said. SEE: CES 2017 Special Coverage (CNET) | CES 2017 (TechRepublic) | CES 2017: The Big Trends for Business (ZDNet) Just because the Compute Card is small (95 mm x 55 mm x 5 mm) doesn't mean it's not powerful. Inside the device, users will find Intel system on a chip (SoC) as well as memory, storage, and wireless connectivity. The I/O options are also flexible, as to be customized for specific use cases.

There are a range of processors available for the card, including the 7th generation (Kaby Lake) Intel Core processors. The Compute Card will connect to devices through a standard USB-C connection. Intel is no stranger to tiny form factor computers, releasing multiple versions of its Compute Stick over the past few years. However, with broader capabilities, and a more narrowed focus, the Compute Card offers something more. Being that the card itself is separate from the device it powers, it could make it easier for organizations to maintain and upgrade the smart capabilities of their IoT devices, without upgrading the device itself. For example, instead of buying an entirely new smart appliance when the features become obsolete, one simply replaces the Compute Card with a newer model. It could also make it easier to continue using the device if it were to become compromised, as one could simply remove the card and continue working. Details and pricing of the Compute Card will be available in Q2 2017, and the device itself is expected to be available in the middle of the year. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Intel's new Compute Card is a credit card-sized computer that can be used to empower smart and connected devices in an IoT deployment. The Compute Card is customizable with different processors, including up to 7th generation Kaby Lake processors. The Compute Card could change the way the enterprise approaches IoT, making for easier upgrades and maintenance of connected devices.

However, it looks like we should not expect any further delays to Cannon Lake, as this week Intel confirmed that we will see the first 10nm processors show up in PCs by the end of this year. Cannon Lake was initially supposed to roll out in the second half of 2016 but Intel hit a roadblock while trying to shrink down transistors. After switching from the ‘tick tock’ release cycle to a new three step rollout plan for future CPU nodes, there was some speculation that Cannon Lake may also miss the end of 2017 but Intel has come out to squash that. As The Inquirer reports, at CES this week, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich told journalists that Moore’s Law is still alive and well. According to Intel’s CEO, the first 2-in-1 PC based on 10nm architecture would be releasing this year and no further delays are expected for Cannon Lake. We can expect these new 10nm processors to bring lower power consumption, better performance, lower thermals and better battery life for portable devices. Obviously, unlocked desktop processors will take a bit longer to hit the market, similarly to how the first Kaby Lake processors hit OEM devices in late 2016 but we did not see the release of the Core i7 7700K and other desktop CPUs until this week. KitGuru Says: While Samsung and Qualcomm will be beating Intel in the 10nm arms race with the Snapdragon 835 during the first half of this year, it looks like Intel won’t be hugely far behind. Are any of you currently waiting on 10nm and Cannon Lake to launch before upgrading? What CPU are you running at the moment?  Similar Posts Categories Tags Related Related Tags: 10nmCannon LakeIntelnews Categorized Under: CPU WhiteSkyMage I guess it will be a great thing if they release a 10nm Cannonlake-E with 50% higher performance over my Haswell-E.

The popularity of a “Cannonlake-C” may not be there and thus might as well move us onto whatever is after just for the unlocked mainstream desktop processors. But I think the majority of Cannonlake in Client will be mobile, then of course Cannonlake-X/-EP/-EX will show up long afterwards. VA:F [1.9.22_1171] Rating: 0 (from 0 votes) lehpron It isn’t weird if you consider Intel has different codenames with similar prefixes for each segment that is on a different schedule. Therefore, if you expect all the codenames we read to be in the same segment, on a straight line, it would look weird. For instance, I’m sure like Broadwell, 10nm Cannonlake will debut mobile only while Coffeelake can still come after Kaby Lake in desktop at 14nm. There might be a “Cannonlake-C” desktop unlocked witha powerful IGP coming to the same chipset as Coffeelake, but it may suffer the same fate as Broadwell-C in terms of no popularity.

Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Behold. Intel has a new PC processor. Does it game, will it blend, is it AMD’s Ryzen CPU you really want and what the hell happened to ‘Tick Tock’? For answers to at least some of these questions, including the shattering news that the arrival of Kaby Lake means the era of ‘Tick Tock’ is over, summarily usurped by ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation’ (or if leaked roadmaps are anything to go by, make that ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation and One More for the Road’), join me on the other side. I’ll save some of you a lot of trouble right from the get go and point out that Kaby Lake is fundamentally non-exciting, albeit for somewhat interesting reasons. It’s another mainstream CPU family from Intel that tops out at four cores and only ups the performance ante by a small increment. Broadly speaking, we’re talking less that 10 per cent performance improvement over existing Skylake CPUs from Intel. Kaby Lake is, in short, probably the last boring mainstream chip from Intel before various factors align and force Intel out of its slumber and into something resembling action. More on that in a moment. I’ve been hands-on with the two headline grabbing CPUs of the Kaby Lake range courtesy of MSI’s Z270 Gaming M5 motherboard, which showcases the new 200 Series chipsets that accompany Kaby. The processors in question are the 4.2GHz/4.5GHz Core i7-7700K and the 3.8GHz/4.2GHz Core i5-7600K. Thus by their ‘7xxx’ suffixes shall ye know Kaby Lake chips. First, let’s talk about what’s new in Kaby Lake the CPU, which isn’t much. The CPU cores are largely if not entirely identical to Skylake. The integrated graphics isn’t new either, not in terms of 3D rendering at least. It’s basically the same ‘Gen9’ integrated gunk as seen and not terribly enjoyed by gamers in Skylake chips. So we’re left with two really significant updates. The first involves manufacturing. Actually, Kaby Lake is a 14nm chip, which makes it the third such family from Intel. Hence the shift from the old so-called ‘Tick Tock’ paradigm which saw Intel crank out a new chip and a new production process in alternate years. The significance here is that Intel has officially given up trying to shrink its CPU transistors every other year. That reflects a general industry-wide slow down in chip development as the world’s silicon engineers increasingly bump up against the laws of physics. Anyway, ‘Tock tick’ is toast and now we have aforementioned ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation’, which buys Intel an extra year to get those tricky die shrinks out the door. Despite all that, Intel has refined the existing 14nm tech enough to bump Kaby Lake’s clockspeeds by around 200MHz to 300MHz higher than previous chips depending on the model in question. That’s where the less-than-10-per-cent performance uptick figure comes from given that the CPU cores aren’t any fancier. They just run a little quicker. That said, prior to launch the scuttlebutt implied that Kaby Lake might be quite the overclocker. Hold that thought. The other potentially significant novelty involves 2D video. Yeah, not exactly gaming relevant. But for the record, Kaby Lake is potentially really snazzy in this department. Firstly, it has some major decode and encode chops. Thanks to some new 2D hardware, it can decode up to eight standard 4K HEVC streams simultaneously, which is kind of crazy, and can also support ultra-high bitrate streams, too, up to 4K at 60 frames per second and 120Mbps. It has some new encode capabilities, too. Arguably even more newsworthy is some new DRM gubbins that will allow Kaby Lake PCs to be the first that are allowed to stream 4K Netflix content. Until now, that’s been restricted to HDTV apps and set top boxes. However, what’s not clear is whether that will only be possible when using the integrated graphics. Personally, I don’t see how it makes sense unless it’s tied to the integrated graphics, but we’ll see. But the point is that if you’re looking for an all-round computing solution, Kaby Lake does have a few tricks up its sleeve. It won’t make games run much faster. But if you’re due an upgrade the 4K Netflix shizzle could be appealing and the hardware decode could also be interesting for laptops. As for what the Core i7-7700K and the Core i5-7600K are like in the real world, I haven’t much to say. To be frank, they feel no different to similar quad-core chips since, arguably, 2011 when Sandy Bridge arrived and shook things up. If you want benchmarks, try these. It’s actually the platform and stuff like USB Type-C… As you can see, it’s a total wash versus any vaguely recent Intel CPU family in almost any game. The overclocking picture, however, is at least a little more interesting. I managed 5.2GHz from the Core i5-7600K and 5GHz from the Core i7-7700K. That’s a few hundred MHz more than you might expect from a Skylake chip. Welcome, but to be brutally honest, again you just ain’t gonna feel that kind of difference. Arguably of more tangible import are the motherboards and chipsets. Kaby Lake sticks with the LGA1151 socket, so it slots into existing Intel 100 series motherboards. Praise the Lord for such small mercies. That said, the new 200 Series chipsets do bring a few frills. Our muse for this purpose is MSI’s new Z270 Gaming G5, which uses the top-end Z270 chipswet (obviously) in a sort of middling format in terms of pricing, which should weighing in at around £165 if the existing Z170 Gaming M5 is anything to go by. There’s support for DDR4-2400 RAM, for instance, and another four PCI Express 3.0 lanes on the chipset for peripherals, making for 24 in total. That said, the connection between the chipset and the CPU is the same DMI 3.0 thingamy, so the max bandwidth hasn’t changed, which is about 4GB/s and thus a tiny fraction of the theoretical maximum of those 24 PCIE 3.0 lanes. …Optane memory support… Additional intrigue comes in the form of an otherwise unassuming logo atop the Gaming G5’s box. “Intel Optane Memory Ready”, it reads. But what does it mean? That’s a story in itself (which I’ve touched on briefly, earlier), but the short version is that Intel has cooked up a new non-volatile memory tech. Like flash memory, it doesn’t need power to maintain data storage. But it’s far faster than flash memory. Think of it as being a cross between flash and RAM and you’ll have the right rough idea. How it will all work is a little unclear at this stage. It seems Optane will initially come in smallish drives of 16GB and 32GB and act as a sort of cache drive rather than as a conventional mass-storage hard drive. Eventually as the price comes down, I think we’ll see straight-up Optane SSDs for mass storage. Anyway, if you like the sound of Optane, support begins with the new 200 Series chipsets. Elsewhere, the MSI Gaming M5 serves ups various modern features, including a pair of M.2 slots and a USB Type-C port. So as has often been the case of late, it’s actually the platform that looks more compelling as an upgrade option for a few-years-old PC, rather than the CPU. The context to all this, of course, and the ‘factor’ I alluded to earlier is the imminent launch of AMD new’s Ryzen CPU. Again, I’ll cover the full story in another post, but Ryzen looks awfully promising and it’s likely that Intel will be forced to respond with a major upgrade to its mainstream CPUs within the next year, including its first six-core mainstream chip. …and generally bags of bandwidth with 200 Series motherboards like the MSI Z270 Gaming M5 that’s arguably a bit interesting, not the Kaby lake chip itself… All of which makes it pretty hard to get excited about Kaby Lake. In truth, you have to go back to Sandy Bridge in 2011 to find a mainstream Intel CPU that really moved the game forward. Kaby Lake doesn’t change that. But hopefully it will be the last of its type, the last sand-bagging Intel chip, if you like. About bloody time it will be, too. TL;DR – By their 7xxx suffixes shall ye know Kaby Lake – They change very little in terms of gaming performance – They overclock pretty well – It says something that 4K Netflix support is perhaps the main selling point – The new 200 Series platform is probably more interesting than the CPU itself thanks to Optane memory support.

No problems reported from them, although the integrated graphics seem to be giving some Win7 users trouble, and I didn’t see any reviews test the new stuff in Kaby Lake (more video decoding features and more granular power management).

I think some folks just like a new shiny. Graphics cards of course are a different story. Log in to Reply 06/01/2017 at 12:03 Ghostwise says: People are funny with their hobbies. Yeah. I hear that there are even grown-ups who play video games, these days. Little Pac-Man and whatnot. That’s ridiculous. Log in to Reply 06/01/2017 at 12:48 LewdPenguin says: If my motherboard hadn’t combusted I expect I’d be in a similar position still running a 7-8 year old CPU, having only upgraded the graphics card probably twice by now. Buying into every new hardware release seems entirely pointless to me, the occasions I would actually max out my old CPU were few enough to have made any upgrade pretty much unnoticeable 99% of the time. Then again the article seems pretty clear in its opinion that unless like me you’re currently looking at potentially (re)building a system pretty much from scratch then there’s little reason to upgrade right now from a performance perspective. In fact if the next new generation of chips is truly going to be the next notable step-change in performance rather than just further incremental optimisation then its all the more reason for potential optional upgraders to hold off.

It’s pretty hard to actually find a motherboard without one, at least looking at consumer chipsets. Log in to Reply 06/01/2017 at 15:22 fish99 says: I was considering a CPU upgrade from my 3570K recently, but after looking up some benchmarks, was surprised to see a 6600K is only 11% quicker, and that’s with it running 100 MHz quicker than my 3570K. And that’s a £250 CPU, plus with the cost of new mobo and ram I decided it 100% wasn’t worth it. I also looked up some gaming benchmarks for DDR4 and was seeing less than 1% gains. The only real downside to the tech gen I’m using is only 2x 6GB/S SATA3 ports which means some of my SSDs aren’t running full speed.

Log in to Reply 07/01/2017 at 15:44 Chorltonwheelie says: Yeah, still see no reason to upgrade from my venerable i5 3570k at all. Running it at rock solid 4.6 for years and still shreds everything I throw at it e.g. Dishonored 2 at 1440p, everything at ultra never dips below 60fps (v-synced, actually goes way higher if I let it). Granted, it’s sharing a case with a GTX1080, 16gb ram and nosebleed fast internet but as far as the cpu goes there’s absolutely no reason to fork out yet. Give me a decent 40-50% increase in performance over my old timer and my money’s yours Intel.

Cpu wise I’m set for another 3 years at least. 4800mhz overclock is running smooth on the 4690k, I’m happy. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

The Black PCIe SSD comes in 256GB asnd 512GB capacities and features an M.2 2280 format with an NVMe PCIe Gen3 x4 host connection. It is WD's third flash product using branding previously reserved for disk drives, joining the Blue and Green 2.5-inch SARA SSDs. It's classed as a consumer SSD but this doesn't mean it's simple to install. WD says Black PCIe SSDs are "perfect for building high-end gaming systems or high-performance tower desktops and laptops with support for an M-type connector". The word "building" indicates the level of installation complexity. You need to get inside your PC or notebook to install it and may well need a somewhat specialised allen key-type screwdriver to fasten the locking nut that holds the end of the card once it is plugged into its socket. The device uses, we understand, TLC (3bits/cell) flash built on a 15nm process. Intel also has a consumer-class M.2 drive, the 600p which uses 3D TLC flash, and its capacity range is 128BGB to 1TB. The WD Black's performance, compared to the Intel 600p product, looks like this: Random Read Random Write Sequential Read Sequential Write WD Black PCIe SSD 170,000 to 134,000 to 2.05GBps to 800MBps Intel 600p 35,000-155,000 to 128,000 to 1.8GBps to 560MBps The Black PCIe SSD is faster than Intel's 600p. Both drives gave a five-year warranty and nearly identical MTBF (mean time before failure) ratings; 1.75 million hours for the Black SSD and 1.6 million hours for the Intel one. The Black's endurance is 80TB written for the 256GB model and 160TB written for the 512GB unit. Intel's 600p has a 72TB written rating, and this is a hard limit with write locking imposed. While the Intel product features AS 256-bit encryption, the Black PCIe SSD has no encryption option. WD product information doesn't mention an NVMe driver for the Black SSD but we would be surprised if one was not supplied. WD supplies Acronis True Image software drive cloning to aid the Black PCIe SSD drive upgrade process. The prices are $109 (£104) for a 256GB product and $199.99 (£189) for the 512GB one. Apart from its lack of encryption, the Black PCIe SSD looks to be a better price/performance option than Intel's 600p. ® Sponsored: Achieving rapid delivery of high quality software with continuous delivery Tips and corrections 8 Comments More from The Register WD gets flash boom bang from SanDisk swallow +Comment Storage stalwart flashes past lumbering Seagate 2 Comments WD flashes first SanDisk drives: Blue and Green Applies disk-drive style branding to SanDy-driven SSDs 8 Comments Oh my Tosh: SanDisk chatted to 3 other buyers before WD slurp Comment Who are companies A, B, C and D?

Project Alloy is the Intel Virtual Reality headset, and is definitely a big game changer for the gaming world and may start the boom of VR headsets. Intel CES 2017’s Project Alloy surprises everyone VR headsets may have been around the market for some time, but Project Alloy potentially can deliver something very unique: world travel at your home. In the Intel CES 2017 demonstration of Project Alloy, we were shown that the headset could do a virtual replica of the scanned room. Related: Shenmue 3 News: HD Remaster Domain Hints Possible Release Before Shenmue III Intel has dubbed this as a “merged reality” and the scanned objects were converted to look appropriate to the game scenery. Project Alloy will not need a separate PC or power source as the computer and battery are built in. Traveling the world without leaving your living room will be more fun and you don’t get to be tired at all. What more can Intel Virtual Reality Project Alloy offer? In an article by BBC.com, Intel also showcased a wide variety of uses for Project Alloy. Included in what was showcased was the 360 view of a waterfall in Vietnam, which is of course in high definition. Related: Google’s AI for SmartTV, Smartwatches and Car Systems Revealed Brian Krzanich, Intel’s CEO, announced in the presentation that the headset can potentially bridge the gap between the digital and the physical world. Among the other possible use is that the VR can be further enhanced through the use of drones and cameras to do rescue missions. Intel also presented its 2-in-1 PC powered by the next generation 10-nm Cannon Lake processor, and their plans for the world’s first 5G modem. Also a partnership between Intel, BMW Group, and Mobileye plans to release 40 autonomous cars this year as well. The Intel CES 2017’s Project Alloy will kick off starting in the fourth quarter of the year and potentially be available next year. Next year will surely be a great year especially for the VR world.

Forums Join   Despite No Actual 5G Standard, Intel Unveils First 5G Modem by Karl Bode Friday Jan 06 2017 08:30 EST Sure, there's no actual fifth generation wireless standard yet, and it may not even surface until later this year (at best). Deployments of the ultra-fast and low latency wireless tech isn't even expected to begin until 2020 (at best). But that's not apparently stopping Intel from proudly proclaiming that it's the first company in the world to unveil a new 5G modem. A company press release states that Intel's new 5G modem (pdf) features a baseband chip and a new 5G transceiver that enables both sub-6 Ghz and mmWave capabilities. Intel says the modem also incorporates 3GPP 5G NR (new radio) technology -- including low latency frame structures, advanced channel coding and massive MIMO -- to deliver "faster connectivity and ultra-responsiveness." "It’s the world’s first global 5G modem to enable initial 5G spectrum trials and deployments worldwide with a baseband chip that supports both sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands," proclaims Intel. "Supporting ultra-wideband operation and enabling multi-gigabit throughput with ultra-low latency, the modem pairs both with Intel’s sub-6 GHz 5G RFIC and 28 GHz 5G RFIC to deliver a global reach across the key bands of interest for 5G systems." Granted it's worth reiterating that this modem technically doesn't exist yet, much like the networks it will eventually operate on. Intel says the Intel 5G RFIC is expected to sample in the first half of 2017, and the modem itself is expected to sample in the second half of 2017 and move into production soon afterwards.There's some additional detail in this full Intel 5G Modem spec sheet (pdf) for those interested. tags: business · hardware · bandwidth · networking · 5G News Jump Google Fiber in San Antonio Paused After Build ComplaintsDirecTV Loses 18 Channels in Yet Another Carriage Fee FightForum Topic: Does Installing Ethernet Raise Your Home Value?Friday Morning Links Riding 5G Hype, Redzone Launches '5Gx' Fixed Wireless ServiceGoogle Shuts Down Broadband Drone EffortsForum Topic: When Amazon's Echo Pulls a Hal 9000Verizon Bumps Top FiOS Speed to 750 MbpsWeekend Open Thread!FCC Report: AT&T And Verizon Are Violating Net Neutrality----------------------this weeklast weekmost discussed Most recommended from 8 comments Packeteers Premium Member join:2005-06-18 Forest Hills, NY Packeteers Premium Member 2017-Jan-6 8:44 am no thanks if intel's docsis 3.0/1 modem chips are any indication of their mastery over i/o best stay far away from any "5g" doorstop. · actions · 2017-Jan-6 8:44 am · How about ..

This means that anyone can enjoy the same experience even when switching from a Raspberry Pi to a PC or Mac. Read More , that comes as part of the Raspbian Jessie operating system. Basically it offers a slick, new user interface to the low-spec hobbyist mini-computer, and the results are stunning. Given the spec of the Raspberry Pi (we’re talking ARM processors without much RAM and no hard disk drive) it would be rather great if this OS could be ported to Intel and AMD 32-bit and 64-bit processors, to pump some new life into older PCs, wouldn’t it? Well, as fortune would have it, this is exactly what has happened Raspberry Pi Launches PIXEL for PC and Mac Raspberry Pi Launches PIXEL for PC and Mac The Raspberry Pi Foundation has released PIXEL on PC and Mac. This means that anyone can enjoy the same experience even when switching from a Raspberry Pi to a PC or Mac. Read More . The Raspberry Pi team has released a version of PIXEL for x86 and x64 computers, which means that there is a good chance that your old, low spec PC or laptop could be persuaded to run, and run well. Clean and Modern The Raspberry Pi Foundation was formed with a vision that “everyone should be able to afford their own programmable general-purpose computer.” The provision of this operating system for free beyond the confines of the $35 Raspberry Pi computer, proves just how much faith the developers have in it. Delivering a clean and modern — not to mention quick — user experience, PIXEL isn’t just a great way to revive some old hardware: it’s pleasing, too. Ads by Google PIXEL has various benefits beyond a usable user interface too. If you’re already using a Raspberry Pi (for projects at home, school, or your local maker space) then time wasted tweaking things, perhaps running a virtualized environment at home How to Emulate a Raspberry Pi on Your PC How to Emulate a Raspberry Pi on Your PC Rather than buy a Raspberry Pi and be disappointed, why not try the QEMU emulator to get a feel for it first? Read More and so on, is eliminated. The learning curve has gone, and you have a continuation of your project between the two devices. You can load up your scripts with the same software, as PIXEL for x32/x64 devices features all of the same utilities and programming tools as the Raspberry Pi version (with the exception of Minecraft and Wolfram Mathematica.) What Old PCs Will PIXEL Run On? It isn’t just any old PCs that PIXEL will run on. At the same time, it probably isn’t all. Your mileage may vary, but in short, if your computer will run Debian, then it should run PIXEL. That doesn’t just mean standard PCs and laptops — if you have a netbook, for instance, you should gain considerable mileage from running a low-footprint operating system and its desktop environment. We recently looked at how five lightweight Linux distros could be installed on an old netbook 5 Lightweight Linux Distros Ideal for an Intel Atom Processor PC 5 Lightweight Linux Distros Ideal for an Intel Atom Processor PC Don't let your Atom-powered netbook or low-specced laptop gather dust in a closet -- install a lightweight Linux distro and start enjoying mobile computing once again! Read More , and PIXEL offers the same advantages. But it doesn’t end there. Because Apple Mac computers have been running on Intel-based hardware for the past 10 years or so, they too can run PIXEL. Old Mac struggling under the weight of the latest macOS update? Reluctant to buy a replacement? Then try PIXEL! Download PIXEL To get PIXEL, you have two choices: Download the image from the Raspberry Pi website. Buy a copy of the latest MagPi magazine (issue 53), the Raspberry Pi magazine produced by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. This includes a cover-mounted Live DVD with PIXEL ready to run. In most cases, you’ll choose option one, and once the ISO file is downloaded, you’ll need to flash it to a USB stick (these steps will help Install Ubuntu On Your Computer Using a USB Flash Drive Install Ubuntu On Your Computer Using a USB Flash Drive Want to install Ubuntu but don't have a spare blank DVD?

When an optical disc breaks, it's gone forever. We show you how to make digital and playable backups of your CDs and DVDs now! Read More . Note that PIXEL isn’t yet available to install. Instead, it is a live disc image. You should note, too, that it is extremely wise to make a backup of your current Windows, Linux, or macOS data in case of issues running PIXEL. After all, it’s not the finished product just yet. Running in a virtual machine will be safe, however. When running from USB, you’ll be able to decide whether you wish to run in persistent (enabling continuity of your PIXEL experience between boots) or non-persistent mode. The latter is the default for running from physical discs. No Installation: PIXEL on PC or Mac Once you’re ready, reboot your PC and insert the DVD or USB flash drive. If everything has worked out, you’ll find that the PIXEL loader boots, and a few minutes later, the live image will run. Done all of this? Good, now run an update: sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade This will ensure that any bugs are fixed, as this is an OS in early release. You might also want to try PIXEL on your PC in a virtual machine. Our various guides to using virtual machines cover what you need to use here. Start by installing Oracle VirtualBox, create a virtual machine, then run PIXEL as a guest OS. Again, no installation is currently necessary. PIXEL certainly joins our list of Linux operating systems you should try in a VM! Of Course It’s Great. It’s Linux! I first tried the Raspberry Pi back in 2012, when I received a Raspberry Pi 1 Model B as a gift. It was fun to use (and remains so) but the Debian-derived Raspbian operating system left a lot to be desired. Improvements over the years have helped improve this, but until PIXEL came along it seemed unlikely that the Pi would ever feel as polished as some other Linux distros. All that has changed now, and PIXEL is heading out into the world! While the lack of an installer is clearly a shortcoming, it is likely that a full installable version of PIXEL will arrive in the foreseeable future. If you’ve tried PIXEL on your old hardware, you’re probably already aware of how much of a difference it makes. If you’re running the OS from some fast flash-based media, you might be surprised to learn you’re even using the same PC! We’ve been pleasantly surprised, and think you will be too. So go ahead and try it! Let us know how it goes, and tell us what you think, in the comments below.

Intel introduced its latest mini-computer at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas yesterday. Called the Compute Card, the device is so small and thin it's the size of a credit card, just slightly thicker. Intel introduced its latest mini-computer at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas yesterday. Called the Compute Card, the device is so small and thin it's the size of a credit card, just slightly thicker THE COMPUTE CARD  The Compute Card is a computer, complete with 7th Generation Intel Kaby Lake processor, memory, Bluetooth, storage and wireless connectivity. It measures about about 3.7 inches (9.4cm) by 2.2 inches (5.6cm) and just 0.2 inches (5mm) thick. Intel says the tiny computer is so small it cannot accommodate USB or other ports to power up or connect to displays.  It works by plugging into a slot in a larger device, similar to smart cards.   Intel said it will start shipping the cards in mid-2017.  It will not be sold directly to consumers and is only available for partners.  The Compute Card is a full blown computer, complete with cutting edge 7th Generation Intel Kaby Lake processor, memory, Bluetooth, storage and wireless connectivity. The device will not be sold directly to consumers, instead Intel has said the tiny machine will be sold to manufacturers to fit into other devices. But the card could potentially be used to extend the life of older gadgets.  It measures about about 3.7 inches (9.4cm) by 2.2 inches (5.6cm) and just 0.2 inches (5mm) thick. Intel says the tiny computer is so small it cannot accommodate USB or other ports to power up or connect to displays. It works by plugging into a slot in a larger device, similar to smart cards. The company is not positioning the card as a stand alone computer as yet, although they say that will come.  The idea is the Compute Card can easily be swapped in and out of smart devices so when one system in a TV or a fridge, for instance, becomes obsolete, you can just swap it out for a new card.

Share this article Share 146 shares The company believes the Compute is the computer of the future,  because it can be slotted into drones, robots, digital signs and other products.   'Businesses will be able to add a whole PC into products that otherwise have very little computing power,' said a CES analyst. The Compute Card could also make upgrading PCs as simple as plugging it into an existing computer to deliver the latest processors and other components. The new device measures about about 3.7 inches (9.4cm) by 2.2 inches (5.6cm) and just 0.2 inches (0.5cm) thick The idea is the Compute Card can easily be swapped in and out of smart devices so when one system in a TV or a fridge, for instance, becomes obsolete, you can just swap it out for a new card Intel is working with manufacturers like Dell, HP, Sharp and Lenovo to build specialized slots into devises, including PCs and home appliances like fridges and security cameras. The partners will take 'advantage of the simplified design, ease of serviceability, and user upgradeability of the Intel Compute Card,' Intel said in a statement.  Intel said it will start shipping the cards in mid-2017.  It will not be sold directly to consumers and is only available for partners, an Intel spokesman said.

It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats.

Intel has unveiled a new modular compute platform, dubbed the Intel Compute Card. A miniature sized platform including elements like that of a full computer. The company also announced that it will have different partners working together to help in accelerating its solutions based ecosystem. These partners include Dell, HP, Lenovo and Sharp. Its ecosystem explores technologies and expertise for a connected world. The mini-computer has been designed to transform the compute and connectivity in future connected devices. The card’s functions include Intel SoC, memory, storage and wireless connectivity with flexile I/O options so that hardware manufacturers can optimise for their solutions. It measures a total of 94.5mm x 55mm x 5mm. This device includes all the functions that are needed to run smart devices such as smart fridges, smart kiosks, security cameras and other Internet of Things gateways. Announced at CES 2017, Intel said the card uses a variant within the USB-C port which is called ‘USB-C plus extension’, enabling it to connect with systems that it is plugged in to. The connector gives devices direct access to the USB and PCle buses, HDMI and DisplayPort video outputs. Intel says that the Intel Compute Card will be made available to run Windows, Linux and all other operating systems which are able to run on a low-end PC. Intel is yet to reveal all the specifications of its compute card, but is expected to release the information, along with availability and pricing in the middle of 2017. The compute card will also be available in mid-2017 with a range of processors such as its 7th gen Intel Core processors.   Tags Compute Homepage News List Intel PC smart gadgets Previous Article‘It’s time for action’ – UK firms demand better access to tech and connectivity post-Brexit Next ArticleLack of in-house skills and the underutilisation of technology continue to hold back charity IT Most read AWS looks to teach military vets cloud skills in IT training programme James Nunns 12th January 2017 Ukranian power outage: Are hackers testing for worldwide SCADA cyber attacks?

But first, the company kicked off its presentation by demonstrating that its next-gen 10nm "Cannon Lake" Core processor was alive and well. That's important, as Intel's current quad-core Kaby Lake chips have received mixed reviews from tech reviewers concerned that Intel had just revamped its existing 14nm process to add a few more megahertz. Cannon Lake moves to an entirely new process, offering the potential for a more dramatic jump. Brian Krzanich, Intel's chief executive, demonstrated the new chip playing back a recent Intel ad. We can expect more info about Cannon Lake this upcoming summer, and a more formal unveiling will likely be timed with the Intel Developer Forum in late summer 2017. Focus on VR Cannon Lake, like the current Kaby Lake, represents an opportunity not just for content creation but for content to be experienced through the magic of virtual reality. The problem is that there really isn't a good way to convey a VR experience, save for VR--2D video doesn't do it, and neither does 2D images. But throughout 2015 and 2016, Intel quietly gobbled up VR technology companies, including Replay Technologies and Voke. None apparently grabbed the attention Kraznich wanted, however, so he arranged for the keynote hall to be outfitted with Oculus Rifts and played back several VR demos (including a live 360-degree video feed, via drone) to the assembled press. Two demos stood out. The first was HypeVR's demonstration of stereoscopic VR, which rendered a pastoral scene from Vietnam with a 360-degree video loop playing back images of grazing water buffalo and a flowing river. But the objects in the video could be looked "around"--if I stood up, I could see more of the video behind the water buffalo in the foreground. It felt a bit artificial, though it did make the scene more visually interesting. Intel's Voke technology feels more like a winner. In concept, it's pretty simple: the broadcaster plants a 3D camera (or two) next to the action and lets the audience switch between them. In Intel's demo, they floated a 3D scoreboard overhead with a live feed of a Villanova basketball game. Though the game largely took place in "front" of the camera, the VR headset still allowed me to focus on what I was interested in. The only drawback was that the game exposed one of the weaknesses of the Oculus Rift: the relatively low resolution, compared to the 1080p or even 4K feeds that sports viewers are used to. Pushing VR into the hands of Intel customers, however, appears to be critical for Intel's future. Project Alloy, a simple "mixed reality" device that Intel disclosed previously, will be turned into a product, Krzanich announced. "We want this to bring the creativity and those experiences to where they need to be," he said. He did not say, however, which manufacturers will make Alloy, or what the price will be, though they will ship during the fourth quarter of 2017. Microsoft has also tried to lure hardware makers to make their own augmented-reality devices, with more success: Asus, Dell, HP, and others have signed on to make them.

(AP Photo/John Locher) By Wire reports Tags: Internet, Internet of Things, E-commerce, PC industry, Dell Las Vegas — The Latest on the CES gadget show in Las Vegas: Companies are upping the "wow" factor trying to stand out as the CES gadget show formally opens in Las Vegas. Samsung, one of the largest exhibitors at the show, is offering demonstrations of its boat racing, air show and other virtual-reality experiences in chairs that move around. Hyundai is offering VR demos for people to experience what it's like to ride in an autonomous car. Also drawing crowds are flashy concept cars like the Toyota Concept-i, with doors that flip up and a 3-D display inside. Polaroid is showing off its Cube+ Wi-Fi camera with a bizarre display of rotating — but fake — monkeys wearing the camera. Camera images are displayed in a live feed above. It's a nod to the monkey-shaped stand that Polaroid sells for the Cube. On the TV front, LG wowed with an OLED 4K display tunnel, which people enter to see the new technology. One of the longer lines on the floor was at MyCharger's Power Up bar — which offered a free MyCharger along with what appeared to be green beer. It's actually regular Sam Adams in a green dye-infused cup. CES takes place over several, sprawling venues in Las Vegas. About 165,000 visitors are expected by the time it closes Sunday. Intel's VR preview includes barf bags Intel thinks the future of virtual reality is skydiving in the desert, watching live sports from a ringside seat and cringing as zombies attack — all powered by Intel chips. Wednesday's demo featured leather chairs, Oculus sensors and headsets — and a barf bag, signaling this was not an ordinary press conference. [VIDEO: CNET provides a video report at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFobWjSYst4 ] "Intel announced a partnership with Hype VR to deliver high-fidelity video capture that allows viewers to move around a video scene as if they were there," CNET reports. One demo was a live feed from a 360-degree camera attached to a drone inspecting solar panels in a desert. Intel was showing how the technology could be used in a work environment. A more exciting live feed showed a college basketball game between Butler and Villanova. Travel experiences took viewers to a waterfall scene in Vietnam and a skydiving experience in the Moab Valley. A trailer for "Arizona Sunshine," a VR game, made viewers jump as zombies lunged for them. No one — noticeably — made use of the barf bags. CEO Brian Krzanich acknowledges that some people are questioning whether VR is going anywhere. He adds, "I hope these experiences give you a taste of where it's going." Whirlpool making fridges, stoves 'smart' Amazon doesn't have an official presence at the CES gadget show in Las Vegas but its Alexa voice control software seems to be everywhere. Whirlpool is adding Alexa voice control to its suite of smart-home appliances, including a stove and refrigerator. With that capability, someone can instruct the oven to pre-heat to 400 degrees by speaking a command to an Alexa-enabled device, such as Amazon's Echo speaker. Jason Mathew, senior director of global connected strategy for Whirlpool, says voice is "the most natural way to interact with a product." Other gadgets that include Alexa: Sensory and OnVocal are both launching headphones that incorporate Alexa. Simplehuman is announcing a voice-activated trash can. And GE Lighting is launching a table lamp that includes Alexa software. Amazon has an edge on the market for now because its software has been out longer, but Google's and Apple's systems are catching up. Mathew says "Amazon is the most mature, but we expect to offer other options in the future." How to grow mobile payments? Sometimes, it takes incentives to persuade people to change their habits. Mobile payment services such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay still aren't widely used, in part because it isn't difficult for shoppers to pull out a plastic card at the cashier. Samsung tried to address that by offering points for each transaction, regardless of the amount spent — redeemable for gift cards and Samsung products. At a CES panel Thursday, Samsung executive Nana Murugesan said that since the launch of Samsung Rewards in November, daily usage of Samsung Pay has nearly doubled, while the number of users who make purchases almost daily more than doubles each week. The company hasn't specified the number of users and transactions, though analysts say it's still a small compared with cash and cards. Is Alexa spying on you? It's a fair question in light of attempts by authorities investigating the slaying of an Arkansas man to obtain voice recordings collected by an Amazon Echo speaker and its Alexa digital assistant. Yet the popularity and capabilities of voice-enabled products such as the Echo continue to grow. At the CES gadget show in Las Vegas, which opened Thursday, Whirlpool, Samsung and other manufacturers are unveiling new ways to use voice services to control laundry machines, refrigerators and other home systems. Consumers are apparently willing to trade a certain amount of privacy for convenience. The issue first grabbed headlines a couple of years ago, after Samsung said sensitive conversations could be captured by its voice-controlled smart TVs. Based on the flood of new voice-controlled gadgets headed to market, tech companies are betting that consumers will get over their fears. Comcast's Derrick Dicol likens it to people getting used to sharing their banking information online. Making hair sprays better Beauty brands L'Oreal and Karastase want to make bad hair days a thing of the past. The two companies teamed up with tech company Withings on a Hair Coach brush that uses a microphone, gyroscope and other sensors to monitor how fast and how hard a person is brushing. An accompanying app recommends how to brush for optimal quality and minimal breakage and split ends. It can also take into account hair-influencing factors like heat or humidity and even discern if hair is wet or dry. The "smart brush" has been garnering buzz at the CES tech show in Las Vegas. Vincent Nida, worldwide general manager at Paris-based Kerastase, says one of the top beauty queries online is consistently about taking better care of your hair. The battery-powered brush starts collecting data when a user begins brushing. The smarts may seem like overkill considering the price of the brush — $200. By contrast, Amazon sells brushes for as little as $1. But Nida says you're getting a high-quality brush "even if you don't have batteries or you don't connect it to your cell phone." The Hair Coach brush is due out in mid-2017. Dell's keyboard-less Canvas Who needs a keyboard? Dell is introducing a new way to interact with your computer. The Dell Canvas 27 is a 27-inch glass surface that sits flat on a desk in front of a monitor. The touch surface is where a keyboard would normally be. Various widgets are available to manipulate items on the monitor. The Canvas also comes with a pen for sketching and creating. Dell envisions people using the device to edit photos and video, work on music and even work with financial tables. The goal is to replace clutter generally found on a desk. Instead of working with paper on a desk, just use the touch surface. The device launches in the spring and is expected to cost less than $2,000 — or around $3,000 with the monitor included. Lenovo has a similar concept in last fall's Yoga Book. It's a laptop that replaces the keyboard with a touch screen for both typing and doodling. But the screen is smaller, measuring 10 inches diagonally. Dell announced the Canvas at the CES gadget show on Thursday. Tom Holland, star of "Spider-Man: Homecoming," also stopped by to introduce two Dell products — a tablet and a gaming laptop — that will appear in the movie. Molecular physics on smartphones? Smartphones can do almost anything, but how about molecular physics? An Israeli startup has embedded a molecular sensor called Scio in a new smartphone that can analyze any material — whether that's the nutritional content of an apple or a person's body fat. Consumer Physics' scanners use infrared light to analyze molecular structure. The startup has been developing them for a few years, but this is the first time it's embedded in a mobile device — one from Chinese phone manufacturer Changhong. Is that a little too much science to carry around in your pocket? Consumer Physics CEO Dror Sharon says knowledge is power. He explains, "When we go out and buy stuff, eat stuff, drink stuff, we think we know what's in there, but we have no clue." Pricing and availability for the phone will be announced Friday at the CES gadget show in Las Vegas. Apple app store surging Apple's app store closed 2016 with 2.2 million apps, an increase of 20 percent from 2015. Apple says New Year's Day 2017 was the biggest day ever for app store purchases — people bought nearly $240 million of stuff in the digital marketplace. Nintendo's "Super Mario Run" was the most downloaded app worldwide on both Christmas and New Year's Day. The app is free to download, but it costs a whopping $10 to play the full version. In what should surprise no one, "Pokemon Go" was the year's most popular app. The game peaked over the summer, when hordes of people prowled real-life locations to catch digital pocket monsters through its innovative augmented reality interface. Other popular apps included Sweat With Kayla, a workout app, and Procreate, a painting and sketching app. The milestones were announced as the CES gadget show in Las Vegas formally opened, though Apple has no official presence there. ​ WRAL TechWire any time: Twitter, FacebookCopyright 2017 WRAL TechWire.

By Sean Portnoy for Laptops & Desktops | January 6, 2017 -- 12:34 GMT (04:34 PST) | Topic: CES 2017: The Big Trends for Business Intel Compute Card First there was the Compute Stick, Intel's mini-computer that resembles a pack of gum. Now the chip giant is releasing a PC that's even more diminutive than that device. CES 2017 The best mobile tech, PCs and laptops on display Panasonic unveils 'human-like' companion robot Kingston unveils 'world's highest capacity USB flash drive' Voice is the next computer interface Dell's killer new XPS 13 2-in-1 HP shows new business convertible and Sprout Pro Amazon revs Alexa everywhere strategy Under Armour highlights digital transformation efforts See also: CNET's full coverage The new Compute Card is even thinner than the Compute Stick, looking more like a slightly bigger, thicker credit card. It's a mere 5mm thick, but still manages to house most of the essentials for a running computer. CNET: Intel's Compute Card could keep your gadgets from going obsolete Whereas the Compute Stick was at least partially marketed to consumers looking to stick a full-fledged PC in the HDMI port of their HDTV for living room computing tasks, the Compute Card is designed to be added to connected devices as a module that's easy to swap out when you want to upgrade its "smart" capabilities. Despite its dimensions, the Compute Card still fits most of the guts of a typical PC within its narrow frame. That even includes Intel's latest Core processors -- the seventh generation or Kaby Lake CPUs -- rather than the low-performance system-on-a-chip that Internet of Things devices typically ship with. It also naturally comes with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to connect the smart object with the greater world, along with what the company is calling a "USB-C plus extension" to connect the Compute Card with products. The fact that the Compute Card features most of what you need from a bare-bones PC will naturally lead some to wonder if Intel plans to offer this as a product that consumers can use for their own computing tasks, rather than it being placed in a smart refrigerator or vending machine. While the company is clearly marketing the Compute Card as an IoT platform, it's not inconceivable that you could place it in a compatible dock and use it like the Compute Stick or other PCs on a stick. The companies that Intel lists as partners for the platform should give hope to those who might want a Compute Card of their own. It has Dell, HP, and Lenovo lined up to help it create products that can make use of the Compute Card, and obviously those manufacturers are much better known for building PCs than kiosks and digital signs. Intel says the Compute Card will be available by the middle of the year, so we'll wait to see what compatible devices are announced and whether docks to use it as a dedicated PC emerge on the company's road map.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Four cores and many years ago... Home Hardware Intel Hands-On With Intel’s New Kaby Lake CPU By Jeremy Laird on January 5th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Behold. Intel has a new PC processor. Does it game, will it blend, is it AMD’s Ryzen CPU you really want and what the hell happened to ‘Tick Tock’? For answers to at least some of these questions, including the shattering news that the arrival of Kaby Lake means the era of ‘Tick Tock’ is over, summarily usurped by ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation’ (or if leaked roadmaps are anything to go by, make that ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation and One More for the Road’), join me on the other side. I’ll save some of you a lot of trouble right from the get go and point out that Kaby Lake is fundamentally non-exciting, albeit for somewhat interesting reasons. It’s another mainstream CPU family from Intel that tops out at four cores and only ups the performance ante by a small increment. Broadly speaking, we’re talking less that 10 per cent performance improvement over existing Skylake CPUs from Intel. Kaby Lake is, in short, probably the last boring mainstream chip from Intel before various factors align and force Intel out of its slumber and into something resembling action. More on that in a moment. I’ve been hands-on with the two headline grabbing CPUs of the Kaby Lake range courtesy of MSI’s Z270 Gaming M5 motherboard, which showcases the new 200 Series chipsets that accompany Kaby. The processors in question are the 4.2GHz/4.5GHz Core i7-7700K and the 3.8GHz/4.2GHz Core i5-7600K. Thus by their ‘7xxx’ suffixes shall ye know Kaby Lake chips. First, let’s talk about what’s new in Kaby Lake the CPU, which isn’t much. The CPU cores are largely if not entirely identical to Skylake. The integrated graphics isn’t new either, not in terms of 3D rendering at least. It’s basically the same ‘Gen9’ integrated gunk as seen and not terribly enjoyed by gamers in Skylake chips. So we’re left with two really significant updates. The first involves manufacturing. Actually, Kaby Lake is a 14nm chip, which makes it the third such family from Intel. Hence the shift from the old so-called ‘Tick Tock’ paradigm which saw Intel crank out a new chip and a new production process in alternate years. The significance here is that Intel has officially given up trying to shrink its CPU transistors every other year. That reflects a general industry-wide slow down in chip development as the world’s silicon engineers increasingly bump up against the laws of physics. Anyway, ‘Tock tick’ is toast and now we have aforementioned ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation’, which buys Intel an extra year to get those tricky die shrinks out the door. Despite all that, Intel has refined the existing 14nm tech enough to bump Kaby Lake’s clockspeeds by around 200MHz to 300MHz higher than previous chips depending on the model in question. That’s where the less-than-10-per-cent performance uptick figure comes from given that the CPU cores aren’t any fancier. They just run a little quicker. That said, prior to launch the scuttlebutt implied that Kaby Lake might be quite the overclocker. Hold that thought. The other potentially significant novelty involves 2D video. Yeah, not exactly gaming relevant. But for the record, Kaby Lake is potentially really snazzy in this department. Firstly, it has some major decode and encode chops. Thanks to some new 2D hardware, it can decode up to eight standard 4K HEVC streams simultaneously, which is kind of crazy, and can also support ultra-high bitrate streams, too, up to 4K at 60 frames per second and 120Mbps. It has some new encode capabilities, too. Arguably even more newsworthy is some new DRM gubbins that will allow Kaby Lake PCs to be the first that are allowed to stream 4K Netflix content. Until now, that’s been restricted to HDTV apps and set top boxes. However, what’s not clear is whether that will only be possible when using the integrated graphics. Personally, I don’t see how it makes sense unless it’s tied to the integrated graphics, but we’ll see. But the point is that if you’re looking for an all-round computing solution, Kaby Lake does have a few tricks up its sleeve. It won’t make games run much faster. But if you’re due an upgrade the 4K Netflix shizzle could be appealing and the hardware decode could also be interesting for laptops. As for what the Core i7-7700K and the Core i5-7600K are like in the real world, I haven’t much to say. To be frank, they feel no different to similar quad-core chips since, arguably, 2011 when Sandy Bridge arrived and shook things up. If you want benchmarks, try these. It’s actually the platform and stuff like USB Type-C… As you can see, it’s a total wash versus any vaguely recent Intel CPU family in almost any game. The overclocking picture, however, is at least a little more interesting. I managed 5.2GHz from the Core i5-7600K and 5GHz from the Core i7-7700K. That’s a few hundred MHz more than you might expect from a Skylake chip. Welcome, but to be brutally honest, again you just ain’t gonna feel that kind of difference. Arguably of more tangible import are the motherboards and chipsets. Kaby Lake sticks with the LGA1151 socket, so it slots into existing Intel 100 series motherboards. Praise the Lord for such small mercies. That said, the new 200 Series chipsets do bring a few frills. Our muse for this purpose is MSI’s new Z270 Gaming G5, which uses the top-end Z270 chipswet (obviously) in a sort of middling format in terms of pricing, which should weighing in at around £165 if the existing Z170 Gaming M5 is anything to go by. There’s support for DDR4-2400 RAM, for instance, and another four PCI Express 3.0 lanes on the chipset for peripherals, making for 24 in total. That said, the connection between the chipset and the CPU is the same DMI 3.0 thingamy, so the max bandwidth hasn’t changed, which is about 4GB/s and thus a tiny fraction of the theoretical maximum of those 24 PCIE 3.0 lanes. …Optane memory support… Additional intrigue comes in the form of an otherwise unassuming logo atop the Gaming G5’s box. “Intel Optane Memory Ready”, it reads. But what does it mean? That’s a story in itself (which I’ve touched on briefly, earlier), but the short version is that Intel has cooked up a new non-volatile memory tech. Like flash memory, it doesn’t need power to maintain data storage. But it’s far faster than flash memory. Think of it as being a cross between flash and RAM and you’ll have the right rough idea. How it will all work is a little unclear at this stage. It seems Optane will initially come in smallish drives of 16GB and 32GB and act as a sort of cache drive rather than as a conventional mass-storage hard drive. Eventually as the price comes down, I think we’ll see straight-up Optane SSDs for mass storage. Anyway, if you like the sound of Optane, support begins with the new 200 Series chipsets. Elsewhere, the MSI Gaming M5 serves ups various modern features, including a pair of M.2 slots and a USB Type-C port. So as has often been the case of late, it’s actually the platform that looks more compelling as an upgrade option for a few-years-old PC, rather than the CPU. The context to all this, of course, and the ‘factor’ I alluded to earlier is the imminent launch of AMD new’s Ryzen CPU. Again, I’ll cover the full story in another post, but Ryzen looks awfully promising and it’s likely that Intel will be forced to respond with a major upgrade to its mainstream CPUs within the next year, including its first six-core mainstream chip. …and generally bags of bandwidth with 200 Series motherboards like the MSI Z270 Gaming M5 that’s arguably a bit interesting, not the Kaby lake chip itself… All of which makes it pretty hard to get excited about Kaby Lake. In truth, you have to go back to Sandy Bridge in 2011 to find a mainstream Intel CPU that really moved the game forward. Kaby Lake doesn’t change that. But hopefully it will be the last of its type, the last sand-bagging Intel chip, if you like. About bloody time it will be, too. TL;DR – By their 7xxx suffixes shall ye know Kaby Lake – They change very little in terms of gaming performance – They overclock pretty well – It says something that 4K Netflix support is perhaps the main selling point – The new 200 Series platform is probably more interesting than the CPU itself thanks to Optane memory support.

Two chips run hotter than the equivalent Skylake model; the third runs cooler, with something like 20% lower current usage.

Buying into every new hardware release seems entirely pointless to me, the occasions I would actually max out my old CPU were few enough to have made any upgrade pretty much unnoticeable 99% of the time. Then again the article seems pretty clear in its opinion that unless like me you’re currently looking at potentially (re)building a system pretty much from scratch then there’s little reason to upgrade right now from a performance perspective. In fact if the next new generation of chips is truly going to be the next notable step-change in performance rather than just further incremental optimisation then its all the more reason for potential optional upgraders to hold off.

And that’s a £250 CPU, plus with the cost of new mobo and ram I decided it 100% wasn’t worth it. I also looked up some gaming benchmarks for DDR4 and was seeing less than 1% gains. The only real downside to the tech gen I’m using is only 2x 6GB/S SATA3 ports which means some of my SSDs aren’t running full speed.

Running it at rock solid 4.6 for years and still shreds everything I throw at it e.g. Dishonored 2 at 1440p, everything at ultra never dips below 60fps (v-synced, actually goes way higher if I let it). Granted, it’s sharing a case with a GTX1080, 16gb ram and nosebleed fast internet but as far as the cpu goes there’s absolutely no reason to fork out yet. Give me a decent 40-50% increase in performance over my old timer and my money’s yours Intel.

Here’s everything we know about the iMac 2017 UK release date, price and specification rumours. With Intel's new Kaby Lake processor announcements at CES 2017, new iMacs surely must be coming soon By Marie Brewis | 12 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments Intel has announced Kaby Lake processors that we will likely see in Apple iMacs, but how long will we have to wait? A new iMac is hotly tipped for March 2017. Here’s everything we know about the iMac 2017 UK release date, price and specification rumours.  Also see: New MacBook Pro  iMac 2017 UK release date rumours: When is the iMac Pro coming out? New iMac UK release date: March 2017 (TBC)  Apple held a special event on 27 October in which it was expected to unveil new Macs. Chief among those Macs, following a Best Buy slip up that saw a Kaby Lake-powered iMac listed for sale, was a new iMac family. This didn't happen, but we're still fairly confident new iMacs are coming soon - with the next possible launch date March 2017. A Q1 2017 release date is all the more likely following Intel's Kaby Lake processor announcements at January's CES. We'd expect to see the S-Series desktop chips (7500/7600/7700K) in the 27in iMac, although there is no clear upgrade path for the 21.5in iMac - we'll just have to wait and see. Apple CEO Tim Cook has stated on an internal Q&A session that, "Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops. If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that." iMac 2017 UK price rumours: How much is the iMac Pro?  According to Best Buy, if accurate, a 27in iMac with 32GB of RAM and a 2TB Fusion Drive will cost $3,199.99. This appears to be slightly higher than the current 27in iMac with 32GB RAM and a 2TB Fusion Drive, though of course we don’t know exactly what other upgrades this model includes (and whether or not it is merely placeholder text).  Over in the UK the current 21.5in iMac starts at £899 or £1,199 with a 4K display, while the 27in 5K model starts at £1,449, both direct from Apple. We would expect prices to remain roughly the same.  iMac 2017 specification rumours: Is the iMac Pro any good?  Following that Best Buy leak, it’s highly likely the new iMac will feature a processor upgrade to Intel’s latest Kaby Lake family. The listing also mentioned a 27in 5K display, 32GB of memory and a 2TB Fusion Drive, with the model priced at $3,199.99. It could be placeholder copy, but why bother to update the processor? We’d really like to see this Fusion Drive rolled out as standard across the range.  Apple could well turn to AMD once again for its graphics solution, with Polaris 10 a prime candidate. It offers improved graphics performance (naturally), plus potential reductions in power consumption and waste heat. More exciting, though, is that these new graphics chips would for the first time bring VR potential to the Mac.  We’ve seen Apple bring the Pro name to its iPad line-up over the past year, and we’re anticipating that the iPad mini will also get a Pro makeover next week. One rumours circulating online is that the iMac will also get Pro treatment, and we could be about to see a sufficiently powerful iMac Pro to replace the Mac Pro.  Content continues below For more new iMac rumours see our sister site Macworld.

ASUS-exclusive 5-Way Optimization dynamically optimizes essential aspects of the system based on real-time use, including the all-new Stress Test Distribution feature that allows users to adjust the proportion of CPU and DRAM stress for the best overclocking performance. As well, the latest-generation Fan Xpert 4 allows users to monitor the GPU temperature to ensure cooler usage scenarios when the graphics card is under heavy loads, such as during 3D content creation or when gaming. ASUS Pro Clock technology has a dedicated base-clock (BCLK) generator designed for 7th Generation Intel processors, enabling overclocked base-clock frequencies of up to 425MHz and beyond. It works in tandem with the ASUS TurboV Processing Unit (TPU) to enhance voltage and base-clock overclocking control, and boosts performance up to 5.4GHz and beyond. Third-generation ASUS T-Topology takes DDR4 memory overclocking to new heights — up to 4133MHz or even beyond2. Refined manufacturing ensures ultra-consistent quality and minimal crosstalk between custom trace paths, so users can enjoy the thrill of overclocking DDR4 with time-aligned signaling for superior stability. And ASUS motherboards are tested for compatibility with industry-leading 790+3 DDR4 memory modules — for great flexibility and reassurance. Built for customization: Aura Sync and 3D-printable components ASUS Aura Sync is the world’s first motherboard-RGB-synchronization technology, delivering distinctive light shows across Aura Sync-capable motherboards, graphics cards and peripherals for up to nine effects — all controlled via the simple and intuitive Aura app. The all-new Music mode is also able to pulse synchronized LEDs in time to the user’s favorite tunes. Users are able enhance their illumination still further, either via the integrated 4-pin/12V Aura RGB header or the included extension cable. Aura offers a brilliant spectrum of colors, and can even change shades to reflect the CPU temperature, providing valuable information at a glance. ASUS has always strived to make it easier for users to customize the cosmetic appearance of their PC components, and now it has become the world’s first motherboard brand to support 3D-printed components — making it easy for users to print their own parts to customize the motherboard’s appearance, improve system performance or manage cables. Dedicated onboard 3D mounts that use the same screws as M.2 and standard motherboard mounting holes make fitting 3D-printed parts easy, so users can quickly add custom nameplates, cable covers, or even an M.2 fan holder to lower M.2 temperature by up to 30°C — preventing throttling. ASUS has also designed a series of 3D-printable accessories, including 2-way SLI™ bridge cover, fan grille, ROG-font letters and all sizes of cable combs, adding style to any build. ASUS has also cooperated with Shapeways, the world’s largest 3D-printing service company, to launch the ASUS 3D Printing Store. This hosts the full selection of ASUS 3D-printable parts, enabling users to select the parts they want to print — replete with preferred materials and color — and order directly via Shapeways. For advanced customization, the original CAD files are available for download, allowing users to personalize them as much as they want before ordering parts via the Shapeways printing service or using their own 3D printers. Record-breaking performance: Redefining limits for the 7th Gen era The all-new ROG Maximus IX Apex motherboard is the latest ground breaking model in the ROG product family which brings players back to ROG’s roots, a one-of-kind community for world-class cutting-edge enthusiasts looking to reach the apex of gaming performance. With a performance-oriented layout, the Apex enables overclocking enthusiasts to go beyond the limits by using extreme cooling methods, including liquid nitrogen (LN2) or liquid helium (LHe)— and it’s already scored multiple world records (WRs) and global first places (GFPs), several being long-standing records. These include the best Intel Core processors CPU frequency processors, with a record of 7.383GHz on a single core and one thread and 7.328GHz on four cores and eight threads using the Intel Core i7-7700K. It also set a reference clock (BCLK) at 584MHz and a memory frequency surpassing 5GHz, with 5041MHz. In total, the Maximus IX Apex has secured eight world records and 13 global first places, as detailed in the following table: Category Benchmark New Score WR/GFP   PiFast 8sec 72ms WR   SuperPi 1M 4sec 937ms WR   SuperPi 32M 4mn 17sec 500ms WR   Cinebench R11.5 -4x 16.73 GFP   Cinebench R15 -4x 1515 GFP 2D Benchmarks GPUPI for CPU -1B x4 225643 GFP   Geekbench3 multi –x4 29463 GFP   HWBOT Prime -4x 8471 GFP   wPrime 32M – 4x 2sec 891ms GFP   wPrime 1024M – 4x 1mn 31sec 516ms GFP   XTU – 4x 2301 GFP           Aquamark       1x GPU 652098 GFP   3DMark2001 SE       1x GPU 212326 WR   3DMark03       1x GPU 351557 WR Legacy Benchmarks 2x GPU 342682 GFP   3DMark05       1x GPU 88398 WR   2x GPU 87604 GFP   3DMark06       1x GPU 68888 WR   2x GPU 68766 GFP           Unigine Heaven – Xtreme preset     3D Benchmark 1x GPU 11009.58 GFP   2x GPU 11187.77 WR *All world records were verified on 3rd January 2017 on HWBOT.org       Leave a comment SCAN THIS QR CODE WITH YOUR PHONE Close Next Post MSI debuts new Intel 200-series gaming motherboards Related Post The Strangest Gadgets of CES 2017 CES 2017 has just concluded, and we’ve seen many promising gadgets, such as LG’s paper-thin Related Post Panasonic unveils the rugged Toughpad FZ-A2 Android tablet Panasonic has announced a new Android tablet for consumers who care more about durability than Tags ASUS CES 2017 Intel 200-series chipset Intel Z270 Kaby Lake motherboards News PRIME B250M-A PRIME H270 PLUS PRIME H270 PRO PRIME Z270-A PRIME Z270-K PRIME Z270M-PLUS ROG MAXIMUS IX CODE ROG MAXIMUS IX FORMULA ROG MAXIMUS IX HERO ROG STRIX Z270E GAMING ROG STRIX Z270F GAMING ROG STRIX Z270G GAMING ROG STRIX Z270H GAMING Skylake TUF Z270 MARK 1 TUG Z270 MARK 2 Z270 © 1999 - 2016 VR Zone AP Pte.

The object Patterson produces from his pocket, not much larger than a credit card, is packing a fully functional system — CPU, SSD, RAM, and Wi-Fi — with a pair of ports on one end, which Intel says are USB Type-C with “extensions” that enable advanced connectivity like PCIe — with some room to spare for future improvements. More: Intel crams its freshly baked seventh-gen CPUs into five new NUC mini PCs It may seem like a smaller Compute Stick on the surface, but the Compute Card plays a very different role in the Intel system lineup. Hardware manufacturers, which already include big names like HP, Dell, InFocus, Lenovo, LG, and Sharp, will use Intel’s specifications to build the Compute Card into their new products. It’s an easy way for a company that does’t have experience producing tiny smart internals to add the functionality into a new device. Now LG doesn’t have to figure out how to produce the computing portion of its fridge, it can just outsource the problem. Even better, it means you don’t need to replace your fridge when you want new features — you can just upgrade the card. It also allows for some novel new advancements in modular security. The card can be built to physically latch into a device, or only release with software control, preventing unauthorized access. It can even be tied to a specific system, so inserting it into a card dock elsewhere wouldn’t work, thanks to a TPM module. No word on pricing or system specifics yet, but Patterson says it will scale up from Atom to full Intel Core processors with time. It’s also not the kind of system consumers would buy, although Intel says the idea of a NUC-sized dock for interested enthusiasts has been kicked around. Also watch: Share

Ars Staff - Jan 6, 2017 12:30 pm UTC reader comments 68 Share this story What happens at CES, ends up in a video montage. Jennifer Hahn LAS VEGAS—The annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas tries to get consumers (and the media) excited for the new year with a treasure trove of new devices. Most of the big names in computing, gaming, fitness tech, smart home, and more show off some of their newest products that will come out later in the year. And until they hit shelves (if they hit the shelves), CES is the only way to get a glimpse of them. While the show's vastness results in a lot of seemingly useless hardware and even some vaporware—Ars UK has intel on the smart hairbrush, LG wants to make sure no one ever has to open a fridge manually again—there are always a few products that stick out and manage to get us genuinely excited for the year ahead. You can find all our coverage from the ground here if you want to wade through both the crazy and cool, but these are our picks for the best technology coming out of CES 2017. Best laptop or convertible: Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga Enlarge Valentina Palladino Traditionally when buying a laptop, one has to compromise. You’ll find a system that has almost everything you want, but there’s always something missing. We wrote about some of the basic features that we're going to insist on for laptops in 2017, and one machine shown at CES stood out as doing all the things we want. With Thunderbolt 3, NVMe storage, Precision Touchpads, biometric authentication, touch screens, and so much more, we're ready to lay hands on the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga. The Yoga nails the basics. It also includes the 360-degree hinge that's invaluable on a plane or in a kitchen, a stylus that docks within the unit for safekeeping, built-in LTE connectivity, 802.11ad/WiGig, and (unusual these days) wired gigabit Ethernet. That's a compelling start, but it's the range of options that takes the Yoga to the next level: you can add an OLED screen, Iris Plus graphics, both a fingerprint reader and an IR camera supporting facial recognition, and NFC. The result is a machine that sets a new standard for connectivity and capabilities, showcasing some of the latest technology—and doing so without compromises. Best desktop or all-in-one: Intel Kaby Lake NUCs Enlarge Intel Further ReadingIntel’s new mini PCs have new chips, an updated design, and Thunderbolt 3 We've seen some interesting-looking all-in-one desktops at the show this year, including Dell's XPS 27 and HP's Pavilion Edge All-in-One with Micro-Edge Display. But in terms of sheer versatility and appeal, we've got to give the moniker of best to Intel's new NUC mini desktops. We've been fans of these PCs for years. Like the older NUCs, the new ones put decent Ultrabook-level performance suitable for productivity tasks and light gaming into a little box that will fit just about anywhere. The new models get an attractive makeover, the latest Kaby Lake CPUs and GPUs, HDMI 2.0 and HDMI-CEC support that will be sure to interest home theater enthusiasts, and a Thunderbolt 3 port that will allow for fast external storage, external GPUs, and all kinds of other possibilities. Best PC peripheral: Asus ROG Swift PG27UQ 27-inch gaming monitor Enlarge Asus Simply being first to something in the tech world isn’t necessarily a guarantee for quality or excellence. But when someone can lay claim to launching the consumer market's first monitor to combine 4K resolution, 144Hz refresh, HDR-10 compatibility, and Nvidia G-Sync support, they're bound to get our attention. Just finding three of those four in a PC monitor is tough these days. (The best we've seen, up until now, is Dell's UP3017Q, which maxes its 4K resolution at a 120Hz refresh without G-Sync.) Adding the wider color gamut and luminance differential of HDR to that package is a nice, brightly rendered cherry on top. You'll need quite the powerful computer to render such crisp, colorful, and smooth content, of course, but if you're already spending so much on a gaming powerhouse, what's another pricey monitor to you? Best gaming hardware: HTC Vive's TPCast Enlarge While the HTC Vive's room-scale VR experience is unquestionably amazing, it's also unquestionably annoying to deal with a thick, three-piece wire that tethers you to a nearby PC tower, tugging on the back of the headset and creating a tripping hazard while you walk around. That's why we're excited about the TPCast, which promises to make the Vive a truly wireless experience by streaming video and audio to the headset from a PC over the air (though there is still a wire running to a pocketable battery pack). There have been other untethered VR experiences, of course, but so far they tend to rely on underpowered mobile technology and have trouble with full head-tracking through space. TPCast promises the best of both worlds—high-end VR graphics and tracking without the annoying tether. If you can afford the $250 cost and can tolerate the reported two-hour battery life, this could greatly increase the quality of your virtual life.

The technology, which is a full-fledged computer, is the smallest and thinnest that the company has produced.  ( Intel ) Advertisement Intel might just have solved the challenge for the modular device concept with a breakthrough technology it unveiled at CES 2017. Called simply as the Compute Card, the device packs all necessary components required to run a computer or a smart device. You can merely plug it to a monitor or even an old smartphone and it will instantly turn each into a powerful computing device. More importantly, you can use it as a module for existing hardware so you will no longer need to keep on purchasing new ones. Tiny Full-Fledged Computer What is so cool about this Intel technology is its size. The Compute Card has about the same size footprint of a credit card and it is only 5 mm thick. The real estate is an incredible feat considering the fact that it already houses a motherboard, memory modules, storage, and Wi-Fi radio, among others. According to Gizmodo, this contraption could even include the latest Kaby Lake processor and it will not get any bigger at all. To top it all, Intel has promised the consistency of its form factor even after future upgrades. As a standalone computer, it can function in the same manner a USB stick works. You can plug it to a monitor at home and bring it with you to work. The only difference is that instead of a portable file storage, you will be carrying an entire computing system with you. No More Gadget Obsolescence Not a few, therefore, are already expecting the Compute Card to prevent any form of tech obsolescence. To put it another way, a device only gets upgraded with modules, complementing the Compute Card running at its core. This will be the case for devices that will have a dedicated Compute Card slot. Intel has already revealed that it is now working with several OEMs and the number is not limited to computer manufacturers. "Device makers simply design a standard Intel Compute Card slot into their device and then utilize the best Intel Compute Card for their performance and price needs," Intel said in an official statement. "This reduces the time and resources needed to design and validate the compute block and helps speed up innovation to bring the power of intelligence into an ever wider range of devices." Compatibility The Compute Card's power seems best applied to devices that are hard to upgrade such as smart appliances, cars, smart kiosks, and other internet-of-things gateways. When it debuts in the middle of this year, for example, the Compute Card will be found inside a Sharp television. The appliance is first in the queue since it now has Foxconn as a parent company. The Chinese manufacturer is Intel's partner in the development of the Compute Card. TAG Intel, Foxconn, Intel Kaby Lake, CES 2017 © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

Moore’s Law, which predicts that the number of transistors in a circuit will double every two years, has proved true since its introduction in the 1960s, but speculation has mounted since 2012 that the law will soon falter as technological progression reaches a peak. But Intel CEO Brian Krzanich used the new PC to demonstrate that “Moore’s Law is alive and well and flourishing”, according to Digital Trends. The publication reported that the unnamed 2-in-1 PC is the first to feature a 10nm chip, which Krzanich said will allow hardware manufacturers to build slimmer, more powerful devices that can better support virtual reality. He added: “So for those who are wondering if Moore’s Law is alive, is 10 nanometers going to be here, the answer is absolutely yes. And I believe Moore’s Law will be well beyond my career — alive and well and kicking.” Intel’s 10nm chip will feature in other products before the end of 2017, Digital Trends reported, with a recent Intel leak suggesting the Cannon Lake processor design could also push into 2018 in the form of Kaby Lake U and H chips.  Qualcomm also announced a 10nm chip, the Qualcomm Centriq 2400, at CES yesterday, after teasing them in December. Previous reports suggest Intel will start production of 7nm chips in 2020, and 5nm in 2022 if silicon remains a cost-effective material for processors.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Four cores and many years ago... Home Hardware Intel Hands-On With Intel’s New Kaby Lake CPU By Jeremy Laird on January 5th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Behold. Intel has a new PC processor. Does it game, will it blend, is it AMD’s Ryzen CPU you really want and what the hell happened to ‘Tick Tock’? For answers to at least some of these questions, including the shattering news that the arrival of Kaby Lake means the era of ‘Tick Tock’ is over, summarily usurped by ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation’ (or if leaked roadmaps are anything to go by, make that ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation and One More for the Road’), join me on the other side. I’ll save some of you a lot of trouble right from the get go and point out that Kaby Lake is fundamentally non-exciting, albeit for somewhat interesting reasons. It’s another mainstream CPU family from Intel that tops out at four cores and only ups the performance ante by a small increment. Broadly speaking, we’re talking less that 10 per cent performance improvement over existing Skylake CPUs from Intel. Kaby Lake is, in short, probably the last boring mainstream chip from Intel before various factors align and force Intel out of its slumber and into something resembling action. More on that in a moment. I’ve been hands-on with the two headline grabbing CPUs of the Kaby Lake range courtesy of MSI’s Z270 Gaming M5 motherboard, which showcases the new 200 Series chipsets that accompany Kaby. The processors in question are the 4.2GHz/4.5GHz Core i7-7700K and the 3.8GHz/4.2GHz Core i5-7600K. Thus by their ‘7xxx’ suffixes shall ye know Kaby Lake chips. First, let’s talk about what’s new in Kaby Lake the CPU, which isn’t much. The CPU cores are largely if not entirely identical to Skylake. The integrated graphics isn’t new either, not in terms of 3D rendering at least. It’s basically the same ‘Gen9’ integrated gunk as seen and not terribly enjoyed by gamers in Skylake chips. So we’re left with two really significant updates. The first involves manufacturing. Actually, Kaby Lake is a 14nm chip, which makes it the third such family from Intel. Hence the shift from the old so-called ‘Tick Tock’ paradigm which saw Intel crank out a new chip and a new production process in alternate years. The significance here is that Intel has officially given up trying to shrink its CPU transistors every other year. That reflects a general industry-wide slow down in chip development as the world’s silicon engineers increasingly bump up against the laws of physics. Anyway, ‘Tock tick’ is toast and now we have aforementioned ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation’, which buys Intel an extra year to get those tricky die shrinks out the door. Despite all that, Intel has refined the existing 14nm tech enough to bump Kaby Lake’s clockspeeds by around 200MHz to 300MHz higher than previous chips depending on the model in question. That’s where the less-than-10-per-cent performance uptick figure comes from given that the CPU cores aren’t any fancier. They just run a little quicker. That said, prior to launch the scuttlebutt implied that Kaby Lake might be quite the overclocker. Hold that thought. The other potentially significant novelty involves 2D video. Yeah, not exactly gaming relevant. But for the record, Kaby Lake is potentially really snazzy in this department. Firstly, it has some major decode and encode chops. Thanks to some new 2D hardware, it can decode up to eight standard 4K HEVC streams simultaneously, which is kind of crazy, and can also support ultra-high bitrate streams, too, up to 4K at 60 frames per second and 120Mbps. It has some new encode capabilities, too. Arguably even more newsworthy is some new DRM gubbins that will allow Kaby Lake PCs to be the first that are allowed to stream 4K Netflix content. Until now, that’s been restricted to HDTV apps and set top boxes. However, what’s not clear is whether that will only be possible when using the integrated graphics. Personally, I don’t see how it makes sense unless it’s tied to the integrated graphics, but we’ll see. But the point is that if you’re looking for an all-round computing solution, Kaby Lake does have a few tricks up its sleeve. It won’t make games run much faster. But if you’re due an upgrade the 4K Netflix shizzle could be appealing and the hardware decode could also be interesting for laptops. As for what the Core i7-7700K and the Core i5-7600K are like in the real world, I haven’t much to say. To be frank, they feel no different to similar quad-core chips since, arguably, 2011 when Sandy Bridge arrived and shook things up. If you want benchmarks, try these. It’s actually the platform and stuff like USB Type-C… As you can see, it’s a total wash versus any vaguely recent Intel CPU family in almost any game. The overclocking picture, however, is at least a little more interesting. I managed 5.2GHz from the Core i5-7600K and 5GHz from the Core i7-7700K. That’s a few hundred MHz more than you might expect from a Skylake chip. Welcome, but to be brutally honest, again you just ain’t gonna feel that kind of difference. Arguably of more tangible import are the motherboards and chipsets. Kaby Lake sticks with the LGA1151 socket, so it slots into existing Intel 100 series motherboards. Praise the Lord for such small mercies. That said, the new 200 Series chipsets do bring a few frills. Our muse for this purpose is MSI’s new Z270 Gaming G5, which uses the top-end Z270 chipswet (obviously) in a sort of middling format in terms of pricing, which should weighing in at around £165 if the existing Z170 Gaming M5 is anything to go by. There’s support for DDR4-2400 RAM, for instance, and another four PCI Express 3.0 lanes on the chipset for peripherals, making for 24 in total. That said, the connection between the chipset and the CPU is the same DMI 3.0 thingamy, so the max bandwidth hasn’t changed, which is about 4GB/s and thus a tiny fraction of the theoretical maximum of those 24 PCIE 3.0 lanes. …Optane memory support… Additional intrigue comes in the form of an otherwise unassuming logo atop the Gaming G5’s box. “Intel Optane Memory Ready”, it reads. But what does it mean? That’s a story in itself (which I’ve touched on briefly, earlier), but the short version is that Intel has cooked up a new non-volatile memory tech. Like flash memory, it doesn’t need power to maintain data storage. But it’s far faster than flash memory. Think of it as being a cross between flash and RAM and you’ll have the right rough idea. How it will all work is a little unclear at this stage. It seems Optane will initially come in smallish drives of 16GB and 32GB and act as a sort of cache drive rather than as a conventional mass-storage hard drive. Eventually as the price comes down, I think we’ll see straight-up Optane SSDs for mass storage. Anyway, if you like the sound of Optane, support begins with the new 200 Series chipsets. Elsewhere, the MSI Gaming M5 serves ups various modern features, including a pair of M.2 slots and a USB Type-C port. So as has often been the case of late, it’s actually the platform that looks more compelling as an upgrade option for a few-years-old PC, rather than the CPU. The context to all this, of course, and the ‘factor’ I alluded to earlier is the imminent launch of AMD new’s Ryzen CPU. Again, I’ll cover the full story in another post, but Ryzen looks awfully promising and it’s likely that Intel will be forced to respond with a major upgrade to its mainstream CPUs within the next year, including its first six-core mainstream chip. …and generally bags of bandwidth with 200 Series motherboards like the MSI Z270 Gaming M5 that’s arguably a bit interesting, not the Kaby lake chip itself… All of which makes it pretty hard to get excited about Kaby Lake. In truth, you have to go back to Sandy Bridge in 2011 to find a mainstream Intel CPU that really moved the game forward. Kaby Lake doesn’t change that. But hopefully it will be the last of its type, the last sand-bagging Intel chip, if you like. About bloody time it will be, too. TL;DR – By their 7xxx suffixes shall ye know Kaby Lake – They change very little in terms of gaming performance – They overclock pretty well – It says something that 4K Netflix support is perhaps the main selling point – The new 200 Series platform is probably more interesting than the CPU itself thanks to Optane memory support.

Two chips run hotter than the equivalent Skylake model; the third runs cooler, with something like 20% lower current usage.

Log in to Reply 06/01/2017 at 12:48 LewdPenguin says: If my motherboard hadn’t combusted I expect I’d be in a similar position still running a 7-8 year old CPU, having only upgraded the graphics card probably twice by now. Buying into every new hardware release seems entirely pointless to me, the occasions I would actually max out my old CPU were few enough to have made any upgrade pretty much unnoticeable 99% of the time. Then again the article seems pretty clear in its opinion that unless like me you’re currently looking at potentially (re)building a system pretty much from scratch then there’s little reason to upgrade right now from a performance perspective. In fact if the next new generation of chips is truly going to be the next notable step-change in performance rather than just further incremental optimisation then its all the more reason for potential optional upgraders to hold off.

And that’s a £250 CPU, plus with the cost of new mobo and ram I decided it 100% wasn’t worth it. I also looked up some gaming benchmarks for DDR4 and was seeing less than 1% gains. The only real downside to the tech gen I’m using is only 2x 6GB/S SATA3 ports which means some of my SSDs aren’t running full speed.

Running it at rock solid 4.6 for years and still shreds everything I throw at it e.g. Dishonored 2 at 1440p, everything at ultra never dips below 60fps (v-synced, actually goes way higher if I let it). Granted, it’s sharing a case with a GTX1080, 16gb ram and nosebleed fast internet but as far as the cpu goes there’s absolutely no reason to fork out yet. Give me a decent 40-50% increase in performance over my old timer and my money’s yours Intel.

This fleet of self-driving BMW 7 Series cars will be tested in the US and Europe. This news follows last July’s announcement that the 3 firms would be cooperating on the development of self-driving vehicles. Since the partnership was first announced, the companies have succeeded in developing “a scalable architecture that can be adopted by other automotive developers and carmakers to pursue state of the art designs and create differentiated brands.” “Making autonomous driving a reality for our customers is the shared ambition behind our cooperation with Intel and Mobileye. This partnership has all of the skills and talent necessary to overcome the enormous technological challenges ahead and commercialize self-driving vehicles. Therefore, we are already thinking in terms of scalability and welcome other companies — manufacturers, suppliers or technology companies — to participate and contribute to our autonomous platform,” stated Klaus Fröhlich, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG for Development. “This year our fleet of vehicles will already test this joint technology globally under real traffic conditions. This is a significant step towards the introduction of the BMW iNEXT in 2021, which will be the BMW Group’s first fully autonomous vehicle,” he added. As you would expect, BMW will be responsible for the actual real-world testing of the self-driving fleet, as well as the evaluation of the overall functional safety of the technologies. BMW will also be responsible for the integration of the various components and prototype production. The press release provides more: “Within the car, the Intel GO solution offers a scalable development and compute platform for critical functions including sensor fusion, driving policy, environment modeling, path planning and decision making. In the data center, Intel GO offers a wide range of technologies ranging from the high performance Intel Xeon processors, to Intel Arria 10 FPGAs and Intel Solid State Drives to the Intel Nervana platform for artificial intelligence that provides a powerful machine and deep learning training and simulation infrastructure required for the autonomous driving industry. “Mobileye contributes its proprietary EyeQ5 high-performance computer vision processor offering automotive-grade functional safety and low-power performance. The EyeQ5 is responsible for processing and interpretation of input from the 360-degree surround view vision sensors as well as localization. EyeQ5, in combination with Intel CPU and FPGA technologies, which forms the Central Computing Platform to be integrated into each autonomous vehicle.” BMW and Mobileye will apparently be working closely to develop the sensor fusion solution — which will integrate LiDAR, camera, and radar inputs. As a reminder here, the plan is apparently for the test efforts to lead directly to the release of the BMW iNEXT model in 2021. So … don’t get too impatient as a result of the news, we’ve quite a while to go before BMW releases a fully autonomous car.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Jef Cozza. Updated January 4, 2017 9:04AM SHARE ALSO SEE CES Intel Processor Chip Kaby Lake Hardware Laptops Desktops Enterprise IT Technology News Chipmaker Intel announced updates to its core CPU series yesterday, in preparation for the CES 2017 tradeshow in Las Vegas, which officially opens Jan 5. The announcement focused on launch of the remaining models in the 7th generation of its Intel Core processors. The addition of the desktop versions of the Kaby Lake processors should have plenty of appeal for enterprise clients thanks to improved performance, security, and graphics. The new CPUs feature several small improvements in efficiency and performance over Intel's previous Skylake models. Improved Integrated Graphics One of the key differences between Kaby Lake and Skylake is an upgraded video engine. This can be important for laptops that lack the space for a dedicated graphics card, but often has little impact on the desktop market where users can add a dedicated GPU. But most corporate customers aren't going to invest in separate graphics cards for their employees' desktops. For these buyers, the improved media engine offers the promise of improved graphics and video rendering performance during their next upgrade cycles without having to spend any extra cash on a GPU. "With the latest 7th Gen Intel Core vPro processors, business owners and IT managers can offer new PCs with up to 10 hours of battery life and a 65 percent increase in productivity when compared with a 5-year-old PC," Navin Shenoy (pictured above), senior vice president and general manager for the Client Computing Group at Intel, said in a statement about the launch. "And with many Millennials today taking technology into consideration when choosing their workplace, I'm confident the new 7th Gen Intel Core processor-based 2 in 1s and AIOs will delight them." Enhanced Security for Enterprises The new Kaby Lake chips make use of the same 14nm manufacturing process that Intel introduced with the launch of its Broadwell chips several years ago. Nevertheless, Intel is claiming that the new chips show a significant improvement in performance over the previous Skylake processors, with up to 20 percent improvement for performance and gaming notebooks and 25 percent for desktops. For 4K and 360-degree content, users can expect up to 65 percent faster performance on notebooks and 35 percent faster on desktops, the company said. But the biggest news for enterprise clients is likely the new improvements in security. The new chips feature several advances in hardware-enhanced security and two-factor authentication. The new processors feature Intel's hardware-based Authenticate multi-factor authentication solution. Authenticate verifies user identity using a combination of hardened factors such as a PIN, a Bluetooth signal from the user's phone or a biometric identifier, such as a fingerprint, making employee logins many times more secure than traditional password logins. The new integrated graphics engine and hardwired security features of the Kaby Lake chips will likely make it appealing to businesses that were already looking to replace their aging IT infrastructures.

What's ahead for 2017? Hackers Release Malware Tools   Review: Samsung Gear S3 Classic   Concierge Tech Comes to Cruise Line   iPhone 8: Rumor of the Week   MORE IN HARDWARE PC Sales Continue on Downward Slide Dell Intros Wireless Charging Laptop Samsung Debuts Chromebook at CES New Snapdragon 835 Chip Debuts Intel, Dell Show Off New Products Next Article > Qualcomm Unveils Smaller, More Powerful Snapdragon 835 Chip By Shirley Siluk / Top Tech News. Updated January 04, 2017. The next generation of Qualcomm Technologies' Snapdragon system-on-chip (SoC) will be far smaller, thinner and more power-efficient than than the previous version. It will also support faster wireless connectivity for mobile computing, gaming and multimedia use, the company said yesterday. Introduced yesterday ahead of the kick-off to CES 2017, which runs from Jan. 5 through Jan. 8, in Las Vegas, Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 is made by Samsung using a new 10-nanometer design that could put new pressure on competitor Intel. Currently, the global microprocessor leader, Intel is still producing 14-nanometer-based chips, although the company said it expects to begin shipping 10-nanometer technology sometime this year. Qualcomm's new design for the Snapdragon 835 makes the SoC 35 percent smaller than the previous version, the Snapdragon 820. Combined with the Snapdragon 835's improved power profile, that means the new chip could enable significantly better battery life, charging, camera images and virtual reality applications for a range of devices, Qualcomm said. 835 To Appear in New Smart Glasses "[A]s we embark on a new era of intelligent, connected experiences, our mobile devices are going to need a new, one-of-a-kind processor that's smaller, faster, and more energy-efficient than any chipset in history," Francisco Cheng, Qualcomm's director of technical marketing, wrote yesterday on the company's Snapdragon blog. "Qualcomm Technologies' newest mobile SoC is designed to meet every one of these rigorous requirements while setting new standards in mobile performance." The architectural improvements in the Snapdragon 835 will pave the way for a new wave of capabilities in smartphones, virtual reality (VR) gear, Bluetooth devices, 4G connectivity and security-focused authentication, Cheng said. The improved computing power of the new SoC will also enable smarter and more dynamic machine learning applications, he added. One of the first VR devices to incorporate the Snapdragon 835 will be Osterhout Design Group's R-8 and R-9 smart glasses, both set to hit the market later this year. Unveiled at CES yesterday, the devices will allow wearers to view movies and videos, play games and read articles and books, among other uses. Improvements Across 5 Key Technologies Qualcomm said the Snapdragon 835 will help deliver improvements across five key technologies: battery life, virtual/augmented reality immersion, image and video capture, connectivity and security. One of the chip's new features, Qualcomm Haven, is a security platform that supports biometric authentication via fingerprint, eye and face-based imagery. The Snapdragon 835 also features an upgraded software framework for neural processing that will enable new machine learning capabilities, Qualcomm said. Original equipment manufacturers and software developers will be able to use these capabilities for "rich experiences such as intelligent photography, strong security and privacy protection, smart automobiles and personal assistants, and responsive and true-to-life VR and AR," Qualcomm said. Faster connectivity will be provided through the chip's new integrated Snapdragon X16 LTE modem, which can support download speeds of up to one gigabit per second and upload speeds of up to 150 megabits per second, Qualcomm said. The company added that the new Snapdragon is also the first certified commercial technology to support the latest Bluetooth 5 standard, which promises signficant improvements over the previous Bluetooth 4 range and connection speeds. In production now, the Snapdragon 835 will begin appearing in commercial devices hitting the market in the first half of this year, Qualcomm said.

The maxim, which became known as Moore’s law, directed technology companies for five decades before reaching a crunch point last year. Physicists and technology giants alike said transistors had reached a point where it was no longer economically viable to make them smaller, bringing about the end of the law. But Intel’s chief executive Brian Krzanich has put an end to such fears with news the company will release a 10 nanometre chip in 2017. The tiny chip will be cheaper than its predecessor, Intel said, keeping Moore’s law alive. "I've heard the death of Moore's law more times than anything else in my 34-year career and I'm here today to really show you and tell you that Moore's law is alive and well and flourishing," Krzanich said. The news came as Intel opened the doors on its virtual reality project, which includes applications for the technology, content production and a headset. For Krzanich, VR is one of the most exciting uses of the faster processor coming this year. “Imagine in your living room being able to walk around the next hotel you’re going to visit, or visiting the event you’re going to,” said Krzanich in a demonstration of the VR uses Intel is working on at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Some of the applications Intel is developing include live sports games in VR and monitoring remote areas, such as solar panel farms, through a live 360 video stream from a drone and a VR headset. The chipmaker has teamed up with La Liga to fit three stadiums with 360-degree cameras that will stream to 38 channels this year. “From the comfort of your home you could be transported to your favourite seat,” said Krzanich. “This is the future of how you’ll view sports. You’ll have the opportunity to go to games you’ve never been to before.”   David Fuller's view I do not assume that silicon chips will always be used for the more complex challenges, because the technology for transistors is still in its infancy, relative to future developments.  We live in an exciting era of accelerating technological innovation, which will not end of its own accord. This item continues in the Subscriber’s Area, where a PDF of The Telegraph’s article is also posted.   Email of the day On the economic consensus being horribly wrong: Dear David I really enjoyed reading this very positive article about the UK economy which was written by a distinguished and well-informed commentator. All the points he makes sound good sense to me. The most surprising thing is the newspaper in which it was published, the rabidly anti-Brexit Independent. Maybe some newspapers are at last tiring of their own negativity! Best wishes   David Fuller's view Thanks for this and more people in the UK now hold similar views, than at the time of the referendum. The biggest risk, in my opinion, would be a frustratingly long exit from the EU, which would increase uncertainty, not least within both the UK and international business communities.  I hope the Supreme Court will bear this in mind and decide on what is best for the UK under the current circumstances.  However, if it rules that legislation is required before notice of Brexit is served – a debatable legal point - I think the additional delay would be both divisive and more costly for the UK economy.   President Mark Zuckerberg? It May Not Be as Crazy as It Sounds Here is the opening of this intriguing article by James Titcomb for The Telegraph: When 13 tech bosses – among them some of the world’s richest entrepreneurs – were summoned for a meeting with Donald Trump, one face was conspicuous in its absence. Facebook’s role in the US election had been much scrutinised: it was accused of being a petri dish for fake news that allowed anti-Clinton stories to spread like wildfire; and the social network was employed to great effect by the Trump campaign, which built up profiles of voters to target and bombarded them with ads. And yet, Mark Zuckerberg was nowhere to be seen at Trump Tower. Instead, he sent his trusted deputy and chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, making Facebook the only company at the meeting without its CEO in attendance. Zuckerberg has not explained his absence, but two likely – and related – reasons may well become clear. Firstly, the man who started Facebook 13 years ago now has priorities outside of its daily running: as with many tech founders, he would prefer the nitty gritty of advertising relationships and regulatory tangles to be dealt with by someone else, as Zuckerberg focuses on his missions – the $45bn fund he has set up with his wife Priscilla Chan, or the internet.org project to bring connectivity to the world’s poor. But more fundamentally, Zuckerberg may see a photo-op with the president-elect as harming his own political ambitions, especially if he plans to act on them sooner rather than later. If your main impression of Facebook’s founder came through seeing The Social Network in 2010, you might find the film's portrayal of Zuckerberg as an awkward Machiavellian schemer a little difficult to square with the idea of a role in public office. But in recent years he has been spring cleaning his image. Connecting directly to the world via his own Facebook page, Mark Zuckerberg is now the family man, the internationalist and the statesman (his profile is full of images documenting meetings with Narendra Modi, officials in Beijing, and Pope Francis). While like much of his Silicon Valley brethren, he is a natural liberal, lobbying on immigration and science research, but Zuckerberg has been careful to appeal to a wider base. In response to allegations that Facebook suppressed conservative news, he fired the team responsible and replaced them with supposedly bias-free algorithms. He has declined to take the immediate action that many liberals demanded on Facebook’s fake news problem. He has come out as religious after years of claiming atheism, a move that a cynic could point to as practically mandatory for high office. And most recently, he announced his ambition to visit every state in the US in order to understand the effect of globalisation. “We need to find a way to change the game so it works for everyone,” he said on Tuesday.   David Fuller's view It may seem a bit early to be discussing this possibility shortly before President-elect Trump is sworn in on 20th January… but perhaps not.  After all, Trump has certainly opened the door for unconventional candidates who have never held political office. Might the possibility of a bad Trump presidency close that door?  Theoretically, yes although I think it would be premature to assume that Trump will be judged as having more failures than success over the next four years.  In any event, Trump and Zuckerberg have very different profiles.   I think it would be a great idea if Zuckerberg ran for President in 2020, or 2024.  Governance is everything and countries with the most capable leaders generally outperform.  If nominated by his Party, I suspect Zuckerberg would win.   America's Roster of Public Companies Is Shrinking Before Our Eyes This article by Maureen Farrell for the Wall Street Journal may be of interest to subscribers. Here is a section: The number of U.S.-listed companies has declined by more than 3,000 since peaking at 9,113 in 1997, according to the University of Chicago’s Center for Research in Security Prices. As of June, there were 5,734 such public companies, little more than in 1982, when the economy was less than half its current size. Meanwhile, the average public company’s valuation has ballooned. In the technology industry, the private fundraising market now dwarfs its public counterpart. There were just 26 U.S.-listed technology IPOs last year, raising $4.3 billion, according to Dealogic. Meanwhile, private U.S. tech companies tapped the late-stage funding market 809 times last year, raising $19 billion, Dow Jones VentureSource’s data show. Private funding markets have taken on attributes of public equity, such as an ability to hand employees shares they can trade. Airbnb Inc.’s recent $850 million funding round, which valued the home-rental company at $30 billion, enabled employees to sell $200 million of stock. Investors, particularly in late-stage funding rounds, now often have a better view of a private company’s financials than they used to, including through quarterly conference calls. “There’s no great advantage of being public,” says Jerry Davis, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business and author of “The Vanishing American Corporation.” “The dangers of being a public company are really evident.”   Eoin Treacy's view There have been two important themes that have shaped the view going public is not the most worthwhile exercise for new companies. The overbearing nature of regulatory requirements has increased substantially over the last decade, not least in response to the financial crisis, and this represents a significant cost for public companies which private companies avoid. It is quite simply a hassle for small companies to go through the motions of preparing earnings reports on a quarterly basis and formulating them in such a way as to be amenable to analysts.   Bitcoin Suffers Biggest Fall in Two Years Following China Currency Gains This article by Martin Baccardax for Bloomberg may be of interest to subscribers. Here it is in full: Bitcoin's value suffered its biggest single-day decline in two years Thursday, just hours after China's offshore yuan posted its biggest two day gain and days after the cryptocurrency touched $1,000. The price of bitcoins against the U.S. dollar fell 13% in London trading, changing hands at around $950 each by 13:45 GMT. Bitcoins traded as low as $880 during a volatile session which saw it reach as high as $1137, according financial bookmakers IG. The moves follow the biggest two-day gain on record for China's offshore yuan, which trades more freely than the domestically controlled currency of the world's second-largest economy. Speculation of government buying led the gains as investors bet authorities are determined to stem capital outflows and avoid a sustained decline in the currency ahead of the inauguration of President elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to label China as a currency manipulator. The connection is relevant in the nearly all of the daily trading in bitcoin is linked to the yuan, which has fallen more than 7% against the dollar over the past year, as speculators attempt to skirt currency controls and ensure value. The offshore yuan gain 1% to 6.7989 against the greenback in Asia trading, putting downward pressure on the dollar index and boosting the yen in foreign exchange trading. The move whipsawed the dollar index, a measure of its strength against a basket of six global currencies, from a near 14-year high on Tuesday to three-week low of 101.74 by the start of European trading before it recovered to 102.10 by 13:45 GMT   Eoin Treacy's view I have been pointing out in recent audios that China represents the majority of Bitcoin trading and what goes on in that country is likely to have a profound impact on the value of the cryptocurrency. In many respects we might look on Bitcoin as the anti-Renminbi because it tends to do best when Chinese investors are worried about the stability of their domestic currency.   Treasuries Soar Most Since Post-Brexit as Market Volatility Hits This article by Brian Chappatta and Edward Bolingbroke for Bloomberg may be of interest to subscribers. Here is a section: Treasuries extended gains across the curve, driving down benchmark yields by the most since the days after the June Brexit vote, as traders across financial markets backed away from crowded bets. The benchmark 10-year U.S. yield plunged about eight basis points to 2.36 percent at 12:15 p.m. in New York, touching the lowest level since Dec. 8, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. It’s on pace for the biggest decline since June 27. The 10-year break-even rate, a market measure of inflation expectations, fell from close to the highest level since 2014. Across financial markets, trends snapped Thursday as investors weighed the risk of a lackluster payrolls report Friday and the prospect that trades based on Donald Trump’s impending presidency had gone too far. Data from the ADP Research Institute on Thursday indicated companies added fewer jobs in December than forecast. The figures come a day before the Labor Department releases its monthly payrolls report. “A bunch of the widely predicted trades for this year are all being broken at the same time, with oil going lower, investment-grade corporates widening out, TIPS break-evens tightening, and then rates rallying as a result,” said Mike Lorizio, a Boston-based senior trader at Manulife Asset Management, which oversees about $343 billion. “Some key levels being broken just inspired further buying.”    Eoin Treacy's view The odds are in favour of the view that the 35-year bull market in bonds is over, however it would be a mistake to think that such a lengthy expansion will end overnight. Inflationary expectations might well be justified in the medium-term but they have run ahead of the market and Treasury yields in the region of 2.5% are competitive with many equities and therefore desirable by bond investors conditioned over generations to buy the dip.   Email of the day on separate video and audio files The VIMEO software for the new subscriber’s audio demands lots of download capacity. I am fixing this issue with my phone company. Is it possible to include a separate Audio file with the combined Video & Audio? If I am away from the house I like the choice to just to listen to the audio. If this is too difficult don't worry I like the new Video and Audio format. Eoin see you in Singapore in April.   Eoin Treacy's view Thank you for this question which gives me the opportunity to clarify what services we are in fact providing and I look forward to renewing our acquaintance in Singapore in April. I record the video and audio file concurrently and post them separately. You will find links to the video on the homepage for the relevant day but I also post the regular audio file separately in the Subscriber’s Audio section.

Since then, the trio have worked on creating a scalable architecture that can be used by other automakers as a foundation and go on to create their own set of autonomous vehicles. After a quiet few months of development, BMW announced at the ongoing 2017 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) that approximately 40 autonomous cars will be on the roads by the second of 2017. The German auto giant says that the fleet of BMW 7 Series will feature cutting-edge Intel and Mobileye tech during the global trials, starting in USA and Europe. All three companies are pioneers in their own game. As part of the tie-up, BMW Group will be responsible for testing the overall functional safety, driving and dynamics of the autonomous system. The Munich-based carmaker is also aligned to engineer a high performance simulation engine, overall technology integration into the cars, production of prototypes and eventually sizing up the platform with the help of deployment partners. Intel will inject the power of high performance computing elements that will connect the vehicle to the data centre. It will make use of its newly launched Intel GO solution for autonomous driving, which the company says, delivers the most efficient balance between power and performance and, at the same time, meets the challenging thermal and safety requisites of the auto industry. Intel’s in-car tech will help compute platform for vital functions like sensor fusion, driving policy, environment modeling, path planning and decision making. Then comes the part where Mobileye can flex its muscles. The company uses its EyeQ 5 high-performance vision processor which has automotive-grade functional safety and low-power performance. The tech is responsible to read and understand the surroundings of the vehicle from its 360-degree view vision sensors. This system, in collaboration with the Intel’s in-car CPU, forms the central computing platform that will be integrated in every autonomous vehicle. Mobileye will further partner with BMW to develop the sensor fusion function which will help to create a full model of the environment surrounding the vehicle. BMW recently announced that it will develop a range of autonomous vehicles under its iNEXT project name by 2021. These developments will surely help the carmaker to establish a concrete platform for it to build on for the future of mobility.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Four cores and many years ago... Home Hardware Intel Hands-On With Intel’s New Kaby Lake CPU By Jeremy Laird on January 5th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Behold. Intel has a new PC processor. Does it game, will it blend, is it AMD’s Ryzen CPU you really want and what the hell happened to ‘Tick Tock’? For answers to at least some of these questions, including the shattering news that the arrival of Kaby Lake means the era of ‘Tick Tock’ is over, summarily usurped by ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation’ (or if leaked roadmaps are anything to go by, make that ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation and One More for the Road’), join me on the other side. I’ll save some of you a lot of trouble right from the get go and point out that Kaby Lake is fundamentally non-exciting, albeit for somewhat interesting reasons. It’s another mainstream CPU family from Intel that tops out at four cores and only ups the performance ante by a small increment. Broadly speaking, we’re talking less that 10 per cent performance improvement over existing Skylake CPUs from Intel. Kaby Lake is, in short, probably the last boring mainstream chip from Intel before various factors align and force Intel out of its slumber and into something resembling action. More on that in a moment. I’ve been hands-on with the two headline grabbing CPUs of the Kaby Lake range courtesy of MSI’s Z270 Gaming M5 motherboard, which showcases the new 200 Series chipsets that accompany Kaby. The processors in question are the 4.2GHz/4.5GHz Core i7-7700K and the 3.8GHz/4.2GHz Core i5-7600K. Thus by their ‘7xxx’ suffixes shall ye know Kaby Lake chips. First, let’s talk about what’s new in Kaby Lake the CPU, which isn’t much. The CPU cores are largely if not entirely identical to Skylake. The integrated graphics isn’t new either, not in terms of 3D rendering at least. It’s basically the same ‘Gen9’ integrated gunk as seen and not terribly enjoyed by gamers in Skylake chips. So we’re left with two really significant updates. The first involves manufacturing. Actually, Kaby Lake is a 14nm chip, which makes it the third such family from Intel. Hence the shift from the old so-called ‘Tick Tock’ paradigm which saw Intel crank out a new chip and a new production process in alternate years. The significance here is that Intel has officially given up trying to shrink its CPU transistors every other year. That reflects a general industry-wide slow down in chip development as the world’s silicon engineers increasingly bump up against the laws of physics. Anyway, ‘Tock tick’ is toast and now we have aforementioned ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation’, which buys Intel an extra year to get those tricky die shrinks out the door. Despite all that, Intel has refined the existing 14nm tech enough to bump Kaby Lake’s clockspeeds by around 200MHz to 300MHz higher than previous chips depending on the model in question. That’s where the less-than-10-per-cent performance uptick figure comes from given that the CPU cores aren’t any fancier. They just run a little quicker. That said, prior to launch the scuttlebutt implied that Kaby Lake might be quite the overclocker. Hold that thought. The other potentially significant novelty involves 2D video. Yeah, not exactly gaming relevant. But for the record, Kaby Lake is potentially really snazzy in this department. Firstly, it has some major decode and encode chops. Thanks to some new 2D hardware, it can decode up to eight standard 4K HEVC streams simultaneously, which is kind of crazy, and can also support ultra-high bitrate streams, too, up to 4K at 60 frames per second and 120Mbps. It has some new encode capabilities, too. Arguably even more newsworthy is some new DRM gubbins that will allow Kaby Lake PCs to be the first that are allowed to stream 4K Netflix content. Until now, that’s been restricted to HDTV apps and set top boxes. However, what’s not clear is whether that will only be possible when using the integrated graphics. Personally, I don’t see how it makes sense unless it’s tied to the integrated graphics, but we’ll see. But the point is that if you’re looking for an all-round computing solution, Kaby Lake does have a few tricks up its sleeve. It won’t make games run much faster. But if you’re due an upgrade the 4K Netflix shizzle could be appealing and the hardware decode could also be interesting for laptops. As for what the Core i7-7700K and the Core i5-7600K are like in the real world, I haven’t much to say. To be frank, they feel no different to similar quad-core chips since, arguably, 2011 when Sandy Bridge arrived and shook things up. If you want benchmarks, try these. It’s actually the platform and stuff like USB Type-C… As you can see, it’s a total wash versus any vaguely recent Intel CPU family in almost any game. The overclocking picture, however, is at least a little more interesting. I managed 5.2GHz from the Core i5-7600K and 5GHz from the Core i7-7700K. That’s a few hundred MHz more than you might expect from a Skylake chip. Welcome, but to be brutally honest, again you just ain’t gonna feel that kind of difference. Arguably of more tangible import are the motherboards and chipsets. Kaby Lake sticks with the LGA1151 socket, so it slots into existing Intel 100 series motherboards. Praise the Lord for such small mercies. That said, the new 200 Series chipsets do bring a few frills. Our muse for this purpose is MSI’s new Z270 Gaming G5, which uses the top-end Z270 chipswet (obviously) in a sort of middling format in terms of pricing, which should weighing in at around £165 if the existing Z170 Gaming M5 is anything to go by. There’s support for DDR4-2400 RAM, for instance, and another four PCI Express 3.0 lanes on the chipset for peripherals, making for 24 in total. That said, the connection between the chipset and the CPU is the same DMI 3.0 thingamy, so the max bandwidth hasn’t changed, which is about 4GB/s and thus a tiny fraction of the theoretical maximum of those 24 PCIE 3.0 lanes. …Optane memory support… Additional intrigue comes in the form of an otherwise unassuming logo atop the Gaming G5’s box. “Intel Optane Memory Ready”, it reads. But what does it mean? That’s a story in itself (which I’ve touched on briefly, earlier), but the short version is that Intel has cooked up a new non-volatile memory tech. Like flash memory, it doesn’t need power to maintain data storage. But it’s far faster than flash memory. Think of it as being a cross between flash and RAM and you’ll have the right rough idea. How it will all work is a little unclear at this stage. It seems Optane will initially come in smallish drives of 16GB and 32GB and act as a sort of cache drive rather than as a conventional mass-storage hard drive. Eventually as the price comes down, I think we’ll see straight-up Optane SSDs for mass storage. Anyway, if you like the sound of Optane, support begins with the new 200 Series chipsets. Elsewhere, the MSI Gaming M5 serves ups various modern features, including a pair of M.2 slots and a USB Type-C port. So as has often been the case of late, it’s actually the platform that looks more compelling as an upgrade option for a few-years-old PC, rather than the CPU. The context to all this, of course, and the ‘factor’ I alluded to earlier is the imminent launch of AMD new’s Ryzen CPU. Again, I’ll cover the full story in another post, but Ryzen looks awfully promising and it’s likely that Intel will be forced to respond with a major upgrade to its mainstream CPUs within the next year, including its first six-core mainstream chip. …and generally bags of bandwidth with 200 Series motherboards like the MSI Z270 Gaming M5 that’s arguably a bit interesting, not the Kaby lake chip itself… All of which makes it pretty hard to get excited about Kaby Lake. In truth, you have to go back to Sandy Bridge in 2011 to find a mainstream Intel CPU that really moved the game forward. Kaby Lake doesn’t change that. But hopefully it will be the last of its type, the last sand-bagging Intel chip, if you like. About bloody time it will be, too. TL;DR – By their 7xxx suffixes shall ye know Kaby Lake – They change very little in terms of gaming performance – They overclock pretty well – It says something that 4K Netflix support is perhaps the main selling point – The new 200 Series platform is probably more interesting than the CPU itself thanks to Optane memory support.

They have several chip samples on hand, and power consumption is all over the map, even running the same processor models at the same clock speed and voltage. Two chips run hotter than the equivalent Skylake model; the third runs cooler, with something like 20% lower current usage.

Log in to Reply 05/01/2017 at 23:37 Jeremy Laird says: Bit of a minefield, HDR, especially as it pertains to monitors. I actually don’t think it changes a huge amount. You still want to focus on the fundamentals – size, panel type, resolution and refresh rate. OLED will be the big game changer, not HDR applied to conventional LCD technology, in my view.

That’s pretty much the reason why I’ve been considering an upgrade from Haswell. And while AMD’s Ryzen sounds promising, I remain skeptical about their ability to deliver on those promises – or that they will leapfrog Kaby Lake.

I tried win 10 for a week and found out it is basically an advertisement platform that is incompatible with my older games that I haven’t played yet. thanks Log in to Reply 06/01/2017 at 03:03 Person of Interest says: Some of the review sites tested their Kaby Lakes on Windows 7. No problems reported from them, although the integrated graphics seem to be giving some Win7 users trouble, and I didn’t see any reviews test the new stuff in Kaby Lake (more video decoding features and more granular power management).

I think some folks just like a new shiny. Graphics cards of course are a different story. Log in to Reply 06/01/2017 at 12:03 Ghostwise says: People are funny with their hobbies. Yeah. I hear that there are even grown-ups who play video games, these days. Little Pac-Man and whatnot. That’s ridiculous. Log in to Reply 06/01/2017 at 12:48 LewdPenguin says: If my motherboard hadn’t combusted I expect I’d be in a similar position still running a 7-8 year old CPU, having only upgraded the graphics card probably twice by now. Buying into every new hardware release seems entirely pointless to me, the occasions I would actually max out my old CPU were few enough to have made any upgrade pretty much unnoticeable 99% of the time. Then again the article seems pretty clear in its opinion that unless like me you’re currently looking at potentially (re)building a system pretty much from scratch then there’s little reason to upgrade right now from a performance perspective. In fact if the next new generation of chips is truly going to be the next notable step-change in performance rather than just further incremental optimisation then its all the more reason for potential optional upgraders to hold off.

It’s pretty hard to actually find a motherboard without one, at least looking at consumer chipsets. Log in to Reply 06/01/2017 at 15:22 fish99 says: I was considering a CPU upgrade from my 3570K recently, but after looking up some benchmarks, was surprised to see a 6600K is only 11% quicker, and that’s with it running 100 MHz quicker than my 3570K. And that’s a £250 CPU, plus with the cost of new mobo and ram I decided it 100% wasn’t worth it. I also looked up some gaming benchmarks for DDR4 and was seeing less than 1% gains. The only real downside to the tech gen I’m using is only 2x 6GB/S SATA3 ports which means some of my SSDs aren’t running full speed.

Log in to Reply 07/01/2017 at 15:44 Chorltonwheelie says: Yeah, still see no reason to upgrade from my venerable i5 3570k at all. Running it at rock solid 4.6 for years and still shreds everything I throw at it e.g. Dishonored 2 at 1440p, everything at ultra never dips below 60fps (v-synced, actually goes way higher if I let it). Granted, it’s sharing a case with a GTX1080, 16gb ram and nosebleed fast internet but as far as the cpu goes there’s absolutely no reason to fork out yet. Give me a decent 40-50% increase in performance over my old timer and my money’s yours Intel.

Cpu wise I’m set for another 3 years at least. 4800mhz overclock is running smooth on the 4690k, I’m happy. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

When working for Intel Corporation for over 15 years, Kalyan Muppaneni, founder and chief executive of Pi Datacenters, was always close to the hardware, digitisation and server market. That was how he developed a passion for back-end infrastructure, an area not many techies would think of for entrepreneurial pursuit, given the complexities involved. The cloud server market has gone to a new level in the past five years. Many enterprises in the US and elsewhere have not only moved to cloud as a first choice but started using commercial data centre services, owing to the complexity involved in data management and its applications. Muppaneni saw a clear opportunity in these when he decided to return to India from the US for a new journey. The opportunity According to Gartner, the research and advisory entity in information technology, the value of the Indian data centre infrastructure and services market was $2 billion in 2016 and is the fastest growing segment. It will be anywhere between $3.5 billion and $5 billion by 2018, said Mupanneni. When he shared plans about going back to India to establish a data centre entity, four of his friends there instantly backed his decision, with funding commitment. "It was only a discussion over a cup of coffee and we closed the initial angel round with overwhelming subscription, almost triple of what I really needed," he told Business Standard. Having worked for Intel Corporation in California and Arizona on design architecture, among other core tasks, Muppaneni, who has a master's degree in computing from Griffith University, Queensland, indeed comes with a large vision that makes Pi's upcoming enterprise-class data centre in Andhra Pradesh's new capital, Amaravati, look like a hurried step on a course to a big journey. Data storage is one of many applications and functions a data centre can deliver: "A data centre is like your heart pumping transactions, acting as a hub, gathering data from different locations and churning out and giving decisions to other centres instantly. So, it is very important to design a solution that is scalable, that is high performance. It cannot be slow; otherwise, it will crash," Muppaneni explains. On December 15, Pi Datacenters announced it had got a first private equity funding round of Rs 154 crore, led by Epsilon Venture Partners, barely three months ahead of the scheduled commissioning of the data centre. The facility would be a modular, 500,000 sq ft infrastructure with 5,000-rack capacity. When fully commissioned, spread across 10 acres, it will be a tier-four certified facility. The investment required is Rs 600 crore, which the promoters plan to spend in five years as they seek to scale up the infrastructure to the targeted capacity in a gradual manner, based on demand. Challenges India has been seeing a surge in data centre investments. In 2016, the who's who of the global IT world, including Microsoft and Amazon, have started investing hundreds of millions of dollars to establish these in India, to offer a variety of services in data management. A sizable data centre infrastructure was already created in the country by a number of players such as Tata Telecommunications, CntrlS, Netmagic, Tulip, Sify and GPX Global, among others, as both big and small Indian companies switch to digital data storage practices. Can this challenging, highly capital-intensive and increasingly crowded space, led by big global players, still qualify to be a start-up play? Does it have scope to bring potential 'disruptions' in the data centre architecture or in data storage and management services, so that a new entrant will enjoy a distinct advantage? Muppaneni says it has all this and more. "The fact that every data centre company is doing well in India is a big positive. As the industry itself is in a positive zone, we will obviously get our piece of pie from the market," the Pi founder says. Business model However, Pi Data seeks to build its business on a strong set of differentiators, not simply by going with the flow. It says it is taking a very different approach to the design of the product, doing it in a completely software-defined approach for the cloud. While Muppaneni bets on the potential differentiators that he believes would make Pi Data the first destination of choice for an enterprise looking to host data within India, he points to fast progress in implementation of this facility as early proof of execution capability. In the best case scenario, even for a large enterprise, it would take three or four years to implement such a project in India, according to him. "In a year and a half, we have not only visualised and conceptualised this but done almost 90 per cent of one of the largest DCs in India, while getting the initial wave of customers on board." Mahesh Vaidya, general partner and head of India at Epsilon Venture Partners, believes the team at Pi was the right mix of hard-core technologists and managers with decades of cumulative experience, drawn from companies across the world. "Kalyan and his team at Pi have attained traction in a year that would easily have taken other teams two or more years," he told Business Standard. Some of the differentiators Pi's data centre comes with own software stack to complement the services on hardware stack, use of the latest technologies in Silicon Valley, lower cost of ownership that would help in offering services at competitive rates, a quick break-even in two-three years compared to the sector average of five years and good technology partnerships. Some of the key offering would be different types of cloud services -- based on a completely software-defined cloud, co-location, hosting, disaster recovery and various other back-up services, manger services, NOC (Network Operating Centre) as a service, private cloud and public cloud. According to Muppaneni, there are customers in every segment he's serving, from day one of the data centre launch in Amaravati. After telecom companies and e-commerce smart cities, the internet of things and big data are expected to create large demand for cloud services. "Healthcare in India also has a huge untapped potential, with not even five per cent of patient records digitised," he says. Local advantage According to Mahesh Vaidya, it is advantageous for a local player with expansive physical presence and efficient teams positioned locally to address the needs of and cater to local businesses. Local players have lower overhead costs and execute data centre services with a quicker time-to-market, he says. "In the long term, there would be a need for global players to partner with local players to deliver data centre and cloud services to local customers. We would see the interest and presence of major players as a validation of the data centre opportunity in India," he told this newspaper. Epsilon expects a return that is comparable in quantum and time frames to any of the other sectors it had invested in. Just as scalability is in-built for cloud services, Pi has created a design architecture which helps in scaling up the capacity in a smooth manner. Adding more DCs is part of this strategy, beside allowing customers a back-up storage as well. Muppaneni says they will be moving to at least two other locations in the next two financial years, which means Pi Data would be building three DCs in three years. "The next time we raise (funds), that would be a very big round for this reason," he said. 'Pi services are at par with those of Amazon' Expert take by Rajarshi Bhattacharya, country head, Suse India, a pioneer in Linux and open source solutions. Pi is developing its own cloud solutions. What Pi delivers today is next-generation cloud services, powered by an absolute open-stack platform. Cloud service providers today offer much faster response time and greater flexibility to customers. In that sense, the services offered by Pi are at par as those offered by companies like Amazon. The latter, too, built its cloud services around open source technology, one reason for it being very successful in this space. Customers or enterprises in India are looking for greater services from data centre players. Initially, it was about picking rack space and then people started taking infrastructure. Now, they are taking a platform and are looking for software-as-a-service from the data centre. Pi Data has made some wise choices. They have decided to build cloud on a platform which is very open and continuously evolving. That automatically makes Pi competitive. The choice of technology is good. Pi is also moving towards software-defined cloud services, which are infinitely scalable. Through an open-stack platform, it can also seamlessly bridge the public and the private cloud.

MailOnline gives its verdict on Nintendo's latest console While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing.

However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background.

However, the company has also used the event to introduce a new interesting computing platform that looks to change how smart gadgets upgrade in the future. To further this effort, Intel has launched a credit-card sized computing platform called Compute Card. In essence, the Compute Card has all the elements that are required for a full-fledged PC. This includes a processor, memory, storage, and wireless connectivity with flexible I/O options. "Device makers simply design a standard Intel Compute Card slot into their device and then utilise the best Intel Compute Card for their performance and price needs. This reduces the time and resources needed to design and validate the compute block and helps speed up innovation to bring the power of intelligence into an ever wider range of devices," Intel explains on its blog. This compute card, because of its small size, can be used in future IoT products like interactive refrigerators, and even smart kiosks to security cameras. This compute card can easily be removed in the future, and replaced with the latest bundle when it arrives. Intel looks to make this the new norm moving forward, and for this purpose it has already started to work with tech companies and regional partners on integrating the Compute Card into their smart gadgets. Global partners include Dell, HP, Lenovo, Sharp, and regional partners include Seneca Data, InFocus, DTx, TabletKiosk, and Pasuntech. The Intel Compute Card is set to be available from mid-2017, and will come in a range of options, including the latest 7th Generation Intel Core processors.

Baig 06/01/2017 SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL Man jailed for 'horror' hammer attack on police Donald Trump claims Brexit is a 'great thing' for Britain © Associated Press Models demonstrate Project Alloy all-in-one merged reality headsets. LAS VEGAS--Intel's Project Reality virtual reality headgear aims to give users the best of both worlds:  Deeply immersive experiences without the awkward cords and pricey hardware. I got to try it out at CES and found it has potential, though in its current state as a developer prototype it still has a way to go. There’s a considerable tradeoff to experience truly rich virtual reality. The best consumer VR headsets on the market today, HTC Vive, Oculus Rift and Sony PlayStation VR, are pricey and demand a tethered connection to expensive and robust hardware--PCs in the case of Vive and Rift, a video game console with PlayStation.  Meantime, the more mobile VR solutions that eliminate the wires and instead work with smartphones—I’m talking Samsung Gear VR and Google Daydream--don’t offer near the same compelling virtual immersion.  Intel’s “merged reality” Project Alloy headgear attempts to bridge the gap by   placing all the PC-class processing and graphics capabilities inside the headset itself; no need to connect Alloy to a separate desktop computer or laptop. The self-contained computing engines and sensors for tracking your movement—Alloy doesn’t demand external lasers and tracking systems such as those used by a Rift or Vive--promises a no-brainer set-up too, potentially a big advantage over those other systems.  How it works. Alloy can track six degrees of mobility, double the three degrees of Google Cardboard or GearVR, says Intel Vice President and General Manager, Perpetual Computing Group, Achin Bhowmik, who hosted my demo. That means you can get close to and walk around the objects in the virtual space. What’s more, Alloy employs Intel RealSense 3D cameras to bring the “real world” into your experience—which might help you from bumping into a wall, coffee table or another human being. Indeed, when you come to a new environment, the smarts inside the system cameras will try to “map” and understand the surroundings to keep you safe.  Intel is also relying on computer vision technology from Movidius, a company it recently acquired, which helps with hand and gesture recognition, and this “inside-out tracking.”  What it's like:  Alloy is kind of a cross between a fully immersive VR experience in which the entire outside world is blocked out and an augmented reality scheme in which virtual objects appear layered on top of the real world, something like what Microsoft has shown off with HoloLens. Thus the "merged reality" descriptor. But Alloy, at least for now, doesn’t seem quite as exciting.  To be fair, though, this is still an unfinished product , and even now you get a sense that Intel is really onto something.  The headset is bulky and on the heavier side. Bhowmik says it will get lighter. And the tracking or something else was off when I first put on a headset; a second try with another unit worked out better. The graphics were ok but far from mind-numbing, though I did like that you could make out physical objects and people. In one demo, I spent a few minutes playing a game in which I had to shoot flying drones before they shot me, using a controller that once inside the Alloy environment turned into a menacing enough weapon.  I periodically had to “reload” my gun by virtually walking into a box with the ammunition. But one time the box was too close to a real physical wall and I was not able reload the gun. That said, I had no trouble fulfilling my knock-out-the-drones mission. The most interesting part of the demo for me was how the physical objects in the room became part of the game—the table in the middle of the room for example became some sort of generator. In a second demo that I got to experience—here a pyramid rose up from the ground after I pressed a virtual green button--I could actually see the Intel employee who was in the room with me, as well as see the ring on my finger, and the shirt and jacket I was wearing. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich announced at CES that a commercial version of Alloy will come out later this year from yet-to-be-disclosed hardware partners--Intel is working with all the usual virtual reality suspects. Bhowmik doesn’t expect battery life on a final Alloy product to be much of a problem. He intimidated you'll get something along the lines of what you get with a laptop. I can’t say I was blown away by what I saw. But I’m all in on the wire-free vision that Alloy promises to deliver and eager to give it another shot.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware ASRock Z270 Extreme 4 LGA 1151 Motherboard Review By Hassan Mujtaba Posted Jan 3, 2017 120Shares Share Tweet Submit Advertisement PRODUCT INFO ASRock Z270 Extreme 4 3rd January 2017 Type Motherboard Price $149.99 US Introduction It has been a year since Intel released their latest and greatest platform for mainstream desktop PCs. The 100-series platform was part of the 6th generation processor launch. Skylake brought with it a range of new feature support and performance updates. The 100-series products were the first to utilize features such as DDR4, M.2, PCI-e 3.0 SSDs and more. Today, Intel officially launches the 200-series platform. Designed to support 7th generation processors that are codenamed Kaby Lake, 200-series offers new features and updates in the form of Intel Optane support. I think the most important thing is that the boards themselves would be far more attractive than the processor series as they are more feature-heavy and offer plenty of reasons for consumers to upgrade. For this review, ASRock sent us their new Z270 Extreme 4 motherboard. The Z270 Extreme 4 features a brand new design scheme and support for the latest features such as M.2, NVMe and 7th generation Intel Core CPUs. ASRock Z270 Extreme 4 aims the mainstream market with an attractive price of 149.99 US so let’s find out how the board holds up in our testing. Intel Z270 Express Chipset – The Top 200-Series PCH The two chipsets that will be offered with the new Kaby Lake processors are Z270 and H270. Intel will be offering support for the Kaby Lake and Skylake processors on both 100-series and 200-series motherboards. This means that consumers can use their Skylake chips on a 200-series board or a Kaby Lake chip on a 100-series board. The two new chips are marketed towards specific markets. The Z270 series is aimed at the consumer market while the H270 series is aimed at the consumer and corporate market. We will get on to the features of these chipset which is an update from the previous 100-series generation of products. Intel Z270 and H270 PCH Features Intel Z270 and Z170 offer the same CPU PCIe configuration support. They allow for 1 x 16, 2 x 8 or 1 x 8 + 2 x 4 config whereas the H270 and H170 chipset offers just 1 x 16 config. The total number of independent Display Port offered by the PCH are 3 and power up to four memory DIMMs in Dual Channel mode. The Z Series offers overclocking support while the H Series is restricted from such support. All chipsets offer Intel SmartSound tech but Intel AIB partners will be offering their own custom Audio codecs to power audio. Moving on, the new 200-series has official support for Optane technology which is not available on 100-series products. Intel Rapid Storage technology is also pushed to 15 (was 14 on 100-series). Some other features in the new chipsets include Raid 0, 1, 5, 10 support, PCIe Storage Drive support, Smart Response Technology and I/O Port flexibility. Intel has increased the number of high-speed I/O lanes to 30 on both 200-series chipsets. The Z170 had 26 while the H170 had 22 lanes. Total USB ports have remain the same at 14 (10 USB 3.0) for Z Series and 14 (8 USB 3.0) for H Series. All boards would have 6 SATA III 6 GB/s ports. Expansion slots would be powered by 24 PCI-e lanes on Z270 and 20 PCI-e lanes on H270. This is a slight increase over 20 PCI-e lanes on Z170 and 16 on H170.

The socket is built to support both 6th gen and 7th gen processors. This allows 200-series boards to support both Skylake and Kaby Lake processors, making it easier for previous gen owners to upgrade. The LGA 1151 socket is also featured on the 100-Series chipset motherboards and will extend support to the new Kaby Lake processors. Motherboard vendors like Gigabyte have released latest firmware for 100 series motherboards to support Kaby Lake processors. The LGA 1151 has a total of 1151 contact pins for interfacing with Skylake and Kaby Lake processors. Following are all of the Kaby Lake processors that will be available at launch for 200-series platform: Intel 7th Generation 'Kaby Lake' Desktop Lineup SKU Name Cores/Threads Core Clock Boost Clock L3 Cache TDP Socket Price Core i7-7700K 4/8 4.2 GHz 4.5 GHz 8 MB 91W LGA1151 $305 US Core i7-7700 4/8 3.6 GHz 4.2 GHz 8 MB 65W LGA1151 $272 US Core i7-7700T 4/8 2.9 GHz TBD 8 MB 35W LGA1151 $272 US Core i5-7600K 4/4 3.8 GHz 4.2 GHz 6 MB 91W LGA1151 $217 US Core i5-7600 4/4 3.5 GHz 4.1 GHz 6 MB 65W LGA1151 $199 US Core i5-7600T 4/4 2.8 GHz TBD 6 MB 35W LGA1151 $199 US Core i5-7500 4/4 3.4 GHz 3.8 GHz 6 MB 65W LGA1151 $179 US Core i5-7500T 4/4 2.7 GHz TBD 6 MB 35W LGA1151 $179 US Core i5-7400 4/4 3.0 GHz 3.5 GHz 6 MB 65W LGA1151 $170 US Core i5-7400T 4/4 2.4 GHz TBD 6 MB 35W LGA1151 $170 US Core i3-7350K 2/4 4.2 GHz N/A 4 MB 60W LGA 1151 $157 US Core i3-7320 2/4 3.9 GHz 4.1 GHz 4 MB TBD LGA 1151 $139 US Core i3-7300 2/4 4.0 GHz TBD 4 MB 51W LGA1151 $129 US Core i3-7310T 2/4 3.4 GHz TBD 3 MB TBD LGA1151 $109 US Core i3-7100 2/2 3.9 GHz TBD 3 MB 35W LGA 1151 $109 US Pentium G4620 2/4 3.7 GHz N/A 3 MB 51W LGA1151 $93 US Pentium G4600 2/4 3.6 GHz N/A 3 MB 51W LGA 1151 $82 US Pentium G4560 2/2 3.5 GHz N/A 2 MB 35W LGA 1151 $64 US Pentium G3950 2/2 3.0 GHz N/A 2 MB 35W LGA1151 $52 US Pentium G3930 2/2 2.9 GHz N/A 2 MB 35W LGA1151 $42 US GIGABYTE AORUS Z270X-Gaming 7 LGA 1151 Motherboard Review Intel did one thing right with the new socket and that’s the socket positioning which allows older coolers and mounting brackets to remain compatible with the newer socket. So if you have a old LGA 1150 socket cooler that you wish to use with the new LGA 1151 socket, It could be done so, but do note that while the socket looks the same as LGA 1150 socket, the processors are incompatible due to different pin layout so you don’t want to try putting an Haswell processor into the LGA 1151 socket otherwise it would damage the pins permanently. Cooler Compatibility With LGA 1151 Socket While Haswell processors ship with their own boxed coolers and cooler makers providing retention brackets for LGA 1150 compatibility, it should be noted that Intel has stopped offering boxed coolers since Skylake and Kaby Lake processor generation and users have to look forward to retail coolers. Intel does offer a separate boxed cooler but it will be a much better choice to get an AIB cooling solution since those offer better cooling performance. Older CPU coolers will remain compatible with the new socket and some manufacturers are provided updated retention brackets for the 1151 socket boards.

The socket is built to support both 6th gen and 7th gen processors. This allows 200-series boards to support both Skylake and Kaby Lake processors, making it easier for previous gen owners to upgrade. The LGA 1151 socket is also featured on the 100-Series chipset motherboards and will extend support to the new Kaby Lake processors. Motherboard vendors like Gigabyte have released latest firmware for 100 series motherboards to support Kaby Lake processors. The LGA 1151 has a total of 1151 contact pins for interfacing with Skylake and Kaby Lake processors. Following are all of the Kaby Lake processors that will be available at launch for 200-series platform: Intel 7th Generation 'Kaby Lake' Desktop Lineup SKU Name Cores/Threads Core Clock Boost Clock L3 Cache TDP Socket Price Core i7-7700K 4/8 4.2 GHz 4.5 GHz 8 MB 91W LGA1151 $305 US Core i7-7700 4/8 3.6 GHz 4.2 GHz 8 MB 65W LGA1151 $272 US Core i7-7700T 4/8 2.9 GHz TBD 8 MB 35W LGA1151 $272 US Core i5-7600K 4/4 3.8 GHz 4.2 GHz 6 MB 91W LGA1151 $217 US Core i5-7600 4/4 3.5 GHz 4.1 GHz 6 MB 65W LGA1151 $199 US Core i5-7600T 4/4 2.8 GHz TBD 6 MB 35W LGA1151 $199 US Core i5-7500 4/4 3.4 GHz 3.8 GHz 6 MB 65W LGA1151 $179 US Core i5-7500T 4/4 2.7 GHz TBD 6 MB 35W LGA1151 $179 US Core i5-7400 4/4 3.0 GHz 3.5 GHz 6 MB 65W LGA1151 $170 US Core i5-7400T 4/4 2.4 GHz TBD 6 MB 35W LGA1151 $170 US Core i3-7350K 2/4 4.2 GHz N/A 4 MB 60W LGA 1151 $157 US Core i3-7320 2/4 3.9 GHz 4.1 GHz 4 MB TBD LGA 1151 $139 US Core i3-7300 2/4 4.0 GHz TBD 4 MB 51W LGA1151 $129 US Core i3-7310T 2/4 3.4 GHz TBD 3 MB TBD LGA1151 $109 US Core i3-7100 2/2 3.9 GHz TBD 3 MB 35W LGA 1151 $109 US Pentium G4620 2/4 3.7 GHz N/A 3 MB 51W LGA1151 $93 US Pentium G4600 2/4 3.6 GHz N/A 3 MB 51W LGA 1151 $82 US Pentium G4560 2/2 3.5 GHz N/A 2 MB 35W LGA 1151 $64 US Pentium G3950 2/2 3.0 GHz N/A 2 MB 35W LGA1151 $52 US Pentium G3930 2/2 2.9 GHz N/A 2 MB 35W LGA1151 $42 US Watch_Dogs 2 Review - A Substantial Software Upgrade Intel did one thing right with the new socket and that’s the socket positioning which allows older coolers and mounting brackets to remain compatible with the newer socket. So if you have a old LGA 1150 socket cooler that you wish to use with the new LGA 1151 socket, It could be done so, but do note that while the socket looks the same as LGA 1150 socket, the processors are incompatible due to different pin layout so you don’t want to try putting an Haswell processor into the LGA 1151 socket otherwise it would damage the pins permanently. Cooler Compatibility With LGA 1151 Socket While Haswell processors ship with their own boxed coolers and cooler makers providing retention brackets for LGA 1150 compatibility, it should be noted that Intel has stopped offering boxed coolers since Skylake and Kaby Lake processor generation and users have to look forward to retail coolers. Intel does offer a separate boxed cooler but it will be a much better choice to get an AIB cooling solution since those offer better cooling performance. Older CPU coolers will remain compatible with the new socket and some manufacturers are provided updated retention brackets for the 1151 socket boards.

It’s hard to imagine any other chip company CEO who would have met with this much enthusiasm from attendees at one of the world’s biggest trade shows. As Huang talked about revolutionizing gaming, entertainment and the transportation of tomorrow with the power of the company’s GPU and AI technologies, the audience was ready and eager to believe his every word. Huang’s star power aside, Nvidia came to CES to demonstrate how far the graphics chip company has come in advancing the development of AI-enabled autonomous cars. Intel Corp. is trying to catch up by rolling out its own development platforms and the alliance with Mobileye and BMW. But the processor giant’s automotive future is still dependent on the execution and integration of the many automotive technologies Intel has amassed over the last 12 months. During Huang's keynote, Nvidia showed a glimpse of Xavier (originally unveiled last fall), described by the company as an “AI car supercomputer.” Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang during his CES keynote speech While showing off a small board a little larger than the palm of his hand, Huang said that Xavier can process 30 trillion operations a second at 30 watts. It’s integrated with an 8-core custom ARM64 CPU and 512 core Volta GPU. The Nvidia CEO also noted during his speech that Xavier chip itself is ASIL C but its module will be designed for ASIL D safety functionality. Built on top of the hardware is a new OS called DriveWork, explained Huang. The OS helps fuse data coming from different sensors and location information from HD mapping. Nvidia showed a video clip of Nvidia’s BB8 autonomous vehicle zipping around streets in California.   Auto-Pilot and Co-Pilot The car, Nvidia explained, understands and interacts with the driver in natural spoken language. It negotiates stop lights, stop signs and intersections, while making its way to the freeway before passing control back to the driver when requested. Layers on top of the DriveWorks OS include Auto-Pilot DNN and Co-Pilot DNN. While discussing the BB8 autonomous car’s perception capability, Huang said, “We are using two types of AI. One is AI driving you as auto-pilot, and another is AI looking out for you as a co-pilot.” In addition to Xavier, Nvidia announced a number of newly formed partnerships. They include deals with Audi, Bosch and ZF. Huang also laid out the company’s HD mapping strategy involving China’s Baidu, Tom Tom, Japan’s ZeNRIN and HERE. Nvidia and Audi have been working together for a decade. Huang reminded the audience that Audi was the first car company to come to CES seven years ago, when it announced that it was using Nvidia technology. To celebrate their log-standing partnerships, Huang brought Audi of America Head Scott Keough to the stage. Head of Audi America, Scott Keough (left) and Nvidia's CEO Huang Under the new partnership, the two companies’ focus will be on putting “advanced AI cars on the road starting in 2020,” said Huang. The first phase of the collaboration will focus on Nvidia’s Drive PX AI platform for self-driving cars. Future Audi car models will use deep learning to tackle the complexities of driving. Audi’s Keough, on stage, talked up the autonomous car the company has brought to Las Vegas. “When you test drive our Q7 in the Gold Lot, it’s driving by itself," he said. Q7 learned how to drive in just three days through AI, he added. Audi believes that this will be Level 4 automation in just three years. — Junko Yoshida, Chief International Correspondent, EE Times Email This Print Comment More Related Links Biggest Robo-Car Roadblock Is Human Infineon: What Makes Robo-Cars Zero Defect?

Also the backup camera is on "instantly" whereas in the older car it usually came up just as I finished backing up.  The auto companies have upgraded to be able to sell us cars that will easily last 200K miles with excellent mileage.  It would be nice to be able to upgrade our cars with new electronics (e.g., a new GPU card and software) and to have those upgrades integrated, verified and supported by the OEM versus the current third party upgrades we can buy now.  Upgrades could be at good margin and be tied to other services.  This could help get the installed base of vehicles to higher levels of safe driving support much sooner than we can expect with the current situation where new electronics only come with a new car.

OK, so maybe it has also thrown in the towel as far as wearables are concerned, so it’s aiming for the next big trend in consumer electronics: the Internet of Things. To help device and appliance manufacturers kickstart their IoT production process with Intel at the core, the chip maker will be making available a Compute Card they can just slot into their product to make them smarter and connect to the World Wide Web. It’s not hard to think of Compute Card as Intel’s x86 answer to the ARM-based Raspberry Pi. Both, after all, are complete compute platforms, with processor, memory, and input/output hooks, that are just slightly bigger than credit cards. The Intel Compute Card itself measures 94.5 mm x 55 mm x 5 mm only. Of course, there are differences beyond just x86 versus ARM. The Raspberry Pi is a hobbyist, DIY board for everyone and you build contraptions around it. The Intel Compute Card, on the other hand, is more like a ready-made and ready to use component that you slot into devices, calling to mind the PCMCIA cards of old. The idea is that manufacturing partners make products, like, a smart fridge or a security camera system, with the Compute Card in mind. But instead of building it right into the device, they just provide a slot they can insert the card into after the fact. This can be done either by the OEM itself or by consumers, making the additional intelligence only optional and potentially keeping costs down. Intel is still being coy about the exact specs of the Compute Card, other than it has a 7th gen “Kaby Lake” Core processor and built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. It is also unknown if it will be made available to the general public when it fully launches in mid-2017, but, from the looks of it, it will primarily be available to manufacturing partners. Intel says that Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Sharp have already signed up to be one of the first to experience Intel’s vision of the Internet of Things.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Intel-engineered New Balance RunIQ revealed at CES 2017 By Rei Padla - January 5, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter This is the first time we’re featuring something related to sneaker brand New Balance. No, there’s no hi-tech sneakers designed by the company but it recently teamed up with Intel to come up with a smartwatch. Okay, this sounds interesting because back in November, we were told that Intel was possibly moving away from wearables. This was after backing out of the tablet and smartphone market and canceling SoFIA and Broxton chips. Now we’ve got news that it has worked again with another company to release the New Balance RunIQ, a new Android Wear-powered smartwatch that is aimed for the runners. The New Balance RunIQ comes equipped with a 1.39-inch AMOLED screen, 512MB RAM, 4GB onboard storage, GPS, optical heart-rate monitor, Intel Z34XX processor, an a 24-hour battery. If you are using GPS and the heart rate monitor, it can only last a maximum of five hours. Just like any other smartwatch, it receives alerts and notifications via WiFi or Bluetooth connectivity. Pair it with your Android phone and receive mails, messages, and stream from Google Play Music. For New Balance RunIQ users, there’s the New Balance Global Run Club platform you can use to share your routes and accomplishments with other runners. This isn’t the first time Intel partnered with other brands to produce a wearable product. There’s the Intel Curie-powered Fossil smartwatch, as well as, the TAG Heuer Connected Android Wear smartwatch. The New Balance RunIQ is now listed for pre-order at NewBalance.com. It will cost you $299.99 and will be available beginning February 1 on New Balance Stores and other retailers. New Balance Run IQ with Intel Inside® enables runners to track their distance, time, pace, heartrate, and cadence during a workout, as well as listen to music and connect with the STRAVA global running community, all without a smartphone as long as you’re connected to Wi-Fi.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Four cores and many years ago... Home Hardware Intel Hands-On With Intel’s New Kaby Lake CPU By Jeremy Laird on January 5th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Behold. Intel has a new PC processor. Does it game, will it blend, is it AMD’s Ryzen CPU you really want and what the hell happened to ‘Tick Tock’? For answers to at least some of these questions, including the shattering news that the arrival of Kaby Lake means the era of ‘Tick Tock’ is over, summarily usurped by ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation’ (or if leaked roadmaps are anything to go by, make that ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation and One More for the Road’), join me on the other side. I’ll save some of you a lot of trouble right from the get go and point out that Kaby Lake is fundamentally non-exciting, albeit for somewhat interesting reasons. It’s another mainstream CPU family from Intel that tops out at four cores and only ups the performance ante by a small increment. Broadly speaking, we’re talking less that 10 per cent performance improvement over existing Skylake CPUs from Intel. Kaby Lake is, in short, probably the last boring mainstream chip from Intel before various factors align and force Intel out of its slumber and into something resembling action. More on that in a moment. I’ve been hands-on with the two headline grabbing CPUs of the Kaby Lake range courtesy of MSI’s Z270 Gaming M5 motherboard, which showcases the new 200 Series chipsets that accompany Kaby. The processors in question are the 4.2GHz/4.5GHz Core i7-7700K and the 3.8GHz/4.2GHz Core i5-7600K. Thus by their ‘7xxx’ suffixes shall ye know Kaby Lake chips. First, let’s talk about what’s new in Kaby Lake the CPU, which isn’t much. The CPU cores are largely if not entirely identical to Skylake. The integrated graphics isn’t new either, not in terms of 3D rendering at least. It’s basically the same ‘Gen9’ integrated gunk as seen and not terribly enjoyed by gamers in Skylake chips. So we’re left with two really significant updates. The first involves manufacturing. Actually, Kaby Lake is a 14nm chip, which makes it the third such family from Intel. Hence the shift from the old so-called ‘Tick Tock’ paradigm which saw Intel crank out a new chip and a new production process in alternate years. The significance here is that Intel has officially given up trying to shrink its CPU transistors every other year. That reflects a general industry-wide slow down in chip development as the world’s silicon engineers increasingly bump up against the laws of physics. Anyway, ‘Tock tick’ is toast and now we have aforementioned ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation’, which buys Intel an extra year to get those tricky die shrinks out the door. Despite all that, Intel has refined the existing 14nm tech enough to bump Kaby Lake’s clockspeeds by around 200MHz to 300MHz higher than previous chips depending on the model in question. That’s where the less-than-10-per-cent performance uptick figure comes from given that the CPU cores aren’t any fancier. They just run a little quicker. That said, prior to launch the scuttlebutt implied that Kaby Lake might be quite the overclocker. Hold that thought. The other potentially significant novelty involves 2D video. Yeah, not exactly gaming relevant. But for the record, Kaby Lake is potentially really snazzy in this department. Firstly, it has some major decode and encode chops. Thanks to some new 2D hardware, it can decode up to eight standard 4K HEVC streams simultaneously, which is kind of crazy, and can also support ultra-high bitrate streams, too, up to 4K at 60 frames per second and 120Mbps. It has some new encode capabilities, too. Arguably even more newsworthy is some new DRM gubbins that will allow Kaby Lake PCs to be the first that are allowed to stream 4K Netflix content. Until now, that’s been restricted to HDTV apps and set top boxes. However, what’s not clear is whether that will only be possible when using the integrated graphics. Personally, I don’t see how it makes sense unless it’s tied to the integrated graphics, but we’ll see. But the point is that if you’re looking for an all-round computing solution, Kaby Lake does have a few tricks up its sleeve. It won’t make games run much faster. But if you’re due an upgrade the 4K Netflix shizzle could be appealing and the hardware decode could also be interesting for laptops. As for what the Core i7-7700K and the Core i5-7600K are like in the real world, I haven’t much to say. To be frank, they feel no different to similar quad-core chips since, arguably, 2011 when Sandy Bridge arrived and shook things up. If you want benchmarks, try these. It’s actually the platform and stuff like USB Type-C… As you can see, it’s a total wash versus any vaguely recent Intel CPU family in almost any game. The overclocking picture, however, is at least a little more interesting. I managed 5.2GHz from the Core i5-7600K and 5GHz from the Core i7-7700K. That’s a few hundred MHz more than you might expect from a Skylake chip. Welcome, but to be brutally honest, again you just ain’t gonna feel that kind of difference. Arguably of more tangible import are the motherboards and chipsets. Kaby Lake sticks with the LGA1151 socket, so it slots into existing Intel 100 series motherboards. Praise the Lord for such small mercies. That said, the new 200 Series chipsets do bring a few frills. Our muse for this purpose is MSI’s new Z270 Gaming G5, which uses the top-end Z270 chipswet (obviously) in a sort of middling format in terms of pricing, which should weighing in at around £165 if the existing Z170 Gaming M5 is anything to go by. There’s support for DDR4-2400 RAM, for instance, and another four PCI Express 3.0 lanes on the chipset for peripherals, making for 24 in total. That said, the connection between the chipset and the CPU is the same DMI 3.0 thingamy, so the max bandwidth hasn’t changed, which is about 4GB/s and thus a tiny fraction of the theoretical maximum of those 24 PCIE 3.0 lanes. …Optane memory support… Additional intrigue comes in the form of an otherwise unassuming logo atop the Gaming G5’s box. “Intel Optane Memory Ready”, it reads. But what does it mean? That’s a story in itself (which I’ve touched on briefly, earlier), but the short version is that Intel has cooked up a new non-volatile memory tech. Like flash memory, it doesn’t need power to maintain data storage. But it’s far faster than flash memory. Think of it as being a cross between flash and RAM and you’ll have the right rough idea. How it will all work is a little unclear at this stage. It seems Optane will initially come in smallish drives of 16GB and 32GB and act as a sort of cache drive rather than as a conventional mass-storage hard drive. Eventually as the price comes down, I think we’ll see straight-up Optane SSDs for mass storage. Anyway, if you like the sound of Optane, support begins with the new 200 Series chipsets. Elsewhere, the MSI Gaming M5 serves ups various modern features, including a pair of M.2 slots and a USB Type-C port. So as has often been the case of late, it’s actually the platform that looks more compelling as an upgrade option for a few-years-old PC, rather than the CPU. The context to all this, of course, and the ‘factor’ I alluded to earlier is the imminent launch of AMD new’s Ryzen CPU. Again, I’ll cover the full story in another post, but Ryzen looks awfully promising and it’s likely that Intel will be forced to respond with a major upgrade to its mainstream CPUs within the next year, including its first six-core mainstream chip. …and generally bags of bandwidth with 200 Series motherboards like the MSI Z270 Gaming M5 that’s arguably a bit interesting, not the Kaby lake chip itself… All of which makes it pretty hard to get excited about Kaby Lake. In truth, you have to go back to Sandy Bridge in 2011 to find a mainstream Intel CPU that really moved the game forward. Kaby Lake doesn’t change that. But hopefully it will be the last of its type, the last sand-bagging Intel chip, if you like. About bloody time it will be, too. TL;DR – By their 7xxx suffixes shall ye know Kaby Lake – They change very little in terms of gaming performance – They overclock pretty well – It says something that 4K Netflix support is perhaps the main selling point – The new 200 Series platform is probably more interesting than the CPU itself thanks to Optane memory support.

They have several chip samples on hand, and power consumption is all over the map, even running the same processor models at the same clock speed and voltage. Two chips run hotter than the equivalent Skylake model; the third runs cooler, with something like 20% lower current usage.

You still want to focus on the fundamentals – size, panel type, resolution and refresh rate. OLED will be the big game changer, not HDR applied to conventional LCD technology, in my view.

Log in to Reply 06/01/2017 at 12:48 LewdPenguin says: If my motherboard hadn’t combusted I expect I’d be in a similar position still running a 7-8 year old CPU, having only upgraded the graphics card probably twice by now. Buying into every new hardware release seems entirely pointless to me, the occasions I would actually max out my old CPU were few enough to have made any upgrade pretty much unnoticeable 99% of the time. Then again the article seems pretty clear in its opinion that unless like me you’re currently looking at potentially (re)building a system pretty much from scratch then there’s little reason to upgrade right now from a performance perspective. In fact if the next new generation of chips is truly going to be the next notable step-change in performance rather than just further incremental optimisation then its all the more reason for potential optional upgraders to hold off.

And that’s a £250 CPU, plus with the cost of new mobo and ram I decided it 100% wasn’t worth it. I also looked up some gaming benchmarks for DDR4 and was seeing less than 1% gains. The only real downside to the tech gen I’m using is only 2x 6GB/S SATA3 ports which means some of my SSDs aren’t running full speed.

Granted, it’s sharing a case with a GTX1080, 16gb ram and nosebleed fast internet but as far as the cpu goes there’s absolutely no reason to fork out yet. Give me a decent 40-50% increase in performance over my old timer and my money’s yours Intel.

That all changed this week at CES, where Intel showed off a developer kit to select media. Gizmodo was lucky enough to be invited into the private demonstration — and we're happy to report that it was well worth the wait. Before we dive into the experience, it's important to make a few caveats: First of all, this is not a finished product. The images you're looking at are just a reference design. Intel plans to work with hardware manufacturers to build different versions of the headset. What enables Project Alloy is Intel RealSense, a tiny camera array that debuted at CES 2014. The camera set is able make a 3D map of any room and the objects in it. Developers can then use the 3D computer model created by the cameras to layer graphics on top of it, which becomes especially handy for creating immersive VR experiences inside of a room. The developer kit is actually a ridiculously good-looking headset considering it's only a reference design. It's completely black and has unnoticeable RealSense camera arrays in the front of the goggles. At the back of the headset is the big battery that enables the headset to be completely untethered. Eliminating the wire from the back of a VR headset is a huge deal. Anyone that's ever played around with the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive will tell you one of the major pain points about those headsets is that you're always tripping over the wire that connects it to power and a nearby computer — especially if you have room tracking enabled. The Project Alloy headset I played around with let me walk around a room filled with book shelves, a coffee table and other objects in it. The demo room was basically made to look like a small apartment. The RealSense cameras took about a minute to scan the room, then another minute to turn the objects inside of the real room into elements in the game. The coffee table was turned into a big generator and the book shelves turned into rusty pipes and other weird objects straight out of a sci-fi film. The game demonstrated doesn't have a name and will never be available for public release. It was made to show off the room mapping and 3D tracking as you walk around the room shooting bad guys. The gameplay was similar to SuperHot VR, but I was shooting drones rather than humans. The graphics were also solid and easily comparable to anything I've played on the Oculus or Vive. My only major complaint about Project Alloy was the controller. It felt a little too flimsy and is most comparable to the controller that comes with the Google Daydream headset. It has a trackpad right where your thumb goes and a trigger on the back. They're basically standard VR controller elements at this point, but the quality just wasn't as good as the higher-end headsets. Still, the whole experience was awesome, especially compared to the other high-end virtual reality headsets out there. I was a little sceptical about how important the cable-free headset would be — but it makes tremendous difference when you're walking around the room, ducking behind objects to dodge bullets, swinging your head in every direction to fire at bad guys. This is one of the few truly innovative products at CES and one I'm extremely glad I had a chance to play around with. The Project Alloy developer kit will be made available to in the second quarter of this year, and there's still no price tag on it yet. The public probably won't see this thing for sale for a long time, but let me be the first to say it will be well worth the wait once an untethered VR headset finally makes its way into your home.

For about five minutes, I tried shooting some digital flying robots from the comfort of a replica living room inside the Las Vegas Convention Center. Project Alloy, which was first announced at Intel’s developer conference last year, is an untethered headset that blends virtual-reality content with information about the physical world around its wearer. It’s designed to give people more freedom of movement when playing games, and also save people from having to buy an expensive gaming rig to play VR games. Based on my brief experience playing the same game that Intel showed on stage Wednesday, the prototype shows a lot of potential. However, it’s hard to know exactly how that will translate into what consumers will get later this year. Intel revealed Wednesday that it’s working with selected manufacturing partners to make Project Alloy devices available in the fourth quarter of 2017. In the meantime, all we have is the Intel-made prototype. It packs in a pair of RealSense depth cameras positioned basically on either side of the user’s nose, along with two RGB cameras at roughly the user’s eye line, and a pair of fisheye cameras at the edge of the visor. Those sensors can be used to render the wearer's surroundings in virtual reality. Its band design is fairly reminiscent of the PlayStation VR headset, with a curved forehead plate attached to an adjustable headband. There’s a large plastic pack on the back of the headband as well. The shooter game that I played lasted only a few minutes, and the headset seemed comfortable enough at the time. It’s hard to know how comfortable the device would be for longer sessions. And again, because this is just a prototype, it’s possible that the commercial versions will feel completely different. In order to get the game up and running quickly, Intel preloaded all the objects in the room onto the Alloy headset. Unfortunately, my headset’s model of the room I was in had drifted slightly relative to the actual objects in the room. That led to me slamming my shin into a coffee table in the center of the room that was supposed to be several inches away. This problem is supposed to be fixed by using the RealSense cameras to detect the positions of objects in real time. In this case, the headset wasn’t set up to do that. There’s still a lot we don’t know about the final hardware, like exactly when it will be available, how much it will cost, and more. Eli Elhadad, the Intel RealSense studio manager, said during my demo that the shipping version of Alloy will have more powerful hardware than the prototype. It will feature a Kaby Lake-based processor, a 400-series RealSense camera and a graphics processing chip from Movidius, which Intel acquired last year. In each case, those upgrades are supposed to provide better performance. It will also be interesting to see if Intel ends up working with Microsoft. The prototype offers untethered mixed-reality experiences, which would fit nicely with Microsoft’s vision for its Windows Holographic platform. The two companies previously announced that they were working together on Alloy, so it seems likely more will come of that.

By Scott Maben scottm@spokesman.com(509) 459-5528 Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS The immersive, live-streaming sports and music experience of a virtual reality technology born on the Palouse is going big time under its new owner, Intel. VOKE, an interactive, 3-D technology giving consumers more control of what they’re watching, was developed by Jay and Uma Jayaram as professors at Washington State University, where they established a virtual reality lab in 1993. The husband-and-wife team founded VOKE in 2004 and have relocated to Silicon Valley as the technology is rolled out for NFL games, the “Project Runway” finale, the Critics’ Choice Awards show and other live events. At a press conference Wednesday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, attendees were treated to a demonstration of VOKE VR by Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. They donned Oculus Rift headsets to watch the Butler-Villanova men’s basketball game, with 180-degree courtside views. Viewers will be able to select their point of view for live games, music concerts and other events, Krzanich said. “Viewers will get to decide what seat they have. That’s the future of what we believe of sports viewing,” he said. “So you’re going to decide, do you want to be on the 50-yard line? Do you want to be courtside at a basketball game? Do you want to be behind the basket to watch the next slam dunk? Do you want to be in the goalie’s position? All of that is possible.” Intel, which in November announced its purchase of VOKE, said content on Oculus Rift will be widely available later this year. The technology last year was used to present the NCAA men’s Final Four and Villanova’s championship. And just a few years ago, the Jayarams gave WSU Cougars fans a chance to test it on home games at Martin Stadium. Jay Jayaram, VOKE’S CEO, has said the company plans to completely change the way fans engage with and experience live events. But he also insists that virtual reality will make people more engaged with the real world as an extension of life, not a replacement of it. “Should we roll back to a reality where there would be no technology-assisted blurring of reality?” Jayaram told GeekWire. “These technologies expand our reality and make it that much richer for all.” Published: Jan. 5, 2017, 5:18 p.m.  Tags: CES, Intel, Jay Jayaram, Technology, virtual reality, VOKE, Washington State University Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Print edition home delivery Newspaper Routes Available Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Four cores and many years ago... Home Hardware Intel Hands-On With Intel’s New Kaby Lake CPU By Jeremy Laird on January 5th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Behold. Intel has a new PC processor. Does it game, will it blend, is it AMD’s Ryzen CPU you really want and what the hell happened to ‘Tick Tock’? For answers to at least some of these questions, including the shattering news that the arrival of Kaby Lake means the era of ‘Tick Tock’ is over, summarily usurped by ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation’ (or if leaked roadmaps are anything to go by, make that ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation and One More for the Road’), join me on the other side. I’ll save some of you a lot of trouble right from the get go and point out that Kaby Lake is fundamentally non-exciting, albeit for somewhat interesting reasons. It’s another mainstream CPU family from Intel that tops out at four cores and only ups the performance ante by a small increment. Broadly speaking, we’re talking less that 10 per cent performance improvement over existing Skylake CPUs from Intel. Kaby Lake is, in short, probably the last boring mainstream chip from Intel before various factors align and force Intel out of its slumber and into something resembling action. More on that in a moment. I’ve been hands-on with the two headline grabbing CPUs of the Kaby Lake range courtesy of MSI’s Z270 Gaming M5 motherboard, which showcases the new 200 Series chipsets that accompany Kaby. The processors in question are the 4.2GHz/4.5GHz Core i7-7700K and the 3.8GHz/4.2GHz Core i5-7600K. Thus by their ‘7xxx’ suffixes shall ye know Kaby Lake chips. First, let’s talk about what’s new in Kaby Lake the CPU, which isn’t much. The CPU cores are largely if not entirely identical to Skylake. The integrated graphics isn’t new either, not in terms of 3D rendering at least. It’s basically the same ‘Gen9’ integrated gunk as seen and not terribly enjoyed by gamers in Skylake chips. So we’re left with two really significant updates. The first involves manufacturing. Actually, Kaby Lake is a 14nm chip, which makes it the third such family from Intel. Hence the shift from the old so-called ‘Tick Tock’ paradigm which saw Intel crank out a new chip and a new production process in alternate years. The significance here is that Intel has officially given up trying to shrink its CPU transistors every other year. That reflects a general industry-wide slow down in chip development as the world’s silicon engineers increasingly bump up against the laws of physics. Anyway, ‘Tock tick’ is toast and now we have aforementioned ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation’, which buys Intel an extra year to get those tricky die shrinks out the door. Despite all that, Intel has refined the existing 14nm tech enough to bump Kaby Lake’s clockspeeds by around 200MHz to 300MHz higher than previous chips depending on the model in question. That’s where the less-than-10-per-cent performance uptick figure comes from given that the CPU cores aren’t any fancier. They just run a little quicker. That said, prior to launch the scuttlebutt implied that Kaby Lake might be quite the overclocker. Hold that thought. The other potentially significant novelty involves 2D video. Yeah, not exactly gaming relevant. But for the record, Kaby Lake is potentially really snazzy in this department. Firstly, it has some major decode and encode chops. Thanks to some new 2D hardware, it can decode up to eight standard 4K HEVC streams simultaneously, which is kind of crazy, and can also support ultra-high bitrate streams, too, up to 4K at 60 frames per second and 120Mbps. It has some new encode capabilities, too. Arguably even more newsworthy is some new DRM gubbins that will allow Kaby Lake PCs to be the first that are allowed to stream 4K Netflix content. Until now, that’s been restricted to HDTV apps and set top boxes. However, what’s not clear is whether that will only be possible when using the integrated graphics. Personally, I don’t see how it makes sense unless it’s tied to the integrated graphics, but we’ll see. But the point is that if you’re looking for an all-round computing solution, Kaby Lake does have a few tricks up its sleeve. It won’t make games run much faster. But if you’re due an upgrade the 4K Netflix shizzle could be appealing and the hardware decode could also be interesting for laptops. As for what the Core i7-7700K and the Core i5-7600K are like in the real world, I haven’t much to say. To be frank, they feel no different to similar quad-core chips since, arguably, 2011 when Sandy Bridge arrived and shook things up. If you want benchmarks, try these. It’s actually the platform and stuff like USB Type-C… As you can see, it’s a total wash versus any vaguely recent Intel CPU family in almost any game. The overclocking picture, however, is at least a little more interesting. I managed 5.2GHz from the Core i5-7600K and 5GHz from the Core i7-7700K. That’s a few hundred MHz more than you might expect from a Skylake chip. Welcome, but to be brutally honest, again you just ain’t gonna feel that kind of difference. Arguably of more tangible import are the motherboards and chipsets. Kaby Lake sticks with the LGA1151 socket, so it slots into existing Intel 100 series motherboards. Praise the Lord for such small mercies. That said, the new 200 Series chipsets do bring a few frills. Our muse for this purpose is MSI’s new Z270 Gaming G5, which uses the top-end Z270 chipswet (obviously) in a sort of middling format in terms of pricing, which should weighing in at around £165 if the existing Z170 Gaming M5 is anything to go by. There’s support for DDR4-2400 RAM, for instance, and another four PCI Express 3.0 lanes on the chipset for peripherals, making for 24 in total. That said, the connection between the chipset and the CPU is the same DMI 3.0 thingamy, so the max bandwidth hasn’t changed, which is about 4GB/s and thus a tiny fraction of the theoretical maximum of those 24 PCIE 3.0 lanes. …Optane memory support… Additional intrigue comes in the form of an otherwise unassuming logo atop the Gaming G5’s box. “Intel Optane Memory Ready”, it reads. But what does it mean? That’s a story in itself (which I’ve touched on briefly, earlier), but the short version is that Intel has cooked up a new non-volatile memory tech. Like flash memory, it doesn’t need power to maintain data storage. But it’s far faster than flash memory. Think of it as being a cross between flash and RAM and you’ll have the right rough idea. How it will all work is a little unclear at this stage. It seems Optane will initially come in smallish drives of 16GB and 32GB and act as a sort of cache drive rather than as a conventional mass-storage hard drive. Eventually as the price comes down, I think we’ll see straight-up Optane SSDs for mass storage. Anyway, if you like the sound of Optane, support begins with the new 200 Series chipsets. Elsewhere, the MSI Gaming M5 serves ups various modern features, including a pair of M.2 slots and a USB Type-C port. So as has often been the case of late, it’s actually the platform that looks more compelling as an upgrade option for a few-years-old PC, rather than the CPU. The context to all this, of course, and the ‘factor’ I alluded to earlier is the imminent launch of AMD new’s Ryzen CPU. Again, I’ll cover the full story in another post, but Ryzen looks awfully promising and it’s likely that Intel will be forced to respond with a major upgrade to its mainstream CPUs within the next year, including its first six-core mainstream chip. …and generally bags of bandwidth with 200 Series motherboards like the MSI Z270 Gaming M5 that’s arguably a bit interesting, not the Kaby lake chip itself… All of which makes it pretty hard to get excited about Kaby Lake. In truth, you have to go back to Sandy Bridge in 2011 to find a mainstream Intel CPU that really moved the game forward. Kaby Lake doesn’t change that. But hopefully it will be the last of its type, the last sand-bagging Intel chip, if you like. About bloody time it will be, too. TL;DR – By their 7xxx suffixes shall ye know Kaby Lake – They change very little in terms of gaming performance – They overclock pretty well – It says something that 4K Netflix support is perhaps the main selling point – The new 200 Series platform is probably more interesting than the CPU itself thanks to Optane memory support.

Two chips run hotter than the equivalent Skylake model; the third runs cooler, with something like 20% lower current usage.

Log in to Reply 05/01/2017 at 23:37 Jeremy Laird says: Bit of a minefield, HDR, especially as it pertains to monitors. I actually don’t think it changes a huge amount. You still want to focus on the fundamentals – size, panel type, resolution and refresh rate. OLED will be the big game changer, not HDR applied to conventional LCD technology, in my view.

That’s pretty much the reason why I’ve been considering an upgrade from Haswell. And while AMD’s Ryzen sounds promising, I remain skeptical about their ability to deliver on those promises – or that they will leapfrog Kaby Lake.

Log in to Reply 06/01/2017 at 12:48 LewdPenguin says: If my motherboard hadn’t combusted I expect I’d be in a similar position still running a 7-8 year old CPU, having only upgraded the graphics card probably twice by now. Buying into every new hardware release seems entirely pointless to me, the occasions I would actually max out my old CPU were few enough to have made any upgrade pretty much unnoticeable 99% of the time. Then again the article seems pretty clear in its opinion that unless like me you’re currently looking at potentially (re)building a system pretty much from scratch then there’s little reason to upgrade right now from a performance perspective. In fact if the next new generation of chips is truly going to be the next notable step-change in performance rather than just further incremental optimisation then its all the more reason for potential optional upgraders to hold off.

Log in to Reply 06/01/2017 at 15:22 fish99 says: I was considering a CPU upgrade from my 3570K recently, but after looking up some benchmarks, was surprised to see a 6600K is only 11% quicker, and that’s with it running 100 MHz quicker than my 3570K. And that’s a £250 CPU, plus with the cost of new mobo and ram I decided it 100% wasn’t worth it. I also looked up some gaming benchmarks for DDR4 and was seeing less than 1% gains. The only real downside to the tech gen I’m using is only 2x 6GB/S SATA3 ports which means some of my SSDs aren’t running full speed.

Running it at rock solid 4.6 for years and still shreds everything I throw at it e.g. Dishonored 2 at 1440p, everything at ultra never dips below 60fps (v-synced, actually goes way higher if I let it). Granted, it’s sharing a case with a GTX1080, 16gb ram and nosebleed fast internet but as far as the cpu goes there’s absolutely no reason to fork out yet. Give me a decent 40-50% increase in performance over my old timer and my money’s yours Intel.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 6 January 2017 | MYT 7:00 AM BMW well on the way to a fully-autonomous production car Moving ahead: The iNext, BMW's fully self-driving car is also on schedule for its 2021 launch. — AFP Relaxnews "Making autonomous driving a reality for our customers is the shared ambition behind our cooperation with Intel and Mobileye," stated Klaus Fröhlich, BMW's head of development at a joint press conference at CES in Las Vegas. "This partnership has all of the skills and talent necessary to overcome the enormous technological challenges ahead and commercialise self-driving vehicles." When the partnership was announced in July 2016, the companies set themselves a hugely ambitious target of having not just an autonomous car, but an autonomous car platform that could be used by other companies, ready to go by decade's end. Yet just six months in, it appears that the project is on track. "We have made very good progress in designing a state-of-the-art solution for autonomous driving on both highways and in urban areas. The solution has been defined in a scalable manner to allow affiliate automakers to meet their unique needs," said Mobileye chairman, Prof Amnon Shashua. It also means the iNext, BMW's fully self-driving car is also on schedule for its 2021 launch. "This year our fleet of vehicles will already test this joint technology globally under real traffic conditions. This is a significant step towards the introduction of the BMW iNext," said Fröhlich. According to Intel, the main obstacle that has been slowing down the development of autonomous vehicle technology is the huge initial costs involved. "From an industry perspective, we are already seeing savings and speed in development by sharing development costs and in pooling resources to develop a complete autonomous platform," said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. As well as a progress report, Intel confirmed at CES that it is taking a 15% stake in HERE. HERE offers global mapping and localisation services for vehicles and is currently owned by Audi, Daimler and BMW. With Intel on board the owners plan to develop high-definition maps that are detailed enough for autonomous driving. "A real-time, self-healing and high-definition representation of the physical world is critical for autonomous driving, and achieving this will require significantly more powerful and capable in-vehicle compute platforms," said Edzard Overbeek, HERE CEO. "As a premier silicon provider, Intel can help accelerate HERE's ambitions in this area by supporting the creation of a universal, always up-to-date digital location platform that spans the vehicle, the cloud and everything else connected."   —  AFP Relaxnews   You May Be Interested QLED vs OLED Could your gadgets send you to jail?

PSA: Nope, Intel did not acquire Bitcasa Posted Jan 5, 2017 by Ingrid Lunden (@ingridlunden) 0 SHARES Next Story A prize for “real-world cryptography” was given to programmers behind AES and the Signal app CES seems to be making some bloggers a little trigger happy with posting. Just a little while ago VentureBeat published a story claiming that Intel had acquired Bitcasa, a cloud storage company that had shut down operations last year. We’ve confirmed directly with Intel that this is not the case, however. “Intel did not acquire Bitcasa,” an Intel spokesperson tells TechCrunch. The information does raise a question though: has someone else acquired it? The farewell note on the homepage from Brian Taptich, the former CEO of the company, seems to imply that it is definitely looking for a buyer — and may have already been acquired: We have no doubt that Bitcasa has found the right home to fulfill a mission that has driven the company from its 2011 beginnings – to eliminate the storage and computing limitations of your connected devices, however small, in the most secure and efficient way possible. We remain optimistic that, before long (and though you may not realize it), Bitcasa’s technology will yet contribute significantly to fulfilling this mission. We’re asking around and will update this post as we learn more. Bitcasa was launched at Disrupt in the Battlefield in 2011, entering the market at a time when Dropbox and Box where just getting on a roll and everyone was getting excited about the potential of the cloud. That business model has proven to be challenging for more than just Bitcasa, with Dropbox seeing a drop in its own valuation and Box seeing ups and downs as a public company as it looks for profitability. Bitcasa had raised just over $20 million, with investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Horizons Ventures.

Intel's Project Alloy is a self-contained VR headset. Image: lili sams/mashable By Raymond Wong2017-01-05 21:11:51 UTC LAS VEGAS — It's no secret Intel is investing heavily in virtual reality.  Intel's CEO Brian Krzanich reiterated the company's commitment to pushing VR forward with Project Alloy, the company's self-contained VR headset reference design, during CES 2017 on Thursday.  SEE ALSO: Here's when Intel's standalone wireless VR headset will arrive I've tried every major VR headset and many of the lesser known ones, so I jumped at the chance to try out Alloy. It's important to remember that the Alloy headset I tried was a prototype reference design. Intel's not going to produce the headsets itself. Instead, its hardware partners will use the existing reference design model and design their own. The first of these headsets will arrive by Q4 of 2017, the company says. That said, the headset is a lot bulkier than it looks in Intel's official images. That's not surprising since the headset contains more computing bits than, say, a mobile VR headset like the Samsung Gear VR, which is really just a plastic shell since the entire VR experience is powered off the attached smartphone. Image: lili sams/mashable The head strap is not too different from the one on the PlayStation VR. Instead of using velcro straps like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, Project Alloy has a plastic hoop that sits on your head, almost like a crown. The design also serves a second purpose: to hold up the front-heavy portion of the headset where the Intel processor, vision processor, RealSense cameras, display and lenses are housed. Even after adjusting it, the headset kept falling down over my eyes and I had to hold it up with one hand several times during my demo. My hope is the headset gets significantly lighter by the time actual headsets based off Alloy launch. Project Alloy is pretty big and bulky Image: lili sams/mashable But I can't knock the hardware for being unfinished since it's just a prototype after all. So what's it like to try out a "merged reality" experience that makes the real world a part of the virtual world? Not too bad, actually.  The game demo I tried out was the same one that Intel showed off during its CES press conference on Wednesday: Project Alloy let's users see each other, cable-free and transforms rooms into immersive gaming arenas #CES2017 #MashCES pic.twitter.com/Bqtmxnx02H — Raymond Wong 📱💾📼 (@raywongy) January 5, 2017 Using the outward-facing RealSense 3D depth cameras, the headset was able to scan the roughly 15- x 15-foot room I was standing in and detect the furniture and objects inside as well. I was given a wand-shaped controller and told my objective was to shoot the drones out of the sky. It wasn't a technically complex demo and the drones weren't hard to take out. What makes Project Alloy unique isn't the mere fact that it's a self-contained VR headset, but that its cameras can scan the objects in your room and make them a part of the game. The headset scans the furniture and objects in the room and maps virtual textures over them make them a part of the VR world. Image: lili sams/mashable So for example, the table in the center of the demo room turned into a generator inside of the VR world and I could walk around it without bumping into it. And the sofa turned into a storage container.  It sounds like a great idea at first until you realize that there's no way to tell the difference between real objects that are now a part of the game world and completely virtual objects.  I prefer a holographic experience, like the kind with HoloLens, where virtual objects are mapped on top of real objects and you can still see them. Though I was a little underwhelmed with Project Alloy, there's no denying that the headset is a glimpse at what's in store for VR headsets. Right now, VR headsets can generate these massive immersive digital worlds, but they're pretty dumb when it comes to actually understanding your physical surroundings. Alloy will help make them smarter.

Once under way, Intel boss Brian Krzanich led the audience through a series of new experiences Intel believes will change how we all use the technology. (John Locher/AP) One of which was a live sports event streamed in virtual reality for the first time – sitting court side at an NCAA basketball game using the firm’s VOKE VR technology. It’s been used by the NBA in the past for television coverage and 360 replays, but this is a huge step forward. There was something of a landmark moment during the press conference too as the 250 people in the audience became the first to at the same time independently perform an industrial inspection of a building. (John Locher/AP) Using VR, a solar power plant in Moapa River Indian Reservation was inspected. Not satisfied with these eye-catching experiences, Intel also announced plans to work with computer firm HypeVR to create content for Intel’s one-in-all wireless VR system, Project Alloy. (John Locher/AP) So while 2016 might have been all about the big three of HTC, Oculus and PlayStation, Intel appears to have its sights firmly set on being the big name in VR in 2017.

After all no one likes spending $1,000 on a new gadget only to find out that next year’s model is many times an improvement, right? However Intel thinks that they might have a solution to that problem. Making the announcement at CES 2017, Intel has taken the wraps off a device called the Compute Card. This is a credit card-sized computer that packs the guts of a computer inside of it, or at least the main components which according to Intel, include an “Intel SoC, memory, storage and wireless connectivity with flexible I/O options”. While this won’t be used for upgrading your computer or smartphone, Intel envisions that it could be used to help upgrade devices like smart refrigerators, smart kiosks, security camera solutions, IoT gateways, and more. All users have to do is swap out their existing card for a newer model and they’ll be good to go. While you will still need to spend money, it could be cheaper than buying the entire device again. Modular computer upgrades aren’t a new concept, although for some reason they haven’t really taken off yet. Several years ago Razer tried to introduce a similar concept for desktop PCs called Project Christine, but it seems that OEMs weren’t quite as eager to get on board, but hopefully the Intel Compute Card will succeed where Razer failed.

Shares Kaby Lake. (That's 'Kaby rhymes with baby' if you're wondering, according to my press contact over at Intel, though I've heard it called 'Cabbie' Lake by more than a few folks.) Intel's 7th Generation Core processors are now available for everything from 2-in-1 devices to laptops to full blown desktops. And what do you get with the new generation of parts? My Kaby Lake overview covers that, but the main story for desktop users is that Kaby Lake increases the clock speeds and clock speed range of Skylake. This is thanks to refinements in Intel's 14nm manufacturing process, and if you're wondering how much junk is left in the trunk, that's what I'm here to explore. Intel has had unlocked 'enthusiast' processors for a while now, but users interested in a budget-friendly option have generally been left out. The Pentium G3258 Anniversary Edition is the one exception, a chip that could overclock well but which was hobbled by a pure dual-core configuration and limited L3 cache. Intel is trying something new with Kaby Lake, bringing out a Core i3 K-series part that supports overclocking. The only problem: it's priced too high to really qualify as a budget option. The Core i3-7350K costs $168 (for 1000 units, so it'll be a bit more at retail initially), compared to the i5-7600K ($242) and i7-7700K ($339). There are other potential options as well, which I'll return to in a minute. Before we get any deeper, anyone new to overclocking needs to understand a few things. First, overclocking results are never 'guaranteed,' so even if everyone and their dog is able to run at 5.0GHz, you might get a dud chip that tops out at 4.8GHz. Trust me on this: it happens, and it's not the end of the world. That goes double now that we're looking at overclocks that amount to around two percent more performance for every 100MHz. Second, if you screw up your chip via overclocking (which is pretty unlikely these days, unless you shove too much voltage down its throat), it's on you—the default warranty doesn't cover overclocking (though you can purchase a protection plan if you want to). Or you can buy a boutique PC that comes factory overclocked. The third point is where things start to get a bit nebulous. Overclocking depends on many factors, including your particular chip, but also your motherboard, CPU cooling, and even less obvious factors like memory and power supply. Basically, don't skimp on most areas and you should be fine. I'm not doing anything exotic here, so if you want to see results with liquid nitrogen (LN2), sorry. Instead, I'm looking at the sort of overclocks most people will go after with a good closed-loop cooler. Let's talk about the test platforms a bit. Meet the hardware I have Corsair's 280mm Hydro 115i closed-loop liquid cooler for the CPU, which should provide ample cooling for most users. For overclocking, I erred on the side of aggressive cooling and set Corsair's Link software to 'Performance' mode rather than 'Balanced' or 'Quiet.' However, I do have to note that the current version of Link doesn't detect Kaby Lake processors—it doesn't show or monitor CPU temperatures, so I had to set fan speed manually. MSI's Z270 Gaming M7 Overclocking Hardware MSI Z270 Gaming M7 Core i7-7700K Core i5-7600K Core i3-7350K Corsair Hydro H115i Corsair Dominator Platinum 2x8GB DDR4 GeForce GTX 1080 FE Samsung 960 Pro 512GB Samsung 850 Pro 2TB Corsair Carbide Air 740 Corsair RM650X Asus Z170-A ASRock Z170 Gaming K6 Core i7-6700K Corei i5-6600K Core i5-6400 On the motherboard front, I'm using MSI's Z270 Gaming M7 for the KBL parts. This is a board that sits near the top of MSI's 'mainstream' Z270 line, with their 'Godlike' line of motherboards designed for those who want to take things to the next level (LN2), but pricing makes those an extremely niche product. The M7 features RGB lighting, auto-overclocking support that can try for up to 5.2GHz if you crank the dial to 11 (no, it didn't work for me), and a nice collection of other features like triple M.2 slots. I've done limited testing with a few other motherboards, including MSI's Z270 Gaming Pro Carbon and Z270 Tomahawk, and overclocking results were similar. The same goes for testing with Asus's Strix Z270G Gaming. There are some practical differences in features and even performance, due to differences in the BIOS/firmware, but so far overclocking hasn't shown any major gaps between modest parts like the Tomahawk and higher end offerings like the Gaming M7. For Skylake comparisons, I've used two different motherboards. First is my standard testbed for Skylake, with Asus's mainstream Z170-A motherboard. The second board is ASRock's Z170 Gaming K6, which supports BCLCK overclocking of non-K processors. This feature was present, then disabled at one point, but now it's back. That makes Intel's i5-6400 and i5-6500 potential options for overclocking as well, if you're willing to go with the ASRock board. Incidentally, word on the street is that Intel isn't very happy with ASRock and others for providing this functionality, and some boards that once had non-K overclocking ended up disabling the feature. I definitely wouldn't count on Z270 boards to support non-K overclocking, but I guess we'll have to wait and see. Anyway, the ASRock Gaming K6 using the latest P7.20 BIOS still works with an i5-6400, a $185 true quad-core part, meaning an extra $15 compared to the i3-7350K. That adds a third Skylake comparison point to the overclocking charts. Overclocking settings There was a time when overclocking required a certain amount of finesse and skill. These days, you can get 98 percent of the maximum performance with very little thought or effort. Adding faster RAM and manually tweaking timings might be interesting for a small subset of users, but most enthusiasts are content to adjust the CPU multiplier, resulting in 100MHz steps (or 50MHz on some AMD CPUs). This is the approach I took here, tuning the multiplier and voltage and running some stress tests to find a stable result. Here's the high-level overview, with some additional notes below. The Skylake chips are pretty straightforward. Both the i7-6700K and i5-6600K managed to run stable at 4.7GHz. 4.8GHz was almost stable, but a few tests would occasionally lock up, even with additional voltage. The i5-6400 is a different beast, where you can't adjust multiplier but have to tweak the BCLCK, and in the process you need to disable some of the power saving features like SpeedStep and C states. I was able to hit 160MHz BCLCK with a 27X multiplier, yielding a decent 4.3GHz clock speed. There are drawbacks (like idle power, which is about 30W higher than most other Skylake/Kaby Lake CPUs), but it ends up being a very capable chip. It also ends up with the highest overclock, in terms of percent increase over stock—4.3GHz being nearly 40 percent higher than the 2.7-3.3GHz the chip runs at stock. For the X99 chips, there are more options available, like per-core overclocking on Broadwell-E parts. I decided not to try for the final 1-2 percent performance increase and just apply the same overclock to all cores. I know that in testing, the i7-6950X appears to have three cores that could go higher (they're typically 5-10C lower during stress testing than the other cores), but that will vary by chip. Finally, we have the three Kaby Lake processors. I had hoped to hit 5.0GHz on Kaby Lake, but I only managed that with the i7-7700K. Depending on yields, this could be the result of binning (the best chips become i7-7700K while lesser chips become i7-7700 or i5-7600K for example), or it could just be luck of the draw. The i3-7350K and i5-7600K both ended up at 4.9GHz, coming up just short of the hallowed 5GHz land of milk and honey. Interestingly, the i3-7350K with an inexpensive cooler (an old Intel boxed air cooler from a Haswell or Ivy Bridge chip, believe it or not) could still run fine at 4.8GHz, which is something to keep in mind. The higher power draw of quad-core parts will require something more, however. I have to admit to being a bit sad that all three Kaby Lake samples I tested topped out at 4.9 or 5.0GHz. Either I got a bit unlucky, or the 14nm+ process is only good for an extra 200MHz or so with overclocking. With MSI's board actually shooting for 5.2GHz via auto-overclocking, it got my hopes up. Still, this is the first time I've had an Intel chip running at 5.0GHz fully stable. I've been stuck in the land of 4.x GHz going back as far as the Pentium 4 days Intel has added a new feature with Kaby Lake that factors into overclocking—or rather, they brought over a feature from Broadwell-E and Xeon processors. AVX instructions can use more power and create some instability with overclocking, so Intel added an AVX offset multiplier. The values start at 0 and go down (negative), and when the CPU runs AVX instructions the multiplier will drop by the specified amount. In practice, this didn't matter on any of the CPUs I benchmarked...except for the i5-7600K, where I set AVX offset to -1 in order to successfully complete y-cruncher without throttling or other errors. Anandtech's overclocking testing offers a bit more detail on AVX offset, but they weren't able to surpass a 5.0GHz overclock, either. Careful, those pins are fragile! Overall overclocking performance As with the main Kaby Lake overview, I have limited performance results when it comes to gaming. I've done a bit of testing with i7-5930K and confirmed that the increased CPU core counts on Haswell-E and Broadwell-E don't do much for gaming performance, so I'll only report gaming performance for the Kaby Lake and Skylake parts, while I'll show the full suite of CPUs for non-gaming tests. Here are the non-gaming results—note that this is a gallery of slides, so click the small arrows for the individual results. (If you want to see non-overclocked performance, you'll have to look at the main Kaby Lake piece, but I'll discuss the overall performance improvements below.) Image 1 of 10 Image 2 of 10 Image 3 of 10 Image 4 of 10 Image 5 of 10 Image 6 of 10 Image 7 of 10 Image 8 of 10 Image 9 of 10 Image 10 of 10 What's the best overclocking chip? If you're talking about the potential for improved performance, that's easy: it's the i5-6400, where performance increases an impressive 35 percent thanks to the 160MHz BCLK. Is it fair to include a non-K CPU in the charts? You can be the judge, but obviously it makes the value proposition for the i3-7350K very questionable. It also explains why Intel doesn't want to allow BCLCK overclocking on non-K processors, since it eats into the potential market for K-series chips. For the officially overclockable CPUs, the largest increase in performance is the i5-6600K, improving by nearly 20 percent. The i3-7350K comes next, with a 17 percent improvement. The i5-7600K performance is up 15 percent, followed by the i7-6700K at 11 percent, and finally the i7-7700K at just 8 percent. That's pretty much what you'd expect from the base clock speeds—the higher the stock clocks, the lower the potential improvement from overclocking. Looking at the individual performance charts, the three Kaby Lake chips all do great at single-threaded performance, since they have the highest clock speeds and are otherwise the same architecture as Skylake. In other words, if you never want to mess with overclocking, Kaby Lake's clock speed improvements are a nice little bump, but there's little new overhead for overclocking, so the year-old Skylake chips can make up for the speed difference. There are a few tests that clearly favor Intel's architecture over AMD's Bulldozer (y-cruncher for example), but AMD's chips are mostly here as a point of reference—Ryzen will be the real comparison come March. AMD does do pretty well in the VeraCrypt and 7-zip tests, though.  Gaming overclocking performance Image 1 of 16 Image 2 of 16 Image 3 of 16 Image 4 of 16 Image 5 of 16 Image 6 of 16 Image 7 of 16 Image 8 of 16 Image 9 of 16 Image 10 of 16 Image 11 of 16 Image 12 of 16 Image 13 of 16 Image 14 of 16 Image 15 of 16 Image 16 of 16 I don't have current gaming results for all of the processors (yet). That allowed me to fit both the stock and OC numbers into a single chart, which gives a nice view of the full range of performance options. And what we learn isn't too surprising, though the i3-7350K results might raise a few eyebrows. Even at stock, the i3-7350K ends up just 15 percent slower than the fastest overclocked CPU for gaming—in overall performance, at least. Moving to the individual games, Hitman (DX12) is the best result, followed by Ashes of the Singularity. Both improve performance by 40-50 percent moving from stock i3-7350K to overclocked i7-7700K. Total War Warhammer and Civilization VI also show significant gains, at least compared to the i3-7350K. But if you're running any decent CPU, including the overclocked i5-6400, the benefits of moving up to a 'faster' processor are pretty limited. There are also plenty of games where your choice of CPU makes virtually no difference, even with a GTX 1080—look at The Division and The Witcher 3, for example, and Deus Ex, Doom (with Vulkan), Far Cry Primal, and Rise of the Tomb Raider aren't much better. Battlefield 1 single-player also doesn't need a ton of CPU, though the multiplayer game is a lot more demanding. Overall, unless you have a relatively slow CPU (like the stock i5-6400 or i3-7350K), overclocking isn't going to net you a lot of extra performance in games. That's not too surprising, since even in CPU limited situations we don't normally see overclocking help by more than 10-15 percent, but if you're wondering where the bottleneck lies in your gaming PC, look first to the graphics card, second to RAM and storage, and third to your CPU and platform would be my advice—unless you're running a very old/slow CPU. Closing thoughts Kaby Lake is clearly better/faster than Skylake, but while it might be a statistically significant improvement, it's not generally going to be practically significant—especially for gaming. Overclocking doesn't really change the story, as the new chips generally get an extra 200-300MHz compared to Skylake, which in practice amounts to 3-4 percent more performance at best—and in games, not even that. It's great to see all three chips in the 4.9-5.0GHz range, even without a ton of effort. But will the added performance typically be noticeable? No. What about the new entry-level K-series chip, the i3-7350K? It's sort of a cool and novel idea, and it can certainly handle games. However, the price makes it a less attractive option. The i5-6400 with the right motherboard is one obvious alternative, and even if you're not doing non-K overclocking, I'd generally recommend looking at a Core i5 processor rather than the i3-7350K—the i5-6500 goes for $190 online, and runs about 10-12 percent faster (at stock) than the i5-6400 for example. The problem with the i3-7350K is that, in pursuit of saving $20 or so (relative to the i5-6500), you're getting a processor that needs a Z270 motherboard to shine, and in many tasks the additional cores of the i5 will still end up delivering a better overall experience. You could buy an i5-6500 or the new i5-7500, pair that with a less expensive H170/H270 motherboard, and run stock, all for less money than an overclocked i3-7350K plus Z270. In other words, where the Pentium G3258 was interesting primarily thanks to its ultra-budget price, the i3-7350K ends up being far too close to better CPUs to catch my interest. If you're not already running Skylake and were thinking about building a new system, short of waiting for AMD's Ryzen to come out (current ETA is March for retail availability), Kaby Lake gets you another 200-300MHz—stock and overclocked. Don't forget that the K-series CPUs also need a decent aftermarket heatsink, which can add another $30 to $100 depending on how high-end you want to go.  Overclocking is easier now than it's ever been, but the potential gains have shrunk to the point where running stock doesn't mean you give up on a lot of 'free' performance.

Mesa 13.0.3 Is Out with Multiple Fixes for RadeonSI and Intel ANV Vulkan Drivers GO The Intel i965 graphics driver also received various fixes Jan 5, 2017 23:00 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  After teasing users with the Release Candidate development version of Mesa 13.0.3 3D Graphics Library just before the Christmas holidays, Collabora's Emil Velikov announced today, January 5, 2017, the availability of the final release of Mesa 13.0.3. As you can imagine, Mesa 13.0.3 is the third bugfix/stabilization update to the Mesa 13.0.x stable series, bringing a total of 55 fixes for many of the included graphics drivers and libraries, among which Intel ANV Vulkan, Intel i965, and RadeonSI are the most notable. Mesa 13.0.3 3D Graphics Library is coming five weeks after Mesa 13.0.2. Among the changes, we can notice that some memory leaks were plugged from the Intel ANV Vulkan driver, a tess+GS hang workaround was added for VI dGPUs to the RadeonSI driver, which now always restores sampler states when unbinding sampler views. Also, unit tests were added for copy propagation pass to the Intel i965 driver. "Mesa 13.0.3 is now available. This series we have multiple fixes for [Intel] i965 and RadeonSI. The ANV driver has extra smoke testing fixes and memory leaks have been resolved," said Emil Velikov, Software Release Engineer working for Collabora, in today's mailing list announcement, from where you can download the latest archive. It's coming soon to a distro near you Mesa 13.0.3, which is now the most advanced stable version of the 3D graphics library we rely on for Linux gaming and running various OpenGL applications, should soon make its way into the stable software repositories of your favorite GNU/Linux distribution, that, of course, if you haven't already switched to the Mesa 13.1-git. Below you can find attached the full changelog if you are curious to know what exactly was patched or added in this release, and we're also providing you with a download for the source archive if you plan on compiling Mesa 13.0.3 3D Graphics Library yourself. However, this is a recommended update for all users running Mesa 13.0.2 or a previous version.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Four cores and many years ago... Home Hardware Intel Hands-On With Intel’s New Kaby Lake CPU By Jeremy Laird on January 5th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Behold. Intel has a new PC processor. Does it game, will it blend, is it AMD’s Ryzen CPU you really want and what the hell happened to ‘Tick Tock’? For answers to at least some of these questions, including the shattering news that the arrival of Kaby Lake means the era of ‘Tick Tock’ is over, summarily usurped by ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation’ (or if leaked roadmaps are anything to go by, make that ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation and One More for the Road’), join me on the other side. I’ll save some of you a lot of trouble right from the get go and point out that Kaby Lake is fundamentally non-exciting, albeit for somewhat interesting reasons. It’s another mainstream CPU family from Intel that tops out at four cores and only ups the performance ante by a small increment. Broadly speaking, we’re talking less that 10 per cent performance improvement over existing Skylake CPUs from Intel. Kaby Lake is, in short, probably the last boring mainstream chip from Intel before various factors align and force Intel out of its slumber and into something resembling action. More on that in a moment. I’ve been hands-on with the two headline grabbing CPUs of the Kaby Lake range courtesy of MSI’s Z270 Gaming M5 motherboard, which showcases the new 200 Series chipsets that accompany Kaby. The processors in question are the 4.2GHz/4.5GHz Core i7-7700K and the 3.8GHz/4.2GHz Core i5-7600K. Thus by their ‘7xxx’ suffixes shall ye know Kaby Lake chips. First, let’s talk about what’s new in Kaby Lake the CPU, which isn’t much. The CPU cores are largely if not entirely identical to Skylake. The integrated graphics isn’t new either, not in terms of 3D rendering at least. It’s basically the same ‘Gen9’ integrated gunk as seen and not terribly enjoyed by gamers in Skylake chips. So we’re left with two really significant updates. The first involves manufacturing. Actually, Kaby Lake is a 14nm chip, which makes it the third such family from Intel. Hence the shift from the old so-called ‘Tick Tock’ paradigm which saw Intel crank out a new chip and a new production process in alternate years. The significance here is that Intel has officially given up trying to shrink its CPU transistors every other year. That reflects a general industry-wide slow down in chip development as the world’s silicon engineers increasingly bump up against the laws of physics. Anyway, ‘Tock tick’ is toast and now we have aforementioned ‘Process, Architecture, Optimisation’, which buys Intel an extra year to get those tricky die shrinks out the door. Despite all that, Intel has refined the existing 14nm tech enough to bump Kaby Lake’s clockspeeds by around 200MHz to 300MHz higher than previous chips depending on the model in question. That’s where the less-than-10-per-cent performance uptick figure comes from given that the CPU cores aren’t any fancier. They just run a little quicker. That said, prior to launch the scuttlebutt implied that Kaby Lake might be quite the overclocker. Hold that thought. The other potentially significant novelty involves 2D video. Yeah, not exactly gaming relevant. But for the record, Kaby Lake is potentially really snazzy in this department. Firstly, it has some major decode and encode chops. Thanks to some new 2D hardware, it can decode up to eight standard 4K HEVC streams simultaneously, which is kind of crazy, and can also support ultra-high bitrate streams, too, up to 4K at 60 frames per second and 120Mbps. It has some new encode capabilities, too. Arguably even more newsworthy is some new DRM gubbins that will allow Kaby Lake PCs to be the first that are allowed to stream 4K Netflix content. Until now, that’s been restricted to HDTV apps and set top boxes. However, what’s not clear is whether that will only be possible when using the integrated graphics. Personally, I don’t see how it makes sense unless it’s tied to the integrated graphics, but we’ll see. But the point is that if you’re looking for an all-round computing solution, Kaby Lake does have a few tricks up its sleeve. It won’t make games run much faster. But if you’re due an upgrade the 4K Netflix shizzle could be appealing and the hardware decode could also be interesting for laptops. As for what the Core i7-7700K and the Core i5-7600K are like in the real world, I haven’t much to say. To be frank, they feel no different to similar quad-core chips since, arguably, 2011 when Sandy Bridge arrived and shook things up. If you want benchmarks, try these. It’s actually the platform and stuff like USB Type-C… As you can see, it’s a total wash versus any vaguely recent Intel CPU family in almost any game. The overclocking picture, however, is at least a little more interesting. I managed 5.2GHz from the Core i5-7600K and 5GHz from the Core i7-7700K. That’s a few hundred MHz more than you might expect from a Skylake chip. Welcome, but to be brutally honest, again you just ain’t gonna feel that kind of difference. Arguably of more tangible import are the motherboards and chipsets. Kaby Lake sticks with the LGA1151 socket, so it slots into existing Intel 100 series motherboards. Praise the Lord for such small mercies. That said, the new 200 Series chipsets do bring a few frills. Our muse for this purpose is MSI’s new Z270 Gaming G5, which uses the top-end Z270 chipswet (obviously) in a sort of middling format in terms of pricing, which should weighing in at around £165 if the existing Z170 Gaming M5 is anything to go by. There’s support for DDR4-2400 RAM, for instance, and another four PCI Express 3.0 lanes on the chipset for peripherals, making for 24 in total. That said, the connection between the chipset and the CPU is the same DMI 3.0 thingamy, so the max bandwidth hasn’t changed, which is about 4GB/s and thus a tiny fraction of the theoretical maximum of those 24 PCIE 3.0 lanes. …Optane memory support… Additional intrigue comes in the form of an otherwise unassuming logo atop the Gaming G5’s box. “Intel Optane Memory Ready”, it reads. But what does it mean? That’s a story in itself (which I’ve touched on briefly, earlier), but the short version is that Intel has cooked up a new non-volatile memory tech. Like flash memory, it doesn’t need power to maintain data storage. But it’s far faster than flash memory. Think of it as being a cross between flash and RAM and you’ll have the right rough idea. How it will all work is a little unclear at this stage. It seems Optane will initially come in smallish drives of 16GB and 32GB and act as a sort of cache drive rather than as a conventional mass-storage hard drive. Eventually as the price comes down, I think we’ll see straight-up Optane SSDs for mass storage. Anyway, if you like the sound of Optane, support begins with the new 200 Series chipsets. Elsewhere, the MSI Gaming M5 serves ups various modern features, including a pair of M.2 slots and a USB Type-C port. So as has often been the case of late, it’s actually the platform that looks more compelling as an upgrade option for a few-years-old PC, rather than the CPU. The context to all this, of course, and the ‘factor’ I alluded to earlier is the imminent launch of AMD new’s Ryzen CPU. Again, I’ll cover the full story in another post, but Ryzen looks awfully promising and it’s likely that Intel will be forced to respond with a major upgrade to its mainstream CPUs within the next year, including its first six-core mainstream chip. …and generally bags of bandwidth with 200 Series motherboards like the MSI Z270 Gaming M5 that’s arguably a bit interesting, not the Kaby lake chip itself… All of which makes it pretty hard to get excited about Kaby Lake. In truth, you have to go back to Sandy Bridge in 2011 to find a mainstream Intel CPU that really moved the game forward. Kaby Lake doesn’t change that. But hopefully it will be the last of its type, the last sand-bagging Intel chip, if you like. About bloody time it will be, too. TL;DR – By their 7xxx suffixes shall ye know Kaby Lake – They change very little in terms of gaming performance – They overclock pretty well – It says something that 4K Netflix support is perhaps the main selling point – The new 200 Series platform is probably more interesting than the CPU itself thanks to Optane memory support.

Two chips run hotter than the equivalent Skylake model; the third runs cooler, with something like 20% lower current usage.

Log in to Reply 05/01/2017 at 23:37 Jeremy Laird says: Bit of a minefield, HDR, especially as it pertains to monitors. I actually don’t think it changes a huge amount. You still want to focus on the fundamentals – size, panel type, resolution and refresh rate. OLED will be the big game changer, not HDR applied to conventional LCD technology, in my view.

Log in to Reply 06/01/2017 at 12:48 LewdPenguin says: If my motherboard hadn’t combusted I expect I’d be in a similar position still running a 7-8 year old CPU, having only upgraded the graphics card probably twice by now. Buying into every new hardware release seems entirely pointless to me, the occasions I would actually max out my old CPU were few enough to have made any upgrade pretty much unnoticeable 99% of the time. Then again the article seems pretty clear in its opinion that unless like me you’re currently looking at potentially (re)building a system pretty much from scratch then there’s little reason to upgrade right now from a performance perspective. In fact if the next new generation of chips is truly going to be the next notable step-change in performance rather than just further incremental optimisation then its all the more reason for potential optional upgraders to hold off.

And that’s a £250 CPU, plus with the cost of new mobo and ram I decided it 100% wasn’t worth it. I also looked up some gaming benchmarks for DDR4 and was seeing less than 1% gains. The only real downside to the tech gen I’m using is only 2x 6GB/S SATA3 ports which means some of my SSDs aren’t running full speed.

Running it at rock solid 4.6 for years and still shreds everything I throw at it e.g. Dishonored 2 at 1440p, everything at ultra never dips below 60fps (v-synced, actually goes way higher if I let it). Granted, it’s sharing a case with a GTX1080, 16gb ram and nosebleed fast internet but as far as the cpu goes there’s absolutely no reason to fork out yet. Give me a decent 40-50% increase in performance over my old timer and my money’s yours Intel.

Devindra Hardawar, @devindra 01.05.17 in Gadgetry Comments 2160 Shares Share Tweet Share Save If you really think about it, "smart" devices today can also count as computers. They have processors, memory and other hardware similar to what you'd find in a PC. But the problem with embedding computing hardware in devices like TVs and refrigerators is that they'll quickly grow obsolete. Simply put: to get a faster TV, you have to buy a whole new one. Intel is hoping to change that with Compute Card, a new platform for credit card-sized modular computers that can easily be swapped in and out of smart devices. The idea is that when new Compute Card hardware is available, you should be able to just plug it into your TV or refrigerator. They include Intel SOCs (system-on-chips), memory, storage and networking capabilities. "Device makers simply design a standard Intel Compute Card slot into their device and then utilize the best Intel Compute Card for their performance and price needs," the company wrote in a statement. "This reduces the time and resources needed to design and validate the compute block and helps speed up innovation to bring the power of intelligence into an ever wider range of devices." Given just how powerful mobile hardware is becoming, and the ongoing problem of smart devices becoming obsolete, it makes sense for Intel to pursue the Compute Card. It's also teamed up with the likes of Dell, HP, Lenovo and Sharp to develop the platform, and its early hardware partners include Seneca Data, Infocus and others.Click here to catch up on the latest news from CES 2017.

To meet the needs of gamers everywhere, Asus refreshed its lineup of Republic of Gamers laptops, and they all come with the latest Intel processors and Nvidia graphics cards. The GX800VH is full of drool-worthy components. One GeForce GTX 1080 wasn't enough, so Asus dropped in two in SLI. Along with a seventh-generation Intel Core i7 processor, those components produce a lot of heat, so Asus equipped this laptop with its Hydro Overclocking liquid-cooling system and thermal dock. The 4K display is an 18" IPS panel with G-Sync support. The MechTAG keyboard is equipped with mechanical switches and customizable Aura RGB LED lighting effects. Asus's G752 and G701 laptops are slightly more modest machines, if laptops with unlocked Intel Core i7 processors can be called that. In both machines, Asus pairs the processors with DDR4 memory clocked at 2800 MT/s. Both models sport displays with 120Hz refresh rates and G-Sync support. The G752 packs a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 card and uses Asus's 3D Vapor Chamber tech for GPU cooling. The G701 steps things up a notch with a GeForce GTX 1080. The company is also updating its smaller gaming laptops. Asus's 15" GL502 and 17" GL702 can be fitted with CPUs up to a Kaby Lake Core i7 model. Buyers will also be able to choose between Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1070 or GTX 1060 cards. Both laptops are equipped with 120Hz, G-Sync-toting displays. The last two Asus ROG laptops to get the Kaby Lake treatment are the GL553 and GL753. Those machines also get upgrades to Intel Core i7 CPUs and a choice of GTX 1050 Ti or GTX 1050 cards. We reckon gamers are spoilt for choice these days—always a good thing.   Tags: Mobile computing Gaming User name:  Password:  Remember me Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Thursday, January 5, 2017 [Tweets] [Favorites] Intel Core i7-7700K Kaby Lake Review Mark Walton (Hacker News): The Intel Core i7-7700K is what happens when a chip company stops trying. The i7-7700K is the first desktop Intel chip in brave new post-”tick-tock” world—which means that instead of major improvements to architecture, process, and instructions per clock (IPC), we get slightly higher clock speeds and a way to decode DRM-laden 4K streaming video. There are apparently power consumption improvements, however. Dan Luu: Dear linkbait authors, I’m pretty sure Intel is trying. If you look at research $, they appear to be trying exponentially harder over time. Marcel Weiher: We are in an effective post-Moore’s law world, and have been for a couple of years. Yes, we can still put more transistors on the chip, but we are pretty much done with single core performance, at least until some really big breakthrough. […] Most of the things that go into squandering CPU don’t parallelize well, so removing the bloat is actually starting to become cheaper again than trying to combat it with more silicon. Lloyd Chambers: [There] are at least a few reasons why the Intel ‘Kaby Lake’ release is significant: Improved graphics performance. My understanding is that the Kaby Lake ‘H’ series supports 32GB memory, thus making a MacBook Pro with 32GB of DR 23000 DRAM possible. But whether the power draw is viable on a laptop is unclear (meaning what we could expect from Apple, given the rationalizations seen with the Nov 2016 MacBook Pro). The i7-7920HQ 3.1 GHz (turbo boost to 4.1 GHz, 4 real CPU cores) might be suitable for a MacBook Pro. The i7-7700K 4.2 GHz (turbo boost 4.5 GHz) shoudl be suitable for an iMac. This perhaps is the “standstill” point—that’s only 5% faster than the 4.0 GHz iMac 5K that sits on my desk today—at the cost of a 95 watt TPD. Paul Haddad: Every PC manufacturer today announced Kaby Lake updates. I’m guessing Apple will wait until at least April to announce a MacBook with one.

At first glance, it's easy to mistake the modular computer for a credit card or smart card. It's so thin, it could be easy to lose. But it's a full blown computer, crammed with a 7th Generation Intel Kaby Lake processor, memory, storage, and wireless connectivity. It's so small, it can't accommodate USB-C or other ports to power up or connect to displays. The Compute Card will work only after being plugged into a slot of a larger device, much like smart cards. Here's the bad news: It's not targeted toward PCs. However, we hope Intel will eventually make them for PCs, and there are hints the chipmaker could. The idea of a super-small computer is exciting, and it could solve some problems. For example, computer upgrades could become easier. The Compute Card is targeted at the commercial market, and it could be slotted into all-in-one devices, digital signs, smart devices, robots, drones, and other products. Businesses will be able to add a whole PC into products that otherwise have minimal computing power. That very model could be applied to upgrading PCs. The Compute Card could make PC upgrades simple by just plugging the card into a slot into a computer case. You wouldn't need to go out and buy a whole new PC just to get the latest processors and components. There are many modular PCs available today in the form of mini-desktops from companies that include Acer and Lenovo. Users can add features by connecting blocks to the desktop. It's an economic way for PC buyers to get the features they need at a reasonable price. Intel will start shipping the Compute Card in the middle of this year. The company sees it as a plug-in computer for a plethora of smart devices starting to invade homes and businesses. Potential uses could include smart devices like refrigerators, smart light bulbs, security cameras, and air conditioners. The card could also be used in smart kiosks and internet of things gateways. Intel is working with companies like Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Sharp to build specialized slots into devices. Many of them are PC makers, and they may try to build the slots into PCs. The partners will take "advantage of the simplified design, ease of serviceability, and user upgradeability of the Intel Compute Card," Intel said in a statement. It won't be sold directly to consumers and is only available for partners, an Intel spokesman said. Had this product been released last year's CES, it could've been marketed as a PC. Intel has since put more emphasis on IoT, and it hopes to sell billions of chips that go into smart devices. Intel targets its Atom chips at IoT devices, and this is the first time it is targeting Kaby Lake chips at devices in the emerging IoT category.

Credit: Samsung More like this ARM PCs with Windows 10 get a new start with the Snapdragon 835 chip Qualcomm awakens and hopes to crush Intel at its own game The top 10 PC technologies and trends to watch in 2017 Video Windows 10 Quick Tips: Getting the most from Cortana Microsoft wants a go-to Chromebook competitor, and it may be getting one in upcoming Windows 10 PCs with ARM chips. Those Windows 10 laptops and tablets could look something like Samsung's latest Chromebook Pro and Plus announced at CES. The attractive 2-in-1s have 12.3-inch screens and are targeted at those who do most of their computing online. In a way, Samsung's new Chromebooks share some features with new Windows PCs announced at CES. They have cool features like 2400 x 1600 pixel touchscreens and USB-C ports, which are also in the latest Windows 2-in-1s with Intel's Kaby Lake chips. While Google plots a Chromebook attack on Windows 10, Microsoft could be using Chromebooks as a blueprint for its "cellular PCs," or thin and light laptops that are always connected to the Internet. The new category of laptops will have Qualcomm's new ARM-based Snapdragon 835 chip, which was also announced at CES. Microsoft and Qualcomm last month announced they would work on building the cellular PCs. The Snapdragon 835 chip will give Windows 10 laptops a bevy of features so users can do most of their computing online, much like on Chromebooks. The Snapdragon 835 boasts integrated Wi-Fi 802.11ad, integrated LTE and Bluetooth 5. Those features aren't integrated in x86 chips. Snapdragon 835 also marks a return of ARM chips to Windows PCs. The most recent outing with Windows RT was a disaster, but Microsoft has since refined its approach. Windows RT was targeted at iOS and Android, and ARM-based Windows 10 PCs are aimed at Chromebooks, analysts said. Chromebooks and ARM-based Windows 10 devices will share many traits, said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. The first ARM-based Windows 10 PCs, which are due later this year, will be entry-level systems for basic applications and online services. You won't be able to do run intense applications, which still require the more powerful x86 chips, McGregor said. Windows 10 laptops with Snapdragon 835 will be thin, light and offer long battery life, said Cisco Cheng, a Snapdragon evangelist at Qualcomm. It'll run the full fledged Windows OS, and offer the connectivity options never before seen in PCs, Cheng said. For now, Windows 10 on ARM seems a big improvement from Windows RT, which was plagued with usability and application compatibility issues. Microsoft and Qualcomm learned from their mistakes, and tried to rectify the issues. But a larger question remains whether an ARM-based Windows 10 laptop will offer the price and usability compared to Chromebooks, said Jack Gold, principal analyst at J. Gold Associates, in a research note. Many Chromebooks are priced under US$200, and the first ARM-based Windows 10 device may not be that inexpensive. That's because the Snapdragon 835 is an expensive chip, Gold wrote. Nevertheless, Microsoft wants to compete on equal terms with Chrome OS and Android in both mobile and PCs, and a Windows 10 laptop with Snapdragon 835 is one way to do so, he wrote. PC makers haven't announced Windows 10 laptops with Snapdragon 835, but want to test the hardware. There's some caution after the failure of Windows RT tablets, but PC makers find ARM-based Windows 10 PCs intriguing as more data moves to the cloud and the lines blur between laptops and mobile devices. Microsoft tried to replicate the Chromebook model with Intel-based x86 chips by offering free versions of Windows 8 -- called Windows 8.1 with Bing -- to PC makers a few years ago. PC makers built low-cost laptops with basic processors and minimal storage, much like Chromebooks, but the strategy failed. Google also has positioned Chrome OS as a replacement for Windows, but that hasn't worked out so far. Chromebooks are more effective when connected to the Internet, and have limited offline capabilities. Windows, on the other hand, is a full-fledged OS. It was smart of Microsoft to extend the Windows 10 to ARM, Gold said. Putting all eggs in the x86 basket was dangerous for Microsoft, and with ARM as a partner, it has more flexibility in how to conduct business. Chromebooks already run on both ARM and x86 chips. Samsung's latest Chromebook Pro has an ARM processor, while Chromebook Plus has an x86 chip. For ARM, being both in Chromebooks and Windows 10 will expand its footprint in devices. Its dogged focus on mobile is paying off, McGregor said. To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

Twitter Facebook Intel's Compute Card mini-computer is so small that you may lose it Intel's Compute Card is the smallest and thinnest computer the chipmaker has ever made Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 06 January, 2017 07:28 - - - - print email Comments You've perhaps never seen a full-blown computer smaller than Intel's amazingly thin Compute Card, announced for the first time at CES. At first glance, it's easy to mistake the modular computer for a credit card or smart card. It's so thin, it could be easy to lose. But it's a full blown computer, crammed with a 7th Generation Intel Kaby Lake processor, memory, storage, and wireless connectivity. It's so small, it can't accommodate USB-C or other ports to power up or connect to displays. The Compute Card will work only after being plugged into a slot of a larger device, much like smart cards. Here's the bad news: It's not targeted toward PCs. However, we hope Intel will eventually make them for PCs, and there are hints the chipmaker could. The idea of a super-small computer is exciting, and it could solve some problems. For example, computer upgrades could become easier. The Compute Card is targeted at the commercial market, and it could be slotted into all-in-one devices, digital signs, smart devices, robots, drones, and other products. Businesses will be able to add a whole PC into products that otherwise have minimal computing power. That very model could be applied to upgrading PCs. The Compute Card could make PC upgrades simple by just plugging the card into a slot into a computer case. You wouldn't need to go out and buy a whole new PC just to get the latest processors and components. There are many modular PCs available today in the form of mini-desktops from companies that include Acer and Lenovo. Users can add features by connecting blocks to the desktop. It's an economic way for PC buyers to get the features they need at a reasonable price. Intel will start shipping the Compute Card in the middle of this year. The company sees it as a plug-in computer for a plethora of smart devices starting to invade homes and businesses. Potential uses could include smart devices like refrigerators, smart light bulbs, security cameras, and air conditioners. The card could also be used in smart kiosks and internet of things gateways. Intel is working with companies like Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Sharp to build specialized slots into devices. Many of them are PC makers, and they may try to build the slots into PCs. The partners will take "advantage of the simplified design, ease of serviceability, and user upgradeability of the Intel Compute Card," Intel said in a statement. It won't be sold directly to consumers and is only available for partners, an Intel spokesman said. Had this product been released last year's CES, it could've been marketed as a PC. Intel has since put more emphasis on IoT, and it hopes to sell billions of chips that go into smart devices. Intel targets its Atom chips at IoT devices, and this is the first time it is targeting Kaby Lake chips at devices in the emerging IoT category.

Until Intel took (mostly) everyone into a room at CES 2017 and told them to put on an Oculus Rift headset. The virtual reality keynote was an opportunity for Intel to showcase three areas they expect virtual reality to become increasingly prevalent: sports and live entertainment, tourism and, of course, video games. And that meant telling everyone - or at least the press and industry folk who lined up early enough to get inside the conference - to pop on the Oculus Rift in front of them. As far as Intel is concerned, VR can play a major factor in three things: travel, work and play. The travel pitch was pretty simple: imagine you could look and move around your next holiday spot, the hotel room you're going to book, the monument you'd like to go visit. So to demonstrate, Intel fired up a VR experience of flying over the desert, complete with jumping out of a helicopter while wearing a wingsuit. The people in the conference weren't wearing wingsuits, but it was pretty good to see a few queasy reactions. The next part required the co-founder of Hype VR, Ted Schilowitz. While video has enjoyed jumps in fidelity, resolution and quality over the years, it's still predominantly a moving image shot from a single camera, a single perspective. Hype VR and Intel's answer was a high-def video from a Waterfall in Vietnam, viewed through the Rift. The kicker with Hype VR's technology was the ability to move around the physical space in the video, without distorting the perspective or point of view. That theme revolved throughout the conference: being able to control the perspective, to become the cameraman. Perhaps the strongest theme of the keynote was Intel's alignment with real-world sports, both through a deal with La Liga to introduce their 360-degree video technology to three stadiums, and a live broadcast of a college basketball match. The trick with the live basketball match in VR was the ability to look around and choose different camera perspectives. It wasn't a free-roaming camera like one would hope, and when Intel first cut to the game it was half-time (leaving viewers with bugger all to see beyond warmups). The live feed - which took about 40 seconds to beam simultaneously to all the headsets in the conference - was truly live courtesy of a platform called Voke. Voke's currently available for the Samsung Gear VR, and is scheduled for release for the Oculus Rift at the end of the year. Krzanich added that the content available won't just be limited to sports, but music and other forms of live entertainment as well. It's hard not to see it as a future route for pay-per-view content, especially when broadcasters have the ability to overlay statistics and information throughout. As far as work is concerned, Krzanich pitched the idea that virtual reality could be a way to reduce the danger associated with hazardous jobs. Intel then streamed 4K, 360-degree live video from a drone inspecting solar panels, a job that would typically be done by a human. While it wasn't the smoothest feed, it was also pretty functional. The idea is that VR could be used in these situations to scope out hazardous work, or for use in search and rescue missions where conditions make it too problematic for a helicopter and crew to investigate. Intel also showed off the work they've been doing on Project Alloy, their open-source HMD first announced at the Intel Developers Conference last year. All of the sensors and processing power is done in the headset itself, using Intel's RealSense technology and a Kaby Lake Core i7 CPU. There's no word on how it matches up to a Rift or Vive that relies on far beefier hardware - but Intel said they would begin productising Project Alloy by the end of the year. Image: Twitter (@intel) Apart from the promise of a VR headset that doesn't have wires and is hooked into something with more processing power than your smartphone, Intel also pulled off a neat trick with "mixed reality". It's basically a fancy term for scanning the space around you and incorporating that into the environment into the headset, which gets around VR's current problem of not having enough space in your living room to move around. As an example, the stage opened up and showcased two people wearing Alloy prototypes in a faux living room. The couches were transformed into bunkers that could be used for cover in-game, which is wonderful encouragement to leave large objects lying around every now and again. Nobody in the crowd got to get hands-on with Project Alloy, but that was besides the point. The demo, much like the whole keynote, showcased ways in which VR might actually have a role in our day to day lives. The technology behind VR has come an awful long way. But from a gaming perspective, developers are very much still figuring things out. Many titles are little more than short experiences, rail shooters and short experiments lasting no more than a few hours at most. It's still very disposable. But being able to watch live sport, or a concert, or the live feed of a drone, isn't. It's something we already do every day, and will continue to do going forward. The conference helped give VR a place in our lives that made sense, and that was the cool part. The technology is almost there, but what we don't have yet is purpose. It probably still won't happen by the time 2017 comes to a close, especially when you factor in the capabilities of Australian internet. But it's not far off.

At first glance, it's easy to mistake the modular computer for a credit card or smart card. It's so thin, it could be easy to lose. But it's a full blown computer, crammed with a 7th Generation Intel Kaby Lake processor, memory, storage, and wireless connectivity. It's so small, it can't accommodate USB-C or other ports to power up or connect to displays. The Compute Card will work only after being plugged into a slot of a larger device, much like smart cards. Here's the bad news: It's not targeted toward PCs. However, we hope Intel will eventually make them for PCs, and there are hints the chipmaker could. The idea of a super-small computer is exciting, and it could solve some problems. For example, computer upgrades could become easier. The Compute Card is targeted at the commercial market, and it could be slotted into all-in-one devices, digital signs, smart devices, robots, drones, and other products. Businesses will be able to add a whole PC into products that otherwise have minimal computing power. That very model could be applied to upgrading PCs. The Compute Card could make PC upgrades simple by just plugging the card into a slot into a computer case. You wouldn't need to go out and buy a whole new PC just to get the latest processors and components. There are many modular PCs available today in the form of mini-desktops from companies that include Acer and Lenovo. Users can add features by connecting blocks to the desktop. It's an economic way for PC buyers to get the features they need at a reasonable price. Intel will start shipping the Compute Card in the middle of this year. The company sees it as a plug-in computer for a plethora of smart devices starting to invade homes and businesses. Potential uses could include smart devices like refrigerators, smart light bulbs, security cameras, and air conditioners. The card could also be used in smart kiosks and internet of things gateways. Intel is working with companies like Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Sharp to build specialized slots into devices. Many of them are PC makers, and they may try to build the slots into PCs. The partners will take "advantage of the simplified design, ease of serviceability, and user upgradeability of the Intel Compute Card," Intel said in a statement. It won't be sold directly to consumers and is only available for partners, an Intel spokesman said. Had this product been released last year's CES, it could've been marketed as a PC. Intel has since put more emphasis on IoT, and it hopes to sell billions of chips that go into smart devices. Intel targets its Atom chips at IoT devices, and this is the first time it is targeting Kaby Lake chips at devices in the emerging IoT category. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Intel unveils Compute Card, a credit card-sized compute platform Posted on 6-Jan-2017 09:44. | Filed under: News : Internet of Things. Intel is announcing a new modular compute platform called the Intel Compute Card, along with a range of partners who will be working with Intel to help accelerate the ecosystem of solutions based on the Intel Compute Card. The new platform is squarely aimed at the Internet of Things projects, enabling more smart and connected devices. The Intel Compute Card is being developed with that in mind, to transform the way compute and connectivity can be integrated and used in future devices.   The Intel Compute Card has all the elements of a full computer, including Intel SoC, memory, storage and wireless connectivity with flexible I/O options so hardware manufacturers can optimize for their particular solutions – from interactive refrigerators and smart kiosks to security cameras and IoT gateways. Intel Compute Card’s modularity and flexibility allows for internal or external integration with certified devices via a compute card slot. Companies will be able to extend capabilities for devices such as digital signage and kiosks, All-in-Ones, smart TVs and appliances   Device makers simply design a standard Intel Compute Card slot into their device and then utilize the best Intel Compute Card for their performance and price needs. This reduces the time and resources needed to design and validate the compute block and helps speed up innovation to bring the power of intelligence into an ever wider range of devices.   Intel is working with a wide range of partners who share our vision that the Intel Compute Card could significantly change the way they and the rest of the industry design and productise a wide range of solutions in the near future. These partners are working to develop products that can take advantage of the simplified design, ease of serviceability and user upgradeability of the Intel Compute Card. Intel is proud to be working with leading global partners, including Dell, HP, Lenovo and Sharp, to bring this vision to reality. In addition, Intel is working with a range of regional partners who are all looking to bring unique solutions to their respective markets. These early partners include Seneca Data, InFocus, DTx, TabletKiosk and Pasuntech.   The Intel Compute Card will be available in mid-2017 and will come with a range of processors options, including the latest 7th Gen Intel Core processors.   More information: http://www.intel.com/ComputeCard...

Intel says virtual reality will replace need to go on holiday World’s biggest computer chip firm says future of travel is in VR from our living room sofas  Share  Comments Bylee bell 10:35, 6 JAN 2017 Technology Audience members react to a virtual reality experience during Intel's CES press conference  Share  Comments Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Intel, one of the world’s biggest computer chip companies, has claimed that virtual reality (VR) will replace the need for us to physically travel the world in the future. Announced during the firm’s keynote at CES 2017 , Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said the merging of digital and physical worlds to create amazing immersive experiences, will change the world of travel. It has echoes of Total Recall, the 1990 action movie directed by Paul Verhoeven and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, in which people can buy memory implants of vacations, including those to Mars. “Why do we travel? We want to explore and have adventures and have experiences we've never had; exploring world around us,” Mr Krzanich said. “But VR makes it possible to have these experiences like you’re really there while being in the comfort of your living room. With VR, we're offering a variety of ways to enjoy immersive travel.” Audience members use virtual reality headsets to experience a series of travel, work and play situations The company gave Oculus Rift VR headsets to over 260 reporters in the crowd to back up its statements, taking them on a journey from the comfort of a hotel conference room. In the first VR demo, Krzanich showed the audience what it’s like to jump off a cliff and parachute through a desert valley. The next demo took us to a waterfall in Vietnam, with the audience engaging in what Krzanich called “the world’s first walk-around video experience”, using the firm’s volumetric video technology. Read More Trouble sleeping? These gadgets promise to help you get a good night's kip in 2017 This experience allows you to walk around while a high fidelity video was playing and experience it like you are really there. The video moves with you and allows you to travel and move through the space of the video concept with a VR headset. Powered by Intel partner and computer vision software company HypeVR, the result is incredibly realistic, as instead of just being able to look around in 360, you can peer inside and behind moving objects. Brian Krzanich, Intel chief executive officer, displays the Project Alloy all-in-one virtual reality headset Intel explained this is possible because every single pixel in the scene is mapped in space, and looks ridiculously realistic as it’s not CGI, it’s real, captured material where every single frame is 3GB per frame, taking masses amounts of computing power. Kranich said it is Intel’s goal to deliver this kind of content to many more locations around the world, making it possible to see holiday destinations while walking around your living room.

To finish off the VR conference, the Intel CEO also used the VR headsets to show off the future of sports viewing. With VR, Intel is bringing live sports to audiences at home like never before. Audience members watch the Villanova-Butler NCAA basketball game on virtual reality headsets This is been made possible thanks to Intel’s acquisition of VOKE VR in November last year, a firm that had previously presented sports content including highlights of NFL games in VR. From the Oculus Rift headset, we were able to experience VOKE’s 180-degree courtside views of a basketball game, live in Indianapolis.

You can then view the game like you are really there. And that’s exactly how it feels, like you've been dropped courtside. Intel said it will be among the first technology companies to enable this live sports experience on multiple VR devices, and said the option to view VOKE VR content on Oculus Rift will be available to all later this year. Intel's press conference on Wednesday, Jan. 4, 2017, in Las Vegas “Viewers get to decide their point of view,” Krzanich said. “So you’re going to decide, do you want to be on the 50 yard line? Do you want to be courtside at a basketball game? Do you want to be behind the basket to watch the next slam dunk? Do you want to be in the goalie’s position? All of that is possible.” Read More Best TVs of CES 2017 - including LG's 'wallpaper' TV, Samsung's QLED and Sony's glass speaker screen Intel believes this is the future of how we will view sports, giving us an opportunity to go to games that we’d never been able to before. “This is the future of spots,” Krzanich added.

Cannon Lake, which is the successor to “Kaby Lake”, will be an entirely new architecture and the first 10nm process. The smaller the fabrication process of a chip, the less power and heat it generates, opening the door tosignificantly better performance and improved battery life. It's the first time Intel has changed its process size since 2014's "Broadwell" chips. Intel image of first Cannon Lake laptop Krzanich demonstrated a Cannon Lake laptop on stage but did not detail any of the specifications or expectations of the new architecture. It's very early days, so expect a growing volume of information as 2017 wears on. It's not surprising Intel didn't reveal much about Cannon Lake. After all, it only just finished launching Kaby Lake, and the vast majority of laptop manufacturers are heavily pushing new Kaby Lake kit. To reveal how much better Cannon Lake might be would probably hit sales. We'll have more on this as we get it. 0 shares Read Comments Charles Spiegel January 5, 2017, 12:52 am New architecture?

Gadgets by Sean Hollister January 5, 2017 10:14 AM PST @starfire2258 Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS Enlarge Image Not bad...but the Compute Card is 5mm thick. (Credit cards are 0.76mm thick.)Photo by Intel How often do you buy a new TV or smart fridge? (Probably not often.) But how quickly do your appliance's smarts go obsolete? The Intel Compute Card -- a credit-card shaped PC just announced at CES 2017 -- is a stab at making upgrades for big, bulky devices far more easy. While it's not quite small enough to fit in your wallet (it's thicker than five cards stacked together), it is a full-fledged Intel computer with a 7th-gen Intel Core CPU, memory, storage, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity all packed into a slottable, swappable cartridge form. (It uses what Intel's calling a "USB-C plus extension connector" to provide USB and PCIe data connectivity along with both HDMI and DisplayPort video signals to the devices it goes inside. I guess Intel's Thunderbolt, which does the same thing, couldn't quite fit.) 5 Intel's pocket-sized Compute Card will update your IoT devices Intel doesn't necessarily see you slotting this into your existing computer -- it's more likely to appear in (what are currently) harder-to-upgrade devices like smart TVs, refrigerators and other appliances, cars, digital signs and kiosks. "Device makers simply design a standard Intel Compute Card slot into their device and then utilize the best Intel Compute Card for their performance and price needs," writes Intel. If this sounds familiar, you might be thinking of the Intel Compute Stick -- but that device is quite a bit different. 50 All the cool new gadgets at CES 2017 Intel tells CNET it will make the Compute Card and slots itself, but that a whole host of partners are currently exploring the best way to use it, including HP, Dell, Lenovo, Sharp, Seneca, DTx, InFocus, TabletKiosk and Pasuntech. The Compute Card should be available in mid-2017, says Intel. You can read more about Intel's connected car ambitions in my colleague Stephen Shankland's piece here.

Skip to content Hackaday Primary Menu Home Blog Hackaday.io Store Hackaday Prize Submit About January 15, 2017 Hands On With The First Open Source Microcontroller 144 Comments by: Brian Benchoff January 5, 2017 2016 was a great year for Open Hardware. The Open Source Hardware Association released their certification program, and late in the year, a few silicon wizards met in Mountain View to show off the latest happenings in the RISC-V instruction set architecture. The RISC-V ISA is completely unlike any other computer architecture. Nearly every other chip you’ll find out there, from the 8051s in embedded controllers, 6502s found in millions of toys, to AVR, PIC, and whatever Intel is working on are closed-source designs. You cannot study these chips, you cannot manufacture these chips, and if you want to use one of these chips, your list of suppliers is dependent on who has a licensing agreement with who. We’ve seen a lot of RISC-V stuff in recent months, from OnChip’s Open-V, and now the HiFive 1 from SiFive. The folks at SiFive offered to give me a look at the HiFive 1, so here it is, the first hands-on with the first Open Hardware microcontroller. Before I dig into this, I must discuss the openness of the HiFive 1, and RISC-V in general. Free Software and Open Hardware is a religion, and it’s significantly more difficult to produce Open Hardware than Free Software. No matter how good or how Open the design is, the production of the first Open Source microcontroller will generate far too many comments from people who use the words ‘moral imperative’ while citing utilitarian examples of why Open and Libre is good. You should ignore these comments, but not just because these people have only read the back cover of the Cliff’s Notes for Philosophy For Dummies. The Openness of the HiFive 1 and RISC-V The biggest selling point for RISC-V chips is that there are no licensing fees, and this microcontroller is Open Source. This is huge — your AVRs, PICs, ARMs, and every other microcontroller on the planet is closed hardware. You can’t study the silicon. If we’re ever going to get a completely Open Source computer, it has to start somewhere, and here it is. With that said, this is an Arduino-compatible board with an FTDI chip providing the USB to serial conversion. If we had a facepalm emoji, we’d use it here. An FTDI chip is not Open Source, and they have designed drivers to break chips that aren’t theirs. The design files for the HiFive 1 were made with Altium, a proprietary and non-Free software. This was the best picture for this section of content. Will Stallman ever say the HiFive 1 is Free as in speech? Absolutely not. Instead, the HiFive 1 is an incrementally more Free microcontroller compared to a PIC, ARM, or AVR. There will be people who will argue – over the Internet, using late-model Intel processors with Management Engines — this is insufficient to be called Free and Open Source. To them, I will simply link to the Nirvana fallacy and ask them to point me to a microcontroller that is more Free and Open Source. Let’s not cut down the idea of an Open Source microcontroller because it’s not perfect on the first release. Hardware Teardown So, what’s in the HiFive 1? The spec sheet is simple enough, the datasheet is complete enough,  although there are some caveats: Microcontroller: SiFive Freedom E310 (FE310) CPU: SiFive E31 CPU Architecture: 32-bit RV32IMAC Speed: 320+ MHz (the stock frequency seems to be about 256 MHz, this can be changed) Performance: 1.61 DMIPs/MHz Memory: 16 KB Instruction Cache, 16 KB Data Scratchpad Other Features: Hardware Multiply/Divide, Debug Module, Flexible Clock Generation with on-chip oscillators and PLLs Operating Voltage: 3.3 V and 1.8 V Input Voltage: 5 V USB or 7-12 VDC Jack IO Voltages: Both 3.3 V or 5 V supported Digital I/O Pins: 19 PWM Pins: 9 SPI Controllers/HW CS Pins: 1/3 External Interrupt Pins: 19 External Wakeup Pins: 1 Flash Memory: 128 Mbit Off-Chip (ISSI SPI Flash) Host Interface (microUSB): Program, Debug, and Serial Communication Basically, the HiFive 1 is the SiFive FE310 microcontroller packaged in an Arduino Uno form factor. The pin spacing is just as stupid as it’s always been, and there is support for a few Adafruit shields sitting around in the SDK. There are no analog pins, but there are two more PWM pins compared to the standard Arduino chip. The Arduino Uno and Leonardo have 32 kilobytes of Flash, while the HiFive 1 has sixteen Megabytes of Flash on an external SOIC chip. The HiFive 1 supports 3.3 and 5V I/O, thanks to three voltage level translators. The support for 5V logic is huge in my opinion — nearly every dev board manufacturer has already written off 5V I/O as a victim of technological progress. The HiFive doesn’t, even though the FE310 microcontroller is itself only 3.3V tolerant. It should be noted the addition of the voltage level translators add at least a dollar or two to the BOM, and double that to the final cost of the board. It’s a nice touch, but there’s room for cost cutting here. Other than that, the only other chip of note on the board is the FTDI FT2232HL, a well-supported but most certainly not Free and Open Source USB to UART chip. This is a two-port chip that provides programming, serial, and debug connections simultaneously. Getting Started With The HiFive 1 The folks at SiFive realize documentation and SDKs are necessary to turn a chip into a development board. To that end, they have a bare-metal SDK and support for the Arduino IDE. The board itself comes with a bootloader, and when you plug the HiFive 1 into a USB you get the equivalent of the Blink sketch from the Arduino. Yes, you too can have Open Source blinkies. What a magical time to be alive. Right now there are two methods of programming the HiFive 1. The Freedom E SDK, and the Arduino IDE. The Arduino IDE appears to be dependent on the Freedom E SDK, so either way, you’ll have to get the SDK running. Right now, the SDK only works under Linux (and OS X, and possibly Cygwin), but support for Windows is coming. For Linux users, the getting started guide is more than sufficient, although it will take quite a while (at least 30 minutes) to build all the tools. Once the Freedom E SDK is installed, support for the Arduino IDE pretty much falls into place. You’ll have to futz around with the Boards Manager, but with a few clicks, you get something fantastic. You can blink an LED with Open Source Hardware.  Actually Programming the Thing Blinking an LED is proof enough this can be programmed, but what about the vast SDK we had to install before getting the Arduino IDE working? Here, too, it’s pretty easy to get the SDK up and running: For this example, I simply changed the ‘hello world’ program shipped with the SDK to a ‘hello Hackaday’ program, compiled it, and ran it. Yes, someone as dumb as me can compile and upload a program to the HiFive 1. This Stuff is Still New, Okay? Before receiving the HiFive 1, I originally planned to benchmark this dev board against other small, common dev boards. The SDK comes with a Dhrystone program, making this the obvious choice. The results were not good, but this isn’t a reflection of the power of the FE310 microcontroller. Allow me to present the shocking infographic you should not pay attention to: Ignore this infographic This test used this Dhrystone Arduino sketch with the Arduino Micro, HiFive 1, and the Teensy 3.6. As you would expect the Arduino Micro performed poorly (but still ten times faster than a mainframe from 1988), and the Teensy 3.6 was extremely fast. According to this benchmark, the HiFive 1 did terribly at barely twice the computing power of the Arduino while running 16 times faster. If this benchmark was accurate, it would immediately spell the end of the RISC-V ISA. The above benchmark is not accurate, and the poor Dhrystone performance was due to incorrect assumptions about the timer’s frequency. I plopped this problem up on the SiFive forums, and a patch was available in a few hours. What does the real benchmark say? That’s a fast microcontroller. RISC architecture is gonna change everything. I love this test. Beginning this review, I originally planned to run a few benchmarks on an Arduino, a Teensy, and the HiFive 1, throw together a graph and spend a hundred or so words on the results.  I got so much more. Right off the bat, we can see the HiFive 1 is fast. Really, really fast. Right now, if you want to build a huge RGB LED display, you have one good option: the Teensy 3.6. If you need a microcontroller to pump a lot of data out, the Teensy has the power, the memory, and the libraries to do it easily. In this small but very demanding use case, the HiFive 1 might be better. The HiFive 1 has more Flash (although it’s an SPI Flash), it has DMA, and it has roughly twice the processing power as the Teensy 3.6. This could be very, very cool, and I can’t wait to see the real life examples of how much the HiFive 1 can push out of its pins. There’s your hundred word review on the performance of the HiFive 1 based on synthetic benchmarks. However, getting this benchmark working revealed far more about the state of the HiFive’s software, and how much support SiFive is throwing at it. Admittedly, I do have a very early version of this board, and the CrowdSupply campaign for the HiFive 1 was only funded last week. No one would expect one of the three demo apps shipped with a newly released board with a mature architecture to be completely broken (unless it’s an Allwinner chip, but whatever). Very few people would expect the devs to get a patch out in less than 24 hours in response to a random person on a support forum. All of this circles back to a single observation on the HiFive 1: It’s new. The HiFive 1 and all RISC-V microcontrollers don’t have a vast market share, user base, or decades of work behind them. However, the SiFive team seems to be taking their work seriously. They’re fixing the problems they have, and they’re constantly pushing out new documentation. This is great, and a very good indication of how much support the RISC-V chips from SiFive will have. Chips As A Service I should note that the folks at SiFive aren’t in the business of building RISC-V Arduino boards. They’re in the business of making chips for people. This is custom silicon we’re talking about here. The easiest parallel to draw is between SiFive and OSH Park. These companies don’t have their own manufacturing capability; the value is in connecting end users (engineers, startups) to manufacturers. OSH Park connects you to a board house that really knows purple, and SiFive connects you to a chip fab. In the case of the FE310, that’s TSMC. For anyone who wants silicon you can study, this is great. No, it’s not as simple as sending a board off to a fab house, but it’s a start. The fact that SiFive chose to start with Open Hardware is great, and we can’t wait to see the other hardware made with their sweat and hydrofluoric acid. Update: You can already get your hands on the RTL for the SiFive chips if you want to run the cores on your own FPGA. It’s a Beginning At the base level, the HiFive 1 is a powerful microcontroller with a lot of Flash, with support for hundreds of Arduino libraries. That’s great, and alone this might be worth the $60 price of admission. However, the big story here is the Openness of the HiFive 1. Is it completely open? No. the HiFive 1 itself uses an FTDI chip, and I’ve heard rumor and hearsay the FE310 chip has proprietary bits that are ultimately inconsequential to the function of the chip. A strict interpretation of Open Hardware will not allow this board to be called Open Hardware. Those who advance this interpretation are dumb, and to counter this argument I will quote the man himself: …We need to distinguish levels in the design of a digital product (and maybe some other kinds of products). The circuit that connects the chips is one level; each chip’s design is another level. In an FPGA, the interconnection of primitive cells is one level, while the primitive cells themselves are another level. In the ideal future we will want the design to be free at all levels. Under present circumstances, just making one level free is a significant advance. – Richard M. Stallman, Free Hardware And Free Hardware Designs A design that fails to be completely Open does not deserve to be grouped with designs that are explicitly closed. Nevertheless, this is the best we have so far, and it is only the beginning. We’re going to have more microcontrollers that are more Open, but until then, the HiFive 1 is actually a pretty cool board.

I had to do a double-take at that second performance graph, though… at first I was thinking “oh, with the fixed test it’s still only half as powerful as a Teensy?”, before I realized that the green and purple bars had switched places. Report comment Reply daid303 says: January 5, 2017 at 2:10 pm While it is showing great performance. It is a bit apples vs oranges. As the chips run at vastly different frequencies. Score per Mhz is: AVR: 0.631 Teensy: 1.239 HiFive: 1.557 Which also isn’t a really good comparison. But it still comes out on top. Next interesting metric, MIPS per Watt. Report comment Reply Traumflug says: January 6, 2017 at 3:45 am As soon as you show me an ATmega or a Cortex-M0 running at 260 MHz I’ll perfectly agree. Until then, achievable clock frequencies are part of the performance equitation. Report comment Reply H3g3m0n (@H3g3m0n) says: January 8, 2017 at 12:52 pm I would prefer to see a RISC-V underclocked to M0 speeds and blowing the MIPS per watt out of the water myself. No reason we can’t have the best of both worlds ☺ Report comment Reply MINIMAN10000 says: January 6, 2017 at 7:24 am I second the interest in MIPS per Watt. But I still think HiFive having more MIPS per cycle while simultaneously having a higher frequency is still impressive. Both metrics are interesting and useful in their own way.

Report comment Reply Tucson Tom says: January 5, 2017 at 10:21 am I guess I just miss the point with open hardware, whereas I have been fully on board with open software for a long long time. The only “open” I need from hardware is good documentation. Report comment Reply ehud42 says: January 5, 2017 at 10:53 am The article covered the a good reason for “open” hardware – licenses. An open hardware design can be fabbed by anyone. This means: lots of (potential) competition around manufacturing to drive cost down. When mainstream manufacturers stop producing, design can easily (from a legal/copyright/license point of view) be sent to someone else to produce a custom run. The other reason is presumably “open” means a better chance at looking into the guts at what makes it tick. This is a bit strawman, as I certainly won’t audit hardware, but someone might. “open” should mean nothing hiding behind NDAs and protective fuses. So, no clever NSA inserted firmware, etc. Report comment Reply Ostracus says: January 5, 2017 at 11:07 am https://counterespionage.worldsecuresystems.com/the-great-seal-bug-part-1.html I think the “Great Seal Bug” demonstrated, one shouldn’t underestimate the cleverness of the intelligence community. Report comment Reply JohnU says: January 6, 2017 at 2:27 am ^ This. It’s no problem whatsoever to insert some subtle bug or backdoor at the fab.

Report comment Reply Nova says: January 7, 2017 at 11:39 pm I shudder in horror when I think what sort of intelligence the NSA is extracting from my RGB led driven by a micro.

Report comment Dax says: January 5, 2017 at 12:42 pm “An open hardware design can be fabbed by anyone.” …with enough money to hire a semiconductor fab and the resources to handle a production run of a million units to make it “cheap”. Report comment Reply awjlogan says: January 5, 2017 at 1:06 pm Yes, that’s the rub here and I think software people often don’t appreciate the costs and logistics involved in getting hardware made. You don’t get a chance to go roll out a bug fix or update after release, and you don’t get your money back if it all goes wrong. There’s a very limited number of fabs in the world, and a very limited number of competent designers so competition will be low. Fabs won’t be falling over themselves to compete, even for 1M units. Contrast that with the software world where the barriers to market are essentially zero. I certainly support the effort but, as an aside, can a chip outsourced for manufacture ever be considered totally secure/open? If the fab were lent on by a large agency, for example, to put in some backdoors after design submission, the end user wouldn’t know about unless they had physical access to the die and the time to go through all the logic. Possibly a contrived scenario, but you don’t have the same transparency as compared to software where you have everything visible to you. Report comment Reply Tucson Tom says: January 5, 2017 at 1:17 pm This was exactly my thought. If you are deep into tin foil hats and/or worrying about your terrorist cell getting uncovered then I see the point of looking for back doors. But for purposes of being able to “screw with stuff”, which is what open source is all about for me, the issue is that I don’t have a semiconductor fab here in my garage. So for me an FPGA is the only path to “open hardware”. Report comment Reply Steven Gann says: January 5, 2017 at 7:01 pm The difficulty of manufacture doesn’t diminish the value of open source hardware. Frankly, I avoid compiling open source software at all costs, but I still prefer using open source software. Report comment Reply awjlogan says: January 6, 2017 at 12:06 am I think it does though, particularly for semiconductors. The beauty of open software is that anyone can get involved, and it’s possible to rapidly iterate through versions and ideas with zero added cost, other than time, no NRE costs, and those changes can be instantly spread across millions of users. The design of hardware is inherently much more conservative: it has to be correct first (ideally!) time, each run typically has substantial NRE costs, and getting a new design out is intrinsically physical. Further, the cost of the tools used to design semiconductors place it far out of reach of the vast majority, even if they did know how to use them. Open sourcing your projects is one thing, maybe you’d spend £100s, maybe £1000s for more complex designs, but for semiconductors at chip scale you’re talking £Ms. Report comment mac012345 says: January 6, 2017 at 8:16 am In fact ARM license costs are so low that open hardware like risc-V are mostly irrelevant cost-wise. The real advantage is to have an opensource core you can modify at will on the ISA level, which is something you can’t do on a std arm core. Report comment Reply MadMike says: January 6, 2017 at 10:50 am “The real advantage is to have an opensource core you can modify at will on the ISA level, which is something you can’t do on a std arm core.” This is a bit misleading. Yes you can technically modify the ISA, but unless you have millions upon millions of dollars to spend you will never get to actually use those changes. Calling it the first open source mcu doesn’t sound right to me. OpenCores have had fully open designs for a long time. While a slightly more open design is certainly a step in right direction, let’s not call it something it’s not. What the world desperately needs isn’t yet another open source ISA. Instead it’s massive reductions in semiconductor fab costs. Report comment daid303 says: January 5, 2017 at 2:14 pm Audit is not the only reason to look at the guts. We recently had a pretty nasty encounter with an I2C slave chip, which would randomly lock up the bus. And it is a major problem for us. We contacted the manufacturer (NXP). However, the end result is “we also do not know why this is happening. Try to add a delay at point X, maybe then your problem is gone” Insight in the chip would give us a chance to actually find the root cause instead of random guessing and hoping for the best. Report comment Reply Cozmo says: January 7, 2017 at 9:11 am You do know slaves are allowed to clock stretch? Also monitor the transients between the ground plane and the I2C pins to make sure the bus is not being glitched by interference. Report comment Reply Pat says: January 11, 2017 at 7:04 am Slaves (or masters in a multi-master setup) locking up the I2C bus definitely happens. This is a major reason why SMBus was developed in the first place, because the lack of timeout functionality seriously hampers the reliability of I2C. The only way a slave actually clock-stretches is if it’s doing some kind of external activity, which means there’s always a possibility for something to go horribly wrong.

I don’t expect every consumer of these chips to have the expertise to do this, but that is how open source functions; there is someone out there, either at SiFive or elsewhere, who will look and see if the silicon matches the design. Report comment Reply awjlogan says: January 6, 2017 at 10:41 am That’s a pretty difficult thing to do – logic looks like logic looks like logic, and it’s incredibly hard to look in – multiple metal layers, buried/blind vias etc. Unless you have an very good (read: experienced, expensive, and well equipped) audit team, this is not going to happen. Sure, gross changes are visible, but one could modify things discretely so it would be very hard to track down changes, especially when you’re talking millions of transistors.

Report comment RandyP says: January 5, 2017 at 11:41 am TL;DR: It seems to me that open hardware offers many of the same benefits as open software, although to (at present) a much smaller group of people. My 2¢: Yes, but how often is the documentation good enough? And isn’t the advantage of anything open that anyone can contribute to debugging it? Anyone with the know-how can look at the design and offer input on how to fix or improve it. Or fork it and make it themselves, with the help of orgs like HiFive and OSH Park etc. And it seems like you get the same potential security benefits from open hw that you do with open sw, in the case of eventually building a fully open computer. If each chip can be independently vetted, you know that none of them are doing things under the covers that you don’t want them to do. Of course I suppose one big difference here is that the set of people who can develop software is vastly larger than the set of people who can develop a microcontroller. So it’s harder to get that large number of independent reviewers. But there again, actually having a working open hardware design can also be a teaching tool for those of us who learn best by seeing examples. Someone could put together a pretty informative course on microcontroller design just by going through the design of the Freedom E310, explaining how it works, discussing strengths and weaknesses, etc. Report comment Reply RandyP says: January 5, 2017 at 11:45 am Apparently I confused the openness of RISC-V and openness of the Freedom E310.

Report comment Reply Perry Harrington says: January 5, 2017 at 10:40 am Sorry, but merely releasing an instruction set specification is far from being an “Open Source Microcontroller”. I’d Argue that the Parallax Propeller 1 and 2 are more open source, they actually release the *HDL files under the MIT license! This whole RISC-V thing smells like marketing propaganda. From the little I can glean in 60 seconds of giving a crap, it’s an instruction set designed by some powerful companies, released into the “open source” so they all can build, or source, chips that will carry a common instruction set for the IoT and/or cloud computing plans. I would speculate that “open source” was not an objective, driving down their costs by not paying for ARM or x86 processors was their objective.

Many of the other PIC32 cores do 1.25 Mips/Mhz or 0.9 depending on the model. This chip is only 1.55 Mips/Mhz… so it is good but not best in class. And it potentially uses more power as well. Report comment Reply Kevin Harrelson says: January 5, 2017 at 12:51 pm I can guarantee you that it will use more power. Modern processors are made in such volume that it makes sense to run them in the most cost-effective process, which seems to be 28nm right now. That works great when you are making millions of parts. This part, on the other hand, is made using a 130nm process (roughly 20 times bigger, and a lot more power). You will never see parity on power until this part is made using a more modern process. However, power and IPC are not really the goals here — openness is.

Report comment Kevin Harrelson says: January 6, 2017 at 10:05 am A larger process generally DOES mean a higher power process. There are tricks that you can do to minimize this (power islands, voltage/frequency scaling, etc.). So, a larger process, properly designed, can indeed be lower power than a smaller process where they did not put in the effort. However, all things being equal, smaller = lower power. Well, lower DYNAMIC power. This is the power that scales with frequency. Simply stated, power, is related to charging and discharging of gate capacitance. Smaller geometry = smaller capacitance, and shorter wires from source to destination. Simply physics. Where smaller geometry hurts, however, is in leakage. That is the amount of power consumed just by applying voltage to the power pins, even in the absence of a clock. There are techniques to control this, however, such as using transistors with different threshold voltages. You do have a point about some chips using larger geometries. Microchip, which you mentioned, (and who I currently work for), owns some of their own fabs. However, these tend to be older ones with larger geometries. There can be cost savings going with your own fabs vs. sending work to places like TSMC and UMC. However, my point still, in general, stands. The cheapest transistors are right around the 28nm mark. However, this assumes a relatively large design. You need a certain amount of space for the IO ring to handle all of the pins on the chip. Simply stated, the number of IO pads determines the minimum size of your chip. Even if transistors shrink, the pads that wire-bond machines have to hook wires up to are not shrinking. So, shrinking your geometry will not reduce your die size below that point (that is called “IO bound”). In that case, going to smaller features will not save you money. Note that the cheapest transistors being 28nm is just for manufacturing. That does not include the design cost. For smaller volumes, larger transistors can be much cheaper just do to the decrease in mask costs. Report comment gh0stwriter88 says: January 6, 2017 at 10:24 am As you say a larger geometry may also be less IO bound and thus cheaper as not all designs need that many transistors… my point earlier was that going to a smaller geometry does not guarantee lower power… neither does doing lots of tricks guarantee that you can beat a smaller unoptimised geometry … in short making generalizations and assumptions are bad. I think things will get more interesting ones optical interconnects become more of a thing…. making designs less IO bound. Report comment halherta says: January 8, 2017 at 11:05 am @kevin….from the datasheet it seems that the manufacturing process for this microcontroller is actually 180nm not 130nm…..For comparison, TI’s Tiva C microcontrollers use a 65nm process and many of the stm32 microcontroller utilize the 90nm process. So I imagine that power consumption for the siFive would be at least 1.5X/2X as large as that of these two microcontrollers….which is still not bad given that it is open and developed by a much smaller company. https://dev.sifive.com/hifive1/freedom-e310-g000-manual/ I’d switch to siFive1 from stm32 in a second if it gets some analog peripherals like an analog comparator & ADC, and if they use at least a 90nm process.

A seperate controller (or two, as a form of northbridge like role) could take the data encoded addresses and pull the appropriate address buses high/low and or map hardware into said address space (Via another Virtual machine acting as a peripheral controller hub) and then pass data/control-signals/etc.. A bit of a hack job. As for the VM side of things, think like that project posted around here that ran Linux on an avr or something… With external RAM slapped onto it.

Report comment Reply Redhatter (VK4MSL) says: January 5, 2017 at 2:32 pm What’s the bet the FTDI controller chip will disappear the moment some smart cookie gets a port of V-USB going on RISC-V? This is just the beginning. Report comment Reply davedarko says: January 5, 2017 at 2:56 pm First time I see early bird boards being more expensive o.O Report comment Reply RÖB says: January 5, 2017 at 4:08 pm Talk about poisoning their own namespace! This is a total mess of confusion. We have a board and it has *something* to do with an open source micro-controller???? OK what’s the board – it’s either a si-five of a hi-five. I did read what it was and these two thing are impossible to confuse NOT!!!!!!!!! OK, then what’s the micro-controller – well it’s one of the above, I think it’s a hi-five cos that the name used. BUT wait hi-five is just an organisation or something and the micro-controller is NOT si-five or hi-five and si-five just an instruction set architecture that is open source and not the micro-controller per-say. And if you google for the hardware architecture of this implementation then you find that the haystack is full of needles relating to the the Instruction set *architecture* and not the hardware architectural so you are looking for one specific needle in a tone of needs instead of a haystack. Then you find some PDF’s embedded into some web pages but the print is too small to read and you want to have a quick look for the number of GPIO’s but there is no really really basic pinout so instead you have to scroll through pages of hard to read print of the pin *descriptions* to try to keep a mental tally of the GPIO’s. Seriously …. Good – HTML web page that has been converted FROM a PDF Fair – PDF available for download Crap – Embedded PDF’s Good – Documentation that has an overview and basic information at the start Fair – Documentation that has basic information close to that start Crap – Documentation that has no overview so you don’t know if it’s about a uC or South African desert crabs. Good – Names that make it clear what they are. Fair – Names that give some idea about what they are. Crap – Names that are so similar that it’s inherently likely that you will confuse them and are so non-descriptive that you don’t know if they an organisation, hardware implementation, or micro-controller Good – Not poisoning your competitors namespace. Fair – Poisoning your competitors namespace after they poison your namespace. Dumb as Fu(k – Poisoning your own name space. With what I did find when I looked because this chip might be good for hardware control (3Dx) – Good – Chip that has good performance even perhaps to run a simple OS Fair – A bit of a limitation with RAM – no bigie for hardware controll Bad – Arduino Uno form factor with not enough GPIO Seriously I hope this project does well but I seriously doubt it will because of the tragic use of namespace – hey guys – the internet – it’s real you know. Report comment Reply RÖB says: January 5, 2017 at 4:09 pm TL;DR My frustration with trying to find information about this board and uC (because namespace) is directly proportional to the length of the above post.

Although I have great respect for people that make it, all I can find is hype, more hype and shallow technical background doc/spec. It say that is Open source but its really act more like patent pending, close source solution from start-up company that want to establish theirs own new ecosystem and (in future) sell good on stock market. I hope time and theirs future efforts will prove me wrong, but right now it sound, and look like hollow story. Report comment Reply Miroslav says: January 5, 2017 at 4:34 pm Good effort and I’m hoping that this will go somewhere. If we could have a chip that would not be obsoleted at the manufacturer’s whim, that alone would be worth it. Report comment Reply chango says: January 6, 2017 at 6:33 am Sadly that’s never going to happen. NRE on silicon is pretty large, and any manufacturer is going to want special sauce in the peripheral set to lock you into their SoC line. Case in point: ARM Cortex-M had us all convinced that a common core standard and some standards for libraries would save the world from SoC vendor lock-in. It did succeed in causing more manufacturers to shy away from proprietary tools. But there’s still no such thing as second sourcing ARM SoCs. Report comment Reply zerg says: January 6, 2017 at 12:17 pm Do you and your open source buddies have millions at your disposal to ensure this doesn’t happen. Remember fabbing the chip is very expensive. BTW there are 3rd party manufacturers that still manufacture those micros that have been obsoleted by their OEM’s. So far releases like this are irrelevant. The small business owner who wants to sell a low cost product can’t afford a crippled micro that sells for $50 or so.while they can buy a ARM micro for the less than the cost of a soda. I’ll get interested when it has the same peripheral set as a M3 ARM and on board flash and is price competitive with the offerings from ARM and Microchip. Right now this micro is for fashionistas and social posturing. Report comment Reply Greenaum says: January 5, 2017 at 7:36 pm The FTDI chip isn’t really relevant. It’s just a way of getting a dev board out into the world quickly. They can surely replace it with something else when they’ve got the time to work on that. Considering this is brand new silicon, FTDI is a good idea, since it’s use is known and understood, as opposed to the Chinese knockoff thing cheap Arduinos use. Using the FTDI means they’ve got a known-good USB interface, so it’s less likely to hit them with some obscure bug down the line, which might have happened with some other USB interface. Best to get everything else on the board as reliable as possible, while the silicon itself is still a new design. For now it’s not relevant, what’s relevant is the new chip itself. In a little while, I’m sure they can change it for something cheaper, from a company less hated and evil. And if they don’t, some enterprising Italian can do it instead, because it’s open hardware. Report comment Reply Eletrax says: January 6, 2017 at 12:04 am Finally a well placed opinion! This anti FTDI rant is like debating over whether it is kosher to use any semiconductors in a tube amplifier. If it makes you feel better.. One thing FTDI has for sure is that it just works well, provided your supply chain doesn’t suck, so you can focus on other more important things. Report comment Reply pelrun says: January 6, 2017 at 3:18 am It’s important to hold FTDI’s feet to the fire. They did some extremely user-hostile actions, and the only way to stop it happening again is to make sure the PR fallout is long-lasting. It also serves to warn off other manufacturers who may have considered doing similar things. That doesn’t necessarily mean they should be boycotted forever, but it’s history that shouldn’t be forgotten.

Unfortunately, this was slightly derailed by the fact that it appears there are, in fact, CH340 clones out there and they’re really rather buggy. (Initialization command does not function as expected, register writes need to be paired up in exactly the pairs it’s expecting, probably other bugs.) Report comment rasz_pl says: January 10, 2017 at 1:26 am there are alternatives other than CH340, for example silabs CP2102/4 Report comment chango says: January 6, 2017 at 6:36 am Not in this case it isn’t. FT2232H has two separate channels, with one acting as USB-UART and the other as a USB-GPIO for JTAG. And it’s USB-HS. The CH340 may be a fine UART, but it doesn’t take the place of the FT2232H as a quick and dirty USB debugger that isn’t dependent on firmware.

Verilog and VHDL should really be buried as some netlist languages. For some reason they stripped the tests, which are essential in a hw design, so for me even the software design is only partially open-source.

Lot’s of debate on the value of open hardware. First, yes, it will probably be a long time if ever before we can ever fab chips at home meaning the same kind of easy user modifications that happen in software are unavailable as a fabbed chip. You can still do that in FPGA though and I would expect that good changes which are shared upstream would eventually make it onto a fabbed chip. Second, that’s not the only value of open source. I like open source software because once something reaches some critical mass of ‘community’ size it or something totally compatible with it is likely to be around for a very very long time. I like my Linux that still has drivers for the old crap parts piled in my garage and can still read the filesystems on the storage devices. I like my programs that can still read the files I wrote as a kid with no artifacts due to imperfect conversions. You only get support with closed stuff so long as there is a strong monetary incentive for a company to continue supporting it.

Report comment Reply Nick Sargeant says: January 9, 2017 at 5:41 am What I would like to see is an open source credit-card format processing engine, that behaves somewhat like an INMOS Transputer of old that I could build up over time with an array of cards to be my own parallel processing machine. I met Parsytec at CeBIT in Hannover many years ago when they were demonstrating a PowerPC based machine to replace their T800 engine. I think they intended to go with T9000, but that failed to arrive. Maybe what sold me on it was the fantastic industrial design they had – it really did look the biz (google for the Parsytec Power Xplorer). That and they were a PowerPC customer (albeit Motorola, and not IBM) when I was in IBMs OEM division, trying to sell bits of IBM technology to other companies. Given that was 20 years ago or more, they were hampered by available technology in terms of the resources that could be made available to each node (like 32MB RAM for instance). We could do hundreds of times better now with lower cost, less energy required and hopefully slightly more mature software tools. I always thought that if we standardised on a card format, I could just add to it over time as technology matures, relegate first generation cards to I/O operations and control computers, have a reconfigurable fabric of engines that could address real-world HPC-style problems, like cracking genomes, or providing radiologists with computer aided detection of possible cancers in DICOM imaging. Report comment Reply Jovan Ivković says: January 10, 2017 at 4:29 pm If we you just change title from “Hands On With …Microcontroller” to “…SoC RISC development board system in Arduino form factor” whole this story will be more relevant and much truer. Although documentation and Block diagrams for E3 Coreplex and Freedom E300 SoC shows ADC and DAC block elements in design (http://files.linuxgizmos.com/sifive_e300_block.jpg), in this design based on FE310 there ware omitted, WHY is the real question? So, if someone could make a serious and thorough review of that device (Dev.board, SoC, ports etc.) its operation, architecture in a proper technically minded way? I am sure that we all will be more then thankful for that. Report comment Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

Origin PC's custom, professional overclocking will push your Kaby Lake chip past 5GHz Overclockers, start your engines. Brad Chacos (PC World (US online)) on 06 January, 2017 04:00 0 - - - - print email Intel’s new Kaby Lake desktop processors may not be huge improvements over their Skylake predecessors in terms of raw speed, but they’ve got it where it counts in one enthusiast-friendly area: overclocking. Before Kaby Lake’s launch, two PC makers and a motherboard vendor told us that the chips overclocked to the vaunted 5GHz milestone with shocking regularity. Now the high-end custom PC builder Origin is putting its (and your) money where its mouth is. Origin’s has offered professional overclocking as a $75 option in its systems for a while, and now the builder is touting that Kaby Lake desktops chips will go up to—and potentially over—the 5GHz barrier. Hot, hot, hot, hot damn. Intel’s chips haven’t hit such lofty heights since the Sandy Bridge days and the Core i7-2600K. Since then, Intel’s processors usually tap out around the 4.5GHz mark. While the current wording for Origin’s professional overclocking doesn’t guarantee a set frequency due to the silicon lottery—promising only that “Origin PC’s award winning system integrators will overclock your processor and squeeze out every last megahertz” with every overclock “stringently tested and benchmarked for ensured stability”—the company must feel darn confident to market that 5GHz number in big, bold numbers in a press release. And that confidence is underscored by Origin’s free lifetime 24/7 tech support for every system it sells. Gordon Mah Ung The Origin PC Chronos. Backing up Origin’s boldness, Asus separately told PCWorld that “through rigorous testing, ASUS engineers have fine-tuned a profile that allows Kaby Lake CPUs to overclock to 5GHz with an 80 percent success rate” on its motherboards. Falcon Northwest also sent us a small form-factor PC that ran rock-solid at 5GHz—which let the four-core Core i7-7700K match a six-core Broadwell-E “Extreme Edition” chip in performance in Cinebench’s multi-threaded benchmark, and beat all comers in single-threaded performance. Maybe Origin isn’t so crazy after all. Kaby Lake overclocking could be the Real Deal, folks. Enthusiasts, start your engines—and grab your liquid-coolers.

It includes all the elements of a typical PC, including Intel SoC, memory, storage and wireless connectivity with flexible I/O options. Intel is working with a range of partners who can optimize Compute Card for their particular solutions – from interactive refrigerators and smart kiosks to security cameras and IoT gateways. Just slightly longer than a credit card at 95mm x 55mm x 5mm, and with a range of processor families in the works, the Intel Compute Card offers an optimal solution to power everything from entry-level to full featured host devices. Intel has mentioned that all latest Intel processors up to 6W can be built into Compute Card. Device makers simply design a standard Intel Compute Card slot into their device and then utilize the best Intel Compute Card for their performance and price needs. For example, consider you have bought an expensive OLED TV with a dual-core processor, 2GB RAM and 500GB storage. After two years, if you need 4GB RAM and 1TB storage, instead of replacing your OLED TV, you can just remove the existing Compute Card and replace it with a powerful new one. Features: Includes built-in integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth® wireless connectivity. Save on engineering and design costs with a standardized I/O interface designed to support multiple devices. Equipped with a range of processors, including 7th Gen Intel® Core™ vPro™ processor, to handle the toughest computing needs. Low wattage computing with cooling integrated in the dock. Whether installed internally or inserted externally, the compute card remains secure via an integrated locking mechanism. Reduce the number of SKUs to manage through compute card enabled devices. Scale quickly when demand dictates. Simply add a compute card to any certified device to increase its compute capabilities and lifecycle. Hardware replacement is as simple as swapping the existing compute card for a new one. Intel is working with a wide range of partners who share their vision and these partners are working to develop products that can take advantage of the simplified design, ease of serviceability and user upgradeability of the Intel Compute Card. Intel’s global partners include Dell, HP, Lenovo and Sharp. In addition, Intel is working with a range of regional partners like Seneca Data, InFocus, DTx, TabletKiosk and Pasuntech. The Intel Compute Card will be available in mid-2017 and will come with a range of processors options, including the latest 7th Gen Intel Core processors.  Intel will reveal more details about Compute Card and its pricing in 2Q 2017.

(Photo : Photo by David Ramos/Getty Images) The future is bright for Macs after Intel introduced their 7th Gen Intel Kaby Lake processors some of which are suitable for future Mac desktops and MacBooks.  The Intel Kaby Lake processors for desktops offer reasonable performance and this has been proven true since its release August last year. Users have seen how promising it was, especially its video engine, which is the main focus of the processors without a big impact on battery life. As for Intel Kaby Lake processors future use on Macs, Intel said that the new chips will increase its performance delivery by up to 20 percent in gaming notebooks and 25 percent for desktops, 9to5 Mac reported. The following Intel core chips and U-series chips will surely make its way to the future MacBooks and Mac desktops:  Intel Kaby Lake processors with Intel Iris Plus graphics  Intel Kaby Lake processors with Intel vPro technology  Intel Xeon processors for mobile workstations  H-series chips for high-performance laptops and battery life  Y-series chips made for detachable with focus on high-performance and battery life  S-series for desktop systems Meanwhile, the U-series chips are designed for ultra-thin notebooks and 2 in 1 convertibles that will enhance productivity and creativity without sacrificing the battery life. Unlike any other processors, the U-series processors can provide up to 10-hour battery life. This year's Intel Kaby Lake processors are optimized to meet consumer's expectations and needs. The processor's major update is on video decoder/encoder block, then there's improvement on the Speed Shift technology which was originally introduced by Skylake, a feature that allows the CPU to complete tasks as fast as possible, PC Gamer reported. What's more interesting is the fact that the new Intel chips will support Optane memory which will make the system faster with limited trade-offs from a system perspective said the director of mobile platform marketing at Intel, Karen Regis.

Image Credit: Dean Takahashi Advanced Micro Devices is taking a swing at Intel with its new Ryzen desktop processors, and it’s going after Nvidia with its new Radeon Instinct artificial intelligence processors. After playing catch-up for years, Sunnyvale, California-based AMD is back on the offensive. Lisa Su, CEO of AMD, and Raja Koduri, senior vice president of AMD’s Radeon Technologies Group, hope that their efforts will reinvigorate competition in the computer industry. The Ryzen desktop computer chips, which use AMD’s Zen core designs, will debut in the first quarter. And the new Radeon Instinct machine intelligence chips will debut during the first half of 2017. AMD says the Ryzen chips are 40 percent faster per clock cycle than the previous generation, and Su is confident that it will beat Intel’s fastest desktop processors on a variety of fronts. And she’s still confident that 2017 will bring great things for the company, and that “AMD is back.” I sat down with Su and Koduri at an AMD event in Sonoma, California. Here’s an edited transcript of our interview. Above: AMD’s new Ryzen processor brand. Image Credit: AMD VentureBeat: It looked to me like phasing the graphics strategy in here—you’ve taken care of graphics, and now you’re taking care of AI. Is it a kind of one-bite-at-a-time strategy? Lisa Su: We view graphics as very strategic over the next five to 10 years. When we started with the road map, it was, “Consumer graphics is very important. It’s a core user base for us.” That was Polaris this year. But, no question, our plan was always to compete across the entire graphics end-to-end space. The next phase is compute and making sure we have a very competitive hardware and software platform. VB: Was that a resource allocation strategy? Raja Koduri: We definitely have graphics as a focus, a continued focus, a lot of investment on that side. But on the compute side, we had to build up infrastructure. That enormous software stack I showed you, we’ve been working on that. To go to market we needed the right software stack. The timing is now. It all happened to coincide with having the MI25 and the Vega architecture. The pieces are falling together for us in 2017. We have a lot of work to do in graphics still. We haven’t taken care of it. We have a lot more opportunity, if you look at the size of the market and the dollars that are still there. We have a lot more to grow in graphics alone. Compute is exciting, though. It’s great that we finally have a compelling software stack that goes along with our hardware. VB: These look like great accomplishments, Zen and Vega. Do you know yet how good they’re going to be for you, though, given the competitive picture? Does this possibly take us back to the days of Opteron, when AMD had a competitive advantage? Or do you have to wait and see where Intel and Nvidia will come in? Su: Let me comment on Zen and Raja can comment on Vega. We know what the competitive market is like, very well. We believe, whether you’re talking about desktop or servers, there are portions of the market that are not served well by the products that are there today. I absolutely believe we’ll grow share. We’ll see how much we grow as the products roll out. But we feel very good about where we are. Above: Radeon Instinct. Image Credit: AMD Koduri: We definitely know where we are right now, and the competitive trajectories. We always count on competition executing well. The great thing that you’re seeing in the 2016 momentum, and also going into 2017, is that we’re competing and fighting in every segment. We’re not leaving any segment to the competition. That’s how we think about 2017. We’re going into every segment. The excitement with Vega is that we’re getting back into the high end of the graphics segment. In 2016 we didn’t have any coverage there. VB: It looks like you have a very competitive product in the same space as Nvidia. Do you think you’re going to come to care as much about things like self-driving cars as Nvidia does today? Is that a little further down the road? Koduri: Like I say, we definitely care about all applications of machine intelligence. Our approach is going to be different. We’re not going to take Nvidia’s approach. Our approach will be very focused on key customers and key enabling of those customers. The amazing thing, is that the technology we’re building to scale for the data center, 90 percent of those same things are required for machine intelligence in the auto industry. There’s some additional stuff in terms of qualifications, robustness of the hardware, some certifications and all that we’ll have to do on top of that. But the base infrastructure is there. We want to go into these markets in a very focused manner. AMD, in the past, had many great initiatives. One of the things Lisa keeps us grounded on is, how do we go and execute on a vertical, enable a customer, and then go on to the next one? Rather than going too broad and not having enough focus and enough resources to execute. Above: AMD promises Vega architecture for graphics will scale. Image Credit: AMD VB: We’re probably a little ways away from design announcements? You showed some people with products, but they’re not necessarily — Koduri: On the cloud hyperscale on the compute side, you saw some of the — our current partners have announced their stuff. It’s in their cycle that we announce. We have a lot of good engagement and momentum going on. We’ll see some interesting announcements in 2017. But yes, we’re just going public with our initiative. We’ve been doing a lot of background work and you’ll see the momentum in 2017. Su: You should expect that we’ll have customer design announcements in 2017. VB: Do you see the amount of investment that’s gone into both sides, graphics and Zen, as basically the same? Are these equally ambitious projects as far as manpower? Su: You’re asking me which child I love better, and I’m sitting next to one of them. [laughs] For sure, we’re committed to high performance road maps on both the CPU and the GPU side. I will say, incremental investment in graphics is higher right now. You look at the explosion in the graphics market. It almost has a rebirth going on, not only in terms of consumer but also professional, and now in the data center as well. The incremental investments in graphics around the software and the platform that Raja was talking about are critical for us. Above: AMD’s Ryzen debuts for desktops in the first quarter of 2017. Image Credit: AMD VB: Was it the same years-long effort to get to this point for you guys? Was it coordinated, or did they just happen to appear at the same time, the CPU and GPU? Koduri: To some extent the same core technology, processor technology, drives both CPU roadmap and GPU roadmap. It’s not coincidental in that sense. A new CPU architecture and a new GPU architecture that leverages the CPU node come together in close proximity. I’d say that’s more a factor than anything else. When there’s a new technology node, all of us are excited, CPU guys and GPU guys. We all try to get something new. Su: It’s also fair to say that the data center focus has become a clear priority for us over the last couple of years. Having both the CPU and the GPU road map optimized for compute was very important. Koduri: That’s a huge thing, like I said on stage, that we’re finding with customers, the amount of excitement between the server CPUs and our capabilities there paired up with GPUs. Our customers are telling us, more than us telling them, what the value is there. It’s rare to see that level of excitement from our customers. VB: Qualcomm had their announcement this week as well, with Snapdragon desktop and laptop SKUs at some point. It’s another interesting avenue of competition. Koduri: Right. Hardware is hot again.

Intel CEO Brian Krzanich talked about automated driving, 5G technologies, VR and merged reality technology. He narrated a series of pre-recorded and live VR experiences as 250 people in the audience sat wearing HMDs. Autonomous Driving and 5G Intel plans to buy 15 per cent of the Here digital maps and location services business. On the subject of navigation and transport, Intel and Mobileye will work with BMW to prepare a fleet of about 40 autonomous BMW cars. These vehicles will be used to demonstrate the advances in autonomous driving achieved by the partners. Intel's 5G plans also include automobiles. It introduced Intel GO, a scalable car to cloud system to enhance automated driving. Automakers will be able to implement Intel GO even before 5G networks roll out. Finally, on the topic of 5G, Intel announced the world's first global 5G modem supporting both sub-6GHz bands and mmWave spectrum. This compact, low-power chip kit delivers gigabit speeds and ultra-low latency. It will help 5G connected cars make faster decisions, we were told. Virtual Reality News Conference Intel provided its crowd with 360-degree, 4K video streamed video on their HMDs. The crowd all got to watch a live industrial inspection of a 2,000-acre solar power plant in the Moapa River Indian Reservation. Sending the imagery to the Intel conference was a drone loaded with Orah 4i high-definition cameras and a low-power, high-latency computing solution. Krzanich also showcased the first demonstration of a YOKE VR live sports event streamed with Intel’s virtual reality technology. Intel's Project Alloy all-in-one merged reality solution will hit the market via various OEMs from Q4 this year. For content Intel has partnered with HypeVR, a computer vision company focused on developing ultra-high-resolution live action VR capture and playback with six degrees of freedom. Intel's HypeVR tech collaboration enabled a live action VR exploration of the Ban Gioc waterfall, "one of Vietnam’s most breathtaking natural sights". Cannon Lake demo, Moore's Law "flourishing" Perhaps of most interest to PC enthusiasts was the live on stage demonstration of a Cannon Lake powered PC system. The system utilised one of Intel's 8th generation processors built on the 10nm process. Krzanich introduced the device by saying "for those who are wondering if Moore's Law is alive, is 10 nanometres going to be here, the answer is absolutely yes." On stage the prototype 2-in-1 PC system was demonstrated running and playing a TV commercial featuring Jim Parsons and Michael Phelps. Intel pledged to begin shipping Cannon Lake chips later this year. Intel has only just released Kaby Lake desktop processors and motherboard chipsets. Remember, rival Qualcomm launched its 10nm Snapdragon 835 SoC earlier this week, with devices packing the chip expected to ship before H1 is out.

AMD reveals an army of Ryzen PCs and AM4 motherboards Watch out, Intel. AMD's hotly anticipated Ryzen processor is coming in for landing. Brad Chacos (PC World (US online)) on 05 January, 2017 15:00 0 - - - - print email So far, everything AMD’s shown of its hotly anticipated Ryzen processors hint that they’re the company’s most competitive new CPUs in a long, long time—chips poised to bring the fight back to Intel at the high-end of computing. No processor launches in a vacuum, though. At CES 2017, AMD set the stage for Ryzen’s Q1 2017 launch by revealing 16 high-end motherboards that use the new unified AM4 socket, CPU coolers built for those boards, and another 17 “extreme performance” pre-built PCs designed around Ryzen. I’m scheduled to meet with AMD about these new AM4 motherboards and system designs tomorrow morning, so stay tuned for an update with more pictures and hands-on impressions. For now, let’s dig into what AMD’s already unveiled. AM4 motherboards Both Ryzen and all of AMD’s other new APUs fit into the same motherboard socket, AM4. (Hallelujah!) But those AM4 motherboards won’t all use the same chipset: A more affordable APU system might pair with a motherboard that has modest features, whereas a Ryzen-based PC is likely to require more robust technologies. To that end, AMD’s releasing the X300 and X370 desktop chipsets for Ryzen systems. AMD An ASRock X370 AM4 motherboard. You’ll want an X300 motherboard in a tiny mini-ITX machine, and an X370 in a full-size PC. Both support all of the recent tech being baked into AM4—dual-channel DDR4 memory, NVMe and M.2 SSDs, USB 3.1 Gen 1 and 2, you name it. At CES, AMD will show the following Ryzen boards and APU-focused B350 and A320 desktop motherboards from its partners: ASRock X370 Taichi, ASRock X370 Gaming K4, ASRock AB350 Gaming K4, and ASRock A320M Pro4 Asus B350M-C Biostar X370GT7, Biostar X350GT5, and Biostar X350GT3 Gigabyte GA-AX370-Gaming K5, Gigabyte GA-AX370-Gaming 5, Gigabyte AB350-Gaming 3 and Gigabyte A320M-HD3 MSI A320M Pro-VD, MSI X370 Xpower Gaming Titanium, MSI B350 Tomahawk, and MSI B350M Mortar So far, I’ve managed to get my hands on MSI’s two AM4 motherboards while at their booth today, and the X370 Xpower Gaming Titanium proved particularly noteworthy. It largely follows the design cues of MSI’s high-end Titanium enthusiast motherboards for Intel’s Kaby Lake chips—and that’s a good thing! AMD’s FX processors have lagged behind Intel systems in terms of feature support for a while now, so it’s refreshing to see the latest and greatest technologies on an AMD motherboard. Brad Chacos MSI’s X370 and B350M motherboards in the flesh, or something. AM4 coolers New motherboards do mean new CPU cooler brackets. AMD’s working with 15 vendors on an array of third-party AM4 cooling solutions, but right now, they’re only naming a handful. Noctua Noctua’s NH-D15. Noctua’s highly regarded NH-D15 and its thinner cousin, the NH-U12S, will both become compatible with AM4 motherboards, and EK Waterblocks—beloved by enthusiasts who dig custom hardline liquid-cooling—will release AM4 products as well. If you prefer your liquid-cooling of the dead-simple closed-loop variety, Corsair’s H60, H100i, and H110i will also support AMD’s new platform. Of course, you can also expect to see AMD’s own quiet Wraith cooler make the jump to AM4—especially considering that AMD’s public Ryzen demos featured it. Ryzen PCs AMD A Ryzen-powered PC from Cybertron. Finally, AMD has teamed with boutique PC builders from around the globe to show off Ryzen “dream PCs,” as the company calls them. The lineup ranges—you’ll find an assortment ranging from practical systems to the most exotic, tricked-out builds imaginable. I’m looking forward to checking out some of these firsthand in the morning, but in the meantime, here’s the full list of partners who’ve built Ryzen rigs. (U.S. folks will recognize Origin, CyberPower, Maingear, Cybertron, and iBuyPower.) Caseking CSL – Computer CyberPower PC Cybertron PC IBUYPOWER Icoda (Korea) iPason Wuhan Komplett LDLC Maingear Mayn Wuhan Medion AG Mindfactory Oldi (Russia) Origin PC Overclockers UK PC Specialist Don’t worry if you’ve noticed that the PC makers on this list are of the more specialized variety. AMD says it expects AM4 computers from all the top PC manufacturers when Ryzen launches sometime later this quarter. And nope, AMD still hasn’t said anything more specific about when that is.

In fact, it produced the first Chromebooks all the way back in 2011. Every other major PC manufacturer has jumped on board since then, but Samsung’s have remained among the best options. Now, six years later, Samsung has another first. It’s the first to introduce a Chromebook built from the ground up with Google Play in mind. This initiative, which brings Android apps to Chrome OS, has rolled out as a beta program for a select few models. But Samsung’s Plus and Pro are the first to release with Google Play from the start. Our hands-on time with the Chromebook Pro was very favorable. We like its quality design, high-resolution display, and beefy hardware. But there’s more going on here than just a nice Chromebook. These new systems throw fresh fuel on the fire of competition between ARM-based processors, like those found in phones, and Intel’s x86 chips, found in most Windows laptops. Undercutting Surface Alanna Cotton, the VP of Mobile Computing at Samsung, was careful not to position the new Chromebooks as a direct Surface competitor. She said the focus is on “targeting the Chrome OS lover, who loves ease and simplicity,” but she also admitted the new models are ideal for students and mobile professionals, not least of all because they include an active digitizer stylus. That stylus, shown in demo photos, will be called on to do the same tasks users ask of their Windows 2-in-1s. Cotton spoke to this, saying the pen “works how they work, from classrooms, to the meeting room.” She spoke, both on and off stage, about how it might be used by students to take notes, or by artists to sketch out a concept. Brad Bourque/Digital Trends It’s easy to see why Samsung wouldn’t want to take Surface on directly. The Chromebook Pro and Plus sell for far less, and have less capable hardware. But for certain people – especially the mentioned students and mobile professionals – these Chromebooks fill a similar role. Samsung itself describes the system doing many of the same tasks as a Surface Pro. They would even have a direct Surface competitor, if Microsoft hadn’t abandoned it. Remember the vanilla Surface? It started as an ARM-based system running Windows 8, then transitioned to an Intel x86 processor with the Surface 3, before going out of production. Microsoft couldn’t figure out how to make it appealing without jacking up the price. Making good on ARM’s threat to x86 Apple’s release of the iPad sent real shockwaves through the PC ecosystem. The following CES was clouded by speculation that “Wintel” systems – Windows laptops powered by Intel hardware – might be threatened. Microsoft pulled out of its CES booth a couple shows after, which only encouraged naysayers. Samsung’s Chromebook Plus shouts ‘anything you can do, I can do cheaper.’ Yet the predicted doom never came to pass. PCs sales haven’t been great, but tablets haven’t roared in behind them. Microsoft and Intel remain strong. The threat of ARM-powered computers has come to nothing. But that doesn’t mean the competition is over, and devices like the Chromebook Plus and Pro are exactly the devices that could make this struggle interesting again. It’s ironic, because this device can be had with either. The $450 Chromebook Plus has an ARM chip of Samsung’s design, while the price for the Intel-powered Pro version hasn’t been announced. While Samsung admits the Plus will lag the Pro in multi-tasking and certain demanding workloads, the weaker sibling may end up being the system to get. Think it over. The Plus and Pro run the same apps. The Plus and Pro have the same 2,400 x 1,600 display. They have the same ports, same battery, same keyboard, same touchpad, same stylus. Sure, the Pro may be singing “anything you can do, I can do better.” But many looking to buy a laptop will instead hear the Plus shout “anything you can do, I can do cheaper.” Chromebooks have been met with favorable reception so far, but they haven’t entirely caught on because they lack broad app support, and lack advanced features like a stylus or high-resolution display. The Chromebook Plus addresses these problems. If others take Samsung’s lead, we may see serious competition between Chrome OS and Windows laptops by the end of 2017 – especially in the arena of budget laptops, which is what most people buy.

Andrew Cunningham - Jan 5, 2017 5:00 pm UTC Enlarge / A concept render of Intel's Compute Card. Intel reader comments 104 Share this story Ars at CES 2017 I have seen the future: Alexa controls everything Sim racing hits the big time with the $1 million Vegas eRace BMW concept car interior puts holographic controls at your fingertips Taking a ride in Nvidia’s self-driving car Concept-i is Toyota’s friendly future View more stories Intel mostly missed the boat on smartphones, but the company is trying to establish a firm foothold in the ever-broadening marketplace for connected appliances and other smart things. Intel's latest effort in this arena is its new "Compute Card," a small 94.5mm by 55mm by 5mm slab that includes a CPU and GPU, RAM, storage, and wireless connectivity. The thinking with the Compute Card is to separate the smarts of various computers and appliances—all-in-ones, smart TVs, fridges, digital kiosks or signage screens, commercial equipment—from the rest of the hardware. You might want to keep a TV around for the better part of a decade, but the processing hardware inside it could start to feel slow three or four years in. With the Compute Card, one could simply eject the old card and slide in a new one instead of replacing the whole thing. Intel hasn't given us specific information about the specs and speeds of its first Compute Cards, but you can expect the fastest ones to approach the performance of high-end fanless laptops like Apple's MacBooks. Intel told us that processors with a TDP of up to 6W could fit inside the Compute Cards, which covers both low-power Atom chips like those that powered early versions of Intel's Compute Stick to full Core M and Y-series Core i5 and i7 CPUs like the ones you find in laptops. Intel says that the card uses a variant of the USB-C port called "USB-C plus extension" to connect with the systems it's plugged into. That connector gives devices direct access to the USB and PCIe buses as well as HDMI and DisplayPort video outputs. The company considers the Compute Card to be a replacement of sorts for the Compute Stick, which Intel says will probably disappear from its roadmap in 2018 or so. The issue with the Compute Stick from Intel's perspective is that its input and output ports were unnecessarily limiting—it could only connect to HDMI ports and could only accept a limited number of USB inputs. The Compute Card can be slid into a wider variety of enclosures that can use all kinds of ports and display interfaces, and Intel says the Card will also offer a large array of performance and storage options, unlike current Compute Sticks. Further ReadingIntel’s Core M Compute Stick is an actually usable computer with caveats While these cards could conceivably solve the hardware end of the problem for some smart devices, the software side is still a big question mark. As x86-based PCs, Intel told us that the Compute Card will be able to run Windows and Linux and any other operating system you can currently run on a low-end PC. Depending on the operating system they use, it may still be up to OEMs to provide software updates for Compute Card-based appliances, and they'll also need to figure out the best way to reload that software on new Compute Cards if users try to upgrade them by themselves. Intel will be revealing more information on specs, availability, and pricing in June of 2017, and the cards themselves will be available in "mid-2017." Intel's Compute Card partners, including Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Sharp on the computing side and Seneca Data, InFocus, DTx, TabletKiosk, and Pasuntech on the commercial side, will all be making their own announcements and releases separately.

OPM tells DC-area feds how to plan for Inauguration Day Samsung, one of the largest exhibitors at the show, is offering demonstrations of its boat racing, air show and other virtual-reality experiences in chairs that move around. Hyundai is offering VR demos for people to experience what it’s like to ride in an autonomous car. Advertisement Also drawing crowds are flashy concept cars like the Toyota Concept-i, with doors that flip up and a 3-D display inside. Polaroid is showing off its Cube+ Wi-Fi camera with a bizarre display of rotating — but fake — monkeys wearing the camera. Camera images are displayed in a live feed above. It’s a nod to the monkey-shaped stand that Polaroid sells for the Cube. On the TV front, LG wowed with an OLED 4K display tunnel, which people enter to see the new technology. One of the longer lines on the floor was at MyCharger’s Power Up bar — which offered a free MyCharger along with what appeared to be green beer. It’s actually regular Sam Adams in a green dye-infused cup. CES takes place over several, sprawling venues in Las Vegas. About 165,000 visitors are expected by the time it closes Sunday. ___ 2:45 p.m. Sometimes, it takes incentives to persuade people to change their habits. Mobile payment services such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay still aren’t widely used, in part because it isn’t difficult for shoppers to pull out a plastic card at the cashier. Samsung tried to address that by offering points for each transaction, regardless of the amount spent — redeemable for gift cards and Samsung products. At a CES panel Thursday, Samsung executive Nana Murugesan said that since the launch of Samsung Rewards in November, daily usage of Samsung Pay has nearly doubled, while the number of users who make purchases almost daily more than doubles each week. The company hasn’t specified the number of users and transactions, though analysts say it’s still a small compared with cash and cards. ___ 1:55 p.m. Is Alexa spying on you? It’s a fair question in light of attempts by authorities investigating the slaying of an Arkansas man to obtain voice recordings collected by an Amazon Echo speaker and its Alexa digital assistant. Yet the popularity and capabilities of voice-enabled products such as the Echo continue to grow. At the CES gadget show in Las Vegas, which opened Thursday, Whirlpool, Samsung and other manufacturers are unveiling new ways to use voice services to control laundry machines, refrigerators and other home systems. Consumers are apparently willing to trade a certain amount of privacy for convenience. The issue first grabbed headlines a couple of years ago, after Samsung said sensitive conversations could be captured by its voice-controlled smart TVs. Based on the flood of new voice-controlled gadgets headed to market, tech companies are betting that consumers will get over their fears. Comcast’s Derrick Dicol likens it to people getting used to sharing their banking information online. ___ 1 p.m. T-Mobile says unlimited plans will be the only option for new customers even though they are more expensive than some of its old, limited plans. The company had said in August that it was phasing out its other plans in favor of just an unlimited plan. On Thursday, T-Mobile said those limited plans won’t be sold anymore starting Jan. 22. Existing customers can keep their current plans. While some existing customers could switch over to the $70-a-month unlimited plan and save money, others would pay more. Most customers who just pay for one or two lines or who have a lower-data plan — 2 gigabytes per line — would save money by sticking to what they have. And T-Mobile’s unlimited plan isn’t exactly unlimited. If the network is busy, T-Mobile may slow speeds on customers that used more than 28 gigabytes. ___ 12:15 p.m. Beauty brands L’Oreal and Karastase want to make bad hair days a thing of the past. The two companies teamed up with tech company Withings on a Hair Coach brush that uses a microphone, gyroscope and other sensors to monitor how fast and how hard a person is brushing. An accompanying app recommends how to brush for optimal quality and minimal breakage and split ends. It can also take into account hair-influencing factors like heat or humidity and even discern if hair is wet or dry. The “smart brush” has been garnering buzz at the CES tech show in Las Vegas. Vincent Nida, worldwide general manager at Paris-based Kerastase, says one of the top beauty queries online is consistently about taking better care of your hair. The battery-powered brush starts collecting data when a user begins brushing. The smarts may seem like overkill considering the price of the brush — $200. By contrast, Amazon sells brushes for as little as $1. But Nida says you’re getting a high-quality brush “even if you don’t have batteries or you don’t connect it to your cell phone.” The Hair Coach brush is due out in mid-2017. ___ 11:05 a.m. Who needs a keyboard? Dell is introducing a new way to interact with your computer. The Dell Canvas 27 is a 27-inch glass surface that sits flat on a desk in front of a monitor. The touch surface is where a keyboard would normally be. Various widgets are available to manipulate items on the monitor. The Canvas also comes with a pen for sketching and creating. Dell envisions people using the device to edit photos and video, work on music and even work with financial tables. The goal is to replace clutter generally found on a desk. Instead of working with paper on a desk, just use the touch surface. The device launches in the spring and is expected to cost less than $2,000 — or around $3,000 with the monitor included. Lenovo has a similar concept in last fall’s Yoga Book. It’s a laptop that replaces the keyboard with a touch screen for both typing and doodling. But the screen is smaller, measuring 10 inches diagonally. Dell announced the Canvas at the CES gadget show on Thursday. Tom Holland, star of “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” also stopped by to introduce two Dell products — a tablet and a gaming laptop — that will appear in the movie. ___ 10:15 a.m. Smartphones can do almost anything, but how about molecular physics? An Israeli startup has embedded a molecular sensor called Scio in a new smartphone that can analyze any material — whether that’s the nutritional content of an apple or a person’s body fat. Consumer Physics’ scanners use infrared light to analyze molecular structure. The startup has been developing them for a few years, but this is the first time it’s embedded in a mobile device — one from Chinese phone manufacturer Changhong. Is that a little too much science to carry around in your pocket? Consumer Physics CEO Dror Sharon says knowledge is power. He explains, “When we go out and buy stuff, eat stuff, drink stuff, we think we know what’s in there, but we have no clue.” Pricing and availability for the phone will be announced Friday at the CES gadget show in Las Vegas. ___ 9:30 a.m. Apple’s app store closed 2016 with 2.2 million apps, an increase of 20 percent from 2015. Apple says New Year’s Day 2017 was the biggest day ever for app store purchases — people bought nearly $240 million of stuff in the digital marketplace. Nintendo’s “Super Mario Run” was the most downloaded app worldwide on both Christmas and New Year’s Day. The app is free to download, but it costs a whopping $10 to play the full version. In what should surprise no one, “Pokemon Go” was the year’s most popular app. The game peaked over the summer, when hordes of people prowled real-life locations to catch digital pocket monsters through its innovative augmented reality interface. Other popular apps included Sweat With Kayla, a workout app, and Procreate, a painting and sketching app. The milestones were announced as the CES gadget show in Las Vegas formally opened, though Apple has no official presence there. ___ 8:20 a.m. Intel thinks the future of virtual reality is skydiving in the desert, watching live sports from a ringside seat and cringing as zombies attack — all powered by Intel chips. Wednesday’s demo featured leather chairs, Oculus sensors and headsets — and a barf bag, signaling this was not an ordinary press conference. One demo was a live feed from a 360-degree camera attached to a drone inspecting solar panels in a desert. Intel was showing how the technology could be used in a work environment. A more exciting live feed showed a college basketball game between Butler and Villanova. Travel experiences took viewers to a waterfall scene in Vietnam and a skydiving experience in the Moab Valley. A trailer for “Arizona Sunshine,” a VR game, made viewers jump as zombies lunged for them. No one — noticeably — made use of the barf bags. CEO Brian Krzanich acknowledges that some people are questioning whether VR is going anywhere. He adds, “I hope these experiences give you a taste of where it’s going.” The CES gadget show in Las Vegas formally opens Thursday after two days of media previews. ___ 7:10 a.m. Amazon doesn’t have an official presence at the CES gadget show in Las Vegas but its Alexa voice control software seems to be everywhere. Whirlpool is adding Alexa voice control to its suite of smart-home appliances, including a stove and refrigerator. With that capability, someone can instruct the oven to pre-heat to 400 degrees by speaking a command to an Alexa-enabled device, such as Amazon’s Echo speaker. Jason Mathew, senior director of global connected strategy for Whirlpool, says voice is “the most natural way to interact with a product.” Other gadgets that include Alexa: Sensory and OnVocal are both launching headphones that incorporate Alexa. Simplehuman is announcing a voice-activated trash can. And GE Lighting is launching a table lamp that includes Alexa software. Amazon has an edge on the market for now because its software has been out longer, but Google’s and Apple’s systems are catching up. Mathew says “Amazon is the most mature, but we expect to offer other options in the future.” Topics: Business News Lifestyle News Technology News Leave A Comment Home » The Associated Press » Business News » The Latest at CES:… Partners FEDERAL INSIGHTS The Associated Press Government News U.S. News Business News World News Technology News Entertainment News Sports News Fed Photo of the Day Photos of the amazing, moving, important and amusing things happening in the federal community.

Gordon Mah Ung (PC World (US online)) on 06 January, 2017 02:35 0 - - - - print email You know Optane offers a thousand times the switching speed of an SSD. You know it’ll work with Intel’s newly announced Z270 chipset and Kaby Lake CPUs. And now you know what it’ll look like. A day before CES officially kicks off, Intel shared a couple of pics of its highly anticipated Optane non-volatile memory drives. Intel Pricing, availability, and even capacity weren’t released with the photos, but the initial drives are expected to be 16GB and 32GB in size. They’ll be used with Intel’s Rapid Storage Technology to cache hard drive performance. SSDs are already being used to cache hard drives with RST, but the question is how much of a difference it’ll make using Optane drives instead of today’s SSDs. The capacity is certainly far lower than where Optane is expected to eventually be. Using a 3D memory technology codeveloped with Micron, Intel has said since its introduction that it would eventually offer capacity exceeding today’s SSDs while approaching system RAM in performance. Future iterations could even go into DDR4 memory slots too. Today though, this is about as close as we’ll get to Optane for consumer use. Top 3 Reasons to Own a NAS More from Synology Join the Good Gear Guide newsletter!

But we might have just found our favourite. Razer has been using the tech show in Vegas to show off its Project Valerie system: laptop that packs in three, yes three, 17-inch 4K displays. Each 17.3-inch 4K IGZO display is equipped with Nvidia G-SYNC variable framerate tech and 180-degree Nvidia Surround View gaming. Related: CES 2017 And for the creative types out there, Razer's provided 100% Adobe RGB colour accuracy and what it's calling "the greatest amount of screen real estate ever assembled in a single computer". So, how does Project Valerie manage to include three displays while still being called a laptop? Well, as Razer explains, the concept design uses an "automatic deployment mechanism" which means each display mechanically slides out of the side of the main screen, once it's folded open. “The complexities of a traditional multi-monitor setup are a thing of the past with Project Valerie,” said Razer co-founder and CEO Min-Liang Tan. “Equally important, the power of a desktop computer and graphics capabilities of three top-end monitors are included in the system. There is no shortcoming in the way of performance in the face of its amazing portability and features.” Running the graphical side of things is an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080, and the impressive laptop exceeds the minimum hardware requirements for the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. The concept design includes a unibody CNC aluminum chassis which measures 1.5-inches thick and weighs less than 12 pounds (5.4kg). Razer's also included its thermal management system which uses custom-designed fan and dynamic heat exchangers paired with a vapour chamber to maximize heat dissipation. On top of that, the company has added its "Ultra-Low-Profile" mechanical switches, which means key presses are registered with 65 grams of force, so it should feel like using a full-size mechanical keyboards. Of course, there's no guarantee this will ever make it to market. Project Valerie is currently a working prototype and there doesn't seem to be any plans to put it into production. But, we're hoping Razer goes ahead with this one, frankly because it looks really cool.

ADVERTISEMENT The American tech firm has confirmed its Project Alloy "merged reality" headset will be turned into a consumer product later this year. "We're planning to productise project Alloy by Q4 of 2017 with some of our top OEM partners," Krzanich said on stage at his firm's CES 2017 press conference. Read more This car headrest monitors your brain waves to stop you falling asleep at the wheel This car headrest monitors your brain waves to stop you falling asleep at the wheel By Matt Burgess Intel first revealed Alloy in August 2016 at its developer conference in Silicon Valley. At the time Krzanich showed off what he called an "all-in-one virtual reality solution". Intel says its headset works in "merged reality," where it combines objects in the real-world with those the wearer sees on the screen of their headset. Ever since it was unveiled, Intel said it would not be directly manufacturing the device. Instead, development of the headset will be done by those outside the company. "We're committed to making Project Alloy an open platform," the CEO said in Las Vegas. He added that Alloy is "progressing very well" and that his firm believes its capabilities are what the future of virtual reality Krzanich said: "VR today requires a fairly complex set-up. It requires sensors to understand where you're at, it requires a tether to a pretty high-end computer".

On stage at the technology show Krzanich and colleagues demonstrated how the headset works. In a purpose built living room two people wearing the headsets were able to walk around the space and play games on the screens of the device. Intel's software turned objects in the room into objects of the same size in a VR world and the walls of the room were transformed into an alien space scene. ADVERTISEMENT Using internal cameras and motion sensors in the headsets the two players were able to move around the room and fire virtual weapons at attacking aliens. At the core of Intel's Project Alloy is its RealSense technology. First released in 2014, it is able to 3D scan a room in real-time and has since been used to help service robots navigate buildings. An example of how it can be used to blend the physical and digital worlds can be seen in RealSense's first integration into mobile phones.

We round up the rumours about new iMacs, including the theory that new iMacs will feature AMD Radeon Polaris graphics chips and might even be VR-ready. Latest: Tim Cook hints at the future of the Mac desktop, specifically mentioning the 5K iMac by Ashleigh Macro | 12 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments When will Apple release new iMacs in the UK? Will Apple update its iMac desktop line to add Intel Kaby Lake processor chips, and what other specs, design changes and new features should we expect in the next generation of iMacs? How much will the new iMacs for 2017 cost? Apple last updated its iMac line on 13 October 2015, bringing Retina-class screen resolution to the smaller Macs for the first time and equipping the larger models with new Skylake processor chips. Before that, you had to go back more than two years - if you don't include the cheaper iMac which Apple launched in June 2014 - to the last proper new iMac update, in September 2013, when Apple added Haswell processors, new graphics, next-gen Wi-Fi and faster PCIe flash storage options. (For more information on that update, read our review of the 2013 iMacs.) So much for Apple's iMac updates over the past few years. Right now we're looking ahead to the next iMac launch - what we hope will be an early-2017 iMac update. In this article we round up all the speculation about Apple's next iMac update: when new iMacs will be released in the UK, new iMac prices, tech specs and new features to expect, any leaked photos and videos that appear online, and all the other new iMac rumours that are fit to print. Updated, 22 December 2016, with comments from Apple CEO Tim Cook about the future of the Mac desktop Read next: Where to buy iMacs in the UK | Best Mac buying guide 2017 | Best cheap iMac deals UK New iMac 2017 release date, price & specs rumours: Launch date When will new iMacs come out? Early in 2017, we hope, but we had been confidently expecting an iMac update in late 2016 and that came to nothing. (A contact told us, under condition of anonymity, that the Mac Pro would be updated before the end of November 2016, and we reasoned that it would make sense for Apple to announce at least a minor update to the iMac at the same time. But the year ended with no word on new Mac desktops.) The Best Buy leak discussed in the processor section of this article, which emerged at the start of October 2016, strongly suggests that the retailer has had advance warning of an imminent launch and posted a listing slightly too early by mistake - although it's also possible that this was a speculative listing created on the basis that it would probably be needed at some point. New iMac 2017 release date: Apple CEO hints at future of the iMac In a rare Q&A session on Apple's internal employee network, Apple CEO Tim Cook gave an interesting response to a question about the future of the Mac, specifically mentioning the 5K iMac in his response. According to a transcript obtained by TechCrunch, an unknown Apple employee asked Cook: "We had a big MacBook Pro launch in October and a powerful upgrade to the MacBook back in Spring. Are Mac desktops strategic for us?" Interestingly, it's what Cook didn't mention in his response that suggests what Apple is planning for the future. In response, Cook wrote the following: "The desktop is very strategic for us. It's unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop — the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people. "The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world. Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops. If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that." If you look closely, Cook never used the word "Mac" in his response. At all. Considering it's the name of Apple's oldest product line, you would think it'd get a mention in a question about the company's desktop lineup. Granted, he does mention desktop computers several times, but never the name of the hardware, apart from one exception - the 5K iMac, which hasn't been updated in over a year. Essentially, Cook was asked whether Mac desktops were strategic, and he answered that desktops were important.  A report from Bloomberg might explain why Cook responded in this way, with keen Apple watcher Mark Gurman claiming that Apple has reorganised its software engineering department, meaning there's no longer a team dedicated to macOS - instead, engineers work on both iOS and macOS. He continues to claim that the Mac has been generally de-prioritised within the company, and that Mac engineers no longer get much attention from the company's industrial design team, which was until 2015 led by design chief Jony Ive, allegedly focussing more on iPhones and iPads. This suggests, to us at least, that while Apple is imagining a future where desktops are still being produced, they might not feature the iconic Mac branding. Could Apple be working on a macOS/iOS hybrid to launch as the ultimate desktop experience? With the astonishing number of iOS apps compared to macOS apps, it may be a smart investment for the company, but only time will tell.  New iMac 2017 release date: What does previous launch history tell us? The last iMac update was in October 2015. Apple's yearly cycle is built around three major press events: autumn - usually September (new iPhones and iPads); spring - usually March (new iPhones and iPads, sometimes MacBooks and watches); and summer - usually June (WWDC - operating system updates, and occasional hardware). But that doesn't mean the company stays quiet the rest of the year. Mac updates can be folded into the big three events, but they're often launched at their own smaller launch events. The iMac update in 2015 got its own announcement, a few weeks after the iPhone 6s reveal. But bear in mind that, unlike the yearly or event twice-yearly update events we're used to for iOS devices, desktop Mac refreshes have frequently come several years apart. WWDC 2017 (which will take place in June next year) is therefore a possibility, and we may have to wait even longer than that. New iMac 2017 release date, price & specs rumours: Specs We'll add leaked details about the tech specs of the new iMacs to this section as we hear them. Here's what we know so far. New iMac 2017 specs: Processor Apple skipped Intel's much-delayed Broadwell processors and went straight from Haswell to Skylake for the 2015 update. Skylake uses the same 14nm manufacturing process as Broadwell, but brings even greater CPU and GPU performance, along with reduced power consumption. But what chips will appear in the next set of iMacs? Clearly that will depend on their launch date and the hardware that's available at the time. After 2015's Skylake, the next round of Intel processors, which started going into mass production in late 2016 and is still being rolled out, is Kaby Lake; this will be followed by Cannonlake (Cannonlake was due to be next, but it's been delayed until the second half of 2017). Then Ice Lake in 2018 and Tiger Lake in 2019, for those who enjoy this sort of thing. Kaby Lake uses a 14nm process, same as Broadwell and Skylake, but Cannonlake switches over to a more accurate 10nm process. If Apple does manage an iMac update before the end of 2016 the machines could feature Kaby Lake processors, but remember that Apple skipped Broadwell and delays are common in the chip sector - so we're not banking on anything. Intel started shipping its Kaby Lake processors in July 2016, and the chips offer support for Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2. It's therefore now possible that Apple will squeeze Kaby Lake chips into the next iMac update, but by no means guaranteed, given Apple's past behaviour. Some of the Kaby Lake chips aren't expected to ship until very late 2016 or more likely early 2017, so be prepared for a wait. Read more on MacRumors. Processor models The specific model of Kaby Lake processor we're expecting to appear in the next iMac is the i7-7700. And as luck would have it, Tom's Hardware has got hold of what they understand to be a pre-release sample of that chip. Naturally they promptly overclocked it and put it through rigorous speed tests. Those speed tests found that the i7-7700 (or rather the i7-7700K - the K in the name denoting that the clock multiplier has been unlocked to allow for overclocking) was capable of 4.2GHz under normal circumstances, and 4.8GHz when overclocked. Serious speed which, as BGR observes, would give the new iMac bragging rights over the rival Surface Studio, launched before the relevant Kaby Lake chips became available. Micosoft could always launch an updated Surface Studio with Kaby Lake, of course, although that might hack off the early buyers. Evidence for Kaby Lake Back in October 2016, the US retailer Best Buy leaked a listing for a new iMac, and it had a Kaby Lake chipset - a "7th Gen Intel Core i7 processor". As Technobuffalo points out, this isn't necessarily genuine: an employee could have created this as a placeholder until official information is available. But slip-ups of this kind more often happen because a retailer has been given advance warning of an imminent launch and somebody sets it live too early by mistake. We'd say - based on this and other clues - that a Kaby Lake iMac is looking like a decent bet for launch in the near future. In November 2016, further evidence emerged that sheds light on the prospects of a Kaby Lake iMac. Intel briefly made documents available on its website, intended for PC manufacturer partners rather than consumers, that detail specs of new Kaby Lake processors - and Anandtech spotted and grabbed them. The documents detail 11 new processors, including seven i5 chips and three i7s; 10 of them are designated for desktop use and one is for worktop. There's still no sign of the Kaby Lake laptop processors we expect to use as part of a MacBook Pro update in early 2017. AMD processors We expect Apple to choose Intel-based CPUs, but there's a chance AMD could also make an appearance in certain iMac models. With the new AMD Zen processor, we hope to see the CPU make an appearance in a lot of high-end machines, given its tremendous processing power. The new processor boasts 8 cores and 16 threads - a massive amount of raw processing power. Given the suggested price tag of the Zen CPU, we expect it either to be in the top-spec iMacs or be an upgrade option. The inclusion of other AMD processors is also not far-fetched, as we still see it being an option for cheaper iMac models. New iMac 2017 specs: Graphics chips It's believed that Apple's next generation of iMacs (or its higher-specced models, at least) will feature graphics chips from AMD's Polaris set, which were announced at the start of 2016. WCCF Tech reports that AMD won the contract last October but was only able to get confirmation from additional sources in April 2016. The contract is for two chipsets: Polaris 10 (previously known as Ellesmere) and Polaris 11 (previously known as Baffin), and WCCF Tech says these processors will appear in "new desktops and notebooks from Apple, which the company plans to bring to market later this year". With the MacBook and MacBook Air having recently seen updates, and the Mac mini highly unlikely to incorporate a discrete graphics unit, the remaining candidates are the MacBook Pro, iMac and Mac Pro. MacRumors reasons that the power range of these chips makes Polaris 11 a strong fit for the MacBook Pro, while Polaris 10 suits the iMac. The Polaris chips offer improved graphics performance compared with previous generations (as much as twice the speed per watt) and potential reductions in both power consumption and waste heat. They are built using a 16nm or 14nm FinFET production process, compared to 28nm on AMD's earlier chips, which means that the chip maker can fit more transistors in a given space (which makes the chips ideal for ultraportable laptops and ultraslim desktops - the latter fitting recent iMac designs) and, because the transistors are closer together, less power is needed to move a signal across them. Apple's current iMac line-up features AMD Radeon graphics chipsets as standard in the 27-inch models. The 21-inch models come with integrated Intel Iris Pro 6200 graphics. Read next: New Mac Pro rumours | New Mac mini rumours New iMac 2017 specs: Virtual reality Talking about graphics architecture can be a little dry, but the Polaris rumour discussed above has a sexier element to it: VR. AMD has consistently talked up its Polaris graphics chips as a way of bringing VR within the reach of a wider market of PC users. At present Macs are basically unusable for VR, as we discuss in our articles Can you use Oculus Rift with Mac? and How to use a Mac for VR, and Oculus founder Palmer Luckey specifically cited underpowered Mac GPUs as the reason why the company was focusing on Windows: "People have said, 'Why don't you support Macs? So many people have Macs.' It's true. A lot of people have Apple hardware, especially in the laptop space. But the GPUs in those, they're not even close to what we're pushing for our recommended spec." But adding Polaris GPUs to the iMac could change Luckey's mind. AMD's Roy Taylor thinks the company's new GPUs are about to massively expand the available market for VR. "AMD has just completed the shrink to 14nm [with Polaris]," he said. "This means we can produce GPUs that will run the minimum spec of VR at a lower cost, in larger volume, consuming less power and running faster. That means in the second half of this year and going forward, more people will be able to run those headsets." Visit WCCF Tech for more info. VR remains a niche topic in tech - the number of people actually willing to shell out for the whole shebang remains small, even if casual gamers who try the Vive or the Oculus Rift tend to love it - but it gets a lot of press at the moment. And it can't be nice for a company that prides itself on the quality of its products to hear them disparaged as "not even close" to being up to a task. As Jim Lynch on CIO colourfully phrases it, "As far as VR goes, it's not something that I have paid much attention to, but it certainly couldn't hurt for Apple's computers to be able to do it adequately... If VR lights a fire under Apple's rear end and gets the company to put out a pro version of the iMac, then it will be a good thing for all users." New iMac 2017 specs: Flash storage We'll repeat our hope, expressed this time last year while waiting for the 2015 update, that Apple makes flash storage standard across the entire range of iMacs. At present the 27-inch iMacs get a Fusion Drive by default (Fusion Drives are a high-performance hybrid blend of flash and conventional storage) and the 21.5-inch models can add them as a build-to-order option for an extra £80. We think it should be offered as standard in all Apple's desktops. The current 21.5-inch iMac range is crippled somewhat by its hard drives, which are a lot slower than the flash drives used in all of Apple's laptops - to the extent that Mac laptops with similar processors will perform noticeably better than the equivalent iMac because of their faster SSD drives.

In our roundup of rumours about the next Mac Pro, we discuss the possibility that Apple is planning to wrap up that line - and one way such a move could work is by ramping up the top spec of the iMac line so that it meets the needs of professional users, rendering the Pro irrelevant. TechRadar has speculated about the specs of a theoretical 'iMac Pro' - "that glitzy, 27-inch 5K display paired with a 10-core Intel Xeon E7 (or two) and the latest and greatest AMD FirePro W9100" - and in this day and age the number of Mac buyers who really need the top spec appears to be dwindling. All of this is certainly a possibility. But while the Mac Pro doesn't appear to be tearing up trees commercially, it was never a line that was about making money. The Mac Pro is a flagship product, a niche offering and a positioning exercise - a way of reassuring Mac buyers that Apple is still a company that makes products for pro users. In some senses it's like the Apple Watch Edition: a glamorous, unnecessarily expensive aspiration point that passes on some of its stardust to the more affordable diffusion lines below.

Video provided by AFP Newslook Crowds gather to see a BMW concept vehicle at the BMW Group news conference Wednesday at CES in Las Vegas. (Photo: Walden Kirsch/Intel Corporation) LAS VEGAS — Not that long ago, checking in on the state of self-driving car technology meant asking Google's engineers how they were doing. The search company was virtually alone on the autonomous car highway. But in the last four years, that road has gotten crowded. The Consumer Electronics Show has served as a leading indicator of the growing interest in self-driving tech, eventually welcoming to what traditionally was a gadget-fest more than a dozen automakers. Two years ago, Ford CEO Mark Fields even delivered the keynote, a spotlight previously reserved for the likes of Bill Gates. This year, CES, which wraps here Sunday, again puts a spotlight on the mounting competition between not just the automakers but also the suppliers vying to provide the high-tech components that allow vehicles to navigate through a world of obstacles. It's clear now that engineers are able to make cars drive themselves. The bigger issue is how to scale this technology in a way that finds it both culturally embraced and scientifically sound — and is cost effective. As tech companies such as Nvidia, Intel, Harman join major auto brands such Audi, BMW and Volvo — 500 auto-tech companies large and small came to CES this year — in showing off their chips, sensors and smart cars, one has to wonder if this is a winner-take-all contest or if we're creating competing standards that could delay the arrival of a self-driving future. "There's a lot of desire to be the ones who can get there first and monetize this market for self-driving cars and it's causing almost a frenetic activity across the automotive industry, both from automakers and from tech companies," said Karl Brauer, executive publisher of Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book. If the various self-driving car booths here had a singular mission, it was to showcase how much safer the driving world can be thanks to technology. Delphi's Mary Gustanski explains the display inside a self-driving Audi SUV in Las Vegas.  (Photo: Mike Snider, USA TODAY) Auto parts supplier Delphi Automotive gave reporters rides in a 2017 Audi Q5 SUV. Its self-driving system was developed with sensors made by Mobileye and chips from Intel that automatically avoided a collision without input from its driver. "I see the potential for zero accidents and mobility for all simply because drivers have been taken out of the transportation equation," said Doug Davis, who leads Intel's automated driving group. Many automakers have set an eventual goal of zero deaths in their vehicles, remarkable considering that 30,000 die each year in the U.S. and more than a million worldwide. The competition to produce technology that can help car companies reach that milestone is intensifying quickly. AT&T, Intel, Nvidia: latest names in self-driving AT&T announced at CES that it was working with Delphi and Ford on improving vehicle communication with other cars and infrastructure. AT&T is also building a self-driving test center in Michigan with the American Center for Mobility. Intel and Mobileye are working with BMW to deploy 40 self-driving BMWs by the second half of 2017, the companies said here Wednesday. Intel, which announced that it plans to invest in high-definition mapping-firm Here, also is developing autonomous driving hardware and software platforms that could serve as a standard for other innovators to adopt. Meanwhile, Intel competitor Nvidia announced at CES Wednesday that it had landed Germany's ZF Group as its first customer for a car-computing platform powered by its chips that boasts both machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities. Big names in the chip game such as Qualcomm and AMD are also in the hunt. "We are going to see cars become the next major platform to battle over for the semiconductor makers," said Bob O'Donnell, president and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research.

"It is by far the hottest area in terms of tech," O'Donnell said. In Harman's demonstration area at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, the company showed off all the various aspects of autonomous vehicles, including smart ride-sharing cars that adapt the car's settings, display and personal audio zones based on riders' profiles.

Also on display was cybersecurity software to protect your car from hackers. Harman's partners in its autonomous car-tech quest include Apple, Daimler Chrysler, Google, IBM and Microsoft. All this collaboration would seem to bode well, but the truth is even those deeply enmeshed in the self-driving car world believe there are many miles to be driven before the masses enjoy this breakthrough. "No one company can do everything," said Dinesh Paliwal, Harman CEO and Chairman. Even though, "the autonomous car is almost here, we are 10 to 15 years out from the day when you have the majority of the cars with smarts that interact with each other through the cloud." In the meantime, expect auto-tech breakthroughs to trickle down into new vehicles in the form of increasingly sophisticated driver-assist features, just as driver-assisted parking and automatic braking have so far. USA TODAY Toyota car gives driver an artificial intelligence buddy And along the way, some companies may fall to the wayside, as did some in the transition from traditional cell phones to today's smartphones. "The next 10 years is going to be as influential in the car and personal transportation world as the smartphone has been in the past ten years," Autotrader's Brauer said. "You are going to see companies disappear because they can't adapt quickly enough." O'Donnell agrees and expects the industry to coalesce around multiple approaches. "It's an exciting area and it’s clear no one owns it. Frankly, it's big enough there may be multiple players."

View Latest Posts >>> What really happened to Hitler and the Third Reich Nazi High Command? By Preston James, Ph.D on January 5, 2017 Did Hitler Escape Germany and is the New FOURTH REICH Alive and Well? Greg Hallett Over the years, I have come into contact with numerous very interesting individuals in my research on the endemic high level government corruption. One such individual is Gregg Hallett, a well-known previously very successful architect from New Zealand, a man who exposed corruption in New Zealand and had to flee to Europe and the UK because of serious harassment by Law Enforcement and Intel. Greg is the modal example of how a well educated, well respected professional can became a Truth-seeker, and then became transformed into an international anti-corruption Truth-warrior, all because of high level corruption that impacted his life. While working as a professional architect in New Zealand, Greg refused to accept abuse by a corrupt system and then fought back with every resource he had to expose it. Initially he had hoped that higher government and Law Enforcement authorities would clean it up. Instead he found out the higher you go the more corrupt they are. After bucking the corruption endemic to the system in New Zealand, and moving to Europe to escape all the murder attempts, he began to investigate the source of this corruption which had also overtaken and occupied England. Ever since his journey as a Truth-seeker he has paid an enormous personal price for his research and activism. The real miracle here is that Greg is still standing and some mysterious force always seems to protect him and keep him just barely getting by. His story is quite remarkable to say the least. Greg is my friend and I have a lot of respect for him and his work. His research has shown that the current Queen of England is an imposter and he has laid this all out in well documented form in his excellent books. Greg Hallett has authored a number of revealing books based on high level MI-6 Intel and from his own sources. My favorite and one of his most well-known is Hitler was a British Agent. This is a remarkable book based on very high level Intel from a highly ranked insider he came to know. Before Greg had to leave New Zealand due to serious harassment by Intel and Law Enforcement for bucking the crooked system and expecting justice, he became good friends with a man he called “the Spymaster”. The Spymaster was a former very high ranking MI-6 man but who had apparently retired in New Zealand and came to know Greg. It may be that Greg Hallett was chosen to serve as a “drip” to leak out historical information by a certain oppositional but high ranking power faction in the UK through MI-6. Greg has written some excellent books on hidden history and some of the Intel behind his books is stunning to say the least. These books are filled with historical data almost impossible to find in any library even with years of deep research. I have read his excellent classic the Blackmailers Guide to New Zealand and it seems to be quite accurate. For anyone living in New Zealand and wants to know how things are really run behind the scenes, this is a must read. Hitler I don’t agree with Greg’s views in regard to the life of Jesus associated with claims of the Merovingians, but with everything else. Greg’s writings about corruption in New Zealand, the heritage of the Royals, and what happened to Hitler are accurate. And as time goes on his claims about what happened to Hitler at the end of WW2 in his book are being progressively corroborated bit by bit, especially by declassified Intel documents in the UK and the USA. This man the Spymaster gave Greg frequent high level briefings on high level Intel, how things really work behind the scenes in new Zealand and inside England too. Greg was given a great deal of Intel not known generally, especially about how Hitler was rescued from Germany and by whom, and who the Queen really is and where she came from. Hitler didn’t die in the Bunker. According to Greg Hallett’s account, Hitler left two murdered doubles in the bunker (one that was his and another Eva Braun’s) and then fled through a tunnel system to a float plane to eventually end up in Spain. From Spain, he may have been taken by ship or submarine to South America to one of the Nazi enclaves (there were a number of them in some areas with large German populations). Or he may have remained in Spain. Certainly there is some reason to believe that Hitler was considered irrelevant at the end of the war because, two years before it ended, special agreements were negotiated with the Allies, specifically US and England Intel, jointly without his input. The best evidence I have been made privy to so far is that Hitler probably died in 1950 in Spain at a Catholic Church rectory while retiring as a gardener growing roses. How interesting it is that some insiders believe that Angela Merkel is the actual daughter of Hitler and Eva Braun. She certainly looks a great deal like him. If true this would certainly explain a lot about her counter-intuitive efforts to “Globalize” Germany by bringing in so many foreign immigrants, an obvious effort to destroy Germany’s language, culture and borders. _________ Secret Intel Agreement Two years before the end of the war, a special secret agreement was negotiated with General Kammler and American and British Intel. Churchill had convinced FDR that the war had to be extended until at least 5 years in order to gain enough land and booty to pay the settlements required by the Bank of International Settlements which came into being in 1930. According to the secret rules of conquest and war after 1930, the winner of any war has to pay to rebuild the nations they defeat. This was passed as a means to prevent the recurrence of the punitive Treaty of Versailles which devastated Germany and led to the rise of the Nazi regime. Plus Churchill had been instructed by the City of London (COL) leaders that he needed to make sure the supply lines into the Work Camps in Germany, and other countries were bombed to increase the death rate for Judaics so that this would serve as more powerful propaganda later on as the Zionist slave state of the New Israel was created. General Kammler was head of the special weapons programs of the Nazis that was responsible for developing super high tech weapons and anti-gravity craft that was reputed to have been shared by the Vril Girls. The Nazis also had a recovered crashed Alien ET UFO that had crashed in Bavaria in 1922 during a powerful thunder storm. Bormann was the Nazi’s business agent, and he prepared Gold stashes in other nations as a back-up plan when he felt certain that Germany would be defeated. Kammler was made privy to this and they formulated a very crafty back up plan to create Nazi SS enclaves throughout South America, Australia and Canada, with armed bases in South America and one in Antarctica (New Schwabenland). Kammler’s and Bormann’s deal negotiated with the allies was this. Operation Paperclip became a reality based on these secret, very sensitive negotiations. Top Nazi Intel officers and those scientists working on ultra-high technology being back engineered from Alien ETs would be given complete immunity if they did three things: 1>The Nazi scientists working on rocketry and anti-gravity craft would be brought into the USA and would be employed at a living wage and would be expected to continue their Alien ET research and advanced rocketry. This eventually led to a bifurcated space program, with the rocket-based system for public consumption, and the secret anti-gravity programs becoming deeply buried inside certain Defense Contractor special access, unacknowledged “need to know” deep-black and beyond-black programs. In Germany, as the program was being transferred to a special unit of the Allies, General Kammler had all his top officers not essential to the program shot in cold blood. This give one an idea how cold-blooded Kammler really was; and he was of the same cloth as Borman, Skorzeny and most other top Nazi insiders who had taken a blood oath to the Reich of the Black Sun. The anti-gravity craft programs had already been bifurcated from the rocketry programs in Germany, and the plan was to continue this bifurcation as cover for the anti-gravity craft programs. >2 Gehlen and Muehler would transfer their spy system embedded inside the Soviet Union to US Intel and would develop a complete cold war strategy for the City of London Banksters. This eventually resulted in the Nazi takeover of American Intel, and the creation of the CIA after the UFO crashed at Roswell NM that sent the American Military into a tailspin. Roswell was leaked on purpose and then covered up to create a crisis in American Intel and the US Congress so that there would be sufficient motivation to pass the Draconian and unconstitutional National Security Act of 1947. >3 Some Nazis would be allowed to occupy South American nations as long as they agreed to provide security systems for the puppet dictators that served the needs of the big American Corporations which needed to oppress the populace and keep cheap access to their natural resources. Those who want more information on the secret Nazi technology can read the fine works by Joseph P. Farrell, an Oxford educated expert of Nazi high technology. _________ South America and Antarctica USS Sennet 1946 Operation HighJump The German base in New Schwabenland in Antarctica was not included in the negotiations because the Allied Intel did not have good substantiation about it. It has been decided that later on after they had developed a good relationship with the Nazis under Operation Paperclip, they would ten press to be a part of that and share in those secrets. But this did not happen and the Nazis were resistant to provide any meaningful information about this even suggesting that the Nazis at this underground/underwater base in Antarctica had formed an alliance with Alien ETs already living there and had gone renegade even from the Nazi high command in South America. In 1947 Admiral Byrd ran a secret naval armed expeditionary force called “Operation Highjump”. Aircraft were deployed and shot down and at least one ship allegedly sunk. Byrd returned to America closed lipped, but while in Argentina had told a reporter that the force they battled with could fly from pole to pole rapidly. This is where good accounts crease and only speculation remains. Sources deep inside American Intel have rumored that another expeditionary naval force was sent back in 1952 and deployed nuclear devices against this Nazi underground base. Allegedly some kind of negotiated truce agreement was formed to be able to do research in Antarctica, but the Alien ET base with co-opted Nazis was to be left alone. It is unknown if the US’ Secret Space War program formed in 1947 later formed a cooperative effort with these Antarctic Alien ETs reputed to be “tall Whites”, and believed to be tolerant of Anglos and Americans and willing to cooperate on mutual interests — like defeating the Dracos which were reputed to hold an iron grip on world banking and most of the Satanic secret societies. _________ Enter the Israelis, Cutouts for the COL Zionist Rothschild Khazarian Mafia (RKM) Banksters After the end of WW2, in the early 1950’s when the Zionists inside the COL Banking system became concerned that the Nazis could become too powerful, they devised a plan to weaken them and bring them into the official COL fold. And the Israelis convinced the COL Bankster councils that in order to create the New Israel on confiscated Palestinian land, they needed to create massive anti-Nazi propaganda as a means to mind-kontrol Judaics enough to get massive worldwide support for Israel. The long term plan of the COL Banksters which has always been associated with a Draconian, Satanic Cult and high Freemasonry had always believed that they needed to occupy Jerusalem, where Satan would then be seated as world ruler as soon as they completed their Globalist NWO Agenda. The top Nazi generals had not wanted to go to war in the first place, they believed that they could take over the world economically in time. But Hitler had been mind-kontrolled to believe he could stop the Bolsheviks, partner with England and then take over and rule the whole world. The team that rescued Hitler from his Bunker was run by Ian Fleming, a man later murdered at the orders of Allen Dulles for writing his book about Dulles, The Man With The Golden Gun. Paperclip scientists in America According to this narrative supplied by the Spymaster, Hitler was a British Agent, deeply mind-kontrolled at Tavistock Institute. He was told that the plan was for Germany to stop Russia and that Britain would join forces and together they would take over the whole world. The proof of this lies in two events: First Hitler’s counterintuitive release of the Allies trapped at Dunkirk (he could have won the war right there). Second, his sending Rudolf Hess to fly into Britain to finalize his expected alliance between Germany and England. Why England turned on him is an interesting question. Was it a ruse right from the start or did the group running England change their minds about Hitler because of his new view on Banking which was counter to theirs? And there is the group “Sharkhunters” that has traced Hitler’s escape to South America and claims to have a lot of evidence. Jeff Rense has broadcast numerous excellent programs and articles by Sharkhunters on Rense.com.  I am not familiar with their all their claims about Hitler’s escape but they have done a lot of research. And then there is the recent history Channel series Hunting Hitler. They may disagree on dates and specific living locations for Hitler post WW2, but they all agree that he survived the end of the war. The man who knows the most about what happened to the Nazis and their Third Reich in general after WW2 is the noted investigative journalist and top selling author Jim Marrs, who has written an excellent, well-respected book, The Rise of the Fourth Reich. And of course there is a lot of misinformation that has been planted on the Internet and broadcast and published to mislead researchers as deception and cover. Here is what I think happened to Hitler from my best sources. Over the years in my profession I did meet and get to know some very high level individuals, some high level Intel. You can take this information for what it is worth (informed rumors), but I believe it is valid. Do your own research and diligence and you will probably come to a realistic conclusion. In 1943 two years before WW2 ended, General Kammler met in secret with British and American Intel and negotiated a deal. He agreed to surrender all his Vril high technology and advanced weapons at the end of the war in exchange for complete immunity and guaranteed jobs for 9,000 of his technicians, scientists and engineers working on these systems inside America. He had been told that the Allied High Command would be continuing the war for another two years for economic reasons but that there was no way Germany could ever make its high tech weapons operational. Another similar deal was made with the General running the Nazi atomic bomb program. They had already successfully fired one off before the end of the war but were short plutonium. That deal negotiated with the allies resulted in the transfer of the German Plutonium and detonator designs and prototypes to the Allies at the end of the war and the nuclear material was used in one of the nuclear bombs dropped on Japan. The person that inserted the detonators in the bombs that were used to attack Nagasaki and Hiroshima just happened to be a woman (not generally known, but I have met her son). Martin Bormann During WW2, the Nazi top command (specifically Bormann who was the real leader of Germany and the Nazis) lost all confidence in Hitler and started making secret arrangements to transfer Gold and valuable artwork all over the world, to Spain, to South America, to Australia, to New Zealand, and even to America and Canada. Bormann was planning to create a new Fourth Reich that would eventually rule the world and result in a Globalist NWO one-world government. Bormann believed that the USA and England were so impressed with the Nazi Intel methodologies and their technology and weapons development programs they could slowly infiltrate and take over both nations. And the USG brought both Gehlen and Muehler mover to build their Intel system in order to counter the new Soviet threat. Gehlen sold the idea to the USG that he had completely penetrated the Soviets at all levels and had a strong spy network in place there and in all satellite nations. Over time there is good anecdotal evidence that the Bormann Plan to covertly build the Fourth Reich was successful and there is reason to believe that it merged with the City of London Globalist plan to build a NWO with a one-world government. Bormann met in secret with the Russians in Switzerland (where he made the deal with the Allies) and formulated plans which accepted the defeat of the Third Reich, but would replace it covertly with the new and secret Fourth Reich. At the end of the war, Bormann and his fellow top Nazis, some who were in uniform and many were industrialists (not just in Germany but all over the world) had a great deal of gold and valuable artwork amassed during WW2. With this vast fortune Bormann and his closest business associates were able to buy major blocks of controlling stock in about 750 of the largest International corporations (oil companies, pharmaceuticals, defense contractors, etc.). Aerial Los Alamos Bormann also had formed close associations with numerous dictators in South America and started providing security services to them, and he did this for the nation of Egypt too. Colonia Dignidad was used as a base for this and to run special “Boys from Brazil” breeding programs, an interrogation center, and as a base to build a large narcotics cartel which later formed a partnership with the Mossad and the CIA (a three way partnership). Hitler stayed away from Colonia Dignidad and was kept out of all Fourth Reich matters. He was told it was for his own protection, but the truth was Bormann felt he was incompetent and deranged. The Israelis were beginning to understand that pushing the “hunt for Nazis” all over the world was great press and help increase their ability to get funding from the US Congress and was a great help politically in Israel. The South American dictators were protecting the Nazis because they trained and ran their security and their deaths squads to keep the peasants in line. But this drive in Israel to hunt every last Nazi down was creating major pressure and Israeli diplomats were busy negotiating with the US State Department to make some kind of deal to get access to these Nazis hiding in South America. A deal was cut and Otto Skorzeny was involved. He found out that the Israelis had put out a contract to assassinate him and were closely on his trail, but that they might be willing to make a deal. So Skorzeny made a deal through intermediaries. He would provide some wetwork for them and provide them information. In exchange he would be allowed to live in America and would also work for American Intel. Bormann supposedly died of stomach cancer in about 1950. His first death then was faked by huim and he allegedly really died sometime between 1955 and 1965. Hitler allegedly died of stomach cancer in 1950 in Spain, living in a Catholic Church home. I think that both of these were assassinations by Skorzeny as a part of a deal made with the Israelis. Plus the Fourth Reich that Bormann set up became completely corporatized, except for the strong Nazi element inside NATO known as Gladio which was responsible for staging terrorist acts for the City of London. The new Fourth Reich Corporate conglomerate decided to get rid of the old Nazis and go completely three piece suit. Through various deals, the dictators protecting them were displaced and the Nazi strongholds in South America were demolished. I believe that Skorzeny poisoned both Bormann and Hitler after that action was approved by this Fourth Reich Directors. Those that were not murdered were discredited and prosecuted, especially those at Colinia Dignidad. So now we have an essentially Nazi/Mossad hybrid system running all security and Intel for the City of London Banksters and their private world Banking System, all of which takes orders from those that hijacked the Vatican, the Jesuit Superior General. And currently this Fourth Reich, a large secret group of major corporations produces oil, pharmaceuticals and has a very large clothing company that displays the swastika in a mildly disguised form. They also run some major defense corporations and are reputed to have complete control over the whole Secret Shadow Government, all Secret Space War matters, including the two main space war groups, and all their 140 Deep Underground Military Bases (DUMBs) inside the USA, the four corners area, and many DUMBs all over the world, even in Norway. As an aside, there are many inside MI-6 that believe that Eva Braun and Hitler had a daughter and that daughter is Angela Merkel. Hitler probably lived in South America until things got too hot because of the Israelis and was moved back to Spain, where he lived as a retired man gardening. I never heard what became of Eva Braun, other than her daughter Merkel was sheep-dipped and propelled to the top. The question of what and where is the Fourth Reich today is an interesting one and quickly involves a great deal of esoteric topics, like what happened to the Nazi base in New Schwabenland (Antarctica), was the Nazi an occult organization at its center based on worship of the Black Sun? Did the Nazis have possession of crashed and recovered alien ET anti-gravity craft from Bavaria in 1922, and did they receive Alien ET technology directly from the Vril Girls? _________ Conclusion Just routine back-engineered technology My best sources have suggested that the Fourth Reich is alive and well today, but in different form, because it has formed an alliance with those who run the Vatican, City of London private Fiat world banking, the Israelis and the major defense contractors in America, especially the no-bid ones. Jim Marrs, the top expert on the Fourth Reich, would likely have a lot to say about all this. Some believe that it runs all American Intel and all US black projects including the US Secret Space War Program. This belief is likely well-founded. This new arrangement is not surprising because the folks that really run things inside the Vatican and the City of London do so according to the Roundtable design. Those with corruption and power are brought in, kind of like the Cosa Nostra Ruling Council for the New York Five Families, but only on a world scale. Thus, at this governing Roundtable can sit Israelis on one side; three-piece-suit Fourth Reich Nazis on the other side who still run the Gladio left behind army inside NATO; COL and Wall Street Banksters on the other side; and wealthy groups, like the Saudis, that serve as a major funding source for other Roundtable member groups who deliver protection and services for them. Ex Corde License plate (photo art) This Roundtable form of world government requires only that these group leaders serve that same God Lucifer (aka Satan or Baal) and are fully committed at least in appearance to the Globalist NWO Agenda of the top single world leader, the Superior general who represents the European Old Black Nobility and carries all the full world authority of the Mark of Cain for Evil Ruling over Evil. Occasionally a group may make a play to grab more power, and that may explain what has happened in the last US Presidential election. It is too soon to know for certain if this is what happened, and if so, who did it; but in time we shall likely find out. And some researchers claim that a new populist force within America and certain Intel groups has now made a powerful pay to re-balance the forces that sit at the Roundtable. If true, this is the first time in history that populism has emerged so quickly and so powerfully — and this must all be credited to the new unanticipated social effects of the worldwide Internet, the New Gutenberg Press. _________ The following link is tested and will play, although it looks ‘blank’: _____________ Related Posts: NEO – John Kerry’s Trip to the South Pole MK-Ultra Triple Play in Orlando (Updated) World War II myths fuel Western crimes Why Alex Jones Bashes Nazis Is the GOP Really America’s Domestic Enemy?

It would give the Us a hold on those nazis to shut up about the angloamerican role behind nazism and the WWs. But Greg Hallett is a mythmaker. No way AH was an agent but just a dupe. No way he would deliberately betray Germany. Not initially but gradually both AH and Stalin were cornered believing they had no option left but to fight. AH inspired by the British had already said too much for Stalin ever to trust him. And both were given signals from Britain to which they reacted in a logical manner. The British had an enormous skill in handling dupes and the nazis were mostly simpleminded people. Mayby M Borman and Schacht were more aware but they still were dupes. AH had a naive sortof romantic view of being chosen to carry out the racial superiority masterplan for the British empire resulting in his admired Germany being accepted as Britains partner. Log in to Reply Edward Longshanks  January 7, 2017 at 9:42 am Stalin was not enforced to fight by external reasons, but by internals. He understood Trotzky’s aspect of permanent revolution very well. Communism in one state, promoted officially by Stalin, does not work economically, proved by history. Stalin sacrificed many Million farming people to refinance his investments in the military. In 1939 the USSR was more armed than the rest of the planet, including the US, except the navies. About the intelligence of the British leaders we have not to debate. Who loses the greatest Empire, the planet has ever seen, and the status of the world reserve currency in 30 years, must be either insane or totally stupid. About evidence and assumptions i would like to draw your attention to the fact that major Allied files are still closed. I do not doubt Dr. James’ contacts, but i would feel better with published files and open archives. PeterAG  January 7, 2017 at 4:29 pm Edward Longshanks Britains Cecil Rhodes decided long before ww1 that the empire would/might need to move the capital to the US. The angloamerican establishment exposed only through Carroll Quigleys work was the vehicle and most of those Hitleradmirers who fail to grasp his role as a dupe also usually havent absorbed Quigleys important revelations. Ever wondered why allied files are still closed? Right, among other reasons because of the decisive cornering of both Stalin and Hitler. Mannerheims spies have revealed the part about how Hitler was cornered. Rakovsky whos credibility is admittedly uncertain claimed that Britain told Stalin he would have to fight the nazis alone unless he occupied Poland. But that is in perfect agreement with Britains wish to foment the eastern war so it makes sense. Rakovsky also made many claims about the financiers and bolshevism which have been confirmed in archives captured from Grand Orient. It is confirmed in official sources that Britain tried to make France sign a stated lie about Stalins unwillingness to ally with France and Britain against Hitler but France refused. It was indeed Britain who stalled their deal forcing the M/R pact. Edward Longshanks  January 6, 2017 at 3:56 pm Dr. James, i watched again all those Antarctica Vids, always an exciting story. But i think, all your interested readers know them already and the conclusions behind, taken from the moon to Miguel S. But it unfortunately seems that no one (including me) from this community has enough money for an expedition following the course of Admiral Byrd. With some luck a few of those 5.000 US navy guys under Byrd’s flag could still live and not afraid to tell you/us the truth.

Was there ever a time when a fetish was made of inheritance of the throne of England – of anywhere ? The world is generally ruled by the ‘mailed fist’, the magnate with the largest personal treasure to buy mercenary troops, finance wars, etc. Henry I of England raced back to England from France, and more specifically to Winchester, to get his hands on the national treasure before his brother, Robert, could get it. Same family, but there have always been usurpers, haven’t there ? Heck William I usurped the throne from Harold, and the Saxons had usurped it from the Britons. I read a while back that the technically legitimate heir to the throne – I think, living in Germany or perhaps Holland – when asked about it, couldn’t have cared less. He evidently had a realistic understanding tha there was an enormous weight of recent history that rendered such a technicality irrelevant. And I dare say he realised his life wouldn’t be his own if he did accede to the throne.

Edward Longshanks  January 6, 2017 at 4:26 am Abbas, i like those articles of Dr. James and others. The point is the lacking evidence. The real story behind is not where Hitler died or not, the real story deals about our personal wishes. All speculators about those stories have the deep whish in the most inner personality, that Hitler had survived. But i doubt it. No one doubts Goebbels suicide and the killing of his wife and children. Do you think Hitler was less brave than his most loyal comrade in the question of suicide? Do you think that Hitler would let his best comrade behind? Other NS leaders we could call cowards, because they hoped for mercy despite they knew it better. In January 1942 the NS leadership knew that the war was lost and they will have to die. Preston James, Ph.D  January 6, 2017 at 7:28 pm Where Hitler finally retired and died is not so important as is the survival of the Third Reich and its transformation into a secret mega multi-national group of corporations that formed alliance with it enemies and other organized crime groups. This is the corporate model for the NWO, rule by a coalition of large international corporations that control govts. It is called super-fascism, the merger of the govt with corporations but where the corporation coalition stacks and hijacks each govt to serve as their secret puppet. Right now the best approximation of the Roundtable or Coalition is G7, where they all share Intel and agents among their member govts. Attempts were made to expand this to G20 but so far they appear to have failed.

Pope Francis is the first jesuit on the throne. This move shows us the desperation of the catholics. The Jesuits were often used as in Japan, but often forbidden. This BBC documentation is really nice, but the German Windsors sit in Buckingham palace. Your conclusion “Might Makes Right” is totally correct, but not a news. Law is made for the weak. In Germany we have many small groups, called “Reichsbürger”, they want to prove the illegal status of Germany. But legel or illegal is never the question. The question is who is empowered with the executive (police/army) forces. Who owns a military option, the rest is in reality not worthy a debate.

Guess why there is war to defend against “executive Power” forced by foreigners.See take over of Washington DC by the Crown and the resulting revolt against it. And no, the Reichsbürgerschaft was invented by Adolf. You should read the STAG and the RUSTAG 1913 to see the difference. Much luck with the Neusiedler in germany if you own a house and ground.

Much talk about it was in Russia, too. The skull did not belong to Hitler, Martin Bormann escaped to Brazil or Argentina. Gold of Reich. Antarctic station and everything else. I think that Hitler and Bormann would be found by Jews or Soviets. Or there would be people who’d betrayed them for money and sensation. Or the only way to hide – only if USA helped. US and British troops so hurried to enter Berlin to capture German documents and scientists! But all military generals in the West told, that to take the Berlin is impossible- it was stronghold. Marshall Zhukov proved the opposite. And the haunting started – to capture technologies, scientists, top leaders of the Nazi. I do not think that the Germans collaborated with aliens. It’s a fairy tale. The same tale as aliens in Roswell. German scientists were really outstanding. Missile technology has allowed then the United States and the Soviet Union to conquer space. Much mystery has been associated with the Ahnenerbe – the mystical division of the Reich. A few months ago in the mountains of Adygea (the North Caucasus, where I live) was found the suitcase with the symbols of the Ahnenerbe. Inside were documents and two skulls, similar to the goat’s, but a strange anatomy. Now it is studied. Many grief Reich brought to my country, but we have broken the backbone of the Hitler’s military machine.

He got 2 medals for it, wounded and bravery. After the WW1 he could not bear it, in reality he became a kind of pacifist. It is the same, with Mr. Putin. For Mr. Putin, war is the last possible decision he makes. He wants always peace. Hitler had no use for any war at all. But from the point of view of the Germans he must promote the interests of Germans in the former eastern provinces.

Log in to Reply Edward Longshanks  January 5, 2017 at 9:08 am I like those stories, very exiting. The problem we face in your stories is that you mix up well known historical facts, some obviously clandestine facts with funny allegations. The Nazis never demanded to rule the planet, this is Allied propaganda as Saddam’s weapons of mass destruction or an evil Mr. Assad. Interested people have simply to read Mr. Irving’s publications, to get an independent insight about the historical events. About the clandestine events, it is to mention, that we have Admiral Byrd’s interview and we know that some German submarines are lost/missing in the precise accounting of the Germans and not so precise accounting of the Allies. My personal problem is that i met once one of the adjutants of Hitler, who was commanded by the Führer himself, to wear him out of the bunker, to burn him and his wife. I assume that Mr. Irving met the same guy. Hitler wanted to avoid to share the fate of Mussolini. And i met several times a bearer of the Knight’s Cross of the Iron Cross, a lieutenant, who escorted with 2 Panther tanks Martin Bormann with others out of the Reichskanzlei, when Hitler decided to remain there. This lieutenant witnessed the death of Bormann, when he walked aside of one of the tanks. He was shot by German partisans. I recorded his statement some 18 years ago. Both guys were absolutly honourable and correct veterans.

Edward Longshanks  January 5, 2017 at 10:32 am The Iron Lady closed all important files for another 40 years, we will see. Edward Longshanks  January 5, 2017 at 10:37 am The old veteran, excorting Bormann, always laughed about speculations due to Bormann’s death. He said, the speculators never asked me. And as i remember Bormann’s skull was found in Berlin. Moustafa Eker  January 5, 2017 at 9:05 am As of 1942 or 1943, the tide of WW2 was turned against The Nazis, and The Nazis were divided into two parts: Reinhard Gehlen’s Nazis that plan to end the war and Adolf Hitler’s Nazis that seek to wage the total war. By collaborating with the allies of WW2, Gehlen’s Nazis decided to put an end to WW2, and during the war -probably until the mid of 1945- they began an operation against Hitler and his Nazis. And Karl Eglseer, Eduard Dietl, Heinrich Himmler, Joseph Goebbels and a few more -and maybe a lot more- Hitler’s Nazis were murdered by Gehlen’s Nazis, under the cover of suicide or accident. This was the first intelligence operation of Gehlen’s Nazis -will be called later Gladio-. When finally Adolf Hitler was killed by them, the Nazi Germany had to be defeated by the allies of WW2. Along with the ending of WW2, Gehlen and his Nazis started to serve Khazarian Mafia and their royal family called British Royal Family. Hence UN, NATO, and EU were founded by Gehlen’s Nazis to control and to monitor the world. Gehlen’s Nazis never were put on trial or they testified against Hitler’s Nazis in Nuremberg. The Nuremberg trials and the next period, the Cold War-and beyond- were the anti-Hitler propaganda prepared by Gehlen’s Nazis. The real criminals were Gehlen’s Nazis, not Hitler’s Nazis! Log in to Reply Preston James, Ph.D  January 5, 2017 at 10:07 am I think you are on to something here Moustafa Eker. Gehlen was a very crafty man who appeared to be able to infiltrate and hijack all American Intel. Of course he had help from Prescott Bush and the Dulles brothers who were closeted secret Nazis apparently. Edward Longshanks  January 5, 2017 at 10:27 am Moustafa, this makes not so much sense. Read the biography of Admiral Canaris. Canaris, a smart guy, chief of the Abwehr, was an enemy of Hitler and supported several opposition members and paid for it. But the point is, that he became more reluctant and dissociated himself from the revolteering officers. He checked very early his Allied connections via the Switzerland, what will happen, if they would dispose Mr. Hitler? The answer was, unconditional surrender. This was the insight, Churchill repeated in public. The Allies did not care about Hitler. They cared about Germany and its destruction. Hitler’s comment about the Stauffenberg assassins was very clear for everybody…. stupid, untaught officers. And i have to state, that you have no idea about the circumstances at the end and after the war in 1945. In the fate of Himmler you see the result of collaborating without useful knowledge. The Sovjets shot SS-guys and suspected political officers on the spot. Prisoners of war and Civilians were deported to Siberia. 14 Million poeple escaped the Red Army to the Tri-zone, 2 Mio. of them died on the escape. The Sovjets as the Allied kept all guys busy in Western (Eastern) intelligence obervance or advanced technologies, planes, missiles, nuclear science…etc. The western Allies managed it more comfortable. Millions of common soldiers died in the Rheinwiesen camps. Important guys were prisoned in former concentration camps as long as their fate was not decided. Edward Longshanks  January 5, 2017 at 10:30 am Intelligence guys as Gestapo Müller, Gehlen and the scientists in advanced technologies, as von Braun, were not asked, they were simply deported. They were happy not to become executed. Gehlen was paid since 56 by the CIA and not the opposite. Moustafa Eker  January 5, 2017 at 12:26 pm Thanks for the interest and comments. None of Gehlen Nazis were tried or convicted for the war crimes. And furthermore they testified against Hitler Nazis, in Nuremberg Trials. (An obvious example; Walter Schellenberg). Gehlen’s Nazis defected to Khazarian Mafia and their royal family called British Royal Family, and so served their profits. UN, NATO, and EU are organizations that protect and defend such global profits and focus NWO. All of Hitler’s Nazis were tried or killed. But Gehlen’s Team sold the accumulation of all knowledge of Nazis and gained wealth and power. That’s probably true story but has no direct evidences and clues, unfortunately. Sorry. Some of Gehlen’s Nazis here; Heinrich Rupp Walter Schellenberg Wernher von Braun Licio Gelli Emil Augsburg Willi Krichbaum Hans Globke and Intelligence squad of The Operation Paperclip and -as you know- Reinhard Gehlen Regards. M.E. Edward Longshanks  January 5, 2017 at 2:37 pm Those guys were used, because they had the knowledge about the Sovjets, the US did not had. Since 56 the Germans nust pay the Gehlen service themselves and were allowed to use some intelligence for themselves. It is a crazy exchange of the circumstances. German bombers destroyed the US?

Intel and New Balance Announce RunIQ Android Wear Smartwatch with Atom CPU GO It is now available for pre-order for $299.99 Jan 5, 2017 16:00 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  New Balance, one of the world's major sports footwear manufacturers, and Intel have teamed up for the release of a smartwatch aimed at runners, the RunIQ.

Obviously, it features built-in GIP for tracking course, pace and distance. Just like many other smartwatches out there, RunIQ comes with a heart rate monitor, as well as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity. According to Intel, the battery should offer 24 hours of typical use or up to 5 hours of continuous life with GPS and hear rate monitoring. Play Video Users will also be able to track run time and intervals with a dedicated one-tap LAP button. They can also reply to smartphone notifications when connected to a smartphone or Wi-Fi on the fly. Hardware-wise, RunIQ is powered by an Intel Atom Z34XX processor, coupled with 512MB of RAM and 4GB of storage. It also features a 1.39-inch AMOLED display, as well as accelerometer, gyroscope and optical heart rate monitoring (OHRM). “From professional athletes to everyday consumers, Intel technology is reinventing the boundaries of computing to evolve the way people get fit, stay active and improve their personal performance. Though partnerships with industry leaders and experts, Intel is creating smart and connected products that allow partners to put design and function first to improve everyday experiences,” reads Intel's press release.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (6 Images) #CES 2017#RunIQ smartwatch#Intel smartwatch#Android Wear#New Balance smartwatch subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it RunIQ smartwatch (6 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 06 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Meet “Vapor,” Misfit's First Touchscreen Smartwatch Asus ZenWatch 2 and ZenWatch 3 Updated with Latest Security Fixes, New Features Samsung Might Launch a Smartwatch with Foldable Display Google to Launch Two Flagship Android Wear 2.0 Smartwatches in Early 2017 It's Now Possible to Use openSUSE Inside Windows 10, Here's How to Install It Barnes & Noble Halts Sales of Nook Tablets Due to Faulty Chargers Android Co-Founder Andy Rubin Working on a Premium Bezel-less Smartphone Lenovo Confirms New Moto Smartphones Will Be Unveiled at MWC 2017 Debian GNU/Linux 8.7 "Jessie" Live & Installable ISOs Now Available for Download - Exclusive Linus Torvalds Announces Fourth Linux 4.10 Kernel Release Candidate, Get It Now Debian Outs First Release Candidate of Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch" Installer Sony G3112 and G3221 Smartphones Coming Soon with MediaTek Helio P20 CPUs 6 photos    RunIQ smartwatch New Android APKs imo APK: Updated January 15th, 18:31 GMT AndroDumpper APK: Updated January 15th, 18:29 GMT MCPE Master APK: Updated January 15th, 18:27 GMT SuperSU APK: Updated January 15th, 18:24 GMT Geekbench 4 APK: Updated January 15th, 18:20 GMT Xbox Beta APK: Updated January 15th, 18:17 GMT Action Launcher 3 APK: Updated January 15th, 18:14 GMT Reader comments Lenovo Confirms New Moto Smartphones Will Be Unveiled at MWC 2017 more on: MWC 2017 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Intel 5G Modem, as the device has been called, has a new 5G transceiver paired to its baseband chip, which enables both sub-6Ghz and mmWave capabilities - on which 5G depends. It incorporates 3GPP 5G NR (new radio) technology, including lower latency frame structures, advanced channel coding and massive MIMO, which the company says will help deliver faster connectivity and improve responsiveness. In a blog post, Aicha Evans, VP and GM for the communications and devices group at Intel, said: "Our goal is to support both early trials and to lay a foundation enabling accelerated development of products that will support the 3GPP NR specification and help drive global adoption of the 3GPP 5G standard. "The new Intel 5G Modem is laying the groundwork for new devices capable of enhanced broadband speeds to satisfy media-hungry users." In addition to public media consumption, Evans also cited more practical uses of 5G, including providing super-fast connectivity to autonomous cars, search-and-rescue drones and smart city infrastructure. "Of course it’s the 'unknown' part of 5G’s story that’s most thrilling in my mind," Evans said. "With the right technologies in place and reliable platforms on which to test them, the opportunities to innovate, invent and launch products and services are virtually unlimited." Intel 5G Modem is expected to be distributed as samples in the latter half of this year and move into production "soon afterwards".

The game replaces pre-scanned furniture and other objects with video game scenery in virtual reality. The headset includes technology that allows it to track users' hands and where they are without any external sensors. Scroll down for video  The headset (pictured) includes technology that allows it to track users' hands and where they are without any external sensors, and is able to turn users' living rooms into a 'merged reality' game WHAT PROJECT ALLOY CAN DO  Project Alloy was first unveiled at an Intel keynote speech in August last year. CEO Brian Krzanich said the system will allow users to: 'Pick up your real-world tennis racket in your living room and step virtually onto the court at Wimbledon.  'Surge backward or forward, reach up or down, sway to the left or right — enjoy fully 6 degrees of total freedom in your movement.  He also said it could put people into the middle of a concert, and even: 'Stand on the stage with your favorite band and feel the love of the fans from their point of view.' He added that users could: 'Experience a sporting event, a concert or a film scene from any point of view — and from any position.  'Walk onto the field and right into the goalie box, or join the huddle, looking over the quarterback’s shoulder to see the calls before they’re played.   The technology, demoed at this week's CES 2017 in Las Vegas, will be licensed to manufacturers toward the end of 2017, according to Intel Chief executive Brian Krzanich. Presenting the latest prototype at the CES event yesterday, Mr Krzanuch explained that the headset does not need to connect to a separate PC or power source. It has a battery and computer built directly into the device.  Two players wearing the headset then demonstrated on stage what the technology could do. The headset created a virtual replica of the room using scanned furniture, which Intel calls 'merged reality'. During Intel's demo, bookcases and coffee tables were digitally replaced by video game scenery of a similar size and shape. The replica scenery was designed to fit the game the players were demoing, using their headsets to virtually decorate the room as a futuristic space shuttle. The headset itself will not be manufactured by Intel, but the company will instead offer the technology to other tech companies to build their own products from.

Share this article Share Project Alloy was first unveiled in August last year, but the newest prototype gave the technology its most advanced showing yet. Back when it was first announced, Intel projected that Project Alloy would bridge the gap between Virtual Reality headsets, such as the Oculus Rift, and 'Augmented Reality' headsets, such as the Microsoft HoloLens, which projects holographic data onto the wearer's field of vision. The technology, demoed at this week's CES 2017 in Las Vegas, will be licensed to manufacturers toward the end of 2017, according to Intel Chief executive Brian Krzanich Presenting the latest prototype at the CES event yesterday, Mr Krzanuch explained that the headset does not need to connect to a separate PC or power source - it has a battery and computer built directly into the device During his opening keynote at the 2016 Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich unveiled Project Alloy, describing it as an 'all-in-one virtual reality solution' made from the ground up. 'Merged reality delivers virtual world experiences more dynamically and naturally than ever before – and makes experiences impossible in the real world now possible,' he said. The firm announced it was also working with Microsoft to use the same 'holographic engine' its HoloLens uses, which will be part of Windows 10 next year. 'Next year, we will be releasing an update to Windows 10, which will enable mainstream PCs to run the Windows Holographic shell and associated mixed reality and universal Windows applications,' Microsoft's Terry Myerson said. 'The Windows Holographic shell enables an entirely new experience for multi-tasking in mixed reality, blending 2D and 3D apps at the same time, while supporting a broad range of 6 degrees of freedom devices.'  'With most VR and AR technologies available today, it’s challenging to merge physical, real-life movement and environments with simulated virtual objects, environments and actions, Mr Krzanich wrote in a post explaining the new system. Two players wearing the headset then demonstrated on stage what the technology could do. The headset created a virtual replica of the room using scanned furniture, which Intel calls 'merged reality' During Intel's demo, bookcases and coffee tables were digitally replaced by video game scenery. The replica scenery was designed to fit the game the players were demoing, using their headsets to virtually decorate the room as a futuristic space shuttle 'When it comes down to it, today’s virtual reality isn’t really that virtual. 'You often need a complex set of consoles, multiple sensors and cameras, and hand controllers. 'Merged reality delivers virtual-world experiences more dynamically and naturally than ever before — and makes experiences impossible in the real world now possible.' 'Through merged reality, see your hands, see your friends … see the wall you are about to run into,' the firm said. 'Using Intel RealSense technology, not only can you see these elements from the real world, but you can use your hands to interact with elements of your virtual world, merging realities. ' That means you can 'cut the VR cord,' allowing a free range of motion with 6 degrees-of-freedom across a large space. 'This, combined with collision detection and avoidance, enables the user to utilize physical movement to explore a virtual space,' Intel says.

Segway’s first robot launches to developer partners Posted Jan 5, 2017 by Darrell Etherington (@etherington) 0 SHARES Next Story Better Ventures closes $21 million fund to back the next Tesla or Patagonia Segway’s moving along with its plan to develop its robotics capability, with the launch of its developer edition Loomo robot, the first robot it created and demoed last year at CES. The robot combines a domestic bot with a Segway personal transport, tackling last-mile transportation as well as addressing a host of other in- and around-home uses. Loomo has autonomous capabilities and self-balancing, with an Intel RealSense depth sensor on board, along with an advanced camera and other tools for navigating its surroundings. It’s also outfitted with various connection technologies, a microphone array for voice input, and speakers for two-way communication with users. The Segway Robotics team selected its initial department partners from a large applicant pool numbering in the “thousands,” the company says, who were selected from applicants to its Developer Program, which was announced at Intel’s Developer Forum in Shenzhen this past April. Developer concepts include both hardware and software, and in addition to the Loomo SDK, Segway will offer its partners a bay that allows adding on hardware accessories. Developer kits will start rolling out to partners early this year, with the first to receive including BMW, Intel, MIT Smart Center and Stibo Accelerator. Segway chose the companies because of the range of opportunities they’ll be building with Loomo, which include autonomous driving for BMW; personal robotics and depth capabilities for Intel; medical and elderly care for MIT; and enterprise and consumer safety and retail for Stibo Accelerator. A lot of companies this year, especially automakers, are demonstrating personal transportation solutions including electric scooters and portable shuttles to help address last-mile mobility for users who might be faced with mobility problems. Likewise, there’s a keen interest in personal and home robotics from both big and small companies. A robot that has the potential to combine both successfully would likely be a popular option both with potential partners looking to supplement their own transportation solutions and with companies focused on addressing the opportunities that come along with an aging global population, so it’ll be interesting to see what this group of developer partners comes up with in terms of building out Loomo’s list of abilities.

The chipmaker announced a high-performance computing platform to provide processing power from vehicles to cloud-based datacentres. The company introduced Intel Go, automated driving technology based on Intel’s processor and field programmable gate array (FPGA) chips, which, it claimed, would offer an efficient balance of performance and power while meeting the automotive industry’s stringent thermal and safety requirements. Intel said the Go system would provide a scalable development and compute platform for critical functions in autonomous vehicles, supporting sensor data collection, driving policy, environment modelling, path planning and decision-making. The datacentre component of Go is based on Xeon and Xeon Phi server processors. It will be used to run the machine and deep learning training and simulation infrastructure required for the autonomous driving industry, said Intel. BMW Group will be responsible for the driving control and dynamics, evaluation of overall functional safety including setting up a high-performance simulation engine, overall component integration, production of prototypes and, eventually, scaling the platform via deployment partners. Read more about connected cars Highway Agency sets out strategy for connected vehicles and promises to test fully autonomous cars on motorway network in 2017. The real value of autonomous vehicles could lie in industrial applications. We take a test drive around Milton Keynes to find out. Klaus Fröhlich, member of the board of management at BMW, said: “Making autonomous driving a reality for our customers is the shared ambition behind our cooperation with Intel and Mobileye. This partnership has all the skills and talent necessary to overcome the enormous technological challenges ahead and commercialise self-driving vehicles.” Fröhlich said that during 2017, BMW would be testing its fleet of autonomous vehicles in real traffic conditions in preparation to introduce the company’s first fully autonomous vehicle, the BMW iNext, in 2021. Mobileye said it would contribute its EyeQ®5 computer vision processor to the partnership. EyeQ®5, in combination with Intel CPU and FPGA technologies, forms the central computing platform to be integrated into each autonomous vehicle. EyeQ*5 is used to process and interpret input from 360-degree surround view vision sensors. Mobileye is also working with BMW to develop “sensor fusion”, which it said creates a full model of the environment surrounding the vehicle, using input from vision, radar and lidar sensors, which use lasers to measure distances. Audi also used CES to showcase its latest industry collaboration. The car company said it would be working with graphics processor company Nvidia to use the Nvida Drive PX platform in its autonomous car initiatives. The idea is to use a trained AI neural network running on Drive PX to understand the surrounding road environment, and determine a safe path to drive. Strategic partnership Also at CES, Renault unveiled a strategic technology partnership with OSVehicle, ARM, Pilot and Sensoria to develop an open source platform for autonomous vehicles. Based on the company’s Twizy electric vehicle, Renault has developed POM, a compact and lightweight electric vehicle with bodywork parts removed and an open source automotive platform. Available to startups, independent laboratories, private customers and researchers, the platform can be used by third parties to copy and modify existing software to create a totally customisable electric vehicle, the car company said. “Connected vehicles will enable new business models that deliver a broad range of choices and experiences for end-users,” said Richard York, vice-president of embedded marketing at ARM. “The automotive industry will increasingly focus on the specific functionality that owners want, such as comfort level and entertainment. By providing this platform, Renault is paving the way for innovation in these areas.” Tin Hang and Yuki Liu, founders of OSVehicle, said: “Sharing hardware platforms common to everyone is a new co-creative and horizontal approach that can disrupt this industry, significantly lowering costs and time to market.” SmartDeviceLink consortium Meanwhile, Ford and Toyota announced the SmartDeviceLink consortium, a non-profit organisation working to manage an open source software platform with the goal of giving consumers more choice in how they connect and control smartphone apps on the road. SmartDeviceLink aims to give consumers easy access to smartphone apps by using voice commands and in-vehicle displays. Adopting the open source platform gives auto makers and suppliers a uniform standard with which to integrate apps. Ford and Toyota said developers would benefit by being able to focus on creating the best experience for customers by integrating one linking system for use by all participating car makers. Shigeki Tomoyama, president of Toyota’s Connected Company, said: “Connectivity between smartphones and the vehicle interface is one of the most important connected services. Using SmartDeviceLink, we can provide this service to our customers in a safe and secure manner. We are excited to collaborate with many auto manufacturers and suppliers who share our view.” Ford AppLink software SmartDeviceLink technology is based on Ford’s contribution of its AppLink software to the open source community in 2013. Ford AppLink software is currently available on more than five million vehicles globally. It enables smartphone app developers to integrate their app functions with in-vehicle technology such as the vehicle display screen, steering wheel controls and voice recognition. With this new level of integration, drivers can enjoy their favourite apps on the road in an enhanced, user-friendly way. Doug VanDagens, global director at Ford Connected Vehicle and Services, and a board member of the consortium, said: “Consumers will win with new, innovative app experiences from increased collaboration and developer engagement.” Mazda, PSA, Fuji Heavy Industries and Suzuki are the first car maker members of the consortium. Elektrobit, Luxoft and Xevo join as the first supplier members, and Harman, Panasonic, Pioneer and QNX have signed letters of intent to join.

Share this article Share 23 shares Intel will offer its Intel Go computing platform that uses a variety of sensors and other data to power the brains of the car. Mobileye will be using its proprietary EyeQ5 computer vision processor which gets input from the 360-degree surround view sensors as well as localization.  Nearly all the major global automakers are involved in testing or autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles, with some expecting full autonomy within a few years. The BMW 7 Series (pictured) will be used as the platform for Intel processor and Mobileye computer vision technology during the trials  Last month, BMW revealed that it would test its driverless cars in Munich.  'There is a trained test driver behind the wheel of every car,' Klaus Buettner, BMW's Vice President in charge of Autonomous Driving said.  Uber's rapid growth has prompted BMW to consider how autonomous vehicles may help them accelerate their own push into pay-per-use transport. Software and technology companies like Lyft, Juno and Uber have shaken up the traditional auto industry business model of selling cars by offering customers an alternative to vehicle ownership through smartphone-based ride-hailing services.  Now traditional car companies are expanding their own ride-hailing schemes, while investing in self-driving technology. 'Ride hailing is nothing more than manual autonomous driving,' Tony Douglas, Head of Strategy for BMW's mobility services said.  'Once you dispense with the driver you have a license to print money.' BMW has already made significant progress expanding into the market for car sharing by introducing pay-by-the-minute services like ReachNow in Seattle, Douglas said. 'We had 14,000 people sign up in 4 days, in a market already served by Zipcar, Uber, Lyft and Car2go,' Douglas said. 'Someone else spent the money to educate the market and then we came in with a cool product. We will not be the largest, but we can be the coolest,' Douglas said.  Share or comment on this article e-mail 23 shares Most watched News videos Gloria Williams waves extradition for kidnapping Kamiyah Mobley Kitesurfer unaware of great white shark swimming below Disgusting moment cyst puss eruption covers cell phone Enraged kick-boxer strikes husband's mistress NINE times 2017's luckiest man: Pedro Grendene Bartelle win's $3.5m Man takes his cat Weston Sledding in the snow Sheep attack shepherd after being frightened by a car in Germany She's falling for him?

Credit: Blair Hanley Frank More like this Hands-on with Intel's Project Alloy untethered VR headset Intel eyes chips for mixed reality headsets Sony's PlayStation VR bests HTC Vive in headset shipments Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles Intel is serious about bringing its Project Alloy untethered VR headset to the masses. On Wednesday, company CEO Brian Krzanich said at the company's CES press conference that it will be available in the fourth quarter of 2017. That will be roughly a year and a half after the company announced it at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco. It’s still unknown how much a Project Alloy headset will cost, or even which company will make it. Krzanich said the headsets will be made available through Intel’s hardware partners, but didn’t provide details beyond that. Project Alloy is designed to provide a way for people to experience high-quality virtual reality without having to tether themselves to a computer. It also has front-facing cameras to analyze the environment that users are in and make that a part of the VR experience as well. VR enthusiasts have two options when it comes to headsets: either use a heavy-duty model like an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive tethered to a dedicated machine, or slot a smartphone into a mobile headset like Google’s Daydream View or Samsung Gear VR. Project Alloy is supposed to provide a middle ground. To make all of that work, Project Alloy packs an Intel processor, twin RealSense cameras, a battery, display, headphones and more into a single package that users can wear on their heads. Applications built to take advantage of Alloy can be set up in a mixed reality mode, to either overlay digital assets over a feed of a user’s surroundings, or replace those surroundings entirely with new digital imagery. An Intel demo showed two men playing a shooting game inside of a living room set, with their couch and armchair replaced in the game by other digital objects like a bunker. The HTC Vive and Oculus Rift each allow users to get up and move around while playing, but users are always at risk of tripping over cables, and must set up their rooms specifically to support the VR headsets. It’s not as though the rest of the VR landscape is sitting still, though. Oculus has also pledged to build a standalone Alloy-like unit.

Float64 Support For Intel ANV Vulkan Driver Revised Written by Michael Larabel in Vulkan on 5 January 2017 at 07:53 AM EST. Add A Comment Now that Igalia developers have landed their Haswell FP64 support and thereby hitting OpenGL 4.0 for these older generation Intel graphics processors, the latest Float64 patches have been sent out for the Intel Vulkan "ANV" driver. Samuel Iglesias Gonsálvez of Igalia submitted his third version of these patches for enabling Float64 support inside the Intel Vulkan driver. Float64 for Vulkan is similar to the FP64 extension for OpenGL: allowing double-precision floating-point data types. Back in December was an earlier version of Float64 for the Intel Vulkan driver. Even if you're not interested in doubles support for the Intel Vulkan driver, this support is a prereq for landing other code inside the Intel Mesa OpenGL driver that is needed to advance Haswell's GL level to OpenGL 4.1 and beyond. Samuel commented with today's patches, "Our plan is to land this patch series in master before sending ARB_vertex_attrib64 patches for HSW for review as they depend on some of the patches of this series." ARB_vertex_attrib64 is the current and only blocker for Haswell having OpenGL 4.1+ in their Mesa driver. This Float64 support for the Intel Vulkan driver though is for only Gen8 Broadwell hardware and newer. These latest patches can be found for testing on Mesa-dev.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | January 5, 2017 -- 06:26 GMT (22:26 PST) | Topic: Innovation Brian Krzanich, Intel chief executive officer, displays the Project Alloy all-in-one virtual reality headset at a company news conference on Wednesday, Jan. 4, 2017, in Las Vegas. Walden Kirsch/Intel Corporation Intel is demonstrating at CES this week how virtual reality is ready to move beyond the realm of gaming, thanks to new capabilities like capturing and playing back live, high fidelity video. On January 4, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich and his team outfitted hundreds of reporters with high-powered laptops, Oculus Rift VR headsets, and barf bags. Krzanich led his audience through both pre-recorded and live VR experiences that showed how VR could transform sports and entertainment experiences, as well as work. Using 360-degree, 4K video captured by a drone, the audience went through a live inspection of solar power panels. Krzanich gave examples of other work-related use cases for VR, such as search-and-rescue missions in the ocean or a forest. "It can save lives, it can save money and it can save time," he said. Turning to sports and entertainment, Krzanich demonstrated how Intel plans to use the VR capabilities it acquired with the startup Voke. The audience used their headsets to watch live video of an NCAA basketball game, giving the audience the same view they'd get from sitting in a seat at the game. Along with sporting events, the functionality could allow viewers to get any perspective they want of events like award shows or concerts. Intel will be bringing Voke VR to Oculus Rift later this year, making the company one of the first to enable live sporting events on multiple VR devices. "Viewers get to decide their point of view, viewers will get to decide what seat they have," Krzanich said. Intel is also partnering with the computer vision company HypeVR to bring volumetric video content to Project Alloy -- the reference design for an untethered VR headset that Intel unveiled last year. The chipmaker plans to "productize" Project Alloy headsets in the fourth quarter of this year, Krzanich said, with various hardware partners.
