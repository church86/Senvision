Intel has dropped its long-time support of one of the nation’s biggest science fairs, reportedly over a belief that such events are focusing more on life sciences and biotechnology, which aren’t Intel’s main areas of interest. By Rex Crum | rcrum@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: February 15, 2017 at 2:25 pm | UPDATED: February 15, 2017 at 2:26 pm Top of the Order:   The Fair is Over: For years, Intel has thrown its weight behind efforts to increase interest in science and technology among America’s youth by supporting various different science fairs. Having Intel’s name attached to events like the International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) gave the gathering a sense of gravitas. It was good public relations for Intel, too. But, that’s all coming to an end.

That event is now sponsored by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, while ISEF is looking for a new supporter of its fair. Intel didn’t give a reason for why it was backing off from supporting such science fairs, which are geared toward supporting junior high and high school students interested in science. The New York Times reported that the ISEF event has only grown in popularity as 78 countries and territories participated in the fair last year, up from 22 in 1997, the year before Intel began its sponsorship. So, it seems like a lack of interest in the fair wouldn’t be a reason for Intel dropping its ties to the event. What does seem to be at play is the opinion of Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich. According to the Times, Krzanich has told other Intel officials that the science fairs’ emphasis has shifted more toward life sciences and biotechnology, which fall outside Intel’s main areas of interest. Middle Innings: At a Price Like This: Six months have gone by since Yahoo said it would sell its internet properties (or, pretty much all of itself) to Verizon Communications for $4.8 billion. Since the deal was announced, Yahoo has revealed that it was the victim of a pair of widespread security breaches of its network; one that occurred in 2013, and another in 2014 that affected the email accounts of at least 500 million of its users. And for months, there have been rumors and speculation about what, if anything, Verizon would do about its Yahoo plans. Everything from canceling the deal to cutting the price of its acquisition was said to be possible. Well, now it appears that Verizon is going the route of getting the same thing it was going to buy, but at a discount. Citing unnamed “people familiar with the matter,” Bloomberg said that Verizon is close to renegotiating the deal to shave $250 million from its originally agreed-upon price for Yahoo. The main reason for the discount is the security hacks, and now the deal is expected to close, at last, in the second quarter of this year. Meanwhile, Yahoo also said Wednesday that its users may have been subjected to malicious attacks by hackers using forged cookies to access users’ accounts. Bottom of the Lineup: Here’s a look at how some leading Silicon Valley stocks did Wednesday. Movin’ on Up: Gains came from Genomic Health, RingCentral, Impax Laboratories, QuinStreet and Gilead Sciences. In the Red: Decliners included Lending Club, Infinera, ShoreTel, Jive Software and Finisar. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.6 percent to 5,819.44. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.5 percent to 20,611.86. And the broad-based Standard & Poor’s 500 Index also rose 0.5 percent to end the day at 2,349.25. Quote of the Day: “This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton’s losing campaign.” — President Donald Trump, in a tweet in which he expressed his latest thoughts about ex-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn’s meetings with Russian government officials.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Report: Intel’s 8th gen chips will still use 14nm, will arrive earlier than expected Report: Intel’s 8th gen chips will still use 14nm, will arrive earlier than expected By Joel Hruska on February 13, 2017 at 2:45 pm Comment Last year, Intel announced that it would abandon the Tick-Tock model that had served it for nearly a decade and switch to something called PAO — Process, Architecture, Optimization. The point of switching from a two-step process to a three-step system was to give Intel extra time to roll out its next-generation process nodes, while simultaneously affording more opportunity to eke maximum gains out of each current node. Now, new information suggests Intel may have a product plan that tears up PAO (or at least complicates it) going forward. Analyst Ashraf Eassa claims to have confirmed with Intel that upcoming 8th generation Core processors will use an updated/enhanced variant of 14nm technology yet again — call it 14nm++. Intel was able to squeeze some gains out of Kaby Lake in this fashion compared with Skylake, but they weren’t huge leaps. Image by Anandtech A slide showed by Intel at a recent speech on the future of its data center business confirms this by stating “Data center first to next process node,” Anandtech notes. It also makes the point that enterprise and government spending are only worth a 2% increase in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) while the cloud services business is expected to grow by 15% from 2017-2021. Still, at first glance, this may seem a foolish strategy. After all, AMD’s Ryzen will debut in the imminent future, and one might reasonably conclude that Intel’s best leap forward is with a strong 10nm chip rather than a third iteration on 14nm. But this misses a larger issue — one we’ve discussed multiple times over the past few years. As node shrinks become more difficult and the advantages of any given node shrink are less and less potent, it can take longer for a company to deliver meaningful advantages. Intel is still pursuing full node shrinks, unlike its competitors at GlobalFoundries, Samsung, and TSMC. These firms won’t offer equivalent gate lengths or feature sizes to Intel until they deploy their 10nm nodes and aren’t expected to match Intel’s 10nm until they hit 7nm. This is why Intel can still plausibly claim to be ahead on process technology, despite using a higher number to describe it. Image by Ars Technica When Intel debuted 14nm, it pushed that technology into ultra-mobile parts first, where the reduction in power consumption and improvement of low-power clock speeds was seen as critical to the company’s ability to compete with ARM. As we’ve recently discussed, the improvements to Intel’s low-power CPUs have been considerably larger than the boosts to desktop performance in an equivalent period of time. AMD, prior to Ryzen, has been stuck in a similar scenario. We may be arriving at a point where it makes more sense to keep older nodes around and to improve process nodes and architecture over several generations than it does to aggressively transition to each new node. Earlier this year, Mark Papermaster of AMD made comments to suggest that AMD would stick to 14nm for multiple product generations. It’s not clear how this will play out or how aggressively the smaller CPU manufacturer will use the strategy. But we could be seeing a similar play from Intel, which has already deployed 14nm across three families of processors (Broadwell, Skylake, Kaby Lake) and may be prepping desktop Cannon Lake chips for a fourth. Other foundry manufacturers have begun referring to certain nodes as “long-lived” (28nm, 14/16nm, and possibly 7nm) while others (20nm, 10nm) are being described as short-term nodes. This differentiation didn’t used to exist in semiconductor technology and it indirectly speaks to what Intel may be driving at: Some nodes are better than others for certain types of semiconductors. 8th-gen chips on 14nm are now expected in the second half of 2017 rather than the first half of 2018 as had previously been reported. This could mean Intel wants to push new hardware to compete with Ryzen sooner than later. Intel might defend PAO as a process with an undisclosed number of steps in the “Optimization” portion, rather than a discrete series of changes that was meant to apply to three, and only three, groups of processors. This interpretation is undermined by how Intel raised precisely zero objections last year when the world+dog described PAO as a three-step process compared with the two-stop pendulum model of tick-tock. We may see multiple process nodes gathered together under the 8th Generation Core banner, with ultra-low-power mobile and data center chips moving to 10nm first, while desktop and high-power laptop processors following at a later date.

Come on inside, if you haven't already guessed the winner. Anders Bylund (TMFZahrim) Feb 15, 2017 at 4:31PM Just five months ago, fellow Fool Leo Sun compared the investing theses for Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI). He found NXP to be the better pick, thanks to massive growth opportunities and a low PEG ratio. A lot has changed since that comparison. Intel shares are still trading at roughly the same prices as last September, but NXP got a game-changing buyout bid from sector rival Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). So which one of these semiconductor giants would be the better buy today? Let's have a fresh look. What's going on with NXP? Assuming no new surprises, NXP's future as an investable asset is crystal clear. Qualcomm has offered a firm $110 per NXP share, to be paid in 100% cash, and with all the necessary financing already lined up. The companies are aiming to close their merger by the end of calendar year 2017, but Qualcomm's tender offer has been on the table for nearly two months now. All that's really missing is a handful of regulatory approvals, and this stock is locking in a $110 exit with no questions asked. NXP shares recently traded as much as 13% below Qualcomm's offer price, as investors were rattled by newly crowned President Trump as he tarnished his diplomatic connections to China and Taiwan. NXP and Qualcomm do most of their business in the Middle Kingdom, and the merger could very well be scuttled if Chinese leaders don't get along with America's new administration. But Trump has softened his Taiwanese stance recently, and NXP investors have visibly relaxed. Monday night, NXP shares traded just 7% below Qualcomm's offer price. The big payoff by the end of 2017 is more guaranteed than ever, but the returns of playing this simple strategy have diminished greatly. Image source: Getty Images. The case for Intel Assuming that NXP will get its Qualcomm wedding by the end of 2017, all Intel has to do is beat a 7% return in 11 months or less. Beyond that finish line, investors can reassess their options again. There's certainly room for value creation here. Intel shares are trading at just 17 times trailing earnings, and that's on top of an earnings base that was temporarily lowered in the second quarter of 2016 because of a series of restructuring and cost-cutting moves. If Intel delivers full-year results in line with its own guidance and analyst estimates, the current P/E ratio would lift share prices north of $47. At an even skimpier 15 times trailing earnings, Intel should end 2017 at $42 per share or more. In other words, I wouldn't be surprised to see Intel delivering at least a 17% return by the end of the year -- far ahead of NXP's safe but increasingly unexciting 7% gain. As the PC market continues an unexpected return to reasonable health while Intel is exploring new growth markets in the Internet of Things, I'm more than happy to keep my Intel position intact while staying on NXP's sidelines. This race wasn't even close.  Anders Bylund owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Qualcomm. The Motley Fool recommends Intel and NXP Semiconductors.

Speaking at this year’s RSA Conference, Intel revealed information on its data centre security strategy and additional components. In a presentation, Simon Johnson, Intel’s SGX program architect discussed the reasons why an effective security strategy is built on a foundation of trust rooted in hardware and also why it requires technologies that protect the data through all phases, at-rest, in-flight and in-use. Intel also confirmed the availability of its newest cryptographic isolation technology for data centre usages. The company mentioned that its Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX) being deployed to data centres will allow application developers to protect select code and data from disclosure or modification. Intel SGX is also distinguished from other cryptographic isolation technologies as it addresses all cryptographic isolation at the most granular application level to enable fine-grained data protection within the tightest trust boundary. The technology offers the most granular level of encrypted protection so far in the industry and assures data privacy even if the case of breaches into the OS, BIOS, VMM and other applications. In a blog post, Intel identified that for a long period of time developers have been overwhelmed by the level of security capabilities major platform providers have exposed for application development.

This is what led to the design of Intel SGX, a new model that protects selected code and data from disclosure or modification and also described as “a hardware-assisted trusted execution environment with the smallest possible attack surface.” By using Intel’s trusted execution environment, developers are able to identify and record privacy, secure browsing, DRM, harden end point protection or any high assurance security use case that needs to safely store secrets or protect data. Intel SGX is now available for use on Intel’s Xeon E3 v5 platform, consisting of a set of CPU instructions and platform enhancements to deliver secure locations for application code and associated data.

Stratoscale shows you how Video Getting a bead on tech trends for 2017 IT managers are finding it difficult to keep their applications and data safe in the cloud, and many are slowing cloud adoption because of it. That was one of the findings of an Intel cloud security report that surveyed 2,000 IT professionals in different countries and industries last fall. The issue isn't with the cloud itself, since trust outnumbers distrust for public clouds by more than two to one, according to Intel's survey. IT professionals told Intel that shadow IT and a shortage of cybersecurity skills are causing the most problems. The study showed that 49% of IT professionals said they have slowed cloud adoption because of a lack of cybersecurity skills, and 65% say shadow IT is interfering with keeping the cloud safe and secure. "I think people have bought the story that the cloud is a panacea to them," said Dan Olds, an analyst with OrionX. "They think it must be good because the cloud is the hot thing right now. What I've found in my research is that real data center folks aren't that enthusiastic about the cloud, and they don't think it's more secure." Olds agreed with the survey results that the problem is largely coming from shadow IT, or employees who skirt around their company's IT department to set up applications on their own. "This problem goes directly back to shadow IT," he said. "You're in a marketing unit and you want a cool application up. Rather than going through IT, you just go out and buy it in the cloud. You're going around IT. That can cause a lot of problems. Companies need to get this under control." Judith Hurwitz, an analyst with Hurwitz & Associates, said IT shops should pump the brakes when it comes to jumping on to the cloud, and they should think through all of the security implications. "IT is traditionally skeptical about security issues with the cloud," Hurwitz said. "They are right to reserve judgment. Not all clouds are the same. Some are more secure than others. IT gets the blame if something goes wrong." And company executives need to make it clear that shadow IT is harmful to the company and won't be tolerated, Olds said. "First they need real IT to say, 'We will help you,' and then they need to say there will be penalties for going around them," he added. "The penalties need to be significant." IT needs to take charge of the cloud, especially since the Intel study showed that 62% of the companies surveyed store sensitive customer information in the public cloud. "Companies might look back and find they've gone too far with the cloud and are paying too much for cloud services they have too little control over," Olds said. "I think companies need to understand all the applications they have on premises and on the cloud, and develop some criteria for what can go out on the public cloud and what should never go out to the public cloud." The report was released at the RSA security conference in San Francisco. To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

With this driver update, Intel is finally bringing official support for the Vulkan API (version 1.0.33.0) on Windows. Vulkan targets high-performing real-time 3D graphics applications, like games, while giving low-overhead hardware control over GPU acceleration to developers, enabling games to better handle virtual reality or 4K HDR. This update also contains multiple optimizations to increase performance on popular games like Far Cry Primal, Fallout 4, and Rise of the Tomb Raider.

First Intel abandoned its successful "Tick-Tock" strategy, and now it looks like the new "Process-Architecture-Optimization" approach has gone the same way. By Adrian Kingsley-Hughes for Hardware 2.0 | February 15, 2017 -- 14:30 GMT (06:30 PST) | Topic: Processors Intel's "Tick-Tock" strategy, where each "tick" representing a die shrink was followed up by a "tock" representing a new microarchitecture, served the company well for a good decade before being replaced with a different approach in 2016. But has Intel given up on its new strategy in order to compete against AMD's upcoming Ryzen silicon? Must read: OLED iPhone 8 may finally have the feature that owners have been craving The Internet of Things 10 types of enterprise deployments As businesses continue to experiment with the Internet of Things, interesting use cases are emerging. Here are some of the most common ways IoT is deployed in the enterprise. Read More Intel's new approach was a three-pronged strategy called "Process-Architecture-Optimization," and Kaby Lake chips are a product of this strategy, being an "Optimization" of the Skylake "Architecture" and the "Process" of Broadwell. The idea was that Intel could squeeze three generations of processors from a single architecture. Or that was the plan. But the announcement last week that Intel was going to release 8th-generation chips codenamed Coffee Lake which are based on 14-nanometer architecture, as opposed to the anticipated 10-nanomenter architecture (codenamed Cannon Lake) suggests that the "Process-Architecture-Optimization" strategy might already be abandoned as Intel reuses the architecture for a fourth time. It's doubly interesting given that both last year and earlier this year, Intel denied rumors that the 10-nanometer architecture would be delayed. In fact, rumors that Intel was having trouble with its 10-nanometer die shrink date back to 2015. In spite of Intel seemingly abandoning the "Process-Architecture-Optimization" strategy at the first hurdle, the new Coffee Lake chips are still expected to produce a 15 percent performance boost over its predecessor, although it is unclear whether this refers to desktop or mobile chips. Bear in mind that Intel promised a similar jump between Skylake and Kaby Lake, and this only materialized for desktop chips, and the performance boost was down to clock speed and not instructions per clock. While Intel is being tight-lipped about what's going on here, the broad strokes are pretty clear -- Intel needs new chips to compete against AMD's upcoming Ryzen chips, but 10-nanometer Cannon Lake silicon isn't yet ready, so Intel is forced to squeeze another iteration out of the 14-nanometer architecture. And this might not be the last time. As the architectures get finer, making the jumps will be more difficult, and if Intel is having difficulty transitioning from 14-nanometer to 10-nanometer, future die shrinks are going to be equally -- if not more -- tricky.

Intel beat its initial hiring goals; Microsoft is tying executive compensation to diversity success; and Google says it's made changes to remove pay inequality, even though the diversity of its workforce has remained flat. Apple also claims to have removed pay disparities and has made slight gains on hiring women and people of color. It’s even launched an "Inclusion & Diversity" page with visualizations of its hiring data. But a small group of Apple investors believe the company isn't making progress fast enough, and they're trying to force the company to pick up the pace. "Some of the excuses given by Apple and others — there's not sufficient people in the pipeline, this and that," says investor Tony Maldonado. "Excuse my language, it's bullshit." Apple wants investors to shoot down the proposal Maldonado is leading an effort to mandate that Apple accelerate its work toward becoming a more diverse company. For the second year in a row, he's submitted a shareholder proposal asking that Apple "adopt an accelerated recruitment policy ... to increase the diversity of senior management and its board of directors." If approved, Apple would have to prioritize diversity at the top levels of its organization. How exactly it accomplishes that, and on what timeline, would be entirely up to Apple — but it'd have to do something. Maldonado says that could include tying executive pay to diversity goals, as Intel and Microsoft have done, or adopting a board refreshment policy, requiring the company to regularly explore potential new board members from diverse backgrounds. This year, Maldonado is submitting his proposal alongside Zevin Asset Management, an investment firm that specializes in "socially responsible investing." While that amplifies Maldonado's voice, it still doesn't give him anywhere near the Apple holdings needed to pass the proposal. Maldonado and Zevin will need help from other investors. And right now, there's a major voice standing in their way: Apple. In a filing with the SEC, Apple’s board wrote a note recommending that shareholders vote against the proposal. The company argues that it already has "much broader" diversity efforts at work and, in the past three years, has made "steady progress in attracting more women and underrepresented minorities." The proposed policy, Apple concludes, "is not necessary or appropriate because we have already demonstrated our commitment to a holistic view of inclusion and diversity." Apple declined a request for further comment. The company’s answer isn't good enough for Maldonado. He says Apple is leaning too heavily on retail stores to improve its diversity figures while doing little at the senior level (82 percent of Apple's leadership is white, versus only 56 percent of its retail employees). If that practice continues, Maldonado fears it'll hurt Apple's business in the years to come. “The board and their leadership needs to expand their viewpoints.” "In the long term, this will affect them," he says. "The more this becomes public and the more they provide pushback and resistance to this, then the people [this affects] will happily shop somewhere else." Pat Tomaino, an associate director at Zevin, agrees that Apple faces a "reputational risk" by not addressing diversity. Tomaino also says that Apple risks losing top talent by not casting its "search light as wide as possible" for new engineers and executives. That'll be particularly important, he says, as Apple begins losing longtime employees who are "basically irreplaceable." Maldonado adds that failing to hire more diverse talent could hurt Apple's decision-making abilities when it comes to different areas of the world. The company's efforts in China and India are two particular areas of concern. "The board and their leadership needs to expand their viewpoints, and only by allowing others to come in to provide them their insight will [Apple] be able to tackle those challenge." For Zevin, challenging Apple on diversity is both a financial issue and a social one. Investors are beginning to look for returns in both areas, Tomaino says, and that's led Zevin to work on issues like climate change and improving supply chain conditions. On climate change, Zevin worked with companies to "to get ahead of carbon pricing;" on supply chains, it was about managing reputation. "You have increasingly a large portion of the investment community that is attuned to these issues," Tomaino says. "Most of our colleagues, we choose issues to work on that we know we can move forward," says Tomaino. "With Apple and diversity, the case is clear." For Maldonado, diversity is solely a business issue Maldonado, who is Hispanic, makes a pure business case for diversity. He identifies as a "fiscally conservative, socially moderate person," clarifies that he doesn't want this turned into "a social justice warrior issue," and says he's simply "looking at things in black and white in terms of money." He’s also a “diehard” Trump supporter, who ends many of his tweets with “#MAGA” and says he both donated to and volunteered for the campaign. "I know it sounds as if it's socially progressive, but it's not a socially progressive issue," he says. "Money talks, okay?" Maldonado says Apple's leadership diversity became an issue for him after his son brought it up a few years ago. "I was actually quite blind to this as an investor and a business person," he says. "I dug into it and saw Apple has rarely ever had many people of ethnic or racial diversity within their board or senior leadership," he says. For a 40-year-old company “that’s laughable. That's racism plain and simple. That's all it is. There has to be plenty of people with sufficient qualifications.” At the company's 2015 shareholder’s meeting, Maldonado managed to get a question in with Apple CEO Tim Cook. He wasn't happy with the answer. "Tim Cook was very defensive, and he presented the two black people on their leadership — but not senior leadership — as a sign of their diversity," Maldonado says. "Personally, I took it as an insult. They were put on the spotlight as 'here's tokenism,' and he didn't seem to accept that." Six percent is this year’s goal Later that year, Maldonado filed his proposal with Apple for the first time. The company tried to have the proposal dismissed, but was ultimately shot down by the SEC. It went up for consideration at Apple's 2016 shareholder’s meeting, where it received only 5.1 percent of the vote. That may have been an overwhelming failure, but it was high enough — above 3 percent — to allow Maldonado to submit the proposal again this year (missing the target would have let Apple bar similar proposals for three years). It’ll go up for a vote again at the company's shareholder’s meeting on February 28th. Maldonado doesn't expect to win this year, but he's hoping to get enough support to keep the proposal going. This time, the threshold he needs to reach is 6 percent in order to resubmit. "If I can reach six percent," he says, "then I can live again to fight another day."

Intel beat its initial hiring goals; Microsoft is tying executive compensation to diversity success; and Google says it's made changes to remove pay inequality, even though the diversity of its workforce has remained flat. Apple also claims to have removed pay disparities and has made slight gains on hiring women and people of color. It’s even launched an "Inclusion & Diversity" page with visualizations of its hiring data. But a small group of Apple investors believe the company isn't making progress fast enough, and they're trying to force the company to pick up the pace. "Some of the excuses given by Apple and others — there's not sufficient people in the pipeline, this and that," says investor Tony Maldonado. "Excuse my language, it's bullshit." Apple wants investors to shoot down the proposal Maldonado is leading an effort to mandate that Apple accelerate its work toward becoming a more diverse company. For the second year in a row, he's submitted a shareholder proposal asking that Apple "adopt an accelerated recruitment policy ... to increase the diversity of senior management and its board of directors." If approved, Apple would have to prioritize diversity at the top levels of its organization. How exactly it accomplishes that, and on what timeline, would be entirely up to Apple — but it'd have to do something. Maldonado says that could include tying executive pay to diversity goals, as Intel and Microsoft have done, or adopting a board refreshment policy, requiring the company to regularly explore potential new board members from diverse backgrounds. This year, Maldonado is submitting his proposal alongside Zevin Asset Management, an investment firm that specializes in "socially responsible investing." While that amplifies Maldonado's voice, it still doesn't give him anywhere near the Apple holdings needed to pass the proposal. Maldonado and Zevin will need help from other investors. And right now, there's a major voice standing in their way: Apple. In a filing with the SEC, Apple’s board wrote a note recommending that shareholders vote against the proposal. The company argues that it already has "much broader" diversity efforts at work and, in the past three years, has made "steady progress in attracting more women and underrepresented minorities." The proposed policy, Apple concludes, "is not necessary or appropriate because we have already demonstrated our commitment to a holistic view of inclusion and diversity." Apple declined a request for further comment. The company’s answer isn't good enough for Maldonado. He says Apple is leaning too heavily on retail stores to improve its diversity figures while doing little at the senior level (82 percent of Apple's leadership is white, versus only 56 percent of its retail employees). If that practice continues, Maldonado fears it'll hurt Apple's business in the years to come. “The board and their leadership needs to expand their viewpoints.” "In the long term, this will affect them," he says. "The more this becomes public and the more they provide pushback and resistance to this, then the people [this affects] will happily shop somewhere else." Pat Tomaino, an associate director at Zevin, agrees that Apple faces a "reputational risk" by not addressing diversity. Tomaino also says that Apple risks losing top talent by not casting its "search light as wide as possible" for new engineers and executives. That'll be particularly important, he says, as Apple begins losing longtime employees who are "basically irreplaceable." Maldonado adds that failing to hire more diverse talent could hurt Apple's decision-making abilities when it comes to different areas of the world. The company's efforts in China and India are two particular areas of concern. "The board and their leadership needs to expand their viewpoints, and only by allowing others to come in to provide them their insight will [Apple] be able to tackle those challenge." For Zevin, challenging Apple on diversity is both a financial issue and a social one. Investors are beginning to look for returns in both areas, Tomaino says, and that's led Zevin to work on issues like climate change and improving supply chain conditions. On climate change, Zevin worked with companies to "to get ahead of carbon pricing;" on supply chains, it was about managing reputation. "You have increasingly a large portion of the investment community that is attuned to these issues," Tomaino says. "Most of our colleagues, we choose issues to work on that we know we can move forward," says Tomaino. "With Apple and diversity, the case is clear." For Maldonado, diversity is solely a business issue Maldonado, who is Hispanic, makes a pure business case for diversity. He identifies as a "fiscally conservative, socially moderate person," clarifies that he doesn't want this turned into "a social justice warrior issue," and says he's simply "looking at things in black and white in terms of money." He’s also a “diehard” Trump supporter, who ends many of his tweets with “#MAGA” and says he both donated to and volunteered for the campaign. "I know it sounds as if it's socially progressive, but it's not a socially progressive issue," he says. "Money talks, okay?" Maldonado says Apple's leadership diversity became an issue for him after his son brought it up a few years ago. "I was actually quite blind to this as an investor and a business person," he says. "I dug into it and saw Apple has rarely ever had many people of ethnic or racial diversity within their board or senior leadership," he says. For a 40-year-old company “that’s laughable. That's racism plain and simple. That's all it is. There has to be plenty of people with sufficient qualifications.” At the company's 2015 shareholder’s meeting, Maldonado managed to get a question in with Apple CEO Tim Cook. He wasn't happy with the answer. "Tim Cook was very defensive, and he presented the two black people on their leadership — but not senior leadership — as a sign of their diversity," Maldonado says. "Personally, I took it as an insult. They were put on the spotlight as 'here's tokenism,' and he didn't seem to accept that." Six percent is this year’s goal Later that year, Maldonado filed his proposal with Apple for the first time. The company tried to have the proposal dismissed, but was ultimately shot down by the SEC. It went up for consideration at Apple's 2016 shareholder’s meeting, where it received only 5.1 percent of the vote. That may have been an overwhelming failure, but it was high enough — above 3 percent — to allow Maldonado to submit the proposal again this year (missing the target would have let Apple bar similar proposals for three years). It’ll go up for a vote again at the company's shareholder’s meeting on February 28th. Maldonado doesn't expect to win this year, but he's hoping to get enough support to keep the proposal going. This time, the threshold he needs to reach is 6 percent in order to resubmit. "If I can reach six percent," he says, "then I can live again to fight another day."

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 15 February 2017 by Military News Society for Science & the Public Launches Campaign to Identify Title Sponsor of the International Science and Engineering Fair — the World’s Largest STEM Competition WASHINGTON, Feb. 15, 2017 — The Society for Science & the Public (the Society) announced today that it is seeking a new title sponsor for the nearly 70-year-old International Science and Engineering Fair, the world’s largest international high school STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) competition. The International Science and Engineering Fair is the world’s premier STEM competition and stands on the value of ensuring all young people from around the world can be inspired to compete and become the next generation of innovators and entrepreneurs. The title sponsorship of this event is now available for only the second time in its storied history. Intel became the title sponsor in 1997 and renewed that sponsorship through 2019. A new sponsor will assume the sole title sponsorship in May 2019. Each year, millions of high school students from around the globe enter this most powerful STEM talent pipeline. These students — tomorrow’s leading scientists, engineers, innovators and entrepreneurs — strive to discover answers and develop new solutions to humanity’s greatest problems. The Society will initiate and manage a competitive process to find its new title sponsor for the International Science and Engineering Fair. A Request for Proposal is being made available today at https://www.societyforscience.org/future-isef. Interested entities should visit the site to learn more about sponsorship details. The next sponsor will commit at least $15 million annually for a minimum sponsorship term of five years. „We are at an inflection point. Our next sponsor has an extraordinary opportunity to inspire and impact future generations of scientific leaders, innovators and entrepreneurs,” said Maya Ajmera, President and CEO of Society for Science & the Public and Publisher of Science News. „This competition and its affiliated science fairs held across the globe reach young people like no other program can, igniting their passion for science and their desire to discover innovative solutions to some of our world’s most intractable problems.” The International Science and Engineering Fair has been cultivating and celebrating the world’s most powerful STEM talent pipeline since its launch in 1950, and has provided more than $100 million in awards to competing students. The competition identifies and fosters the best and brightest minds through its more than 425 affiliated fairs in more than 75 countries, regions and territories globally. Tens of millions of students compete in science fairs every year around the globe at local, state, regional and national levels, with hundreds of thousands then rising to compete in the Society’s affiliated fairs. Top winners at these fairs — about 1,800 students representing the top talent — are selected as finalists each year and earn the right to travel to and compete at the culminating International Science and Engineering Fair held each May. This weeklong event hosts the student finalists as they are given the opportunity to showcase their independent research and compete for (on average) more than $4 million in prizes, scholarships and awards. Also attending are nearly 8,000 additional people including volunteer judges, alumni, members of the global science fair community, local school children and their educators, distinguished guests and members of the media. The event is hosted in the United States, and provides significant economic impact to the host city, most recently estimated as $13.1 million to Los Angeles in 2014, $9.3 million to Phoenix in 2016 and $7.2 million to Pittsburgh in 2015. „Sponsorship of the International Science and Engineering Fair spans global borders, providing an invaluable platform that ensures we can identify and develop the next generations of top young scientists, engineers and innovators,” said Craig Barrett, former CEO and Chairman of the Board of Intel Corporation and current Society Trustee. „These young people make the world a better place for all of us.” The International Science and Engineering Fair presents an extraordinary opportunity for the next sponsor to inspire, connect with and directly support top high school students in their local communities and on a global stage. The program enables the next sponsor to establish a global legacy of fostering and advancing all sciences, while inspiring the next generations of scientific entrepreneurs, innovators and leaders. Exclusive title sponsorship also generates deep and meaningful access to a global talent pipeline as well as the chance to build significant reputational capital and awareness among a broad network of global leaders and influencers, and with the general public. Since 1997, the International Science and Engineering Fair has grown from 27 participating countries, regions and territories to 78 in 2016, and annual awards to participating students have increased from about $1 million in 1997 to about $4 million in 2016. In total over these past 20 years, more than $80 million has been awarded to International Science and Engineering Fair participants by sponsors and awarding organizations. „Intel is extremely proud of our nearly two-decade partnership with Society for Science & the Public and the millions of amazing young scientists and technologists who have inspired us through their talents and passion for changing the world,” said Rosalind Hudnell, Intel Vice President of Corporate Affairs and President of the Intel Foundation. „We are committed to supporting a world-class Intel International Science and Engineering Fair through 2019, and to continuing to inspire, educate and engage the next generation of innovators in the U.S. and around the globe.” The annual program and competition celebrates tomorrow’s leaders, innovators and entrepreneurs — while presenting the title sponsor the opportunity to inspire, connect with and directly support an unparalleled talent pipeline and alumni community on a global stage. In its nearly 70 years, the International Science and Engineering Fair has yielded thousands of distinguished alumni, including top innovators and entrepreneurs as well as recipients of the world’s most coveted science and math honors such as the Nobel Prize, National Medal of Science, Breakthrough Prize, Lasker Award and MacArthur Fellowship. The Society’s search for a new sponsor follows the recent transformational sponsorship by Regeneron of the Science Talent Search (the Society’s program for U.S. high school seniors) from 2017—2026 for $100 million; and the renewal from the Broadcom Foundation of the Society’s premier middle school science competition, Broadcom MASTERS, through 2021.  About Society for Science & the Public Society for Science & the Public is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit membership organization dedicated to the achievement of young researchers in independent research and to public engagement in science. Established in 1921, its vision is to promote the understanding and appreciation of science and the vital role it plays in human advancement.

Democrats are planning multiple press conferences across the Capitol today to again highlight what they say are too-cozy ties between Trump’s White House and the Kremlin, push for an independent probe and roll out bipartisan Russian sanctions legislation. So far, most Republicans have resisted joining with Democrats to demand an independent investigation into Trump's ties to Russia but that could change as more news leaks out about his campaign's communications with the Kremlin. So far investigators have found no evidence of cooperation between Russia and Trump’s campaign to sway the election but “the intercepts alarmed American intelligence and law enforcement agencies, in part because of the amount of contact that was occurring while Mr. Trump was speaking glowingly about the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin,” report Michael Schmidt, Mark Mazzetti and Matt Apuzzo for the New York Times. More: http://nyti.ms/2lP0Bof A house divided: A growing number of Senate Republicans are calling for further investigation into Flynn’s conversations with Russia but the GOP is still largely united against Democrats’ demands for an independent probe into connections between Trump and Russia. Some GOP lawmakers suggested Flynn will likely have to testify before the House and Senate Intel Committees, which are both leading an investigation into Russia’s election meddling. But House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes seems more content to praise the former national security adviser than anything else. Flynn “deserves America’s gratitude and respect,” Nunes said in a statement. Republicans investigate Republicans? No. Nunes “told CNN that he wants to investigate how transcripts of Flynn’s calls with [the Russian ambassador] got leaked — not the impact of the calls themselves,” Elana and Kyle report. Later on Fox News radio Tuesday, Sen. Rand Paul suggested Republicans shouldn’t investigate other Republicans in the first place. “I just don’t think it’s useful to be doing investigation after investigation, particularly of your own party,” Paul said. “We’ll never even get started with doing the things we need to do like repealing Obamacare if we’re spending our whole time having Republicans investigate Republicans.” BIBI ON THE HILL — Following lunch at the White House, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be on the Hill today for meetings with top congressional leaders. Netanyahu will sit down with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer at 5:15 p.m. He’ll then cross the Capitol for a 6:45 p.m. meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. PUZDER ‘VOWED REVENGE,’ EX-WIFE CLAIMED — Labor secretary nominee Andrew Puzder’s ex-wife told Oprah in 1990 he “vowed revenge” after she went public with allegations of abuse. Lisa Fierstein, Puzder’s ex-wife, said he told her, “’I will see you in the gutter. This will never be over. You will pay for this,’” report Marianne Levine and Timothy Noah after reviewing the tape Tuesday night. Puzder’s confirmation hearing is set for tomorrow but four Republicans have already expressed reservations about his nomination. Fierstein has since retracted the abuse allegations. Much more: http://politi.co/2lOLsn0 WHICH WAY IS THE RIGHT WAY? The GOP's intra-party warfare over Obamacare reignited this week after conservatives agreed to make a concerted push to dismantle the health care law immediately, something moderates say would be disastrous. Now doubts are growing that the GOP can even reach agreement on how to repeal Obamacare, despite having control of both Congress and the White House. House Speaker Paul Ryan crossed the Capitol Tuesday for lunch, seeking to ease Senate GOP concerns about House progress on the healthcare rollback. But not everyone was buying it. Sen. Rand Paul left before it was over, saying he was hearing “things that are unacceptable to me.” Today Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price will attend lunch with Senate Republicans but “it may take a direct intervention from Trump to get the party's warring factions in line,” report Burgess, Josh Dawsey, Rachael and Jen Haberkorn. “It’s hard to see how this gets done unless the president says, ‘OK, let’s do it this way,’” said Senate HELP Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander.

These centers provide comprehensive health care for women but do not perform abortions or harvest fetal body parts. Polling shows the majority of Americans support this effort. http://bit.ly/3kWW0mi ** DEMS BLAST CANCELED IMMIGRATION MEETING — House Democrats were fuming Tuesday after the top federal immigration official abruptly canceled an afternoon meeting with leaders of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus over recent deportation raids. CHC Chairwoman Michelle Lujan Grisham told Huddle it was clear after a phone conversation with ICE acting director Thomas Homan that he scrapped the meeting for political “cover.” Grisham and other Dems said they think Homan wasn’t ready to answer questions about the more than 680 people arrested last week, including at least one Dreamer, in what they fear could be the start of “mass deportations.” A bipartisan meeting with ICE is now scheduled for Thursday. WH ‘SHOULD DO SOMETHING’ ON CONWAY — House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz says the White House “should do something” to discipline adviser Kellyanne Conway. His remarks come after the Office of Government Ethics said Conway committed a “clear violation” by plugging Ivanka Trump’s clothing line on TV last week. “We’re going to see what the White House does at this point,” Chaffetz told the Huffington Post Tuesday. “I don’t know what the proper remedy is. It is a first-time offense. I’m not trying to make any excuses for it, but I want the White House to let us know what they’re doing.” Paul Blumenthal with more: http://huff.to/2lOOtnk Speaking of Chaffetz, he sent a letter to the White House Tuesday demanding to know “details on why President Donald Trump conducted some of his response to a North Korean missile test in a public dining room at his Mar-a-Lago club,” Kyle reports. “White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Tuesday that no classified material was discussed in public, and that Trump was briefed in a secure location both before and after his dinner. But Chaffetz said that assurance may not be enough.” More: http://politi.co/2lOWOrl TROUBLE’S A BREWIN’ — Trump’s plan to funnel billions of more dollars to the Pentagon to “load up” the military is threatening to blow open a rift between budget and defense hawks over just how much should be spent on defense and whether the plus-up should be offset elsewhere. Top defense hawks like Sen. Lindsey Graham say they’re willing to back the defense spending surge without paying for it. But fiscal hardliners like Sens. Rand Paul and Ted Cruz “worry the GOP will abandon its mission of reining in red ink now that the Obama administration is in the rearview mirror,” Austin Wright and Jeremy Herb report. Much more: http://politi.co/2kRSetU On a related note, GOP Sens. Thad Cochran and John McCain say they’re concerned about Rep. Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s nominee to lead the OMB, because of his previous hardline stances on defense spending. Sen. Susan Collins also said she hasn’t made a decision on whether to support Mulvaney, whose confirmation vote is expected later this week. Three GOP defections could sink Mulvaney's nomination. CNN’s Manu Raju: http://cnn.it/2lgLzKB WALDEN’S SILVER LINING — Given how much he’s on the Hill, Vice President Mike Pence really seems to be loving his new House digs. But he had to boot House Energy and Commerce Chairman Greg Walden out of the hideaway space first. “If you’re going to lose your hideaway, its better to lose it to the vice president of the United States than some other shmuck, right?” Walden said. “He said I can keep a key but I doubt the Secret Service will allow it.” EXTRA, EXTRA: An 'absolutely crazy' time for a meeting with POTUS.

Anthony List: Despite receiving over $550 million tax dollars a year, Planned Parenthood's cancer screening and prevention services have dropped by 57% since 2010. Additionally, contraceptive services dropped by 20% since 2010. Community health centers outnumber Planned Parenthood facilities 20:1 nationwide: Women don't need Planned Parenthood. Just this December, after reviewing over 20,000 documents, the Senate Judiciary Committee referred Planned Parenthood to the Department of Justice and the FBI for potential criminal prosecution for trafficking fetal body parts from abortions for profit. And despite claiming to offer prenatal services, undercover investigators discovered fewer than 6% of facilities surveyed provided prenatal services. A 2015 nationwide poll showed 53% of Americans support redirecting tax dollars to federally qualified community health centers. Congress should redirect taxpayer dollars to community health centers that provide real healthcare for women. http://bit.ly/3kWW0mi ** « View Archives This story tagged under: Congress Most Read FBI releases files on Trump apartments' race discrimination probe in '70s Trump to take breather from White House, hold rally this weekend Trump blames ‘fake media’ for treating Flynn ‘very unfairly’ Trump, asked about anti-Semitism, brags about election victory Poll: Trump trails generic Democrat, but not Warren, in 2020 ‘Real News’ Joins the White House Briefing Room ‘An Absolutely Crazy Time to Hold a Meeting with the President of the United States’ Fallon responds to Trump: He's trying to distract from 'very serious allegations' about Russia Congress blocks rule barring mentally impaired from guns House intel chairman dismisses call for expanded Russia probe Huddle - POLITICO Archive Wednesday, 2/15/17 Tuesday, 2/14/17 Monday, 2/13/17 Friday, 2/10/17 Thursday, 2/9/17 View the Full Huddle Archives » Politico Magazine Congress Needs to Investigate the Flynn Case By Rich Lowry Does Kicking Out Mexicans Create Jobs?

There are many components that make up the data industry, from software companies to cloud players, data centres, telecoms companies and more. As part of Data Week, we will list all the major constituents of the industry in Ireland. On Monday, we provided a list of the top players in telecoms and yesterday, we listed 20 leading cloud service providers. Today, we feature internet of things (IoT) enablers. Stay tuned for the global data carriers connecting our shores to the world, culminating in a final list on Friday that incorporates data centres in Ireland. Analog Devices Founded in 1965 by Ray Stata and Matthew Lorber, Analog Devices is now one of the largest semiconductor businesses in the world and has rapidly adapted to the growing IoT market. Celebrating its 40th anniversary in Ireland last year, where it now employs 1,200 people, the company made a strategic move to buy its rival Linear Technology for $14.8bn last July. It also bought LiDAR developer Vescent Photonics to expand the company’s capabilities with autonomous driving tech. Asavie From its Dublin HQ, Asavie has developed the award-winning PassBridge platform to make IoT connectivity that bit easier. Connecting myriad ‘things’ to the internet is no easy task. There are multiple protocols and standards, ever-evolving cellular technologies, and varying device capabilities and requirements to navigate. PassBridge has helped Asavie hook in more than 20 operators seeking to quickly launch scalable and secure mobile and IoT projects, including AT&T, Three, Vodafone and Eir Business. DecaWave One of Ireland’s most exciting young companies, DecaWave creates wireless devices that can be located indoors to an accuracy of 10cm. By last summer, the company had already deployed over 1m internet of things chips globally. Having raised $30m in funding to date, its ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless technology has close to 1,000 customers throughout the world. DecaWave is headquartered in Dublin, with offices in France, China and South Korea. Eir Last year, Eir joined forces with Irish IoT player Asavie to build an IoT Connect platform that can be used by small and large companies, from healthcare to transport and manufacturing, to connect machines to the internet and gather real-time intelligent data. This will see Eir’s cellular network be employed by businesses to connect machines in the field via a self-care portal that firms can log in to over a public cloud, or through a VPN. Image: Besjunior/Shutterstock Firmwave Firmwave is a product and solution design company that specialises in designing ultra-low power hardware and firmware for IoT and wearable devices. Based at GEC in Dublin, Firmwave is targeting the emerging IoT sensors market that is predicted to reach $34.75bn by 2023. It also has offices in Gdansk Technology Park, Poland. Last summer, the company partnered with Asavie on a low-power, wireless sensor network platform in the US. Ericsson A tactile IoT that anticipates needs, rather than waiting to be instructed, is the focus of Ericsson’s 1,600-strong workforce in Dublin and Athlone. In 2014, Ericsson revealed plans to create 120 new software roles in the two areas. The global telecom giant’s legacy in technology is enduring, with the next generation focused on 5G, IoT, fibre, VR and more. The company currently has 800 people focused on next-generation software, and 400 involved in a global consulting hub. IBM The company known as ‘Big Blue’ is investing heavily in the world of IoT, proving its clout as a leader in the connected world. Claire Penny, IoT leader for IBM, recently spoke about the potential of the Watson supercomputer in industries such as healthcare. Just last week, IBM and Ericsson revealed 5G tech 10 times more powerful than ever before, with “potential to unleash and inspire brand new ideas and innovations we haven’t yet imagined”. Intel/Movidius Since establishing in Ireland in 1989, Intel is one of the top employers in the country. The local operation supplies a significant proportion of the company’s 14nm chips to the rest of the world. Intel Ireland has also played a key role in developing Intel’s Galileo board for IoT, which was designed in Ireland. In September 2016, Irish company Movidius was acquired by Intel. Movidius designs low-power processor chips for computer vision and deep learning. The company is headquartered in California and has two design centres in Dublin and Romania. Movidius recently signed a deal with Google for the company’s chips to feature on smartphones that can sense their immediate environment. Image: Besjunior/Shutterstock Johnson Controls Johnson Controls is a global technology and IoT company, designing, fitting and monitoring intelligent buildings such as hospitals, airports and manufacturing facilities. The company also works to support IoT, managing data centres built to house the data created by connected devices (and structures). Following a 2016 merger with Irish security systems company Tyco, the US-headquartered Johnson Controls operates out of an additional location in Cork. Nokia Bell Labs The legacy of Alexander Graham Bell continues through the work of Nokia subsidiary Bell Labs in Dublin, where an R&D group has achieved a number of firsts, including the first lightRadio transatlantic calls. Bell Labs became a part of Nokia when the latter revealed plans to acquire Alcatel-Lucent for €15.6bn. The acquisition will lay the foundation for the next wave of technological change driven by 5G and IoT. PCH Cork is the global headquarters of Liam Casey’s PCH, a $1bn-a-year supply chain player focused on professional services around IoT. The company, which also has offices in San Francisco and Shenzhen in China, devises the design and manufacture of connected devices. In the past year, PCH has been cultivating specialised relationships with consumer brands in the fashion, luxury and health markets, including alliances with brands like Johnson & Johnson and L’Oréal. S3 Group Founded in Dublin back in 1986, S3 has focused its business on two areas: the design and supply chain management of advanced semiconductors, as well as cloud and data analytics services for the health sector. Of particular interest to S3 is the design of semiconductors for satellite communications and the field of industrial IoT. Image: Besjunior/Shutterstock SAP As well as handling a myriad of business support functions for German software giant SAP, Dublin is also home to SAP’s App Haus, as well as its BusinessObjects’ R&D centre, which develops business analytics. Specifically, App Haus works with start-ups on SAP’s next-generation in-memory computing platform SAP HANA, which can be harnessed to manage and deploy real-time IoT and machine-to-machine applications. Three Three is one of Ireland’s most prolific data carriers. When it comes to IoT, according to ComReg in Q2 2016, Three Group had the largest market share of M2M subscriptions, at 50.1pc. In early 2016, Three announced the roll-out of 4G Plus, to allow users to access speeds of up to 225Mbps on the move. Taoglas Irish IoT company Taoglas designs and manufactures antennas that enable M2M connectivity for wireless devices. The Wexford-headquartered announced a $2m investment in a state-of-the-art San Diego IoT centre early last year. Other investments in Taiwan, Germany and France give the company an international footprint. Now, Taoglas is reaching for the stars. The company received funding from the European Space Agency last month, which will be put towards its telecoms research. Vodafone Beyond offering mobile and fixed data connections to Irish consumers, Vodafone also uses its networks to support IoT. ComReg reported that in Q2 2016, Vodafone had a 43.9pc share of M2M subscriptions. Through its Siro partnership with ESB, Vodafone aims to bring high-speed broadband access to rural Ireland. In November, Vodafone revealed that it is planning to invest €250m in 2017 in a network and IT transformation programme to deliver its plan for the Gigabit Society. VT Networks Founded in 2015 by Mark Bannon and Will Ferguson, VT Networks successfully raised €1.2m last year to roll out Ireland’s first IoT network. Using Sigfox technology, the nationwide network went live in June 2016 and aims to connect 1m devices by the end of this year. Bannon believes that the future of IoT lies in creating products with zero battery consumption, noting specific potential with sensors in the agricultural sector. Wia Wia, led by Conall Laverty, is an NDRC-based IoT start-up that originated in Belfast, and aims to provide makers with a platform to bring home and school projects to life. The company is targeting both consumers and businesses. Wia’s SDK provides an interface between a hardware device and its real-time service. With just a few lines a code, a developer can create a production-ready product, as well as a complementary mobile app. In-Depth: Data Week Related: Movidius, Intel, Bell Labs, data, pch, SAP, Ericsson, DecaWave, Analog Devices, Vodafone, internet of things, Asavie, Eir, wireless, IBM, networks, Three Editor John Kennedy is an award-winning technology journalist. editorial@siliconrepublic.com You May Also Like You May Also Like Enterprise Data for Dummies: The essential data glossary 3 hours ago9 Shares Hiring Now Join us to create the technology of tomorrow Innovation for mobility and the internet of things Keeps files safe, synced and easy to share A dynamic and rapidly expanding company Jobs 6 top international companies hiring in data right now 20 hours ago10 Shares Enterprise Smart steps for securing your employees’ smartphones 22 hours ago64 Shares SUBSCRIBE TO OUR E-ZINE Sign up to receive weekly alerts bringing the best of Siliconrepublic.com straight to your inbox.

The CEO announced that Intel will invest $7 billion to complete a manufacturing facility in Arizona. Fab 42 will create about 3,000 full-time Intel jobs and more than 10,000 jobs in Arizona to run and support the factory, he said in an e-mail to his employees. “The completion of Fab 42 in 3 to 4 years will directly create approximately 3,000 high-tech, high-wage Intel jobs for process engineers, equipment technicians, and facilities-support engineers and technicians who will work at the site. Combined with the indirect impact on businesses that will help support the factory’s operations, Fab 42 is expected to create more than 10,000 total long-term jobs in Arizona,” Krzanich said in a press release. #Intel Corp. announces $7 billion investment in #Arizona plant https://t.co/Z59VcbhWC7 — FOX Business (@FoxBusiness) February 9, 2017 “Intel is a global manufacturing and technology company, yet we think of ourselves as a leading American innovation enterprise,” Krzanich added. “America has a unique combination of talent, a vibrant business environment and access to global markets, which has enabled U.S. companies like Intel to foster economic growth and innovation. Our factories support jobs — high-wage, high-tech manufacturing jobs that are the economic engines of the states where they are located,” he added. The seven nanometer (nm) chips that the company is targeting for this factory will power state-of-the-art computers, data centers, and other high-tech devices. They will enable amazing breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, automated driving, medical research and treatment, and the factories of the future, the release stated. “Leading-edge technologies like 7 nm require an increasing amount of factory space per wafer. These two factors have driven Intel to a point where we must get to work and build out another factory for 7 nm capacity. These state-of-the-art factories take a couple of years to build out capacity and begin the start-up process. As a result, we made the decision to start the process now. We are excited to begin this journey to build the world’s most advanced and complex factory producing Intel’s 7 nm technology,” he said. He added that Intel has maintained this U.S.-based manufacturing even though approximately 80 percent of their products are sold outside the U.S. “We support the Administration’s policies to level the global playing field and make U.S. manufacturing competitive worldwide through new regulatory standards and investment policies,” he said, adding that government policies play a critical role in enabling and sustaining American-driven innovation. “At Intel we meet with governments from around the world, discussing and debating issues and policies important to our business, employees, and shareholders. When we disagree, we don’t walk away. We believe that we must be part of the conversation to voice our views on key issues such as immigration, H1B visas and other policies that are essential to innovation,” he said. Shedding light on Fab 42, Ann Kelleher, Intel vice president and general manager of Technology and Manufacturing Group at Intel Corporation, said that the firm started building the facility in 2011. “Fab 42 is a factory that we originally started building in 2011, aiming for our 14-nanometer technology. Then, based on a number of manufacturing efficiencies, we were able to defer using Fab 42 because we were able to fit the 14 nm capacity into our existing factory on the Arizona site. Since we deferred Fab 42, we’ve been consistently saying, “Yes, we will need Fab 42 for future space, capacity and for future technologies.” Well, that time has come. So we’re starting to prepare Fab 42 for 7 nanometer,” she said. #SuperBowl 2017 #ArtificialIntelligence #AI, #IoT and #LadyGaga Lighting Extravaganza with #Intel Drones https://t.co/BhvEEdXuvy pic.twitter.com/t4lRdfJtd5 — VCloud News (@VCloudNews) February 12, 2017 Hopefully, President Donald Trump’s initiative will provide more job opportunities to Americans.

Reg readers vote Tom Baker for Doctor 13. Of course More like this Intel Itanium Hpe Data Center Servers Next Superdome CPU chips amble into HPE Intel shipping Kittson samples into Itanium-land Itanium Poulson (8500) die 15 Feb 2017 at 11:01, Chris Mellor There have been reports that Intel has already started shipping its latest, Kittson version, Itanium processor chip. The current Itanium processors are the 9500 series, code-named Poulson, and introduced in 2012. There are four versions: 9520, 9540, 9550 and 9560. HPE uses Itanium chips in its high-end Superdome 2 servers, running the HP-UX operating system, and has previously said it will have a Kittson refresh coming out this year. Megsco has sued Oracle over Larryco's wish not to develop its software for Itanium servers any more – because of low sales and, now, Oracle's headlong cloud rush. Our understanding is that Itanium was developed by Intel to compete with IBM's POWER and Oracle/Sun's SPARC processors. However, multi-processor, multi-core Xeon developments, the unwillingness of mainframe users to migrate to POWER/SPARC/Itanium server alternatives, and the rise of public cloud computing are three things that have weakened the POWER/SPARC/Itanium server market. Itanium server sales are understood to lag POWER and SPARC server sales, with all three being a long way behind Xeon server sales. It is generally reckoned that Intel would like to dump Itanium and concentrate on its more mainstream Xeon and Knights Landing products. Consequently Kittson is likely to be the end of the line for Intel's Itanium processor architecture products. Itanium does not provide significantly more powerful servers than Xeon chips do. Applications need to be specifically built to execute on Itanium, and HPE also bears the cost of developing Itanium server hardware and the HP-UX software. All-in-all Itanium-powered servers are costly beasts to develop, support and operate, and there is no easy migration path off them. Another factor to bear in mind is that HPE has bought HPC server supplier SGI and its technology overlaps that of Superdome in the shared memory area. There has been speculation that there could be some kind of convergence of SGI and Superdome technologies. HPE will, of course, support its Itanium customers for a number of years, at least until 2025, after having introduced Kittson-powered Superdomes later this year. There is no available information about any Kittson performance advantages over Poulson Itanium processors, although this will emerge when HPE launches its Kittson-powered Superdomes. ® Tips and corrections 21 Comments More from The Register Oracle to driver developers: 'Come play with our interface' Big Red lets C/C++ types talk to its call interface 5 Comments Oracle settles court spat with fired cloud 'sales inflation whistleblower' Terms of settlement not disclosed SHOCKER 18 Comments Oracle slurps enterprise cloud API wrangler Apiary Time for REST... and it's only January Solaris continuous upgrades have already begun, says Oracle But Big Red's staying schtum about the new cloud services on its recently-updated roadmap 5 Comments Oracle crashes AWS and Azure UK cloud data centre party London base in global expansion 18 Comments Oracle refuses to let Java copyright battle die – another appeal filed in war against Google If at first you don't succeed, try { try { again } } 63 Comments Whitepapers Faster Applications with Predictive Flash Interactive tool outlining the benefits of Predictive Flash to remove the app-data gap.

Twitter Facebook Intel ships latest Itanium chip called Kittson, but grim future looms HPE will ship high-end Itanium servers in the second half of the year, and the chip will be supported by HP-UX and OpenVMS Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 15 February, 2017 05:36 - - - - print email Comments Intel's Itanium chip is hanging by a thread, and after more than three years, the company is now shipping the next and possibly final version of the processor, which is code-named Kittson. The chip is now shipping to test customers, and volume shipments will commence later this year, a company spokesman said. Itanium chips have been used in mainframes and mission-critical servers. Hewlett Packard Enterprise will ship servers with Kittson later this year. Itanium has been dying a slow and painful death, and Kittson will likely be the end of the line. Support for the chip has been dwindling, and software development has stalled. Intel may be happy to see Itanium sink as it looks to drop irrelevant products in its pursuit of profitable markets. Intel has been openly lobbying customers to switch from Itanium to x86-based Xeon chips, which commands a server chip market share of more than 90 percent. Itanium is in maintenance mode, and "you won't see much more going forward," said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. Intel developed Itanium in conjunction HP, and the first chip was released in 2001. The goal of the superfast chip was to replace older mainframe architectures like SPARC and to compete with IBM's Power. InteI considered Itanium the architecture of choice for future high-performance chips. But the Itanium chips flopped and couldn't outrun SPARC or Power. Itanium's biggest enemy was Intel's own Xeon chip, which became successful with mass adoption in fast-growing low-end and mid-range server markets. Intel then put more resources into developing Xeon. Itanium has been in the news for the wrong reasons. The chip's slow death gained attention when Oracle decided to stop writing software for the architecture in 2011, after it determined the chip "was nearing the end of its life." Microsoft also pulled the plug on Itanium software development. Intel hasn't provided an Itanium roadmap ahead of Kittson. The new chip succeeds the older Itanium 9500 series code-named Poulson, which started shipping in the fourth quarter of 2012. The only big vendor still installing Itanium in servers is HPE, which puts the chip in mission-critical Integrity servers. HPE has reassured customers that it is committed to supporting Itanium until 2025, but the company is also successfully convincing customers to switch over to Xeon chips. HPE will release servers based on the new Itanium chips later this year, a spokeswoman for the company said in an email. "We are refreshing our HPE Integrity Servers with HP-UX to take advantage of Kittson in the second half of 2017," the spokeswoman said. HPE has kept Itanium support active until 2025 mainly due to long-term customer commitments. Many Itanium customers are government agencies, which sign long-term deals with vendors to supply and support servers. In addition to Unix-based HP-UX, the Integrity servers run on Linux and OpenVMS. OpenVMS will get Kittson support in the fourth quarter, according to a recently updated OS product roadmap on the website of VMS Software, which is leading the software development. Many customers may skip Kittson and jump to x86, but that could be an expensive proposition, McGregor said. The process involves porting legacy code over to new systems based on x86, and that process could take years. Some Itanium users -- especially financial organizations who rely on the rock-solid servers for transactions -- may not be willing to take the risk. "Sooner or later these guys have to convert to something else," McGregor said. HPE and Dell are offering services to port code over from mainframe systems to newer x86 servers, but the process is complicated and requires a lot of testing to ensure the code is stable.

A 'sled' from the Boston Quattro 12256-T. Image: Alan Stevens/ZDNet Developed as an alternative to market-leading Nvidia Tesla and AMD FirePro GPUs, the Phi takes the same approach of dumping complex chip architectures in favour of a huge number of much simpler cores. Equipped with their own RAM and high-speed interconnects linking all the cores together, GPUs were originally developed to handle graphics processing but can also be used alongside a conventional CPU to offload parallel processing workloads and, thereby, boost the performance of HPC applications. The first release of the Xeon Phi was on a plug-in PCIe card, just like the Tesla, but the second generation, known as Knights Landing (KNL), is not just faster but also available in a standard CPU form factor ready to plug into a host processor socket. More than that, the new Xeon Phi can boot and run a standard x64 operating system, typically Linux, for easier integration into enterprise data centres with 16GB of on-die 'near memory' based on MCDRAM technology to further boost throughput. It is also available with optional support for direct connection to massively parallel HPC clusters using Intel's preferred Omni-Path technology. The latest Xeon Phi processors are based on modified Atom Silvermont cores and are up to three times faster than previous-generation coprocessor implementations. Image: Intel The Quattro story of Phi The Xeon Phi may be radically different from other Xeon processors, but the Boston Quattro server in which it's used here isn't. In fact the 2U Quattro chassis from Supermicro has been around for a number of years now and is effectively a mini-blade platform with four sleds instead of blades, each designed to take an independent server motherboard. These plug in at the rear of the unit with power provided by a pair of hot-swap 2000W supplies that, similarly, slide into place at the back. Four server sleds and two redundant power supplies all slide into place at the rear of the Boston Quattro chassis. Image: Alan Stevens/ZDNet On a Quattro fitted with standard Xeon processors there's usually a small amount of disk or SSD storage located within the sleds themselves, but not on this model. Instead, the storage is arranged across the front of the unit and organised into four banks of three, one per node (server) connected via a passive backplane in the centre of the chassis. There's no room for storage in the server sleds so it's all located at the front of the chassis, in four banks of carriers to take magnetic disks or SSDs. Image: Alan Stevens/ZDNet The Xeon Phi also has a relatively high thermal rating (up to 260 Watts) which means that, even though there's only one per sled, it can get very hot in there, so there's a bank of fans in the middle of the unit and ducting in the sleds to direct the airflow and keep the processors cool. The end result is as noisy as you would expect -- but that's not really an issue on this kind of server, which will typically be locked away in a soundproofed machine room. The fans and sled backplane are in the middle of the Quattro chassis. Image: Alan Stevens/ZDNet Top ZDNET Reviews Dell Latitude 11 5000 7.9 Apple iPhone 7 Plus 9.3 Amazon Echo 9.0 Google Pixel XL Phone 8.0 The Supermicro motherboard in the bottom of each sled has a single socket to take the Xeon Phi coprocessor, which is based on highly modified Intel Atom Silvermont cores and available in a number of variants. The main differentiator is the number of usable cores/threads, our review system shipping with 1.3GHz Xeon Phi 7230 processors to give it 64 cores (256 threads) per node. Sitting in the middle of a three-SKU range, the alternatives are 1.4GHz chips with 68 cores (272 threads) and 1.5GHz with 72 cores (288 threads). There's room for just one Xeon Phi per sled, with up to 384GB of DDR4 RAM in 6 DIMM slots arranged on either side. Image: Alan Stevens/ZDNet The processor is neatly sandwiched between two sets of DIMM slots able to take up 384GB of DDR4 RAM, which can be clocked at either 2133MHz or 2400MHz depending on the processor fitted. In addition each Xeon Phi chip has a further 16GB of high-performance multi-channel memory (MCDRAM) built in as standard on the die. This 4-5 times faster than DDR4 and, under application control, can be used as a high-speed cache, a distinct NUMA node or a combination of the two in order to keep all those cores fed with data and instructions. It's also worth noting that, even though each sled contains an independent server with up to 72 cores (288 threads), Xeon Phi processors are designed to work together to build highly scalable processing clusters containing tens of thousands of nodes to handle massively parallel workloads. To this end the review machine was fitted with Mellanox InfiniBand PCIe adapters (one per node), although there are Xeon Phi variants available that come equipped with Intel's own Omni-Path fabric on-board. These are identified by a protruding connector on the processor designed to fit into a gap in the motherboard socket to take the cables for connection to an external switch. The review servers each had a Mellanox PCIe InfiniBand adapter installed (top right of the interfaces in the photo), although the Xeon Phi is also available with the technology to connect to Intel's own Omni-Path fabric built in. Image: Alan Stevens/ZDNet A second PCIe slot is also available along with two Gigabit Ethernet interfaces per node managed by an on-board Intel i350 controller plus an integrated IPMI management interface with KVM and another, dedicated, LAN connector. Storage, meanwhile, is looked after by a SATA3 controller in the Intel C612 chipset with RAID 0,1,5 and 10 support, where needed. Phi squared The key to positioning the Boston Quattro 12256-T, and Intel's Xeon Phi in general, is understanding that it's not your everyday Xeon server. It's not designed to run Windows (although it can) or Windows applications, and it's certainly not a virtualisation platform. Neither does it make a good platform for cloud applications. For all these reasons, it should not be considered as an alternative to standard Xeon-based servers for the majority of enterprise IT projects. Where it scores best is in handling workloads that can be broken down into multiple processing streams and spread across hundreds or thousands of cores in parallel. Workloads such as DNA sequencing, for example, or deep learning, big data analytics and complex modelling. The Quattro 12256-T isn't cheap by any means -- the Xeon Phi 7230 CPUs used in our review unit cost $3,710 each, for example. However, Boston's server compares well on price with other HPC solutions. Moreover, it's available for delivery now, with the Boston Quattro 12256-T providing a practical platform from which to exploit the capabilities of Intel's latest Xeon Phi processors, which are already proving popular with HPC customers worldwide.

These startups were assessed to be in a position to disrupt the spaces of preventive healthcare, infant mortality, and waste management, respectively. | TNN | Feb 15, 2017, 11.51 AM IST CHENNAI: Startups Allizhealth, iNICU & iCHR, and Banyan Nation have been announced as the top three teams of the Intel & DST - Innovate for Digital India Challenge 2.0 (Challenge 2.0). These startups were assessed to be in a position to disrupt the spaces of preventive healthcare, infant mortality, and waste management, respectively. Shortlisted from nearly 800 applications received nationwide, the selected three teams will now receive go-to-market support and access opportunities led by Intel, DST and T-Hub and their knowledge network of partners and industry. In addition, they will have the opportunity to travel to the United States for a bootcamp and go-to-market mentoring program with US Market Access Center (USMAC). Each team will also receive grants of up to Rs 5,00,000 to take their solutions beyond the beta stage and from local to global markets. Challenge 2.0, the second edition of the Intel & DST Innovate for Digital India Challenge, is a platform for end-to-end hardware product innovation that identifies and incubates homegrown entrepreneurial solutions that address India's indigenous issues. This year, Intel India and Department of Science & Technology ("DST") collaborated with T-Hub to identify ideas that could solve complex issues at the country's grassroots level through technology and automation, accelerating the transition to a Digital India. Each solution is designed for scale, and to improve the quality of people's lives in the remotest corners of India. From developing the Minimum Viable Product that allowed teams to collect maximum validated learning about their customers with the minimum effort, to go-to-market strategy, Challenge 2.0 intended to help participants take their prototypes from mind-to-market. The Smart City category introduced this year garnered almost a quarter of all entries, as did the IoT category, indicating a trend of citizen participation in India's smart and connected urban infrastructure. Here is the list of the top three teams, in no particular order: AllizHealth is an assistive device based on the Intel Curie module in the preventive healthcare technology space. It connects the user with a health management platform that assesses and anticipates health risks particularly related to geriatrics support. Providing an integrated, predictive algorithm, the wearable digitally connects users with various ecosystem partners / caregivers for alerts on falls and resulting support and condition management. Banyan Nation is a mobile technology platform that integrates the supply chain of India's waste management and plastic recycling sector. Based on the Intel® Edison, and using the Intel® based Jan Unnati tablet, the smart waste platform automates end-to-end urban recycling operations through on-field bin sensors, GPS truck routers, landfill management toolkits and back-end analytic engines. The solution follows a modular design which is customizable to suit the needs of different municipalities and third-party system integrators developing smart city solutions. iNICU & iCHR is helping reduce the neonatal infant mortality rate with a system that integrates real-time clinical data from connected devices within the laboratory with bedside observational data. Based on the Intel Cybertan Gateway and Intel Edison, the solution presents the information in medically comprehensive formats to reduce mortality in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). It enables complex clinical decisions to be made in real-time by automatically collecting clinical data, providing critical care for preterm babies. Debjani Ghosh, MD and VP, sales & marketing, Intel South Asia, said, "Developing local solutions to address India's widespread social challenges, is one of the prerequisites to make Digital India a reality. We urgently need technologies that are relevant for addressing some of the most basic needs of our country, and the Intel & DST - Innovate for Digital India Challenge is a platform to make that happen. I've spent time with the top ten teams, and while many of us dream of changing India, these individuals are actually leading that change. Congratulations to the top three, and I am certain that like last year's teams, this year's top teams will also go from mind-to-market, not just in India, but in other countries as well."

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Editorial  ⋮  Hardware AMD Calls Check; Your Move, Intel By Usman Pirzada Feb 14, 2017 376Shares Share Tweet Submit Something incredible has happened, for the first time in many years, there is an x86 microarchitecture out there that is going to pose a very real, and very significant threat to Intel’s monopoly in at least one major segment. I am talking of course, about AMD’s brand new Zen architecture, powering the all new Ryzen processors that are all set to hit the market by the end of this month. This isn’t a marketing buff or a nomenclature gimmick, the comeback is very much real. AMD is competitive again in the x86 scene and from everything we have heard so far, its going to massively undercut Intel in terms of pricing, marking the end of an era in computing (and the beginning of a price war). A monopoly is broken: AMD’s highly competitive x86 Ryzen processors to enter the battle at a fraction of Intel cost Amidst status quo shattering applause, AMD’s Ryzen processors will enter the arena this month. If you are a reader of Wccftech, you would know that we have already talked about pretty much all of the details concerning Ryzen. 8-core performance leaks have been coming for a long time now and they have not disappointed. The much cheaper Ryzen processor is able to go toe to toe with Intel’s $1000 chip which presents a very obvious problem for chipzilla considering the price difference. Intel will have to respond either by introducing new SKUs and/or by dropping the price of existing units. The public can see that the $329 Ryzen processor can do the job just as good as a $1000 Intel CPU, which means that the premium they have been charging for as a monopoly tax will quickly have to be removed. A price cut from Intel, is therefore anxiously anticipated. Even if one does come however, it will be too little, too late. Intel has been enjoying the high throne for quite some time now and is quite confident in its margins. All this however, is liable to change with the arrival of Ryzen CPUs. The only question is whether AMD can maintain supply at rates this cheap, and the answer to that, is given further down the article for anyone that wants to look. We also saw that the processors have a high overclock potential, dependent almost entirely on the VRM of the board and the cooling system used. If a single core can hit 5 GHz on air, ignoring the effects of electromigration, then you can realistically expect cherry chips to overclock up to 3.8-4.2 GHz on all cores with a high-end cooler and a mature enough revision of the Ryzen processor. A Ryzen chip with a decent overclock will be able to give comparable performance to (and possibly even beat) Intel’s $1000 i7-6900 in optimized scenarios and match the i5s in gaming performance. So in short, we know the following things for sure about Ryzen: The eight core Ryzen will have comparable optimized/threaded performance to the $1000+ Intel piece and comparable gaming/unoptimized performance to the quad-core i5 pieces. This is because any unthreaded application will rely mostly on the clock rate, at which Intel is currently ahead. It will have overclocking potential. Intel should still be in the lead in terms of pure IPC. It will be half as cheap as its Intel counterpart (tentative pre-order pricing is at around $499). This is just a ridiculously good value proposition that no enthusiast will be able to ignore. Lower attach and upgrade costs of the AM4 platform as compared with Intel’s Z270 platform. This is very good news for any tech enthusiast waiting to go with a Ryzen build. All this information points to the fact that we are looking at a very real AMD comeback on the compute side of things. Ryzen is not only going to be a game changer for the company in terms of its profitability (in the long run) but also a status quo shattering product for the x86 industry at large. Keep in mind however, that caution is advised as far as raw gaming performance is concerned. Games usually are not capable of utilizing a lot of threads and instead rely on high clock rates, applications like server/enterprise and rendering farms however are going to benefit from the arrival of Ryzen a lot. That is the industry where it is truly going to be a game changer, providing Intel-level performance at 1/2-1/3 the cost.

Actually, that’s where the amended WSA comes in The amendment is of a very material nature to the success of AMD (and Ryzen) but before we get into that it is interesting to point out that this is one of the more significant amendments to the WSA that has happened so far. It came almost a year after the amendment of 2015 and was officially filed as the “The Sixth Amendment to the Wafer Supply Agreement”. Advertisement The initial point of the contract was to make sure that AMD continued to buy a set quantity of wafers from the foundry every year and not simply shift to other foundries after the spin off. With almost every amendment AMD has attempted to re-adjust the grip of the WSA and paid corresponding monetary compensation according to the terms for doing so. Unlike the previous amendments however, this particular contract changes quite a few things for the duration it will stay active. The original Wafer Supply Agreement stated that it will stay active no later than 2024, and this particular amendment will end on 2020.  One thing is for certain though, it would seem that AMD is not as confident in the capabilities of GlobalFoundries as it once might have been. Zen is critical to AMD’s success and quite possibly its ability to stay afloat going forward. It can be argued that the company remaining a going concern depends on Zen not being a failure. With that context in mind, it is easy to see why AMD might be looking to diversify its options in case GlobalFoundries does not perform. Since GlobalFoundries and Samsung share the same 14nm process, it is more probable that the amendment will be utilized to harness TSMC’s ability to create high powered SOCs at the 16nm FinFET node. This amendment will also serve as a fail safe option for AMD’s Zen processors – which are due to land sometime in early 2017. So basically:   AMD is free to source wafers from foundries that are not GlobalFoundries for any product it sees fit, provided it pays a penalty for every time this happens. It will give the company an unparalleled and unprecedented capability to not only hedge its bet with GloFo but make sure it has a fall back if the foundry does not perform. This means that as far as the supply risk is concerned, Ryzen is fairly hedged. You can also read our complete and thorough breakdown of the amended WSA agreement but I think readers will be able to see what I am talking about when I say that AMD has never been in a better position to support high demand for its products. With this amended WSA in place, the sky’s the limit as far as its ability to meet demand goes. I’ll end on the same note I began, AMD has made its move and it is most definitely a check. Whether this is also consequently a ‘mate’ for a colossal AMD win, depends entirely on how Intel chooses to react to it. Will it cut its pricing across the board in response or will it chose to do what it has always does with AMD processors (which is to say, nothing) and face the consequences?   Share Tweet Submit <a href="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="//titangate-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=538336708&cs=d4114a3168&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

It was, however, a Pentium, and it didn't make much sense for many users who wanted that little extra bump when it came to using the CPU for more intensive tasks such as gaming.   Since Kaby Lake is pretty much the end product of the Process, Architecture, Optimize cycle which Intel is using for its new processors, they decided to unlock a Core i3. The Kaby Lake i3-7530K is pretty much a 7700K divided by two. While it uses the same HD630 graphics core, it has exactly half the core count (2) and half the L3 cache (4MB) as the 7700K. Intel also decided to provide it the same base clock of 4.2GHz, but they didn't give the 7350K Turbo Boost Technology 2.0. The 7350K has a TDP of 61W.     If you are still not sure if you want to get a 7th generation Intel CPU over a 6th generation Intel CPU, I wrote a piece on the 7700K versus the 6700K clock-for-clock here, and I also wrote a piece on the process improvements and iGPU additions the 7th generation products offer here.   The i3-7350K is really a top of the line i3 processor. In fact, it is right at the top of the i3 product category just like the 7600K is the top i5 and the 7700K is the top i7. The one interesting feature the 7350K offers is the ability to overclock, so I have decided to make this review an overclocking review. That means I found the CPU's maximum overclock, used a reasonable memory kit with XMP enabled, and compared those results to the 7350K at stock, and again at 4GHz clock for clock versus the other CPUs in the charts.     I want to mention something before we move forward; there are two very basic metrics when it comes to CPU performance. The number of cores a CPU has, and the speed of each core are important factors when it comes to judging a CPU on paper. Software that is optimized for core count, like rendering software, will take advantage of higher core counts, and physical cores are better than virtual cores. It's why the i5 series exists, even though many i3s offer HT on two cores resulting in the ability to render four threads, the i5s with four real cores and no HT perform better when core count matters. Software that is optimized for an average number of cores (we can say four), like most games, can benefit more from frequency and IPC increases, and that is where the 7350K should do better. So, can an overclocked 7350K compete against the i7s in our charts when overclocked? Let's find out.     The 7350K is unlocked, meaning it can overclock the CPU, iGPU, cache, and memory. However, you will need a motherboard with the ability to drive the 7350K, and you have two options; the Z170 and Z270 chipsets. I would recommend the Z270 chipset because most of the motherboard UEFI's have been optimized to overclock Kaby Lake CPUs such as the 7350K, but if you need to save a few bucks, then the Z170 chipset should also work. The 7350K offers the same IO capabilities as the 7700K, including x16 PCI-E 3.0 lanes, support for 64GB of DDR4, identical iGPU output capabilities, and the same storage capabilities.     Pricing   The retail price of the 7350K is $179.99 on Newegg, while the 7700K costs $349.99. The closest 7th generation CPUs to the 7350K in price are the i3-7320 at $164.99, and the i5-7400 at $194.99.   So for $15 less, you get a Core i3 that uses 9W less at 100MHz lower and is locked. For $15 more, you get to replace the two virtual cores with two physical ones, add 4W of power, but you lose 700MHz at Turbo, but 1.2GHz at base and the CPU is locked.

Dell XPS 13 Kaby Lake review: Yes, this is the best one so far It’s an incremental update, but a good one. Shame about the Aussie price hike though. Gordon Mah Ung PC World 15/02/17 Review Specs Images User Reviews Buy Now Tweet 5 Users want this Expert Rating 4.50 / 5 Pros 10% better than previous, excellent models Available with 4K screens and touchscreen Cons 10% Australian price hike Bottom Line We can all agree that Dell’s latest XPS 13 with Kaby Lake is an incremental update. But when your ultrabook is the one that’s being copied by everyone, that’s not such a bad thing, is it? Would you buy this? Yes 5 No 0 Price $ 1,999.00 (AUD) Special Offers Coupon: HP Envy 15 Laptops Coupon We can all agree that Dell’s latest XPS 13 with Kaby Lake is an incremental update. But when your ultrabook is the one that’s being copied by everyone, that’s not such a bad thing, is it? Externally, you’d be hard-pressed to tell the difference between the latest XPS 13 and its direct predecessor. You still get that beautiful InfinityEdge, nigh-zero bezel that lets Dell put the guts of a 13-inch laptop into the body of an 11-incher. The outside is still brushed aluminum and the keyboard deck, carbon fiber. Gordon Mah Ung Three generations of InfinityEdge PCs. Dell knows it has something good, so it hasn’t changed its XPS 13 much for three generations. The real changes are inside, where you’ll find Intel’s latest 7th-gen Kaby Lake CPU, basically a souped-up Skylake chip that’s roughly 10 percent faster. On the GPU side, you'll see a similar boost. Dell also increases the battery capacity by using slightly denser cells. That takes your fuel tank from about 57.5 watt hours to 59 watt hours. Gordon Mah Ung The trackpad on the latest XPS 13 has less friction than more rubbery-feeling predecessors. I think the keyboard is still a tad small, though. Although Dell says the trackpad hasn’t changed, to my fingers, the trackpad definitely feels less rubbery than before, and more similar to the Microsoft Surface Book's silky-smooth glass version. I have no complaints. The keyboard, unfortunately, hasn’t changed either. It’s not a bad keyboard, and I’ve used an older XPS 13 for several months. Still, I’d still be remiss if I didn’t mention that the keys just feel a tad bit small versus the competition. And no, I don’t mean Apple’s MacBook, I mean HP’s Spectre x360, which gives us a roomy keyboard. Ports don’t change either: You still get a Thunderbolt 3 using a USB-C, as well as two USB 3.1 (10Gbps) Type A ports. There’s also a cowardly headphone jack and SD card reader too. Gordon Mah Ung The newest XPS 13 (top) has the same ports as the previous iteration (middle) and let you charge via USB-C. The oldest XPS 13 (bottom) has a mini-DisplayPort. Like the previous version, charging is done via the legacy Dell barrel charger or by using a USB-C Dell charger. Our unit came with the legacy barrel charger, but I've tested the XPS 13 with USB-C chargers from Dell, HP, Google and Innergie with no issues. It’ll also work with Dell’s own USB-C external battery pack brick. What this really comes down to is Intel’s Kaby Lake so let’s get on to it. The review model here was equipped with an Intel Core i5-7200U, 8GB of LPDDR3/1866 in dual-channel mode, and a 256GB M.2 NVMe PCIe drive. The screen is a 1920x1080 IPS non-touch panel with a light anti-reflective coating. Dell offers touch and 4K display options, but they cost more money and eat the battery, too. Cinebench R15 Performance Our first test is Cinebench R15, a 3D rendering benchmark using the same engine that Maxon uses in its Cine4D application. For comparison, we have a Broadwell Core i5, a Skylake Core i5, and finally, I threw in the Gold XPS 13 with Intel’s higher-performance Skylake Core i7 and Iris graphics aboard. Kaby Lake is based on the same 14nm process as Broadwell and Skylake—Intel's backup plan when it couldn't move to a smaller process as planned. Intel took its experience making Broadwell and Skylake and squeezed higher clock speeds out of the chip while using nearly the same amount of power. As Cinebench R15 is a CPU benchmark, all the performance gains you’re seeing come from the higher megahertz of Kaby Lake—about 10 percent more clock speed and performance over Skylake. Here's a bonus: The Core i7 Skylake, with its fancy eDRAM cache, can’t pull away from the Kaby Lake chip either. The 7th-gen Kaby Lake in the latest XPS 13 comes out on top in the Cinebench R15 CPU test. Handbrake performance Cinebench R15 takes just a few minutes to run. To see how laptops fare under a longer load, we use the free and popular encoder Handbrake to convert a 30GB high-resolution MKV video file using the Android Tablet preset. The entire process can take up to two hours on a dual-core Core i5 or Core i7 CPU. On a desktop or larger laptop, cooling generally is not an issue. On tiny little laptops, this test can function as a performance test or an indicator of how well the laptop handles heat. Some laptop makers will opt to reduce performance to keep the laptop cooler and the fan noise down. Dell, generally, favours performance. That pattern doesn’t change here, as the Kaby Lake-based XPS 13 comes in well ahead of its siblings and again bests even the pricier Core i7 / Iris-based XPS 13. The Kaby Lake outpaces even the Core i7-based Skylake chip with its fancy-pants Iris graphics and eDRAM. 3DMark Cloud Gate performance For graphics performance, I tested all four units using Futuremark’s synthetic gaming test, 3DMark Cloud Gate. It’s a test made lower-ambition laptops that lack discrete graphics—all models tested here rely on the graphics integrated directly into their Intel CPUs. The Kaby Lake chip comes out well ahead of the 5th-gen Broadwell and 6th-gen Skylake. I’d say it does pretty well against the Dell XPS 13 with its fancy 6th-gen Core i7 and Iris graphics, too. The Iris graphics and eDRAM don’t give the Core i7 much of an advantage in Cloud Gate. To be fair to Iris graphics, the overall Cloud Gate performance score does factor CPU performance into its final score. When you look at only the graphics performance, the Iris graphics and the 64MB of eDRAM used as a buffer give it a respectable 10-percent advantage. Cloud Gate favors the XPS 13 with 6th-gen Core i7 when only graphics is factored in. Battery life I expected to get pretty good run time out of the slightly-larger battery on this laptop, and I did. Our test loops a 4K video file in airplane mode with sound enabled (using ear buds). The screen is set to a fairly bright 250 to 260 nits, which is a good setting for watching a movie in a typical office or home. While you might look at the results and decide Kaby Lake gives you more battery life over Skylake, there are differences between the two Core i5 XPS 13 units in SSD power consumption. The Lite-On SSD in the Kaby Lake XPS 13 is far more power-efficient than the one in the Skylake XPS 13. SSD performance may also play into the battery life of the 5th-gen Broadwell: That particular generation of XPS 13 used an M.2 SATA drive rather than the more power-hungry NVMe PCIe drives of the newer models. If you're wondering just how much of a power hit you can take from a higher-resolution screen with touch, just look at the loser in all this: the gold XPS 13, which gives you about six hours of video vs. the 11 hours of the Kaby Lake XPS 13. The Kaby Lake XPS 13 has pretty great battery life while playing video. One more thing Perhaps the most significant improvement with the 7th-gen Kaby Lake chip is the video engine. Intel basically added hardware support for 10-bit HEVC video, and boatload of other encoding and decoding features. Of course, 10-bit HEVC and other support doesn't yet matter for most of us, but it’s something keep in mind. The practical upshot is you can actually play video encoded using 10-bit color on the Kaby Lake, while a Skylake or a Broadwell machine would just spit furballs. Here’s the proof in pictures: Playing a 1080p file encoded with 10-bit color saw the Kaby Lake XPS13 basically at idle. Gordon Mah Ung The 7th gen Kaby Lake CPU in the latest Dell XPS 13 can play 10-bit color video files without breaking a sweat. Without the hardware support in the GPU, that means the CPU is doing all the work. Decoding that Tears of Steel video file with 10-bit color depth isn’t easy, either. It took battery life on the Skylake-based XPS 13 to a dismal three hours. That higher clock speed means more power consumption, which means less battery life. The Kaby Lake XPS 13, though, took a minimal hit and could loop the video for 10.5 hours. Gordon Mah Ung Skylake can’t handle video files encoded at 10-bit color depth without cranking up the CPU and even then will drop a massive amount of frames. Should you upgrade? If you’re already aboard the Dell XPS 13 train, you don’t need to be told how great of a laptop it is. The question you’re probably asking is whether you should upgrade. I’d say it depends. If you own a 6th gen-based Skylake chip based XPS 13, I’d say no. The performance bump you’re getting is maybe 10 percent or so. Because that revision of the XPS 13 already has Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C charging and NVMe drive support, it just doesn’t make sense for anyone who isn’t made of money. When you step back one more generation to a 5th-gen Broadwell-based XPS 13, then it starts to get interesting. You get roughly a 20-percent or more performance increase, a much faster NVMe drive and Thunderbolt 3, plus the ability to do USB-C charging. Coming from that generation of XPS 13, it’s a very decent upgrade, especially if you can sell your older unit to a friend or family member. Conclusion In the end, you can look at Dell’s latest XPS 13 as a “if nothing’s broken, don’t fix it” moment. It’s arguably one of the best if not the best laptop available. You get that beautiful InfinityEdge display, a super-compact body, and oodles of performance. Not that anyone should resting on their laurels, because the competition isn’t going to sit still for much longer. For now though, it would be hard to beat the XPS 13. Gordon Mah Ung Some may ding the XPS 13 for not changing much but it’s clear the latest one is the best. Join the PC World newsletter! Join Error: Please check your email address.

The chip is now shipping to test customers, and volume shipments will commence later this year, a company spokesman said. Itanium chips have been used in mainframes and mission-critical servers. Hewlett Packard Enterprise will ship servers with Kittson later this year. Itanium has been dying a slow and painful death, and Kittson will likely be the end of the line. Support for the chip has been dwindling, and software development has stalled. Intel may be happy to see Itanium sink as it looks to drop irrelevant products in its pursuit of profitable markets. Intel has been openly lobbying customers to switch from Itanium to x86-based Xeon chips, which commands a server chip market share of more than 90 percent. Itanium is in maintenance mode, and "you won't see much more going forward," said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. Intel developed Itanium in conjunction HP, and the first chip was released in 2001. The goal of the superfast chip was to replace older mainframe architectures like SPARC and to compete with IBM's Power. InteI considered Itanium the architecture of choice for future high-performance chips. But the Itanium chips flopped and couldn't outrun SPARC or Power. Itanium's biggest enemy was Intel's own Xeon chip, which became successful with mass adoption in fast-growing low-end and mid-range server markets. Intel then put more resources into developing Xeon. Itanium has been in the news for the wrong reasons. The chip's slow death gained attention when Oracle decided to stop writing software for the architecture in 2011, after it determined the chip "was nearing the end of its life." Microsoft also pulled the plug on Itanium software development. Intel hasn't provided an Itanium roadmap ahead of Kittson. The new chip succeeds the older Itanium 9500 series code-named Poulson, which started shipping in the fourth quarter of 2012. The only big vendor still installing Itanium in servers is HPE, which puts the chip in mission-critical Integrity servers. HPE has reassured customers that it is committed to supporting Itanium until 2025, but the company is also successfully convincing customers to switch over to Xeon chips. HPE will release servers based on the new Itanium chips later this year, a spokeswoman for the company said in an email. "We are refreshing our HPE Integrity Servers with HP-UX to take advantage of Kittson in the second half of 2017," the spokeswoman said. HPE has kept Itanium support active until 2025 mainly due to long-term customer commitments. Many Itanium customers are government agencies, which sign long-term deals with vendors to supply and support servers. In addition to Unix-based HP-UX, the Integrity servers run on Linux and OpenVMS. OpenVMS will get Kittson support in the fourth quarter, according to a recently updated OS product roadmap on the website of VMS Software, which is leading the software development. Many customers may skip Kittson and jump to x86, but that could be an expensive proposition, McGregor said. The process involves porting legacy code over to new systems based on x86, and that process could take years. Some Itanium users -- especially financial organizations who rely on the rock-solid servers for transactions -- may not be willing to take the risk. "Sooner or later these guys have to convert to something else," McGregor said. HPE and Dell are offering services to port code over from mainframe systems to newer x86 servers, but the process is complicated and requires a lot of testing to ensure the code is stable. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

We know about the declining sales of the iPad and Apple’s seeming inattention to the Mac line as whole in 2016. In turn, that has created some discussion about their respective future developments. John catalogs the likely and not-so-likely roadmaps for these products. What looked like simple evolution has become not so simple. Each of these plans below is someting I’ve read or thought about. They’re in no particular order, but I have assigned a prognosis for each plan. There may be other brilliant plans being cooked up by Apple, but I thought it would interesting to list the most often discussed evolutionary scenarios for macOS, iOS and possible integration. Here we go…. Plan A. “Let it Be.” Or: Survival of the fittest. The Intel-based Macs and iPads are allowed to continue as distinct products. They will evolve to work better and better together, and we’ve seen Apple do that already. But the products remain essentially as they are. Apple will, instead, depend on dramatic improvements in iOS/iPad technologies to stem the decline on iPad sales. Eventually, an inflection point will come when the iPad can do everything the Mac does today. Then, the Mac, without touch capability, fades into history. Downside. Thousands of great macOS apps depend on Intel and Macs. Reference: “Let iPad be iPad: Why making it a traditional computer isn’t the answer,” by Rene Ritchie. Likelihood: Low Plan B. “Here Comes the Sun.” Or: Intel plus ARM. Slowly migrate macOS apps to run on ARM by including low-power but fast ARM processor in all new Macs. macOS and iOS, however, remain distinct. Gradually transition more and more tasks to ARM until an Intel CPU is hardly necessary in, say, five years. It helps reduce Apple’s dependence on Intel.  A possible gateway to Plan D. Reference: “Apple Said to Work on Mac Chip That Would Lessen Intel Role,” by Mark Gurman. Likelihood: Moderate Plan C. “I Want to Hold Your Hand.” Or: The Toaster Fridge. Single out MacBooks that have ARM in the lid and Intel under the keyboard. When connected, the system operates as macOS/Intel Mac with low power ARM functions. When the lid is detached, it’s an iPad. Desktop, Intel-based Macs will use and ARM for iOS simulator and other supporting operations. One problem is continued dependence on Intel CPUs. Another is cost, confusion and lack of elegance. Likelihood: Low. Plan D. “Strawberry Fields Forever.” macOS apps run in iOS. New, much larger iPads will have a Rosetta-like system with mouse and other needed frameworks added back in. macOS apps remain Intel-based, run on standard Macs, but can also run on large-display iPads. This continues until Macs and macOS apps fade into history, as with the old Classic apps. This is an attractive option because it avoids a premature obsolescence of the Mac by allowing all those thousands of macOS apps to have new life on the platform of the future, the bigger iPads. It essentially competes with the ground-breaking notion of the Microsoft Surface Studio and buys time for the iPad to evolve. When the iPad reaches technical maturity and can do everything a Mac can, including the role as an iOS development platform, then the Mac can be left behind. In the meantime, macOS apps remain viable. Likelihood: High. This is just the kind of technical brilliance Apple is known for. They did it before with the Classic to Mac OS X and the PowerPC to Intel transition. It combats the Surface Studio nicely. Apple’s dependence on Intel goes away. So there you have it. My four roadmaps for the evolution of macOS and iOS apart or together. What do you think? Have I missed any attractive avenues? Or pitfalls? Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit More Email Print Tumblr Tags: Apple, iOS, iPad, Mac, macOS 3 Comments Add a comment Rick Allen February 14, 2017 John; Love your analysis, yet I think giving option D a “High” mark is a huge stretch. ARM would need would need to up its horsepower either to have a VM environment capable of hosting an x86 modern Mac OS without being dog slow. Rosetta approach might work, yet I feel only if the conversion were pre-bundled in the app bundle and not have to be done on the ARM device itself. February 14, 2017 at 5:21 EST PM geoduck February 14, 2017 Yes, option D is certainly the one I would not be surprised to see Apple follow, and am hoping for. I’ll be sad to see the Mac fade away, but I’ve been dreaming of a true tablet to replace my Mac since I got my iPad 2. However to truly replace the Mac, padOS has to be split off and incorporate functions that both aren’t needed and would be useless on phoneOS. You mentioned a mouse, that’s a good start. Until that happens the iPad just won’t be able to cut it. It has the horsepower now to do nearly everything I want to do. The limit is the OS. February 14, 2017 at 5:23 EST PM John Martellaro February 14, 2017 Rick: A birdie on my shoulder told me that it wouldn’t be very hard to fix up iOS to run macOS apps with mouse and other related support. As for the evolution of the ARM CPUs, supporting a Rosetta-like instruction translator, recall that the A10 in the iPhone 7 can, according to Phil Schiller, process 100 billion operations in 25 milliseconds when processing camera images. If those operations are floating point, that works out to 4 teraflops. This may not apply to other computational tasks, but it gives us a feel for the A10. And I’m thinking the A12 era for Plan D. https://www.wired.com/2016/09/iphone-7-plus-camera/ February 14, 2017 at 7:39 EST PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

This latest version of the Blade swaps out the Skylake Core i7-6700HQ for a Kaby Lake Core i7-7700HQ. These two processors are largely the same, however the Kaby Lake model is clocked up to 300 MHz higher, with a 2.80 GHz base clock and 3.80 GHz boost clock, compared to 2.6 and 3.5 GHz previously. This should provide a minor performance improvement in CPU-limited workloads. The rest of the Blade's hardware is the same as before, including the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GPU, 16 GB of RAM, and SSD options that range from 256 GB to 1 TB. The base model includes a 1080p IPS display, although a variant with a 4K touchscreen display will be released in Q2 2017. The upgraded Blade is $100 more expensive than its predecessor, with the base model starting at $1,899 rather than $1,799. It is available starting today from Razer's website, followed by "select retailers" next week ahead of a worldwide launch in March.

Intel's ANV Vulkan Driver Gets An Important Performance Fix For Broadwell Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 14 February 2017 at 05:30 PM EST. 1 Comment If you are using Intel Broadwell graphics with Mesa's ANV Vulkan driver, the performance should be better for Dota 2 and potentially other workloads. Back in January for the Intel IvyBridge/Haswell/Broadwell/Skylake OpenGL & Vulkan Benchmarks On Linux 4.10 + Mesa 13.1 article, the Vulkan performance on Broadwell was poor relative to the other generations/hardware. While the Core i7 5775C with Iris Pro graphics were much faster than the Core i5 6600K HD Graphics (Skylake) and others with OpenGL, under Vulkan it was barely faster than Skylake HD hardware. Fortunately, the underlying issue appears to have now been corrected. Jason Ekstrand has landed a PMA stall workaround in the ANV driver today for Mesa 17.1-dev Git. This should help Dota 2 with Broadwell graphics hardware by 8~9%, according to Jason. Though with my aforelinked results from January, there's more than an 8~9% slowdown from where the i7-5775C should have been performing, so I guess I'll fire up Mesa Git on that Iris Pro box and see how the performance is now with Mesa 17.1-dev. Details via this commit. The workaround is over 200 lines of new code and isn't CC'ed as a candidate for getting into Mesa 17.0 or older stable series. There is also a PMA optimization for Skylake but it doesn't appear to help the overall frame-rate by much. 1 Comment Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Feb 14, 2017 at 5:30PM At Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Feb. 9 investor meeting, the company talked a little bit about chip manufacturing -- arguably, the company's core competency. Though the company didn't dedicate a whole presentation to chip-manufacturing technology, as it has in recent years (apparently the company will be doing an entirely separate presentation sometime in the first half of this year), Intel executive Murthy Renduchintala did take the opportunity to highlight that the company has a three-year lead over competing chip manufacturers. In this column, I'd like to put that claim under the microscope and see if it checks out. Intel's claims Check out the following slide from Intel: Intel logic-cell area competitive comparison. Image source: Intel. The focus of this presentation was on a metric that Intel calls "effective logic cell area" -- essentially, the lower the number, the better. The company claims that its 14-nanometer technology, which went into high-volume production in the first half of 2014, will have had clear leadership in this metric until Intel's competition -- Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) -- release their 10-nanometer technologies in the first half of this year. Intel's chart seems to suggest that those 10-nanometer technologies will offer comparable logic-cell areas to Intel's 14-nanometer technology -- though the chart indicates that Intel's 14-nanometer technology will be slightly behind on this metric. During his presentation, Renduchintala also indicated that he expects that Intel will "continue to maintain a three-year lead, even after [Intel's] competitors release their 10-nanometer plans during the course of this year." Challenging that claim Intel has made a reasonable case for why its 14-nanometer technology is more comparable to competing 10-nanometer technologies than to competing 14/16-nanometer technologies -- at least when it comes to logic-cell area. Intel has also done a good job explaining why its 10-nanometer technology should give the company a significant logic-cell area lead over competing 10-nanometer technologies. Intel's chart also indicates, quite honestly, that its 10-nanometer technology will go into production a few quarters later than competing 10-nanometer technologies. What the chart is missing, however, is information regarding competing 7-nanometer technologies. It's not clear when Samsung intends to go into mass production on its 7-nanometer technology, but TSMC has said that it intends to go into mass production on its 7-nanometer technology in the first half of 2018. Presumably, this technology will be shipping in very high volumes in support of Apple's 2018 iPhone. TSMC is claiming a significant area reduction for its 7-nanometer technology relative to its 10-nanometer technology -- EETimes reports a 1.63 times increase in routed gate density for TSMC's 7-nanometer tech compared to its 10-nanometer tech -- so it seems likely that Intel will have far less of a lead during its 10-nanometer generation than it did during its 14-nanometer generation. More clarity needed At this point, I'm struggling to see how Intel can justify its claim that, in terms of logic-cell density, it will be able to maintain a three-year lead over TSMC, as it looks as though Intel's lead will shrink generation over generation. Intel is expected to do a full day's worth of presentations related to chip-manufacturing technology at some point in the first half of this year. I hope the company will provide more detail about its future technology plans -- both 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer -- as well as, perhaps, a more detailed and comprehensive competitive comparison.

The chip is now shipping to test customers, and volume shipments will commence later this year, a company spokesman said. Itanium chips have been used in mainframes and mission-critical servers. Hewlett Packard Enterprise will ship servers with Kittson later this year. Itanium has been dying a slow and painful death, and Kittson will likely be the end of the line. Support for the chip has been dwindling, and software development has stalled. Intel may be happy to see Itanium sink as it looks to drop irrelevant products in its pursuit of profitable markets. Intel has been openly lobbying customers to switch from Itanium to x86-based Xeon chips, which commands a server chip market share of more than 90 percent. Itanium is in maintenance mode, and "you won't see much more going forward," said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. Intel developed Itanium in conjunction HP, and the first chip was released in 2001. The goal of the superfast chip was to replace older mainframe architectures like SPARC and to compete with IBM's Power. InteI considered Itanium the architecture of choice for future high-performance chips. But the Itanium chips flopped and couldn't outrun SPARC or Power. Itanium's biggest enemy was Intel's own Xeon chip, which became successful with mass adoption in fast-growing low-end and mid-range server markets. Intel then put more resources into developing Xeon. Itanium has been in the news for the wrong reasons. The chip's slow death gained attention when Oracle decided to stop writing software for the architecture in 2011, after it determined the chip "was nearing the end of its life." Microsoft also pulled the plug on Itanium software development. Intel hasn't provided an Itanium roadmap ahead of Kittson. The new chip succeeds the older Itanium 9500 series code-named Poulson, which started shipping in the fourth quarter of 2012. The only big vendor still installing Itanium in servers is HPE, which puts the chip in mission-critical Integrity servers. HPE has reassured customers that it is committed to supporting Itanium until 2025, but the company is also successfully convincing customers to switch over to Xeon chips. HPE will release servers based on the new Itanium chips later this year, a spokeswoman for the company said in an email. "We are refreshing our HPE Integrity Servers with HP-UX to take advantage of Kittson in the second half of 2017," the spokeswoman said. HPE has kept Itanium support active until 2025 mainly due to long-term customer commitments. Many Itanium customers are government agencies, which sign long-term deals with vendors to supply and support servers. In addition to Unix-based HP-UX, the Integrity servers run on Linux and OpenVMS. OpenVMS will get Kittson support in the fourth quarter, according to a recently updated OS product roadmap on the website of VMS Software, which is leading the software development. Many customers may skip Kittson and jump to x86, but that could be an expensive proposition, McGregor said. The process involves porting legacy code over to new systems based on x86, and that process could take years. Some Itanium users -- especially financial organizations who rely on the rock-solid servers for transactions -- may not be willing to take the risk. "Sooner or later these guys have to convert to something else," McGregor said. HPE and Dell are offering services to port code over from mainframe systems to newer x86 servers, but the process is complicated and requires a lot of testing to ensure the code is stable.

(GMS) today announced the S1U-MD, a 1U rackmount, multi-domain server and managed Ethernet switch/router based on the Intel® Xeon® D server CPU. S1U-MD boasts 12x the performance of traditional blade-servers, but in one-twelfth the size of traditional systems. Isolating Red and Black domains to ensure security or designing for redundancy is normally accomplished with one full-depth box for each Red and Black domain: 1) two physically separate servers; 2) two separate Ethernet multi-port switches; and 3) two separate routers. Putting this capability into a single, 1U high and 17-inch deep (Short Rack) server blade is another GMS engineering phenomenon in small form factor rugged systems. S1U-MD takes one-twelfth the rack space of a competing multi-domain solution. The S1U-MD has six network functions in one, making it ideal for the Navy’s evolution of secure Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) and Base Level Information Infrastructure (BLII) networks worldwide. S1U-MD targets all rugged rackmount installations, from ships and ground vehicles, to mobile command posts, mission command centers, first responders and airborne C4ISR platforms. The 1U high, Short Rack box does it all. General Micro Systems is trusted at sea, in the air and on land and has been supplying Smart Displays and VME boards to the U.S. Navy for shipboard use for more than three decades, and has applied its extensive knowledge of Naval requirements to the design of the S1U-MD. “We took our successfully deployed and proven SB2002-SW ‚Blackhawk’ multi-domain server from the U.S. Army’s WIN-T battlefield network program and optimized it for rugged, rack-mount applications for the Navy,” said GMS CEO Benjamin Sharfi. “You won’t find a MILS-ready dual 1U server with 28 Ethernet ports anywhere on the planet. No one else could accomplish all this functionality—and ruggedness—in 1U-Short, but we did it.” S1U-MD Technical Specifications Each S1U-MD has up to a 16-core Intel® Xeon® D CPU per server domain and can be powered via 110/220 VAC or 28VDC (“dirty power” per MIL-STD-1275). Each domain’s CPU can support 32 virtual machines (VMs), or 64 VMs per 1U-Short space. There is up to 64GB of DDR-4 at 2133MTS with ECC RAM per CPU domain, and four removable drives per domain with RAID support (plus another for OS boot): total disk storage is 80 TB per domain, or an incredible total 160 TB in the slim 1U-Short rack. Besides the Red/Black separation, a zeroize function (panic-initiated) is available to securely erase all non-volatile storage in each domain—a non-trivial feature designed to avoid a repeat of the Hainan Island incident. For each domain, network connectivity includes an integrated managed Layer 2/3 Ethernet switch with up to twelve 1 Gigabit Ethernet ports and two 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports (Fiber or Copper) per domain. Four of the 1 Gigabit ports include Power-over-Ethernet (POE+), supplying up to 25.5W (total) to directly power remote nodes such as sensors and to simplify wiring. The switch handles local routing and virtual LANs and accelerates packet processing to maximize wire speed; the 10 Gigabit ports support inter/intra-rack datacom or WAN reachback. There are two USB 3.0 ports, two USB 2.0 ports and HDMI for a user interface. Additionally, the Intel® Xeon® D CPU allows a full-featured Cisco® IOS® router to be run in one or more VMs in each domain. Cisco’s Embedded Services Router (ESR) series is intended for embedded applications; additionally, Cisco’s 1000V™ Series Cloud Services Router (CSR) running on an S1U-MD VM creates a locally hosted, infrastructure-agnostic “single tenant router” capability, uniquely supported on S1U-MD’s multi-domain hardware. Routing is available on all 1 Gigabit and 10 Gigabit ports for each of S1U-MD’s domains. Like all GMS products, S1U-MD can accommodate additional I/O such as MIL-STD-1553, CANbus, Serial Ports and custom features. The architecture is U.S. Army VICTORY conformant. Application Examples As cyber-security threats grow, the Department of Defense and service branches are hardening worldwide networks. One way to significantly enhance security is by separating secure from insecure networks through Red/Black isolation and Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS). In fact, the Navy’s PEO Enterprise Information Systems (EIS) identifies boundary isolation as a key upgrade for both NMCI and BLII networks. Running SIPRNet (secure) and NIPRNet (insecure) networks in the same 1U space is a perfect example of efficient isolation. Red/Black separation is needed in ground-, shipboard- and airborne-based installations. S1U-MDSW’s low weight and small size make it deployable on many ground, air and shipboard platforms. S1U-MD is also ideal for enterprise/cloud data centers or server rooms where the 12:1 size/weight/power reduction is a smart upgrade by combining the server/switch/router into one domain, and combining two domains into only 1U shelf. Two S1U-MD boxes can be mounted back-to-back in a 1U shelf. S1U-MD multi-domain servers with switches are also ideal for field-deployed, shipboard, airborne reconnaissance, first responder command post vehicles, oil/gas exploration or fault-tolerant/redundant industrial controllers.

The chip is now shipping to test customers, and volume shipments will commence later this year, a company spokesman said. Itanium chips have been used in mainframes and mission-critical servers. Hewlett Packard Enterprise will ship servers with Kittson later this year. Itanium has been dying a slow and painful death, and Kittson will likely be the end of the line. Support for the chip has been dwindling, and software development has stalled. Intel may be happy to see Itanium sink as it looks to drop irrelevant products in its pursuit of profitable markets. Intel has been openly lobbying customers to switch from Itanium to x86-based Xeon chips, which commands a server chip market share of more than 90 percent. Itanium is in maintenance mode, and "you won't see much more going forward," said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. Intel developed Itanium in conjunction HP, and the first chip was released in 2001. The goal of the superfast chip was to replace older mainframe architectures like SPARC and to compete with IBM's Power. InteI considered Itanium the architecture of choice for future high-performance chips. But the Itanium chips flopped and couldn't outrun SPARC or Power. Itanium's biggest enemy was Intel's own Xeon chip, which became successful with mass adoption in fast-growing low-end and mid-range server markets. Intel then put more resources into developing Xeon. Itanium has been in the news for the wrong reasons. The chip's slow death gained attention when Oracle decided to stop writing software for the architecture in 2011, after it determined the chip "was nearing the end of its life." Microsoft also pulled the plug on Itanium software development. Intel hasn't provided an Itanium roadmap ahead of Kittson. The new chip succeeds the older Itanium 9500 series code-named Poulson, which started shipping in the fourth quarter of 2012. The only big vendor still installing Itanium in servers is HPE, which puts the chip in mission-critical Integrity servers. HPE has reassured customers that it is committed to supporting Itanium until 2025, but the company is also successfully convincing customers to switch over to Xeon chips. HPE will release servers based on the new Itanium chips later this year, a spokeswoman for the company said in an email. "We are refreshing our HPE Integrity Servers with HP-UX to take advantage of Kittson in the second half of 2017," the spokeswoman said. HPE has kept Itanium support active until 2025 mainly due to long-term customer commitments. Many Itanium customers are government agencies, which sign long-term deals with vendors to supply and support servers. In addition to Unix-based HP-UX, the Integrity servers run on Linux and OpenVMS. OpenVMS will get Kittson support in the fourth quarter, according to a recently updated OS product roadmap on the website of VMS Software, which is leading the software development. Many customers may skip Kittson and jump to x86, but that could be an expensive proposition, McGregor said. The process involves porting legacy code over to new systems based on x86, and that process could take years. Some Itanium users -- especially financial organizations who rely on the rock-solid servers for transactions -- may not be willing to take the risk. "Sooner or later these guys have to convert to something else," McGregor said. HPE and Dell are offering services to port code over from mainframe systems to newer x86 servers, but the process is complicated and requires a lot of testing to ensure the code is stable. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Feb 13, 2017 at 9:01PM These days, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) forces gamers and other personal computer enthusiasts to make a tough choice when picking out desktop processors. Intel offers PC gamers chips with four incredibly fast processor cores ("mainstream desktop"), and it also offers them chips with between six and 10 processor cores ("high-end desktop"), but each of these cores is much slower than the four-core chips. The six- to 10-core chips also cost much more than the four-core chips do, as well. Although Intel does not provide sales data by individual chip model, I have a strong suspicion that even gamers with very deep pockets often opt for the super-fast quad-core chip rather than go for one of the more expensive chips. Image source: Intel. After all, since most games can't really take advantage of more than four cores, why should a gamer pick a chip with a lot of slower cores when the one with fewer but faster cores for cheaper will enable a superior user experience? This is one of the reasons that Intel's high-end desktop product lineup (the expensive six- to 10-core chips with relatively slow cores) has usually been somewhat of a "niche" among gamers. Going forward, considering a recent announcement from the chipmaker, I believe that Intel's high-end desktop processors will become much more attractive by remedying the problem that I outlined above. Data center first could mean high-end desktop first Intel's previous product development methodology was "personal computer first, data center second." Since Intel's mainstream desktop chips are designed first and foremost as personal computer chips (the same basic designs are used in high performance notebook computers as well as desktop computers), they have historically gotten all the technical goodies first. Indeed, the mainstream desktop chips have generally had Intel's most advanced processor cores built using the company's most advanced chip manufacturing technology. The high-end desktop chips, which are based on the chips that the company designs and sells into the data center, tend to not represent Intel's best -- at least in ways that matter to consumers.  The data center parts have generally been a generation behind in both processor architecture and manufacturing technology relative to the mainstream desktop/notebook processors. Now that the situation is going to reverse going forward, the high-end desktop chips should have the best processor cores and be built using the best manufacturing technology. Once Intel's product development methodology change flows through to products in the marketplace, then I wouldn't be surprised to see enthusiasts and gamers gravitating more to the high-end desktop products, as they will represent Intel's best, while the mainstream desktop chips will represent older, less desirable technology. Potential impact on Intel's business If what I expect to eventually play out does in fact happen, it would probably manifest itself in Intel's financial results as a mix shift to higher-performance/higher-priced gaming products. To the extent that Intel can drive a richer mix of products, the company should see both revenue (same number of units sold, but the ones that do sell are higher priced, on average) and profit improvements (even at fixed gross profit margin, higher revenue means higher gross profit dollars). This transition isn't going to happen overnight, though. Remember that Intel said that its data center products won't take the manufacturing lead from its traditional client personal computer products until it rolls out its third-generation 10-nanometer manufacturing technology. Considering that, don't expect Intel's high-end desktop products to become the company's unequivocally best products in terms of core performance and manufacturing technology until, perhaps, the middle of 2019.

In the market for a new gaming laptop? The latest version of the 14-inch Razer Blade now runs a Intel Kaby Lake processor, boasts faster memory, and includes a 4K ultra high-definition screen option. Razer said the seventh-generation Intel Core i7 quad-core processor achieves "double-digit increases in productivity benchmarks," and paired with Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 graphics delivers "the best frame rates available in an ultra-thin laptop." As for size, the new Razer Blade measures just 0.70 inches thin and weighs a little more than 4 pounds. A full HD panel comes standard, but you can opt for the 4K UHD touch screen for added clarity, the first time Razer has offered this option on its 14-inch model. "The Razer Blade sets the benchmark for performance in thin laptops," Razer co-founder and CEO Min-Liang Tan said in a statement. "More users embraced this flagship computer model in 2016 than ever before, and we are excited to make it even more available worldwide this year. Beyond gaming, it has been really gratifying to see people enjoying the power and portability of the Blade for video editing, music creation, and software development." In terms of specs, the laptop comes with 16GB of system memory (DDR4 running at 2400 MHz), runs Windows 10, and offers up to 1TB of SSD storage. The new Razer Blade Full HD systems are available online now in North America and Europe and in the San Francisco RazerStore, starting at $1,899. The 4K UHD model is expected to launch in the second quarter of the year.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Feb 14, 2017 at 9:00AM Back in April of 2016, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced that it would be implementing restructuring actions that the company said were designed to achieve annual run rate operating expense savings of $1.4 billion. At the time, Intel said that the restructuring was intended to "accelerate [Intel's] evolution from a [personal computer] company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices." A wafer of Intel's 7tg generation Core chips. Image source: Intel. At its Feb. 9 investor meeting, Intel went into much more detail about how it has shifted around its spending. Let's take a closer look. Investment shift year-over-year Intel provided the following chart which illustrates a "bridge" from Intel's 2016 operating expenses to its projected 2017 operating expenses: How Intel's research and development spending is shifting year-over-year. Image source: Intel. This "bridge" shows that Intel expects operating expenses to drop year-over-year due to the spin-off of its Intel Security group (which will now be a stand-alone company called McAfee) as well as reductions in its Client Computing Group (CCG) investment levels. Offsetting those declines, though, is an increase in investment levels in what the company collectively refers to as its "growth businesses" -- Data Center Group, Internet of Things Group, and Non-Volatile Solutions Group. Additionally, Intel says it's investing more in Moore's Law, which means that it's boosting its investments in next generation manufacturing technologies. This makes sense because the company's new development methodology calls for the company to continue to enhance existing manufacturing technologies while simultaneously developing next-generation ones -- something that it didn't really do before. All told, Intel is looking at a modest reduction in operating expenses, year-over-year. Some additional detail In addition to the broad year-over-year spending shifts that Intel talked about above, CFO Bob Swan showed an additional slide that gives more insight into how much research and development spending by market segment is expected to shift from 2015 through 2017. How Intel's research and development spending changed by product category. Image source: Intel. Intel is apparently cutting its research and development spending in personal computer processors by 5% in 2017 relative to where it was in 2015. That's not all that much, to be blunt, and I'd imagine the bulk of that shift comes more from accounting changes (i.e. allocating less of its shared operating expenses to the PC segment and more of it to other segments, like the Data Center Group). Data Center spending is expected to be up by 25% in that two-year period. I'd imagine that part of that increase is due to the shared expense allocation, but I also expect that Intel is increasing its investments here in ways beyond simply a reshuffling of expenses. Intel's investments in non-volatile memory -- a business that Intel expects to be a key growth engine in the years ahead -- are going up 40%. Considering that technology strength is critical to succeeding in the non-volatile memory business (better technology usually translates into a better cost structure, allowing a company to more effectively compete at good margin levels), the boost in spending isn't a surprise. The company's investments in mobile are going to be down 55% per the slide. That's not surprising considering that Intel has refocused its mobile business away from trying to build a broad range of platforms to address the broad range of smartphones toward focusing primarily on stand-alone cellular modems, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) being the company's principal (only?) smartphone customer here. And, finally, Intel is expecting a big boost in its investments within its Internet of Things Group. This business has been growing steadily over the last several years and management had indicated that they're making some big bets on new areas like self-driving cars, so a large increase in research and development spending here makes sense -- especially as the odds that those investments will ultimately pay off look good. Intel's sensible spending shifts At the end of the day, these spending shifts are quite reasonable -- the company is feeding those business segments that have been growing and have the potential to continue to grow, and it's cutting back in areas that aren't expected to grow (i.e. PC processors) as well as in areas where its efforts have fallen flat and success appears unlikely (mobile system-on-chip). Intel management is investing for the long-term, which is the right thing to do. However, investments in high technology usually take years to bear fruit, so don't expect these increased investments made today to pay off tomorrow. It'll be a couple of years before we know if Intel's increased investments will ultimately pay off.   Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Report: Intel’s 8th gen chips will still use 14nm, will arrive earlier than expected Report: Intel’s 8th gen chips will still use 14nm, will arrive earlier than expected By Joel Hruska on February 13, 2017 at 2:45 pm Comment Last year, Intel announced that it would abandon the Tick-Tock model that had served it for nearly a decade and switch to something called PAO — Process, Architecture, Optimization. The point of switching from a two-step process to a three-step system was to give Intel extra time to roll out its next-generation process nodes, while simultaneously affording more opportunity to eke maximum gains out of each current node. Now, new information suggests Intel may have a product plan that tears up PAO (or at least complicates it) going forward. Analyst Ashraf Eassa claims to have confirmed with Intel that upcoming 8th generation Core processors will use an updated/enhanced variant of 14nm technology yet again — call it 14nm++. Intel was able to squeeze some gains out of Kaby Lake in this fashion compared with Skylake, but they weren’t huge leaps. Image by Anandtech A slide showed by Intel at a recent speech on the future of its data center business confirms this by stating “Data center first to next process node,” Anandtech notes. It also makes the point that enterprise and government spending are only worth a 2% increase in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) while the cloud services business is expected to grow by 15% from 2017-2021. Still, at first glance, this may seem a foolish strategy. After all, AMD’s Ryzen will debut in the imminent future, and one might reasonably conclude that Intel’s best leap forward is with a strong 10nm chip rather than a third iteration on 14nm. But this misses a larger issue — one we’ve discussed multiple times over the past few years. As node shrinks become more difficult and the advantages of any given node shrink are less and less potent, it can take longer for a company to deliver meaningful advantages. Intel is still pursuing full node shrinks, unlike its competitors at GlobalFoundries, Samsung, and TSMC. These firms won’t offer equivalent gate lengths or feature sizes to Intel until they deploy their 10nm nodes and aren’t expected to match Intel’s 10nm until they hit 7nm. This is why Intel can still plausibly claim to be ahead on process technology, despite using a higher number to describe it. Image by Ars Technica When Intel debuted 14nm, it pushed that technology into ultra-mobile parts first, where the reduction in power consumption and improvement of low-power clock speeds was seen as critical to the company’s ability to compete with ARM. As we’ve recently discussed, the improvements to Intel’s low-power CPUs have been considerably larger than the boosts to desktop performance in an equivalent period of time. AMD, prior to Ryzen, has been stuck in a similar scenario. We may be arriving at a point where it makes more sense to keep older nodes around and to improve process nodes and architecture over several generations than it does to aggressively transition to each new node. Earlier this year, Mark Papermaster of AMD made comments to suggest that AMD would stick to 14nm for multiple product generations. It’s not clear how this will play out or how aggressively the smaller CPU manufacturer will use the strategy. But we could be seeing a similar play from Intel, which has already deployed 14nm across three families of processors (Broadwell, Skylake, Kaby Lake) and may be prepping desktop Cannon Lake chips for a fourth. Other foundry manufacturers have begun referring to certain nodes as “long-lived” (28nm, 14/16nm, and possibly 7nm) while others (20nm, 10nm) are being described as short-term nodes. This differentiation didn’t used to exist in semiconductor technology and it indirectly speaks to what Intel may be driving at: Some nodes are better than others for certain types of semiconductors. 8th-gen chips on 14nm are now expected in the second half of 2017 rather than the first half of 2018 as had previously been reported. This could mean Intel wants to push new hardware to compete with Ryzen sooner than later. Intel might defend PAO as a process with an undisclosed number of steps in the “Optimization” portion, rather than a discrete series of changes that was meant to apply to three, and only three, groups of processors. This interpretation is undermined by how Intel raised precisely zero objections last year when the world+dog described PAO as a three-step process compared with the two-stop pendulum model of tick-tock. We may see multiple process nodes gathered together under the 8th Generation Core banner, with ultra-low-power mobile and data center chips moving to 10nm first, while desktop and high-power laptop processors following at a later date.

One of the benefits of working for a big company is that you get a say in the type of computer you wish to use. I use a Lenovo ThinkPad, while many of my colleagues use MacBook Airs – a decision that requires an opinion piece of its own to understand. Some folk choose Mac minis. They'll take their Mac mini out of their locker and carry it to their 'hot desk' for the day. At the end of each day, they'll unplug it and return it to their locker. I know, it's mind-boggling – and in more ways than you might think. For one, it has been 854 days since Apple's last Mac mini update, or more than two years. In and of itself, the Mac mini's age isn't a problem, as you should generally be able to get at least three years out of a decent computer, and often many more. But what you won't see on any Apple spec sheet is the fact that its 'latest' Mac minis use Intel's 4th-generation 'Haswell' Core processors. These actually launched in July 2014, making the technology at the heart of the device positively ancient, at least in computer chip time. These processors are significantly less efficient and powerful than current-gen Intel CPUs, and even pale in comparison to the 5th-gen kit found in the seemingly abandoned MacBook Air. Compared to the 6th- and 7th-gen kit found in the latest 13-inch MacBook Pro? Don't get me started. Related: Intel Core i processors explained At £479, the Mac mini is the cheapest way to join the excellent macOS ecosystem; even the most expensive Mac mini model 'only' costs £949, which is less than you'll pay for a new MacBook Pro. Yet given its fossilised internals, you won't be making the most of what macOS Sierra has to offer. You don’t get the benefits of a great touchpad, brilliant screen or backlit keyboard. You don’t get processors powerful enough to do multimedia task particularly well, and the cheapest model also comes with just 4GB of RAM, plus you have to attach numerous cables to get the benefit of its desktop form factor. One argument in favour of the device is that it features more ports than all the MacBooks. This is true: it does have a pair of ThunderBolt/DisplayPort connectors and an HDMI port, along with four USB ports and an SD card slot. However, it can’t output to a 4K monitor at more than a juddery 30Hz, making its high-res capability useless for many people. It’s lumped with slow hard disks in all but the most expensive model, which receives a slightly faster “Fusion” drive with a bit of solid state cache. But there’s no high-performance storage anywhere to be seen. What really irks me here is that the Mac mini has the potential to be a fantastic machine. Nowadays, you can quite happily squeeze a proper quad-core Intel processor into a compact PC chassis, rather than the piddly U-series dual cores in the Mac mini. Intel’s Skull Canyon range of PCs, the stylish HP Pavilion Wave and the impressive Zotac Zbox Magnus, are but three examples of what can be achieved in a compact space. To dive a bit deeper, let's use the Pavilion Wave as our example. It's a complete PC that includes a built-in speaker, high-quality design, and components that are substantially faster than the Mac mini. Yet it costs, at most, £730 for 128GB of SSD storage, a 1TB hard disk and a proper quad-core i5 processor from Intel’s sixth-gen range. Plus, it can output 4K at a full 60Hz. All this value from HP, a company that's aggressively pursuing Apple levels of flashy lifestyle kit. Against the odds, it's actually succeeding. Windows 10 may lag behind macOS in terms of ease of use, but HP's PC shows what’s possible in hardware terms. If Apple simply refreshed the Mac mini this year with the latest 7th-gen Intel Core processors, I might see a reason to buy one again. But what the mini really needs is a complete overhaul – a new design and components that match what consumers expect in 2017. Oh, and a nice marketing push from Apple to help me feel better about parting with my hard earned cash. Maybe a 2017 Mac mini update is in the works and being kept remarkably well under wraps. Given that so many people prefer macOS and the Apple brand – and that the Mac mini is, in terms of computers, the easiest way to get on board with these things – it would make sense. Yet given the complete lack of rumours surrounding a Mac mini refresh, I fear for the future of this compact machine. It's a shame because, ultimately, it means that Apple is content with giving you a half-arsed user experience, undermining its great software by continuing to flog slow and outdated hardware. That's why, this Valentine's Day, I've fallen out of love with Apple. Come autumn, I hope Apple helps me open my heart again. WATCH: Laptop buying guide Do you agree with Michael?

I kept it until if could no longer process my yearly tax returns. But the new iMacs had gotten to be more expensive than I wanted to buy. My mom bought my first one as my birthday/Xmas present. A friend who has worked at Apple for years told me about the then, new Mac Mini. I wasted no time buying one. I am now on my second one, the last 2009 model. It may not be the fastest computer on the block, but it works for me most of the time, with some minor disruptions. I love me my Minis. So far, I have heard the 2010 Mini's are the end of the line of Minis. I refuse to accept that. I don't like laptops and their fragility. I also like that should anyone break in and want to steal my computer, they would likely walk right by my Mac mini, as most people don't even know what it is. As much as I like Apple products - I hate their pricing and I am on a budget for electronics, all which have a limited life. I don't know what I will do if Apple does not either continue the Mini, or come up with something equal or better at a lower price than their other computers. My hope is that Apple is not just content selling to smaller businesses, or those who have a lot more money to spend on electronics. Please, please, please. - either bring back my the MacMinis or, at least something equal or better at a fair market price for the budget minded! I want to stay loyal to Apple and I really don't like PC's. I had to use those at work for years and hated them. matt February 15, 2017, 4:42 am There was a recent article on the web that explained apples limited choices for mobile processors. You got to put part of the blame on intel. I'd love to see a Mac mini with a better video then intel , but intel would sue the crap out of you if you sold an i5 with nvidia graphics Edward Lock February 15, 2017, 6:30 am Why buy an overpriced Lemon like "MAC", when you can have a more capable lemon cream pie PC for less than 1/2 the price.WTF?...........puffy cuteness and esoteric purpleness, yea real useful. Bob Forsberg February 15, 2017, 7:35 am MacOS is my system of choice, but Apple's hardware is, as you say "ancient" by computer standards. Apple has transformed into a hand held device company, ignoring those of us using desktop systems. Since Apple lags in hardware manufacturing, they should license MacOS to run on superior and often refreshed, high-end PC hardware. We miss you Steve. itsallgonepearshaped February 15, 2017, 9:05 am I just bought myself an Intel NUC 6th Gen box. Smaller, lighter and faster than my old mac mini server. I'm moving away from MacOS back to windows due to the lack of investment and continually disappointing and constrained hardware. I will keep my Macbook pro for a couple more years as it's one a year old. Not sure about by my iMac 5k, it's a beautiful machine, but runs Windows under bootcamp(which I need for work) like a dysfunctional child. Alex Walsh February 15, 2017, 11:09 am Hackintosh a Gigabyte Brix? From a quick look Sierra is achievable. That's a proper Mac Mini :) Michael Passingham February 15, 2017, 12:24 pm Yeah, Apple is specific about the chips it wants. The most recent MacBook Pros used last-gen Skylake chips because the Kaby Lake chips apple uses (normally with Iris Graphics on board) weren't ready yet. But, all the same, I do think Apple could slap an SSD in, load it up with some more RAM and upgrade to a Skylake chip and lots of people would be happy. jheartney February 15, 2017, 1:20 pm Got tired of waiting for Apple to sell a reasonable mini-tower; I'm building a Hackintosh. (Macintosh owner since 1990; had more Macs than I can count. Apple's innovative DNA died with Steve, and now they're just a money factory.) Roger Randall February 15, 2017, 11:12 pm Um, there are three generations of Minis beyond the 2010 models. 2011, 2012 and the current (crippled) models. I have 4, one is a quad-core i7 that is pretty fast. You can still buy good used models (prices are going up though) and parts are still available. SCSZ February 16, 2017, 12:58 am I've seen that. But I am hoping Apple will change it's mind or make something better which won't cost to much. I don't want to spend money on a later model Mini and then find out a new one is coming out. I will wait 6 months or so, and see what happens.

Expected to launch in the second half of 2017, the Coffee Lake update to the current Kaby Lake processors will offer an expected 15% bump in performance over its predecessor, though it will still be based on the same 14nm process. That this will represent the fourth generation in a row based on the 14nm process may be a sign of Intel's growing troubles in keeping up with Moore's Law, which suggests die sizes would shrink in half every two years. Increasing complexities with the smaller chips have presented significant challenges in allowing manufacturers to keep up with Moore's Law and, indeed, Intel last year abandoned its former tick-tock model of releases based on Moore's Law in favour of a Process-Architecture-Optimisation cycle that spans three years before a shrink in the die size. Coffee Lake will represent a departure from Intel's stated plans for the new release cycle as well, being the fourth generation based on the 14nm process first introduced with Broadwell. Apart from the performance bump, the only other difference between Kaby Lake and Coffee Lake will be the release of a six-core CPU as part of the standard lineup of CPUs, a feature currently reserved for the higher tier Xeon and Extreme Edition lines. While the company also has a range of processors dubbed Cannon Lake based on a 10nm process in the works, there is no release date currently and language from Intel suggests consumers may not see a die shrink for some time to come, as the company may diverge its offerings between enterprise and consumers, offering the former the newer chips first.

This week Intel took the wraps off its new Xeon E7-8894 v4 processor, providing a new top-end chip and breaking a number of performance records in the process. Intel first debuted the 14-nanometer-based Xeon E7-8800 processor family in June 2016 and is now expanding it with increased performance. "Intel continues to push innovation and process improvements with the Intel Xeon processor E7-8894 v4, which has captured several record-breaking results based on key performance benchmarks, including SAP SD 2-Tier, SPECjbb*2015, SPECcpu2006, LINPACK and SAP BW edition on SAP HANA," Intel stated. With the new E7-8894 v4, up to 32 sockets can be connected via a node controller, which enables configurations that can have up to 24 processor cores. The processor base frequency is clocked at 2.40 GHz and can burst up to 3.40 GHz with turbo frequency. The chip also integrates a 60 MB cache as part of its 165W power envelope. Additionally, the chip can support up to 24 TB of memory in an 8-socket system, which is being positioned by Intel for the in-memory analytics market. Intel is also positioning the high-end chip for scale-up workloads, including online transaction processing and large databases. All that power doesn't come cheaply, though, as Intel currently has then E7-8894 V4 listed online with a recommended customer price of $8,898.

Intel's 8th-gen 'Coffee Lake' chips reuse 14nm process as other Core CPUs ease into new tech It's time to add "Cannon Lake" and "Coffee Lake" to your vocabulary. Mark Hachman (PC World (US online)) on 14 February, 2017 02:06 0 - - - - print email Normally, Intel launches one new microprocessor every year. But Intel is quietly signalling that PCs shipped during the holiday 2017 season could feature one of two new designs, using either its aging 14nm process or the upcoming 10nm technology. The two new names to add to your Intel vocabulary include Cannon Lake, a 10nm chip that Intel showed off at CES last month, and an unnamed fourth-generation 14nm chip that some are referring to as Coffee Lake. The latter chip is perhaps the most interesting, as it would extend Intel’s 14nm chips to a record four generations, following Broadwell, Skylake, and the current Kaby Lake chip. When Intel added a third 14nm chip 2015, signalling the end of the company’s vaunted “tick-tock” manufacturing process, the industry freaked out. A fourth, then, would be absolutely unprecedented. But Intel already seems to be setting the stage to convince investors and customers that it can manufacture four straight generations of chips on the same 14-nm process without giving up consistent performance improvements—which is what customers care about, after all. Why this matters: At its investor day last week, Intel said that its 8th-generation Core chips—which should include Cannon Lake and Coffee Lake—will deliver a 15 percent performance improvement over Kaby Lake. That’s good enough for most consumers. But enthusiasts have to wonder where the additional performance will come from—and whether it will open the door to AMD’s own rival, Ryzen. There’s also a broader question: if Intel’s being forced into shipping a fourth 14nm chip, will the same scenario play out within the 10nm generation? IDG / Mark Hachman Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich shows off Cannon Lake hardware at its CES 2017 presentation. Here’s how 2017 shapes up Intel hasn’t made a big deal of the fact that it’s pursuing parallel 10nm and 14nm strategies, but both chips have been finally referred to publicly. At CES, Intel showed off a two-in-one running Cannon Lake, later claiming that Intel would ship Cannon Lake chips in 2017. Intel’s plan for a separate 14nm chip appeared in a roadmap slide during its investor’s day last week, titled “Advancing Moore’s Law on 14nm”. That roadmap included an illustration showing that the company tentatively plans to ship those 14nm, 8th-generation Core chips during the second half of 2017, too. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of what some are calling a “split” approach is how Coffee Lake and Cannon Lake are positioned. Intel is believed to be targeting Cannon Lake at more premium niche markets such as low-power ultrabooks, leaving the well-established 14nm process powering Coffee Lake for mainstream notebooks and desktops until the 10nm Cannon Lake comes fully up to speed. That strategy avoids forcing Intel to bet everything on the unproven 10nm process, and allows them to focus on premium, high-margin products, analyst Dean McCarron said—the strategy that helped Intel’s client group grow operating profits by 30 percent even as PC shipments declined in 2016. AMD It certainly looks like this could be the summer of Ryzen. How quickly Intel can steal its thunder with Cannon Lake or Coffee Lake remains to be seen. Generally speaking, here’s how 2017 could shape up in terms of CPU releases: Intel’s Kaby Lake holds sway until about early March, when AMD has said that the Ryzen chip will launch. Sometime near the summer—late May, if history holds—Intel should release its high-end Skylake-E chips for gaming PCs. AMD will ship its Raven Ridge chip for laptops and some desktops in the fall, which is also roughly the time frame to expect Intel’s Cannon Lake and Coffee Lake. How Kaby Lake compares to Ryzen will play an enormous role in AMD’s future. But questions will quickly be raised about how the 14nm chip, Coffee Lake, will shape up, too. You may already be asking this question: If Coffee Lake is Intel’s fourth chip on the same 14nm process, how can it possibly be any faster than its predecessors? This isn’t your father’s process technology Historically, Intel increases its chip performance from product to product in two ways: design and manufacturing. This is the aforementioned tick-tock process; a new change to a chip’s design (tick) is followed by a “process shrink” to an improved manufacturing process (tock). Both methods generate performance improvements. The “tock” is where Moore’s Law enters: the number of transistors in a given area doubles every 12 to 18 months as new manufacturing technologies are developed, giving chips a “free” performance boost. But given that Intel is leaving its manufacturing process unchanged, doesn’t that mean that its “tock” improvements will disappear? Intel Intel revealed its plans to extend 14nm technology through the 8th-generation Core products at its investor conference last week. Not exactly. Over time, both the tick-tock model as well as what it describes has broken down. During the Skylake and Kaby Lake generations, Intel smooshed the “tick” and “tock” together somewhat, tweaking both the design and the process technology simultaneously. Even a descriptive term like “14nm” means has also become more vague. Sources confirmed a tweet by The Motley Fool’s Ashraf Eassa, that Intel is using a manufacturing shorthand to distinguish between Broadwell/Skylake (“14nm”), Kaby Lake (“14nm+”), and Coffee Lake (14nm++). That, plus Intel’s shift to a more three-dimensional FinFET architecture, has made identifying each generation by a gate length even more outdated, added Patrick Moorhead, a former AMD fellow and now an independent analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy. “I actually believe that Intel’s 14nm+ is actually closer to other people’s 10nm than they get credit for,” Moorhead said. Intel This is the metric Intel is now pushing to show how its manufacturing is consistently improving: logic cell scaling. In his investor day presentation, Murthy Renduchintala, the head of Intel’s client chip and IoT business, used a different metric in a bid to clear up the confusion once and for all: logic cell area. Under that metric, he said, Intel has steadily shrunk the logic cell by 50% over every two years, and has maintained a steady three-year lead over its rivals. All of this may sound horribly abstract, but the bottom line is this: Moore’s Law has driven the entire computing industry for literally decades. It seems to be slowing down—and in some ways, it is. But Moore’s Law isn’t quite as accurate as it once was, and that inaccuracy masks some of the progress Intel’s making. No easy answer to improved performance Nevertheless, analysts expect that Intel will turn other knobs when improving the performance of a fourth-generation 14nm chip. Since Intel’s roadmap slide confirms that its 8th-generation Core chip runs 15 percent faster than the current Kaby Lake, that implies that Coffee Lake will feature a revised design, analysts say, similar to how the 14nm Kaby Lake chip improves over its 14nm predecessor, Skylake. The “cheap, dirty way” to improve performance involves adding cache memory, McCarron said. “Putting more cache in always solves the problem,” he said. What’s more likely, though, is that Intel will simply combine a number of small improvements, McCarron said, such as running core clocks slightly higher and adjusting power. For his part, Moorhead said that he believed Intel would bet more heavily on improving the integrated graphics engine. “My gut instinct says that it’s a lot of GPU, a little bit of clock [speed], and potentially not a whole lot more instructions per clock” to achieve that 15 percent improvement, Moorhead added. Intel has been quietly working to improve its Iris Pro integrated graphics, and we’d expect that trend to continue. Long gone, then, are the days when Intel dialed up the clock speed to dramatically increase performance. As Moore’s Law slows, Intel will likely take a little bit here, and a little bit there, to gradually push performance higher. So which chip should you buy, Coffee Lake or Cannon Lake? Because of the way in which Intel plans to reportedly split up the two architectures, neither should compete with each directly—at least at first. Remember, Intel’s deliberately delaying its 10nm process as part of its “datacenter first” strategy, giving the 10nm tech a chance to ripen on the vine. Eventually, it seems like Cannon Lake and Coffee Lake collide—and then what? At this point, we simply don’t know. We’re Hooked on Our Devices, But Can We Handle the Eye Strain?

Vulkan is similar to DirectX 12 and can be used for many applications, but it is most relevant to visual applications like games. Games and VR applications written in Vulkan will work with GPUs integrated into Intel's 7th Generation chips code-named Kaby Lake and 6th Generation chips code-named Skylake. It will also support the Intel HD Graphics 505 GPU in Pentium chips code-named Apollo Lake. The support could open the door for Vulkan applications to work on Windows-based virtual reality headsets. Later this year, PC makers like Lenovo, Dell, and HP are expected to release headsets that attach to Windows 10 PCs. Microsoft will launch VR development kits with tethered headsets at the Game Developers Conference, which starts on Feb. 27 in San Francisco. Intel has ramped up graphics capabilities of its integrated Kaby Lake GPUs, making it capable of 4K graphics. Vulkan will exploit the new features for a better gaming experience. It's already possible to run Vulkan games on Windows PCs via drivers provided by Nvidia and AMD, which sell discrete GPUs. But Intel's support for Vulkan is now official, and the previous beta drivers were considered highly unstable. Most Windows games today run on closed-source DirectX 12 technology. The open-source Vulkan has many similar features -- it takes full advantage of the latest GPUs and CPUs for better graphics. It also uses fewer system resources and can generate images faster. It's also easier to port games from DX12 to Vulkan, which succeeds the older OpenGL set of APIs. Porting games from DirectX to OpenGL was considered time-consuming. Some premium smartphones like Samsung's Galaxy S7 also support Vulkan. Games running Vulkan use fewer system resources and preserve battery life in laptops and mobile devices. Vulkan is already seen as a future for gaming on Linux PCs and Steam Machines.

Intel researches tech to prepare for a future beyond today's PCs Intel is investing heavily in quantum computing and neuromorphic chip research as it prepares for the post-Moore's Law era Agam Shah (IDG News Service) on 11 February, 2017 04:26 0 - - - - print email IDG Intel realizes there will be a post-Moore's Law era and is already investing in technologies to drive computing beyond today's PCs and servers. The chipmaker is "investing heavily" in quantum and neuromorphic computing, said Brian Krzanich, CEO of Intel, during a question-and-answer session at the company's investor day on Thursday. "We are investing in those edge type things that are way out there," Krzanich said. To give an idea of how far out these technologies are, Krzanich said his daughter would perhaps be running the company by then. Researching in these technologies, which are still in their infancy, is something Intel has to do to survive for many more decades. Shrinking silicon chips and cramming more features into them is becoming difficult, and Intel is already having trouble in manufacturing smaller chips. Smartphones, PCs, and other devices are getting smaller, faster and more power efficient thanks to Moore's Law, a 1965 observation loosely stating that the number of transistors in a die area would double every two years, causing performance to double while driving down the cost of making chips. Intel has been using Moore's Law as a guiding star to make faster and smaller chips and reducing the price of devices. However, it is widely agreed that Moore's Law is slowly dying, and Intel's manufacturing struggles are growing. For decades, Intel's business has been heavily reliant on its ability to make and deliver chips. But the process is slowing down. Intel used to advance manufacturing processes every two years, and that has now changed to three to four years. One way to resolve that crisis -- which all chipmakers face -- is to completely change the current computing model in PCs, smartphones, and servers. The current model -- known as the Von Neumann approach -- involves data being pushed to a processor, calculated, and sent back to memory. But storage and memory are becoming bottlenecks. The answer is to adopt new models of computing, which is where quantum computers and neuromorphic chips fit in. Quantum computers have the potential to be powerful computers harnessing the unique quality of a large number of qubits to perform multiple calculations in parallel. Neuromorphic chips are modeled after the human brain, which could help computers make decisions based on patterns and associations. Intel has made some advances in quantum computing and neuromorphic chips. But Krzanich's comments lend more credibility to the company's push to look at a future beyond today's computing models. Some short-term answers can resolve the bottlenecks based on Von Neumann model, including Optane, Intel's new form of super-fast memory and storage. It could unite SSDs and DRAM in systems, cutting one bottleneck. Intel is also embracing silicon photonics, which could resolve throughput issues in data centers. Both technologies have researched for more than a decade and are now practical. The chipmaker has lived off the PC industry for decades but is now looking to grow in markets like data centers, the internet of things, automotive and high-performance computing. The new focus is bringing a gradual change to the way Intel makes chips. It's similar to the 1970s, when different types of chips like vector processors and floating point arrays were crammed together for complex calculations. For example, Intel is slapping together two separate functional blocks for applications like machine learning and autonomous cars. Intel envisions FPGAs combining with CPUs in autonomous cars. Later this year, the company will release a chip called Lake Crest, which combines a Xeon server CPU with deep-learning chip technology it picked up through its Nervana Systems acquisition. Intel is also merging an FPGA inside an Intel Xeon chip to carry out machine learning tasks. Intel is expecting a lot of data to be generated by sources like autonomous cars, which will need edge processing for tasks like image recognition, analysis, and map updates. Intel is pushing its wide roster of co-processors to the edge, and that is where the quantum and neuromorphic chips may fit. Quantum computer research is also being done by other companies. D-Wave recently released a 2,000-qubit quantum computer based on quantum annealing, while IBM has a 5-bit quantum computer accessible via the cloud. IBM is also playing with brain-like chips and has benchmarked its TrueNorth chip, which has a million neurons and 256 million synapses. Academic institutions like the University of Heidelberg in Germany, Stanford University, and the University of Manchester in the U.K. are also working on neuromorphic chips. HPE has shown a computer that emulates the human brain, and it intends to adapt ideas from that for servers.

The high-volume factory is targeted to use the 7 nanometer (nm) manufacturing process. It will produce microprocessors to power data centers and hundreds of millions of smart and connected devices worldwide. The announcement was made jointly by President Donald Trump and Intel CEO Brian Krzanich at the White House. According to company officials, the completion of Fab 42 in 3 to 4 years will directly create approximately 3,000 high-tech, high-wage Intel jobs for process engineers, equipment technicians, and facilities-support engineers and technicians who will work at the site. Combined with the indirect impact on businesses that will help support the factory’s operations, Fab 42 is expected to create more than 10,000 total long-term jobs in Arizona. “Intel’s business continues to grow and investment in manufacturing capacity and R&D ensures that the pace of Moore’s law continues to march on, fueling technology innovations the world loves and depends on,” said Krzanich. “This factory will help the U.S. maintain its position as the global leader in the semiconductor industry.” America has a unique combination of talent, a vibrant business environment and access to global markets, which has enabled U.S. companies like Intel to foster economic growth and innovation. Brian Krzanich, CEO, Intel Corporation “Intel is a global manufacturing and technology company, yet we think of ourselves as a leading American innovation enterprise,” Krzanich added. “America has a unique combination of talent, a vibrant business environment and access to global markets, which has enabled U.S. companies like Intel to foster economic growth and innovation. Our factories support jobs, high-wage, high-tech manufacturing jobs that are the economic engines of the states where they are located.” Intel is America’s largest high-technology capital expenditure investor ($5.1 billion in the U.S. 2015) and its third largest investor in global R&D ($12.1 billion in 20151), Intel officials said. The majority of Intel’s manufacturing and R&D is in the United States. As a result, Intel employs more than 50,000 people in the United States, while directly supporting almost half a million other U.S. jobs across a range of industries, including semiconductor tooling, software, logistics, channels, OEMs and other manufacturers that incorporate our products into theirs. The 7 nm semiconductor manufacturing process targeted for Fab 42 will be the most advanced semiconductor process technology used in the world and represents the future of Moore’s Law. In 1968 Intel co-founder Gordon Moore predicted that computing power will become significantly more capable and yet cost less year after year. The chips made on the 7 nm process will power the most sophisticated computers, data centers, sensors and other high-tech devices, and enable things like artificial intelligence, more advanced cars and transportation services, breakthroughs in medical research and treatment, and more. These are areas that depend upon having the highest amount of computing power, access to the fastest networks, the most data storage, the smallest chip sizes, and other benefits that come from advancing Moore’s Law, a suggestion from experts in the field predicting the number of integrated circuit transistors per square inch has doubled and is likely to increase to the same degree every year.

WD recognizes that enthusiasts and the high-end computing market have moved over to PCIe SSDs to get many times more performance than traditional SATA storage drives. The WD Black PCIe SSDs have sequential read/write speeds of up to 2050MB/s read and up to 800MB/s write with the backing of a nice 5-year limited warranty. Those speeds are pretty impressive, but believe it or not they are on the lower side compared to many of the other NVMe drives on the market, so this is something we’d actually consider an entry-level PVIe NVMe SSD. We might not be making any brownie points over at WD by saying that, but their pricing shows that we thoughts are accurate. WD currently offers the Black M.2 PCIe NVMe series in two capacities; 256GB ($109.99 shipped) and 512GB ($199.99 shipped) at Amazon. Those Amazon prices put the WD Black 512GB drive around $0.39 per GB and that makes it one of the lower price M.2 PCIe NVMe drives on the market today. The Intel SSD 600P series is widely regarded as being the lowest priced NVMe series around and you can get the Intel SSD 600P 512GB for $179.99 shipped, so WD is bringing out the WD Black 512GB M.2 PCIe NVMe drive for $20 more than that particular model. WD appears to offer better performance and a matching 5-year warranty, so the price premium could be justified and that is what we hope to find out in our benchmarks. The WD Black PCIe SSD series uses a Marvell 88SS1093 controller and 15nm TLC NAND Flash by Sandisk. These components help the WB Black PCIe SSD reach sequential speeds of up to 2,050 MB/s read and either 700 MB/s write on the 256GB  drive or 800 MB/s on the 512 GB drive. The 4K Random Read/Write performance (Q32, T4) is rated at up to  up to 170,000 IOPS for 4K Random Reads and either 130,000 IOPS (256GB drives) or 134,000 IOPS (512GB drives) when it comes to the 4K Random Write performance. Write endurance ratings are 80 TBW and 160 TBW for the 256GB and 512GB models respectively, which are on the lower side. The good news is that the WD Black has a lengthy 5-year warranty and 1.75M hour MTTF rating! WD Black M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD Specifications:   Marvell 88SS1093 M.2 PCIe Gen 3 x 4 NVMe Controller – Tri-core CPU architecture 2D TLC NAND Flash – Sandisk 15nm Operating Temperature – 0° ~ 70°C MTBF: 1,750,000 hours 4K Aligned Random Read: up to 170,000 IOPS 4K Aligned Random Write: up to 130,000 IOPS (256GB), up to 134,000 IOPS (512GB) Sequential Read & Write Transfer: Up to 2,050 MB/s Read | Up to 700 MB/s Write (256GB)/Up to 800 MB/s Write (512GB) Low Power Mode PS4: 5.5mW Low Power Mode PS3: 50mW Active Power: 135mW Max Power: 8.25 Watts Endurance: 256GB: 80 TBW 512GB: 160 TBW Warranty: 5-Years WD Black M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD Features:   NVMe 1.2 Protocol Support Security Protocol: TCG Pyrite Security Subsystem Class (SCC) and SSD Password via ATA Pass-through (ATA Security), which provides a mechanism to control access to user data. SLC Caching Technology – non-volatile write cache On-The-Fly Error Handling Mechanism – Page-level striping with distributed parity providing a last line of data protection TRIM Command – helps sustain drive’s high performance over time Dynamic and static wear-leveling – to help extend the life of the SSD Bad Block Management Background Garbage Collection Error recovering using LDPC (Low-Density Parity Check) & ECC (Error Correction Code) Minimal write amplification – increases endurance and performance NVMe power management Self-thermal throttling – To avoid cases where the SSD temperature exceeds the products allowable temperature envelope, or where NVMe power management does not throttle down effectively. The drive that we’ll be reviewing today is the WD Black PCIe Gen3x4 NVMe SSD that is 512GB in capacity and sold under part number WDS512G1X0C-00ENX0. We were expecting to see a black PCB on the WD Black PCIe SSD, but WD is sticking with blue for some unknown reason. The WD Black PCIe SSD has a blue PCB! Flipping the drive over you’ll find two more 128-gigabit planar MLC NAND Flash chips and a spot for more memory, but it is not being used. The WD Black PCIe SSD series does not require NVMe drivers to work properly on a PC, but you can manually install other brands NVMe drives if you really wanted to do so. We used the default StorNVMe drivers in WIndows 10, but manually disabled the write-cache buffer. The standard Windows NVMe driver in Windows 10 and Windows 8.1 doesn’t pass the Force Unit Access (FUA) command. FUA commands bypass the DRAM cache on the SSD and write directly to the drives cache resulting in really bad performance. Storage review sites that use AS SSD, Anvil and PCMark (Storage 1.0) may show low write performance due to this. You can do registry hacks to disable FUA or simply turn off Windows write-cache buffer flushing in Windows Device Manager for the storage drive you want to benchmark. Companies like Intel, Samsung and OCZ have released special NVMe drivers for some of their NVMe drivers to remedy this situation. We’ll show you Anvil scores with Windows Write-Cache Buffer Flushing off to show you the performance difference that can be seen by turning this feature off. Let’s take a look at the test system and then jump into the benchmarks. Questions or Comments? View this thread in our forums!

More like this AMD strengthens gaming and VR on Linux with graphics improvements 12 things Kaby Lake-based PCs will offer Microsoft sets Windows 10 PC requirements for tethered VR headsets Video Windows 10 Quick Tips: Getting the most from Cortana Intel is bringing more options to improve gaming and virtual reality experiences on Windows PCs with official support for Vulkan APIs (application programming interfaces). Vulkan is similar to DirectX 12 and can be used for many applications, but it is most relevant to visual applications like games. Games and VR applications written in Vulkan will work with GPUs integrated into Intel's 7th Generation chips code-named Kaby Lake and 6th Generation chips code-named Skylake. It will also support the Intel HD Graphics 505 GPU in Pentium chips code-named Apollo Lake. The support could open the door for Vulkan applications to work on Windows-based virtual reality headsets. Later this year, PC makers like Lenovo, Dell and HP are expected to release headsets that attach to Windows 10 PCs. Microsoft will launch VR development kits with tethered headsets at the Game Developers Conference, which starts on Feb. 27 in San Francisco. Intel has ramped up graphics capabilities of its integrated Kaby Lake GPUs, making it capable of 4K graphics. Vulkan will exploit the new features for a better gaming experience. It's already possible to run Vulkan games on Windows PCs via drivers provided by Nvidia and AMD, which sell discrete GPUs. But Intel's support for Vulkan is now official, and the previous beta drivers were considered highly unstable. Most Windows games today run on closed-source DirectX 12 technology. The open-source Vulkan has many similar features -- it takes full advantage of the latest GPUs and CPUs for better graphics. It also uses fewer system resources and can generate images faster. It's also easier to port games from DX12 to Vulkan, which succeeds the older OpenGL set of APIs. Porting games from DirectX to OpenGL was considered time-consuming. Some premium smartphones like Samsung's Galaxy S7 also support Vulkan. Games running Vulkan use fewer system resources and preserve battery life in laptops and mobile devices. Vulkan is already seen as a future for gaming on Linux PCs and Steam Machines.

In the initial comparison, Videocardz compared the four, six, and eight core Ryzen models with numbers taken from Toms Hardware. The four core model held the lowest position on the chart with the six core just a few thousand points behind several Intel chips. The eight core model beat out all but the best Intel chips at a stock speed of 3.4 GHz, and fell just short of the Core i7 6950X when overclocked to 4.0 GHz. When compared to the official Futuremark score database, the overclocked eight core Ryzen beat the i7 6950X by about 500 points. On a per core basis, the eight core Ryzen outperforms the i7 6950X and the six and four core Ryzen perform even better. A number of Intel chips were able to convincingly beat the Ryzen chips on a per core basis, with the i7 7700K overclocked to 4.8 GHz reigning supreme. At a cost of $389 for the eight core Ryzen and $1700 for the i7 6950X, AMD can certainly offer a tremendous amount of bang for your buck.

The launch of the chips has been confirmed by Intel and the parts will launch in the second half of 2017. We have to wonder what’s going on over at Intel at this point, the chipmaker has been talking up that vaunted 10nm process tech, getting us all excited, and then going back to the 14nm process that it has used on parts gong all the way back to 2014. Broadwell, SkyLake, and Kaby Lake processors all used the 14nm process. The Intel Kaby Lake Refresh with the more powerful Core i7-7740K or Core i7-7770K CPU is expected this summer and will also be using the 14nm process. Rubbing salt in our wounds even more is the fact that Intel had promised 10nm chips in 2017 back in January. Despite Coffee Lake keeping the same build process, Intel is saying that the new chips will give a 15% performance boost over the predecessor chip. It is thought that the Cannon Lake data center chip running 10nm build process will land before the consumer parts that we all want. Another little tidbit is that the Cannon Lake parts are expected to be built at the Arizona Fab 42 that has been pulled back into action. PC fans aren’t the only folks disappointed by the lack of 10nm chips, smartphones expected to be running chips with 10 nm tech under the hood are going without as well. At least most are, Samsung has apparently gobbled most of the 10nm chips out there for its Galaxy S8 smartphone. Before you fret too much over any potential lost performance with Coffee Lake not getting 10nm process tech, check out our Core i7-7700K Kaby Lake review and see what Coffee Lake will improve on. Basket of Winning ✓ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ LMAO uroshi I don’t see where is all this incredible change, performance CPUs stay on 14nm, power sensitive ones go on 10nm. I think this was more or less known for a while. Apparently the 10nm process is not an upgrade regarding attainable frequencies and mostly gives just a decent power reduction in comparison to the 14nm process. Give them some time to think it over and I am sure they will manage to solve the issue and most probably call the refined process 7nm. We will soon know when the so called 7nm processes of the other foundries come to market (more or less comparable to Intel’s 10nm).

DOWNLOAD Intel Security Mends Cybersecurity Fragmentation with Unifying Strategy February 14, 2017February 14, 2017 by CloudBuzz 23shares Offering Integrated and Automated Solutions, Expansive Partner Ecosystem, Advanced Architecture with Cross-Industry Collaboration SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 14, 2017 – Today Intel Security outlined a new, unifying approach for the cybersecurity industry that strives to eliminate fragmentation through updated integrated solutions, new cross-industry partnerships and product integrations within the Intel Security Innovation Alliance and Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA). “Transforming isolated technologies into a cohesive security system is without a doubt the most daunting challenge facing practitioners today,” said Chris Young, senior vice president and general manager of Intel Security Group. “The battle against our adversaries cannot be fought alone; it will take people, products, organizations and industries working together to eliminate the fragmentation of security through automation, partnerships and unified architectures.” The workforce shortage facing the cybersecurity industry makes it increasingly difficult to hire and retain employees. These scarce resources make it harder to maintain a coherent security architecture to prevent damage from and minimize the cost of emerging threats while embracing the potential of new open source, digital, cloud and security technologies. Our research and customer discussions have underscored the need for trusted partners that work cooperatively to reduce the burden of fragmented technologies and help organizations stay focused on securing their business assets and productivity. With this in mind, Intel Security is pleased to announce several new product integrations and updates, new industry partnerships and increased open source and standards-based collaboration that will strengthen the effectiveness of cybersecurity infrastructure across the industry’s largest open ecosystem. Integrated Solutions At the heart of a unified strategy for cybersecurity is the need for integrated solutions that tie into the enterprise’s framework to address top-of-mind challenges. Intel Security announces new and updated solutions that do exactly that: McAfeeâ Enterprise Security Manager (ESM) 10 and McAfee® Virtual Network Security Platform (vNSP). With the high cost of detecting and resolving cyberattacks, the need for SIEM solutions that are intelligent and intuitive has never been greater. The newly released McAfee ESM 10 joins an expanded McAfee® Foundstone™ security operations center (SOC) services portfolio to help security analysts to be far more effective. New capabilities include: Intuitive and Collaborative User Interface: A new user interface reflects extensive incident management workflow usability testing, delivering on increased efficiency, faster and more effective threat detection and response, and the ability to manage multiple incidents within the same dashboard. Contextual Threat Intelligence: Significant advancements have improved ongoing contextual threat intelligence and immediate access to critical threat data to identify, scope and orchestrate responses to emerging attacks. Trusted Expertise Offerings: Foundstone threat researchers (i.e., Intel Security’s expert security consultants) can now augment staffing as part of a virtual SOC offering, adding expertise, capacity and coverage to supplement existing enterprise capabilities and extending the Foundstone services lifecycle SOC portfolio. The need for advanced malware protection within the public cloud environment calls for integrated virtual solutions. McAfee® vNSP now extends virtual network protection to Amazon Web Services* (AWS) cloud and OpenStack* cloud deployments, with new simplified multi-cloud licensing, easily protecting virtual networks. New capabilities include: Virtual Network Protection for Public Clouds: McAfee vNSP is an industry-leading solution that protects AWS workloads from attacks like zero-day, bots, malware and application-level DOS with both detection and protection mode. It integrates seamlessly with AWS Auto Scaling to deliver a fully scalable security solution with a single pane of glass. Virtual Network Traffic Inspection for Private Clouds: vNSP continues to add support for multi-hypervisor platforms, which now includes VMware® ESX®, VMware NSX™ and OpenStack cloud with its best-of-breed next-generation IPS. Security Operations can now manage their public and private cloud security from a single network security management console giving them full visibility. Cloud-Based Threat Analysis: New integration with McAfee® Cloud Threat Detection allows McAfee® Network Security Platform (NSP) to easily and efficiently augment existing inspection capabilities with sophisticated cloud-based malware analysis. Ecosystem Momentum and Cross-Industry Collaboration  Transforming fragmentation requires the industry to work cooperatively to build meaningful integrations. Today, the Intel Security Innovation Alliance, the industry’s premier technology partnering program, announces 15 new partnerships, bringing the total number of partners to more than 135 globally. Over the past year, 35 partners have integrated or planned integrations with the McAfee Data Exchange Layer (DXL), the industry-endorsed communication fabric, providing real-time interaction between applications. Since announcing the OpenDXL initiative – an open industry standard for all developers to increase integration flexibility, simplicity and opportunity – Intel Security has expanded its commitment to open source and community adoption. Today, Intel Security is publishing more open source software on github.com/opendxl to further reduce high-integration complexity and cost, and replacing lengthy manual and repetitive processes for enterprises. These advancements include: New Integrations: New open source connectors for McAfeeâ Threat Intelligence Exchange (TIE) and McAfeeâ Active Response (MAR) let applications easily use these tools to search endpoints and query and set file reputations, simplifying the process of querying endpoints within the enterprise environment to just 20 lines of code. Expedited Availability: Responding to customer demand, Intel Security has expedited availability of the OpenDXL Python client, which is now available for organizations to download, develop and deploy with confidence. For demonstrations of technology integrations using OpenDXL, visit the Intel Security booth at #N3801 – North Hall of the Moscone Center. New Capabilities: New OpenDXL connectors for McAfeeâ ePolicy Orchestrator® (McAfee® ePO™) platform APIs enable easy, fast options to apply policies, tag systems, move groups and trigger actions within the industry-leading security platform. The new capabilities open up the most frequently used capabilities of the McAfee ePO platform web APIs, and permit more applications to leverage centralized and efficient management with a lightweight integration process. New Partnerships: With the goal to improve cybersecurity efficiencies and maximize protection, 15 new companies have joined the Intel Security Innovation Alliance: Absolute Software*, Bay Dynamics*, Cyphort*, DFLabs*, Digicert*, Dropbox*, io*, Fireglass*, Kaspersky*, Opswat*, Radware*, SailPoint*, SAS Institute*, SS8 Networks* and ThreatConnect*. Intel Security also announced that it is now sharing and consuming advanced threat intelligence through the Cyber Threat Alliance Platform (CTAP) and that it has a plan to further integrate CTAP with its products. CTAP is a platform that scores and shares threat intelligence among members of the Cyber Threat Alliance. Shared CTAP Indicators of Compromise help Intel Security and other CTA members detect and better understand new, emerging attack campaigns. This allows CTA members to more quickly protect their customers’ systems. As announced earlier today by the Cyber Threat Alliance, it is now formally incorporated as an independent, 501(c)(6) entity, with a president, board of directors and permanent standing committees. It is generously funded by the founding members – Intel Security, Fortinet*, Palo Alto Networks*, Symantec*, Check Point* and Cisco Systems*. Each founding member has committed $1 million over the next two years to the success of the Cyber Threat Alliance.

Transcript: My fellow Americans, This week our hearts are with the people of Louisiana and Mississippi. Families have lost their homes, businesses, and livelihoods after devastating tornadoes swept through many, many communities.  My administration will make sure they have the support that they need and really desperately want. We’re going to take care of them. It’s remarkable to see Americans across the country come together to help families rebuild their lives. That is the beauty of the American spirit – there’s nothing like it. There is a great spirit all over the country – and that spirit is what we will need to rebuild America to, as I have said so often, Make America Great Again. On Tuesday, I was pleased to host at the White House the CEO of Intel, who announced that Intel will invest $7 billion dollars in a new manufacturing facility in Arizona – creating thousands of new American jobs. That’s what we want, new American jobs, and good jobs. Intel decided to move forward with this project because they know we are totally committed to lifting the regulatory and tax burdens that are hurting American innovation and companies. In fact, we are in the process right now of working on a major tax reform that will massively reduce taxes on our workers and businesses.  We want to make it much easier to do business in America – and that’s what we are going to do. We are going to make it also much harder for companies to leave.  They’re not just going to say bye-bye and fire everybody. There will be consequences. I want America to be the great jobs magnet of the world – but we can’t do that if we don’t stop the wasteful rules and excessive taxes that make it impossible for companies to compete.  Every hour of every day, my Administration is focused on creating jobs for our people and I mean good jobs. More jobs, better jobs, higher-paying jobs – that’s our mission. This week, I also met with Sheriffs and Police Chiefs from across the country.  I pledged to them that we would stand with the incredible men and women of law enforcement – and so too will our great new Attorney General, Jeff Sessions. My administration is committed to your security, which is why we will continue to fight to take all necessary and legal action to keep terrorists, radical and dangerous extremists from ever entering our country.  We will not allow our generous system of immigration to be turned against us as a tool for terrorism and truly bad people. We must take firm steps today to ensure that we are safe tomorrow. We will defend our country, protect our Constitution, and deliver real prosperity for our people. God bless you, God bless America. Have a great week.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Intel Optane-branded solid-state drive for data… Intel Optane-branded solid-state drive for data centers spotted in leaked specs By Kevin Parrish — February 10, 2017 11:43 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you Intel's Optane-branded products aim to speed up PCs by merging the speed of system memory and the storage capabilities of NAND memory. The first Optane-branded product released by Intel may be a solid-state drive for data centers. The news arrives by way of leaked specifications for the P4800X Series SSD stuffed onto a PCI Express add-in card. It will have a 375GB capacity, promising the read/write performance of standard system memory (DRAM) and the storage capabilities of NAND flash technology. That’s the big selling point of Optane products: The merging of the two DRAM and NAND technologies. Optane is based on 3D XPoint technology jointly developed by Micron and Intel, which stacks memory cells vertically rather than horizontally, like standard SSDs and flash drives. This enables more storage capacity and better performance due to 3D XPoint’s vertically designed checkerboard design. Here are some of the specs for the unannounced Optane SSD: Sequential read speed: Up to 2,400MB per second Sequential write speed: Up to 2,000MB per second Random 4KB IOPS read speed: Up to 550K per second Random 4KB IOPS write speed: Up to 500K per second Latency (typical) Read/Write: <10 microseconds Security: AES 256-bit encryption supported Mean Time Between Failures: 1,000,000 hours Endurance Rating: 30 drive writes per day 12.3 petabytes written Form Factor: PCIs 3.0 x4 half-height, half-length, low profile Operating system support: Windows Server 2016 / 2012 R2 Windows 8.1 / 10 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 / 7.0 / 7.1 / 7.3 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP4 / 12 SP1 UEFI 2.3.1 Intel’s Optane products will reportedly have excellent performance with a queue depth of one. A queue depth is essentially the number of commands that the SSD’s controller queues at the same time. Typically, tests show that the performance of an SSD is rather poor when only one command is queued in the controller whereas performance greatly improves when 32 commands are queued. That huge performance gap supposedly isn’t the case with Intel’s Optane drives. Intel first revealed its Optane products during the CES 2017 technology show in January. They were in the form of sticks that connect to an M.2 slot on a PC’s motherboard. Offering 16GB and 32GB capacities, they aim to speed up PCs with hard drives installed by putting the most-used files on the speedier Optane drive to provide SSD-like performance. More: Intel’s 48-thread, 24-core Xeon superchip will cost nearly $9,000 The two Optane products on display at CES falls under the company’s Optane Memory group for storage caching in HDD-based systems. The leaked P4800X Series drive falls under its Optane SSD umbrella providing drives with more than 120GB of storage capacity. Optane will also include DRAM products that are crammed into PCs just like memory sticks. We reached out to Intel for further comment about the leaked Optane SSD specs, but just like the company’s recent eighth-generation Core processor tease it dangled in front of Twitter users, Intel is remaining tight-lipped about the leaked Optane drive specs. Bribing Intel didn’t help us gain additional information either. On a mainstream level, the take from all of this Optane talk is that systems will get a huge performance boost from these 3D XPoint-based products. We expect to hear more from Intel in the coming weeks.

By Keith Townsend | February 14, 2017, 4:00 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/Baks It seems as if software has eaten the world, except for network hardware. Feature enablement is frustratingly slow in the network device space. For example, it took major network vendors approximately four years to add VXLAN support to mainstream routers and switches. VXLAN makes perfect sense for the integration of virtualized networks and physical networks. Even with the agreement of major vendors such as Cisco and VMware, the rollout trailed the business drivers for years. The primary challenge is the ASIC-based approach used by the network industry. Barefoot Networks looks to eliminate the inflexibility of ASIC-based device design while maintaining performance via their new Tofino chip. ASIC vs. x86 performance Intel has done some amazing things with networking on x86, especially with Intel Xeon-based networking. The Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) has achieved performance of 233 Gbps (347 Mpps) using a Xeon E5-2658. Telecom and application developers can build applications that provide any number of data services on packets transiting an Intel-based network function virtualized (NFV) instance. SEE: How Intel's open source Data Plane Development Kit enables high-performance Linux networking x86-based network solutions have enjoyed the flexibility of software. VMware's NSX is a great example of a platform that quickly integrates new protocols and services via software. In many instances, 233 Gbps of performance is more than fast enough. However, the performance of x86 network is just a fraction of the throughput available via dedicated ASIC. ASIC chip maker Broadcom recently announced a processor capable of 1Tbps throughput in a much more network-friendly physical package that supports high-density network connectivity. Network device manufacturers have long sacrificed flexibility for performance in system design. Unlike general computing processors, ASICs are purpose-built to accelerate specific algorithms. Protocols such as VXLAN require a redesign of the ASIC to perform high-throughput processing. Couple slow design, regression testing, and manufacturing into the equation and new protocol integration can take years to complete.

During TFD, Barefoot Network discussed some of the lessons the company learned from the graphics processing units (GPU) industry. Companies such as NVIDIA have transformed themselves into high-performance compute (HPC) companies, as opposed to companies simply focused on the graphics industry. As a result of the lessons it learned, Barefoot Networks announced their Tofino platform. Tofino is a programmable chip that enables line rate processing up to 6.5Tbps. Customers or network vendors can leverage the P4 programming language to customize white box solutions or fixed configuration products that offer x86-like flexibility while providing ASIC-like performance. The company also provided a reference design to the Open Compute Project (OCP) that leverages the Wedge 100B switch. The Wedge 100 is a plan submitted to OCP by Facebook. Leveraging a Wedge 100B with a Tofino chip, customers the size of Facebook can build a custom switching platform with only the services needed for operation of their application. The limited feature switches improve performance and reliability by eliminating general purpose features not needed by the customer's applications. Vendors could use the same platform to provide 100G network products with just the services individual customers require. It may take some time for enterprise customers to create custom code for white box switches. The more direct impact, however, is tighter release schedules for new services such as VXLAN. Tofino is a platform to watch carefully. As part of a long-term strategy, enterprise network managers need to pay attention to the chipsets in their network vendor products.

provided by SAS Feb 14, 2017, 08:00 ET Share this article CARY, N.C., Feb. 14, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- SAS, the leader in analytics, today announced it has joined the Intel Security Innovation Alliance. The new collaboration will add SAS® Cybersecurity, SAS' security analytics software platform, to the partner ecosystem's diverse portfolio of integrated security offerings. The venture builds upon a long-standing analytics modernization relationship between SAS and Intel, combining SAS' world-class advanced analytics platform with Intel's computational power to help businesses tap the full potential of their ever-growing data sources. This latest collaboration with Intel Security empowers customers to harness best-of-breed prescriptive and predictive analytics to better safeguard their invaluable data assets and infrastructures from ever-advancing cyber threats. "As analytics become a foundational component of security architectures, organizations will face the critical decision of choosing an analytics partner – a decision that must consider the ability to manage the full analytics life cycle," said Stu Bradley, Vice President of SAS Cybersecurity Solutions. "SAS brings an unrivaled pedigree in analytics to the Intel Security Innovation Alliance that will complement the partners' cohesive, unified array of security solutions with advanced analytics software to improve visibility and reduce cyber risk." Analyst firm IDC's inaugural Worldwide Semiannual Security Spending Guide, 2015H2 Forecast Release, projected that businesses would spend an estimated $73.7 billion on security-related software, services and hardware in 2016 alone – a figure predicted to grow to $101.6 billion by 2020. Despite such substantial annual investment, IT teams most commonly manage a fragmented patchwork of security tools, each collecting massive amounts of data but with no means to interact or generate a holistic view of security. The result is blind spots that weaken the organization's overall security posture. "Organizations need a robust analytics platform to capitalize on all the security data that's being exchanged – to reveal insights that are not being driven by the individual, siloed solutions themselves," said Bradley. "Intel Security's common data taxonomy creates robust opportunity for SAS to seamlessly deliver the enterprise visibility missing in today's security ecosystems." The Intel Security Innovation Alliance's mission is to accelerate the development of interoperable security products and simplify their integration within complex enterprise environments. As the largest pure play analytics vendor in the collective, SAS will assume a critical role in helping address industry's growing need to respond more quickly to security events, optimize workflows, and achieve more with existing (and often limited) security resources. "The Intel Security Innovation Alliance is driving a new era in security, where all components come together to work as a single, cohesive system, regardless of vendor or underlying architecture – and now with the benefit of SAS' top-ranked advanced analytics to augment defenses through enhanced security insights," said DJ Long, Senior Director of the Intel Security Innovation Alliance. "Together we will stimulate powerful new analytically driven workflows for security and compliance, reduce operational costs, and minimize the toll of adversaries threatening today's business, government and consumer data." Today's announcement came out of RSA Conference 2017, the world's leading security conference, being held Feb. 13-17 in San Francisco. To learn more, visit SAS at Booth N4308.

March 2017 now looks most likely, although Tim Cook has been dropping some worrying hints... We round up all the rumours of a new Mac Pro for 2017: the new Mac Pro's release date, price, tech specs, design changes and new features by Karen Haslam | 14 Feb 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents Launch date Will Apple discontinue the Mac Pro? Tech specs Buying guide for current Mac Pro models When will Apple release a new Mac Pro for 2017? And what tech specs, new features and design changes should we expect when Apple updates the Mac Pro line for 2017? Is there any chance Apple will discontinue the Mac Pro instead of updating it? We've had a long wait for the new Mac Pro. The current Mac Pro model was announced at WWDC in June 2013 and, for a top-of-the range system, the Mac Pro is looking pretty long in the tooth. But when will Apple announce a new Mac Pro? And what hardware improvements, design changes, tech specs and new features will we see in the new Mac Pro for 2017? There's some good news for expectant Mac Pro fans: code in Mac OS X El Capitan hints that a new Mac Pro (one with 10x USB 3 ports) could arrive soon. But nothing is certain at this point, and some pundits believe the Mac Pro should simply be discontinued. Some Apple appreciators are even working on concept images and videos of what an updated Mac Pro could look like. A concept video by a French designer sees the Mac Pro take the route of looking like an iMac while borrowing a lot of ideas from the Microsoft Surface Studio. Take a look for yourself here. Whatever the future holds for the Mac Pro, in this article we will be looking at all the rumours surrounding the next update of the Mac Pro line: the new Mac Pro's UK release date and pricing, its expected design, and the new features and specs we hope to see in the next version of the Mac Pro. For more discussion of upcoming Apple launches, take a look at our New iMac rumours and our big roundup of Apple predictions for 2017. And if you're considering buying one of the current Mac Pro models, read Where to buy Mac Pro in the UK and our Mac buying guide. See also: New MacBook Pro rumours | New MacBook Air rumours | New MacBook rumours | New iMac rumours | New Mac mini rumours New Mac Pro 2017 release date rumours UK: Launch date We expect the new Mac Pro to be launched in March 2017. The present Mac Pro was unveiled at WWDC 2013, and it's been more than three years since it went on sale. It's about time, then, for an update to the Mac Pro for 2017. Of course, Apple hasn't announced an official launch date for the next generation of Mac Pro systems - the company is known for its code of silence when it comes to upcoming product launches. We had entertained hopes of a Mac Pro update at Apple's 27 October press event, but no such luck. In the event Apple unveiled a new MacBook Pro instead: a rather lovely new laptop with a customisable touch bar above the keyboard. (You can read more about that device here - New MacBook Pro 2016 review - and here: New MacBook Pro on Apple Store.) Despite the lack of news about the new Mac Pro in October, we remain optimistic that Apple will refresh the line in the near future. A few months back a source at one of Apple's partner companies confidently told us to expect this by the end of November, which was evidently wishful thinking; but it seems likely that March 2017 will see the Mac Pro updated alongside other Apple products. (However, we suspect the update will only involve spec/component bumps rather than a full-blown redesign of the Mac Pro.) Read more: iPhone 7 release date | iPhone 7 Plus release date New iMac 2017 release date: Apple CEO hints at future of the iMac In a rare Q&A session on Apple's internal employee network, Apple CEO Tim Cook gave an interesting response to a question about the future of the Mac, specifically mentioning the 5K iMac in his response. According to a transcript obtained by TechCrunch, an unknown Apple employee asked Cook: "We had a big MacBook Pro launch in October and a powerful upgrade to the MacBook back in Spring. Are Mac desktops strategic for us?" Interestingly, it's what Cook didn't mention in his response that suggests what Apple is planning for the future. In response, Cook wrote the following: "The desktop is very strategic for us. It's unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop - the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people. "The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world. Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops. If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that." If you look closely, Cook never used the word "Mac" in his response. At all. Considering it's the name of Apple's oldest product line, you would think it'd get a mention in a question about the company's desktop lineup. Granted, he does mention desktop computers several times, but never the name of the hardware, apart from one exception - the 5K iMac, which hasn't been updated in over a year. Essentially, Cook was asked whether Mac desktops were strategic, and he answered that desktops were important. What about the Mac Pro? A report from Bloomberg might explain why Cook responded in this way, with keen Apple watcher Mark Gurman claiming that Apple has reorganised its software engineering department, meaning there's no longer a team dedicated to macOS - instead, engineers work on both iOS and macOS. He continues to claim that the Mac has been generally de-prioritised within the company, and that Mac engineers no longer get much attention from the company's industrial design team, which was until 2015 led by design chief Jony Ive, allegedly focussing more on iPhones and iPads. This suggests, to us at least, that while Apple is imagining a future where desktops are still being produced, they might not feature the iconic Mac branding. Could Apple be working on a macOS/iOS hybrid to launch as the ultimate desktop experience? With the astonishing number of iOS apps compared to macOS apps, it may be a smart investment for the company, but only time will tell. If so, this would signify the end of the Mac Pro line, a line that was once the pride of Apple, but has now been neglected for three years.  New Mac Pro 2017 release date: El Capitan code hint Code discovered in Mac OS X El Capitan offers a hint that a new Mac Pro may be on its way soon. There's a reference to a new Mac that's codenamed "AAPLJ95,1" within El Capitan, according to Pike's Universum. The current Mac Pro is similarly codenamed AAPLJ90,1 so it's plausible that the code refers to a new version of the professional-level workstation. Another clue that this is the Mac Pro: the code hints that there are 10 USB 3.0 ports on the new machine, and only the Mac Pro has anywhere near that many ports. (Currently there are 4 USB ports and 6 Thunderbolt 2 ports on the Mac Pro, while the iMacs have 4 USB and 2 Thunderbolt.) We think adopting Thunderbolt 3 on the Mac Pro may make more sense as it brings Thunderbolt to USB-C at 40Gbps for the best of both worlds. More on that below. It's been well over a year since El Capitan was launched, and many Apple fans have now moved on to macOS Sierra. We'll update this if any smoking guns are discovered in the Sierra code. New Mac Pro 2017 release date: Delays in 2013/2014 When Apple launches the new Mac Pro there may well be delays in availability, as there were in 2013-2014. Apple first unveiled the Intel Xeon (Ivy Bridge-E) Mac Pro at WWDC in June 2013, but the unit didn't actually start shipping until December that year. In fact, for most shoppers the supply of Mac Pro was so constrained that they didn't receive their new Mac until 2014 - in some cases not until February, or March, or in a few cases April. Having previewed the Mac Pro at WWDC in June 2013, the company promised availability before the end of 2013, but it wasn't until 19 December that the Mac Pro became available. Then, following the launch, stocks were so limited that only a lucky few, US-based, customers were able to purchase the new professional Mac workstation before the end of 2013. Customers in the UK who ordered their new Mac on 19 December 2014 found that they would have to wait until January 2015 for the new Mac Pro. Some lucky UK customers finally received their Mac Pro around 12 January. This was almost a year after the old version of the Mac Pro was banned in Europe because it didn't comply with EU safety laws. One reason for the delays back in 2013 was thought to be the fact that Apple was building the new-look Mac Pro in the US: Apple had a new design which was being produced at an entirely new factory in the States, so the delays were understandable, although maybe not excusable. New Mac Pro 2017 release date: New delays We had hoped to hear new developments about a new Mac Pro, so we're growing impatient and are hoping for an update soon. Could updates to the current model face the same issues that slowed the production lines back in 2013? We think probably not. If you check Apple's website, you'll see that the wait for the current Mac Pro has come down to 24 hours (although if you want a build-to-order version the wait will be about 5-7 business days). The fact that Apple is no longer struggling to meet demand would suggest that when it launches the next Mac Pro there will not be the significant delays in getting units out to customers that there were at the end of 2013. Instead, the reason for the long wait for an update to the Mac Pro could be simple lack of interest in this workstation-style Mac. Apple may be focusing attention on other projects such as the Retina iMac, which was updated in October 2015. It's possible that Apple doesn't intend to update the Mac Pro at all. The company has launched several other new Macs since the launch of the Mac Pro, including impressively powerful iMacs that can sometimes perform better than the current entry-level Mac Pro can. Video editor Max Yuryev tested Final Cut and Premiere Pro rendering on both the 5K Retina iMac and 6 Core Mac Pro and found that the iMac performed better in some cases, although did suffer from heating issues that the Mac Pro avoids thanks to its design. Yet we don't think Apple is trying to phase out the Mac Pro in favour of a more powerful iMac line-up. It's more likely that it's just spending a long time getting the new Mac Pro right before it launches, after the issues it experiences with the previous launch. There is still a market for the more powerful Mac Pro, we think. But not everyone agrees with us, as we'll see in the next section. New Mac Pro 2017 release date rumours UK: Will Apple discontinue the Mac Pro? Maybe the Mac Pro will never be updated. MacObserver argues that the current Mac Pro is a failure, and compares it to the ill-fated Cube, which was available for less than a year in 2000/2001. (We look at more interesting failures and controversies in our roundup of the worst Apple products.) It's possible, indeed, that Apple will update its iMac line to the point where it satisfies the needs of pro users, rendering the actual Pro line irrelevant. As a thought experiment, TechRadar has imagined the specs of an 'iMac Pro' - "that glitzy, 27-inch 5K display paired with a 10-core Intel Xeon E7 (or two) and the latest and greatest AMD FirePro W9100" - and in this day and age the number of Mac buyers who really need the top spec appears to be dwindling.  Many professional Mac users are still using old Mac Pros from pre-2012 mainly because they are easily upgradable, with options for larger-capacity drives (2TB, 4TB or even more). You can even get a 12-core 3.46GHz processor in the older model that could give the newer, 2.7GHz 12-core processor in the 2013 Mac Pro a run for its money. As for video card options, the old Mac Pro has many more. Those who did upgrade to the 'new' trashcan-like Mac Pro are also finding that the need for multiple expansion cards and external drives are cluttering up their desks, where previously these extras could be neatly concealed inside the Mac Pro chassis. For all Apple's claims about it being a powerful machine, it appears that the Mac Pro is just not considered a professional workstation by the intended market - which does raise uncomfortable questions about its future as a product line. But with its status as Apple's flagship Mac, and the hoopla surrounding its reinvention in 2013, the US assembly plants and so on, we'd be surprised if Apple threw in the towel just yet. New Mac Pro 2017 release date rumours UK: Tech specs Currently, there are two standard Mac Pro models available along with various build-to-order options: Quad-Core and Dual GPU: 3.7GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor; 12GB 1866MHz DDR3 ECC memory; Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM each; and 256GB PCIe-based flash storage. 6-Core and Dual GPU: 3.5GHz 6-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor; 16GB 1866MHz DDR3 ECC memory; Dual AMD FirePro D500 with 3GB GDDR5 VRAM each; 256GB PCIe-based flash storage. It seems likely that Apple will update the Mac Pro with the next-generation Intel Xeon E5 processor described above, we may also see more RAM in the entry-level version, now that the 15-inch MacBook Pro range ship with 16GB as standard. We'll go into more detail below. New Mac Pro specs: Ports The current Mac Pro sports six Thunderbolt 2 ports, which means this Mac can be connected to up to three 4K displays. There's also 4 USB 3 ports; Dual Gigabit Ethernet; and an HDMI 1.4 UltraHD, as well as a combined optical digital audio output/analog line out mini-jack; headphone mini-jack with headset support; HDMI port supports multi-channel audio output and a built-in speaker. Code in the El Capitan beta actually suggests that the next generation Mac Pro will offer 10 USB 3.0 ports. Currently there are 4 USB 3 ports and 6 Thunderbolt 2 ports on the Mac Pro. We think that it would make more sense if Apple adopts Thunderbolt 3 on the Mac Pro - this standard of Thunderbolt supports USB Type-C and offers 40Gbps transfer speeds, so Mac Pro users would get the best of both worlds. Thunderbolt 3 offers double the speed of USB 3.1, which is only 10Gbps.   Another thing Apple could add is a Lightning port as seen on the iPhone. Yes really. There are rumours that the lightning port will be used on Macs for plugging in headphones which could allow for high-res audio. However, many traditional Mac Pro users are still calling out for PCI slots, which would allow users to add faster SSDs and better video cards. Some even ask for internal drive bays, with Mac Observer noting that a 3.5in hard drive bay would allow for archival space to be added. New Mac Pro specs: Current processor The 2013 Mac Pro features Intel's Xeon E5 V2 processors (code-named Romley) offering up to 12 cores (as a build-to-order option). Back in September 2014 new Xeon E5 V3 chips (code-named Grantley) started shipping - bringing the Haswell architecture to pro workstations. At the time we thought the processor would soon make their way to the Mac Pro, but no upgrade emerged. Those Intel Xeon E5 V3 chips were being used in Dell's new Xeon Precision Tower (5810, 7810 and 7910) - find out more on Dell's website. These Dell workstations use the Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 processor series featuring either 14 or 18 cores per processor. The processors in the current Mac Pros are configurable up to 3.5GHz for a six-core option, 3.0GHz for an 8-core option, and 2.7GHz for a 12-core option. We may see a slight boost in these numbers, but we could equally see the same clock speeds, with the processors themselves being faster. It is possible that the new Mac Pro will, like the Dell above, offer an option of 14 or 18 cores. New Mac Pro specs: New Xeon E3-1205 v6 or Xeon E3-1585 v5 processor It is likely that we see brand new Xeon processors in the Mac Pro. It's expected that we see a late Skylake (Xeon E3-1585 v5) or the new Kaby Lake ( Xeon E3-1205 v6) processors included. The Intel Skylake processor features a base clock of 3.5GHz, four cores and eight threads - it has 8MB of cache and features the Iris Pro Graphics P580 - a powerful in-built GPU that will help low-profile renders. However, with Kaby Lake already being shipped to OEMs and manufacturers, we are more likely to see these new processors shipped with the new Mac Pro. The rumoured Xeon E3-1205 v6 is a base model - featuring 3GHz of processing power - we expect more powerful and optimised CPUs to be included within the Mac Pro. Read next: i5 or i7? What is turbo boost? Here's how to choose the best processor for your Mac New Mac Pro specs: Graphics The 2013 Mac Pro features dual workstation-class GPUs. The Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM each in the Quad-Core version, and Dual AMD FirePro D500 with 3GB GDDR5 VRAM each in the 6-Core model. There’s also a build-to-order option of the Dual AMD FirePro D700 GPUs with 6GB of GDDR5 VRAM each (an extra £540).  AMD showcased new its new FirePro W-series at Siggraph in August 2014. The FirePro W7100, W5100 may find their way into the new Mac Pro. Alternatively there are significantly faster graphics based on AMD's Fury platform that may be destined for the new Mac Pro. Update (08/03/2016): After a thread on the Apple Support Communities website amassed a huge response when complaining about faulty graphics cards in the Late 2013 Mac Pro, Apple admitted that a number of Mac Pro's have faulty cards and that affected customers could have the issue fixed free of charge. To be legible for a free repair, you must have encountered "distorted video, no video, system instability, freezing, restarts, shutdowns" or system startup failure.  It's not all Mac Pro's though, only those manufactured between February 8 and April 11 2015, and the issue can be fixed by taking your damaged Mac Pro to an Apple Store. Interestingly, MacRumours notes that the issues are known to exist with the AMD FirePro D500 and D700 GPUs, with the AMD FirePro D300 being completely unaffected. Will these issues force Apple into choosing another graphic card manufacturer for the next Mac Pro? While there are no rumours online that suggest so, we think a change could be on the cards for the Mac Pro GPU.

We'd like to see more storage as standard on the Mac Pro, as the target audience tend to be working with very large files. An option for 2TB flash storage would be nice. New Mac Pro specs: RAM The new Xeon E5 V3 Grantley chips are said to have DDR4 memory controllers, so you can expect even faster memory in this year's new Mac Pro. The current models offer 12GB RAM in the Quad-Core model, and 16GB in the 6-Code model as standard. You can add 32GB RAM at point of purchase for £360, or a massive 64GB RAM for £1,080. As we mention above, the 15-inch MacBook Pro now comes with 16GB RAM as standard, so we would hope that the updated entry-level Mac Pro would match that. 64GB RAM might sound like a lot to you, but some of these Dell workstations can accommodate up to 1TB of DDR4 RAM. We hope that the next generation of Mac Pros will be configurable to more than 64GB (four slots of 16GB). New Mac Pro specs: Internal design Here's one last titbit that may offer clues about the Mac Pro of the future. Apple has been granted a patent for the Mac Pro, specifically for the structure and organisation of internal components and external interfaces for a compact computing system, according to a report on Patently Apple.

Read our Mac Pro reviews: Mac Pro Six-Core/3.5GHz (late 2013) review | Mac Pro Quad-Core/3.7GHz (Late 2013) review | 2013 Mac Pro review, BTO version Where can I buy a Mac Pro? The most obvious place to buy a Mac Pro is from the Apple Store. Other than directly from Apple, you can buy the Mac Pro from Apple Premium Resellers such as Stormfront, Square Group, Solutions Inc, iStore, Western Computer, MR Systems, KRCS, HardSoft, and PC World. You can find an Apple Premium Reseller near you by searching on Apple's site. UK pricing for the Mac Pro Currently the Mac Pro starts at £2,999 in the UK for a quad-core 3.7GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor with 10 MB L3 cache and Turbo Boost up to 3.9 GHz, 12GB RAM, Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB of VRAM and 256GB of flash storage.  There is also a 6-core model with 3.5GHz Xeon E5, 16GB RAM, two AMD FirePro D500 cards with 3GB of VRAM, and 256GB flash storage for £3,899. We expect that prices won't change significantly when Apple updates the range, although we could see a drop in the old model and a rise in the base 2017 model - as we've seen through other Apple products. See: Apple price increases UK. Current pricing for Mac Pro build-to-order options  The build-to-order options will push the price higher. The following specifications are available for the 2013 Mac Pro: Build-to-order options on the 3.7GHz Quad-Core Mac Pro 2013: 3.5GHz 6-core option (add £450), 3.0GHz 8-core processor (add £1,800), or 2.7GHz 12-core processor (add £3,150); 16GB (add £90), 32GB (add £450) or 64GB (add £1,170) RAM memory; dual AMD FirePro D500 (add £360), or or dual AMD FirePro D700 (add £900); 512GB (add £180) or 1TB flash storage (add £540) Build-to-order options on the 3.5GHz 6-Core Mac Pro 2013: 3.0GHz 8-core processor (add £1,350), 2.7GHz 12-core processor (add £2,700); 32GB (add £360) or 64GB (£add £1,080) RAM memory; dual AMD FirePro D700 (add £540); 512GB (add £180) or 1TB flash storage (add £540). A Mac Pro with the maximum 12-core 2.7GHz processors, with 30MB L3 cache, 64GB RAM, 1TB PCIe-based flash storage, Dual AMD FirePro D700 GPUs with 6GB of GDDR5 VRAM each currently costs £8,759 including VAT.

I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents Release date  Apple's October Mac event Will Apple discontinue the Mac mini? Price Specs and features Design What is the Mac mini? When will Apple release a new Mac mini in the UK? And what new features and design changes can we expect from the updated Mac mini in 2017? A new Mac mini was expected to launch in 2016, since the line wasn't updated at all in 2015; but Apple (as usual) is giving nothing away. Nevertheless, based on past experience and the specs of current Macs, we've got a fair idea of what to expect from the new Mac mini, and when to expect it. We've got all the new Mac mini hints and rumours for you right here. Read on for the next Mac mini's likely release date, specs, design changes and new features. We'll update this article whenever new information is unearthed, so check back regularly for the latest Mac mini update rumours. And remember to check our Mac buying guide for current buying advice, and our guide to the best cheap iPad deals. Last update: Apple has officially made the Mac mini (Early and late 2009, and mid 2010) vintage and obsolete. But we still feel a Mac mini update is due in 2017; read on for the latest rumours. New Mac mini 2017 rumours: Release date When will the next Mac mini come out? Apple last updated the Mac mini on 16 October 2014 after a two-year wait: the previous model came out on 23 October 2012. Mac mini fans are now waiting for the next iteration of the smallest and cheapest Mac. There were rumours suggesting that Apple would do a low-key update to its Mac desktop range by the end of November 2016, focusing on the Mac Pro but potentially covering the iMac and Mac mini at the same time. But it seems Apple disliked the idea. Instead, we would expect the mini to be updated during the company's usual spring event in March 2017. If we still don't see a Mac mini update in March 2017, it's probably safe to assume that Apple has killed off the Mac mini line. New Mac mini 2017 release date rumours UK: Apple's October Mac event Apple's 27 October Mac launch event was broadcast live on Apple's website. While the company did announce three new versions of the MacBook Pro (two with a new Touch Bar), the rest of the Mac range, including the Mac mini, seemed to be pushed to the side. There was no mention of any other Mac updates, and the event finished rather quickly when looking at the length of previous Apple events.  Does this spell the end of the Mac mini range? As mentioned above, while we assumed that Apple would stick to its two-year upgrade cycle for the Mini, it seems not to be the case. We speculate that if it doesn't get announced at an event in March 2017 (when Apple usually updates the MacBook), we think that Apple will kill off the Mac Mini line entirely. We explain why in more detail below.  See also: New MacBook Pro release | New MacBook Air release | New MacBook release | New iMac release | New Mac Pro release New Mac mini 2017 release date rumours: Previous theories One popular theory for a while was that the new Mac mini might make an appearance at WWDC 2016, which started on 13 June 2016 - but in the event, Apple didn't announce any new Macs at all. (Although Mac fans can console themselves with all the news about the macOS Sierra operating system, and what that means for your current machine. You can install macOS Sierra on your Mac mini right now, if it's a 2010 model or later.) The next generation of Intel chips was made available to OEMs in Q4 2016 - they're called Kaby Lake, and it's possible that the new Mac mini could feature processors from this batch. But we're getting ahead of ourselves. We'll talk about processors, and other specs, in a later section of this article. Also read: Mac mini vs MacBook Air  New Mac mini 2017 release date rumours UK: Will Apple discontinue the Mac mini? Apple, to paraphrase a colleague, is generally very good at killing its darlings: at knowing when it makes sense to drop a much-loved product or product feature - one which is often still popular and/or profitable - and switch focus to something else that has more of a future. Think the iPod classic or the optical drive, or dropping the headphone port from the iPhone 7. There are a couple of candidates to be the next iPod classic. The MacBook Air is one. But the Mac mini, which hasn't been updated since 2014, is rarely mentioned at events, and feels surplus to requirements now that the Apple TV is making its claim as a media centre device (although for storing a large number of films the mini remains an excellent choice, offering 500GB as standard and up to 2TB as a configuration option), will be expecting a P45 more than most of Apple's product line-up. The design of the Mac mini hasn't changed significantly since it was first launched and is starting to feel a little dated, and the device doesn't have a clear selling point (or at least, Apple isn't doing a good job of communicating one). So it wouldn't surprise us if Apple quietly retired the line at its next Mac launch event. It's either that or give it a radical overhaul. If Apple does kill off the mini, we'd have to start asking questions about the 'mini' branding in general, and wondering if the iPads are going to be reorganised: there's already a sense that the 'Air' brand is on the way out, across both MacBooks and iPads. But that's a story for another day. New Mac mini 2017 release date & specs rumours: Price How much will the next Mac mini cost? There are currently three models of the Mac mini available; the one that's best for you will depend on your budget and computing needs. The cheapest model currently costs £479, the middle model is £679, and the priciest model is £949 - this is a price increase since its launch, due to Brexit. Of course, you'll still need to factor in the price of a monitor, keyboard and mouse. (For advice on that, see our roundups of the Best Mac monitors, Best Mac keyboards and Best Mac mice.) However, we don't anticipate Apple reducing the price with the new model when it launches, so you can expect similar pricing. Hopefully better specs for your money, though, of course. Which leads us on to... New Mac mini 2017 release date & specs rumours: Specs and features The Mac mini is Apple's most budget-focused desktop system and as such features relatively low-end components. But what specs upgrades should we expect from the next Mac mini? Processor: The Kaby Lake question It's unlikely that Apple will include an AMD processor in the next generation of Mac minis... unlikely, but not out of the question, given that AMD's new CPUs are set to come out this year. We'd rate the chances of an AMD chip appearing in the 2017 Mac mini as slight. However, we do expect Kaby Lake, the latest generation of Intel chips. Intel has now started shipping its Kaby Lake processors. But the key word there is 'started': the Kaby Lake processors that would be suitable for a Mac mini may not appear for some months, assuming Apple decides to plump for a Kaby Lake chipset at all. According to MacRumors, in fact, mini-appropriate Kaby Lake chips may not roll out until very late 2016 or even early 2017, so any Mac mini launched before then would be limited to Skylake, the previous generation of Intel processors. That would still represent a significant power boost over the current Haswell processors. Kaby Lake supports Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2, as well as 4K video. The chips are manufactured using a 14nm process, same as Broadwell and Skylake. The next generation, Cannonlake, will switch over to a more accurate 10nm process. As we discuss in our iMac rumour roundup, Intel has laid out a roadmap for its next four generations of processor. After Skylake and Kaby Lake, Intel will release Cannonlake, then Ice Lake in 2018 and Tiger Lake in 2019. Graphics Our iMac predictions also include new graphics chipsets: Polaris 10, by AMD, which is particularly interesting because it may make the next iMacs VR-ready. But the current range of Mac mini models feature integrated graphics, and we expect this to remain the case in the next generation. RAM Right now, the entry-level Mac mini features just 4GB RAM as standard, which we think should be ramped up to 8GB in the new entry-level model. Storage The other big change we hope to see in the new Mac mini is the addition of more flash drive options. Currently the 2.8GHz model comes with a Fusion Drive, or you can add 256GB flash storage to that model, or the 2.8GHz model. While the 500GB hard drive in the current entry-level model (and the 1TB hard drive as standard in the £569 model) might appear attractive to some, flash memory is so much faster that we believe it is well worth the compromise of storing additional files on an external hard drive. However, it seems unlikely that Apple would do away with the hard drive storage option altogether, as many workgroups choose the Mac mini as a server and will need the extra capacity and lower prices that HD storage makes possible. Read next: New iMac rumours | New Mac Pro rumours USB-C It's felt like the USB port has been on borrowed time ever since Apple launched the first-gen 12-inch MacBook - with its lone USB Type-C (or, more commonly, just USB-C) port for both data and charging - in 2015. Like the optical drive circa 2012, it seems likely that bog-standard USB 3.0 is no longer in Apple's thoughts, and (unless the market rejects USB-C comprehensively, which despite some qualms about there only being one port on the MacBook, hasn't happened yet) it's surely a matter of time before the rest of the Mac line-up switches across to the newer tech. USB-C offers more advantages than just being reversible and thereby easier to connect when you can't see what you're doing; in theory, it offers twice the data throughput of USB 3.0 and the ability to deliver far more power. The latter factor enabled Apple to use USB-C as a combined data and power port and further slim down its laptop design. Our feeling is that the Mac mini won't be next on Apple's update list, however - our money's on the revamped MacBook Pro. As a budget-focused (and somewhat neglected) line, the Mac mini isn't likely to get the love and cutting-edge componentry of more favoured products. And power delivery - and the ability to remove extraneous ports and slim down the chassis - is far less of a concern for a static machine like the mini than for a portable like the MacBook. New Mac mini 2017 release date & specs rumours: Design It's possible that the Mac mini will get a new design. We're not expecting a major visual or build redesign, but it is certainly possible that it could get thinner and smaller, especially since it no longer has to accommodate a CD drive. Right now the dimensions are 3.6cm high, 19.7cm wide, and it weighs 1.22kg. How about a Mac mini that has similar dimensions to an Apple TV? (That's 9.8cm wide, 2.3cm high, and a weight of 0.27kg.) There was some speculation that the reason for the long delay prior to the Mac mini update in 2014 was that Apple was looking at redesiging the Mac mini along the lines of the Mac Pro. This was probably intended as an April Fool's Day prank, but we like this render of a flat Mac mini, as seen on Apple User. Even better, how about a Mac mini that's also an Apple TV? Adding Apple TV functionality to a Mac mini would be a great way of getting the Mac mini into people's living rooms as a home entertainment device. New Mac mini 2017 rumours: What is the Mac mini? Not the no-brainer it might sound like to keen mini-heads: plenty of otherwise tech-savvy folk aren't aware the Mac mini even exists. Indeed, sometimes it seems like Apple itself isn't aware of its presence. That would certainly explain the long gap before the 2014 model was launched. The Mac mini is Apple's smallest desktop Mac and also its cheapest Mac, at £479. It's a full-blown OS X or macOS Sierra desktop that fits into a self-contained chassis no bigger than a set-top box. It's an inexpensive living-room Mac that lacks the power of even some MacBooks and comes with no keyboard, mouse or display, but one that works perfectly as the centre of your digital home - not least because it comes with HDMI sockets, so that plugging it into a modern TV is a doddle. There used to be a Mac mini with OS X Server available for £849 but Apple removed that option from the line-up in October 2014.

How An Old PowerMac G5 Compares To Modern Intel CPUs Written by Michael Larabel in Hardware on 14 February 2017 at 07:52 AM EST. 31 Comments With Debian and Ubuntu dropping 32-bit PowerPC support in their future releases, you may be curious how the older PowerPC hardware compares to Intel's modern x86 processors if you are wishing to switchover. Here are some benchmarks. A Phoronix reader has provided comparison benchmarks of his PowerMac G5 to our recent Intel Kabylake CPU benchmarks and other recent x86 CPU tests. His PowerMac G5 v2 with the PPC970 is dual-core and clocks up to 2.0GHz. This Apple computer has 2GB of RAM, NVIDIA GeForce FX 5200 Ultra graphics, and was running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with the Linux 4.4 kernel and GCC 5.4 compiler. I, unfortunately, have no physical access to any PowerPC hardware at all. Fortunately, thanks to Phoronix reader Alexandre Couture we have these comparison data points to my recent Intel Linux CPU tests. With all of the tests done via the Phoronix Test Suite and centralized on OpenBenchmarking.org, it makes for easy independent yet reproducible and automated comparisons. The PowerMac G5 performance is incredibly poor compared to modern Intel x86 CPUs. This PowerMac7,2 model dates back to 2004 and was great back in the day... Now it won't even work with future Ubuntu/Debian releases. So even switching over to a $40 Kabylake Celeron CPU will be a huge upgrade in performance. Or a sub-$100 Pentium CPU is also a big upgrade if not wanting to switch to a Core CPU. Thanks to Alexandre for sending in these results showing how far performance has come since ~2004 with Apple PowerPC hardware. Unfortunately with no access to any PowerPC hardware, I'm not able to deliver any results showing how modern POWER hardware is performing. Those wishing to see more of these older PowerMac comparison results to Intel x86 CPUs can visit this OpenBenchmarking.org result file. 31 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Zoals in het screenshot te zien is kan je er nog een paar testen mee doen en een secure erase mee uitvoeren. De system tuner is nutteloos op Windows 10 voor zover ik kan zien. Alles stond ook standaard al goed bij mij terwijl ik zelf niets heb veranderd. Reageer +1 forsel @Lennyz • 14 februari 2017 11:15 Klinkt niet zo nuttig. Ik heb zelf een Samsung ssd, die hebben ook zulke tools. Maar gebruiken ga ik zo'n tool niet, geloof ik. Reageer +1 DukeBox @forsel • 14 februari 2017 11:26 Waar samsung juist wel wat kan toevoegen door een memory cache aan te maken. Bij veel io komt dat de levensduur ten goede. Reageer +1 forsel @DukeBox • 14 februari 2017 11:44 Bedankt voor de tip! Zal het dan toch eens proberen. Reageer 0 Tourmaline System en netwerk utilities @DukeBox • 15 februari 2017 15:53 Dan pakt hij wel minimaal 2gb of meer van je ram, om een memory cache aan te maken. Reageer 0 DukeBox @Tourmaline • 15 februari 2017 16:17 Nee (er vanuit gaande dat je GB bedoeld), RAPID mode will release and re-acquire system resources seamlessly based on system activity and requirements. RAPID mode consumes at most 25% of the installed DRAM, up to a maximum of 1GB.Voor performance heeft het voornamelijk nut bij SATA2 en in sommige gevallen SATA3 drives. Omdat ik mij ook afvroeg hoe het zat met write optimalisatie, heb ik zelf een test gedaan bij het spelen met games en wat foto bewerking. Met 2 Samsung 850 2TB EVO SSD's die in mirror staan, een mét rapid mode een zonder heeft die zonder rapid mode gemiddeld 3% meer writes. Het is niet veel maar in andere gevallen kan de winst veel meer zijn (of minder). Het is eigenlijk jammer dat de cache niet groter kan zijn dan 1GB en/of een langere write delay. Dat zou nog meer kunnen helpen.

Reageer 0 DukeBox @Tourmaline • 15 februari 2017 16:35 Toen ook niet, denk dat je in de wat bent met de minimale systeemeisen van 2GB. edit: Dit was de white paper op moment van de introductie: http://www.samsung.com/se...id_Mode_Whitepaper_EN.pdf Bevat exact dezelfde info als de huidige.

Het is wel al een tijdje geleden. In de oude versie kon je zelf nog aangeven hoeveel geheugen cache je wilde aanmaken. Ik lees net op het www dat de nieuwere magacian software sommige opties niet meer hebben.

Rival AMD has tried, a times valiantly, to keep up, but other than a short spurt in popularity with the Athlon 64 line, Intel’s maintained its commanding lead. Since the launch of its ‘Core i’ series of processors, particularly the second generation Core i series, Intel’s lead has only been growing. This lead can in part be attributed to Intel’s tick-tock development cycle. This cycle involves a tick, which changes the chip design, and a tock, which shrinks the manufacturing process. These ticks and tocks alternate each year. The process shrink refers to the size of the transistor gates. As a rule of thumb, the smaller they are, the faster and more efficient they run, resulting in ever-increasing performance. A shrink in transistor size also means that a higher density of them can be packed into a given area. Intel’s manufacturing process has shrunk from 32nm in 2011 to 14 nm today. The next step is 10nm, and this was expected last year. For the last few years, Intel appears to have hit a roadblock. The shrink to the 10nm process is taking longer than expected and even forced Intel to abandon its tick-tock cycle for something that it’s calling PAO (Process Architecture Optimisation). To put it another way, Intel has so far released three chips on the 14nm process – Broadwell (14 nm), Skylake (14 nm) and Kaby Lake (14 nm+), which caught the tech industry off-guard. Kaby Lake should have been built on the 10nm process. Now, it appears that Intel will release yet another generation of chips on the 14nm process. Called Coffee Lake (14 nm++), this will be Intel’s eight generation Core i series chip. There’s nothing to be consternated about, however. As PCWorld explains, this new 14 nm process, called 14 nm++ internally, is very different from the first 14 nm Broadwell chips. As ArsTechnica points out, Kaby Lake offers 10-15 percent more performance than Skylake, partly due to higher clock speeds, for the same TDP. The upcoming Coffee Lake chips will offer up to 15 percent more performance over Kaby Lake, says Intel. Either way, that’s a big bump in performance. To add to this, 10nm chips are actually coming and they’ll form the Canon Lake lineup. Analysts think that Intel plans to ship Coffee Lake chips for more mainstream applications and that the 10 nm Canon Lake chips will first hit low power devices like Ultrabooks before making their way to the mainstream. This will help Intel iron out any kinks in the 10 nm process. AMD is finally throwing a spanner in Intel’s works as well. AMD’s Ryzen expected to pose quite a threat to Intel’s stranglehold on the high-end PC market. Will Intel’s 15 percent performance bump be competitive? We’ll know for sure by April this year. The fight for CPU supremacy is indeed shaping up to be an interesting one.

Abhijit Ahaskar Asus R55UQ is a feature packed notebook capable of handling most heavy tasks and games. Click here for enlarge Asus R558UQ is one of the few notebooks that are already running the latest 7th generation Intel Core processor. And at Rs48,990, it is not very expensive either. It succeeds the Asus R558UR notebook which ran Intel’s 6th gen processor and sported a price tag of Rs46,598. What makes the new notebook interesting, apart from the interesting price tag, is that it is available in more eye popping colours, has better configuration newer specs and is lighter than its predecessor. Design: Ordinary looking, plastic body The R558UQ is a big screen notebook which like most other similar notebooks has a bigger footprint and requires a bigger bag to carry it. It looks slim and weighs 2.3kg, which makes carrying it around easy. It is available in four colour options — matte golden, glossy dark brown, red and dark blue. The all plastic exterior helps keep the weight in check but also gives it the look and feel of a budget laptop, especially the glossy brown variant. Despite the slim profile, the side panel carries all relevant connectivity options. The optical drive, VGA port, and LAN are still in vogue in many workplaces. The there is the HDMI port so you can hook it up with a bigger display or a projector. It also offers one USB 3.0 port and one USB 3.1 Type-C connector for faster data transfer. Keyboard: Small keys but well spaced The keys look flat and small but allow for quick typing after a while. They are also responsive and don’t require extra pressure to be applied on them. There is ample space between the keys which means you can type for long hours without worrying about tapping the neighbouring keys by mistake. The big letdown, in the keyboard, is that the keys are not backlit, which means you can’t use it in the dark with ease as laptops with backlit keyboard. The compact size of the keyboard leaves ample space for hand rest and touch pad. The touch pad is responsive but feels a bit small. Display: Big and non-reflective The laptop’s 15.6-inch LED display has a resolution of 1,920x1,080p. It has a matte finish on it which makes the display reflect less when the light source is directly behind the user’s head compared to laptops with glossy display.The display feels a bit dull due to the matte finish but you can liven up the display by bumping up the brightness a bit. The wide viewing angles are good which means you can use it for teamwork or watching movies with a friend or family member. Text looks crisp which makes reading and typing enjoyable. Performance: Smooth with most tasks Asus R558UQ is the first crop of Windows 10 notebooks running on Intel’s 7th Gen (Kaby Lake) Core i5-7200U Processor clocking at 2.5GHz and paired with 4GB RAM. It uses a dedicated Nvidia GeForce 940MX (2GB) graphics card which is a bit old but powerful enough to handle modern games. It was able to play some of the most demanding games like the Crysis 3 or the Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 at lower resolution and special effect settings without any stutter. The notebook offers 1TB HDD storage which means you have ample space for your movies, HD movies and games. Powered by a 2 cell Li-ion battery, the laptop lasted four to five hours on modest use and about an hour of non-stop gaming session, which is quite impressive. We also liked the audio output. Powered by Sonic Master speakers, we didn’t have to fall back on headphones even once while watching a movie or gaming. Verdict Asus R558UQ is powerful notebook capable of handling most day to day chores and some amount of gaming with ease. While build quality is not one of its strong areas, its performance, dependable battery backup and price tag makes it a solid proposition for professionals looking for an all-round notebook that can handle the personal chores comfortably. Its closest rival is the Dell Inspiron 5000 series 5567 notebook which looks slightly better. It is priced at Rs 56,190, runs Intel’s 7th Gen core i5 processor too, with 4GB RAM but with AMD Radeon R7 M445 graphics. It offers a 15.6-inch full HD display too and weighs as much as the Asus laptop.

In the same session, AMD showed its Zen x86 processor sports a 10 percent smaller die than Intel’s latest 14nm CPUs. The Stratix X uses Intel’s Embedded Multi-die Interconnect Bridge (EMIB) to link the FPGA with four external transceivers. The bridge is made using silicon die mounted in a BGA substrate which is significantly smaller than the silicon substrates used in the CoWoS process developed by TSMC and used by rival FPGA vendor Xilinx and GPU designer Nvidia. EMIB uses a combination of 55 micron micro-bumps and 100+ micron flip-chip bumps to support up to 24 transceiver channels with 96 I/Os each. They deliver 2 Gbits/second/pin at 1.2 pJ/bit/die using a proprietary protocol. EMIB uses fine-pitch vias and flip-chip interconnects rather than through-hole vias. (Images ISSCC) Currently, the bridge links four 28 GHz serdes to the FPGA. Intel has a road map to faster serdes and other kinds of external chips, said David Greenhill, an Intel engineer who presented the paper at ISSCC. The packaging technology drew several questions from a crowded session. Responding to a question from a Xilinx engineer, Greenhill said the Intel team doesn’t foresee any issues dealing with thermal challenges migrating the design to 56G serdes. Intel announced the technology more than two years ago as an offering in its foundry service. So far, it has not announced any other users of EMIB. The 14nm Stratix X packs 2.8 million logic elements into a 560mm2 fabric running at a gigahertz.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Feb 13, 2017 at 9:01PM These days, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) forces gamers and other personal computer enthusiasts to make a tough choice when picking out desktop processors. Intel offers PC gamers chips with four incredibly fast processor cores ("mainstream desktop"), and it also offers them chips with between six and 10 processor cores ("high-end desktop"), but each of these cores is much slower than the four-core chips. The six- to 10-core chips also cost much more than the four-core chips do, as well. Although Intel does not provide sales data by individual chip model, I have a strong suspicion that even gamers with very deep pockets often opt for the super-fast quad-core chip rather than go for one of the more expensive chips. Image source: Intel. After all, since most games can't really take advantage of more than four cores, why should a gamer pick a chip with a lot of slower cores when the one with fewer but faster cores for cheaper will enable a superior user experience? This is one of the reasons that Intel's high-end desktop product lineup (the expensive six- to 10-core chips with relatively slow cores) has usually been somewhat of a "niche" among gamers. Going forward, considering a recent announcement from the chipmaker, I believe that Intel's high-end desktop processors will become much more attractive by remedying the problem that I outlined above. Data center first could mean high-end desktop first Intel's previous product development methodology was "personal computer first, data center second." Since Intel's mainstream desktop chips are designed first and foremost as personal computer chips (the same basic designs are used in high performance notebook computers as well as desktop computers), they have historically gotten all the technical goodies first. Indeed, the mainstream desktop chips have generally had Intel's most advanced processor cores built using the company's most advanced chip manufacturing technology. The high-end desktop chips, which are based on the chips that the company designs and sells into the data center, tend to not represent Intel's best -- at least in ways that matter to consumers.  The data center parts have generally been a generation behind in both processor architecture and manufacturing technology relative to the mainstream desktop/notebook processors. Now that the situation is going to reverse going forward, the high-end desktop chips should have the best processor cores and be built using the best manufacturing technology. Once Intel's product development methodology change flows through to products in the marketplace, then I wouldn't be surprised to see enthusiasts and gamers gravitating more to the high-end desktop products, as they will represent Intel's best, while the mainstream desktop chips will represent older, less desirable technology. Potential impact on Intel's business If what I expect to eventually play out does in fact happen, it would probably manifest itself in Intel's financial results as a mix shift to higher-performance/higher-priced gaming products. To the extent that Intel can drive a richer mix of products, the company should see both revenue (same number of units sold, but the ones that do sell are higher priced, on average) and profit improvements (even at fixed gross profit margin, higher revenue means higher gross profit dollars). This transition isn't going to happen overnight, though. Remember that Intel said that its data center products won't take the manufacturing lead from its traditional client personal computer products until it rolls out its third-generation 10-nanometer manufacturing technology. Considering that, don't expect Intel's high-end desktop products to become the company's unequivocally best products in terms of core performance and manufacturing technology until, perhaps, the middle of 2019.

As employees create new documents, presentations, spreadsheets and more, the amount of stored content grows dramatically over time. This rapid data growth creates a challenging new problem for IT professionals: how to store all the data in the most cost-effective way, while ensuring end-users have immediate access to the information they need. Many organizations depend on expensive, onsite Network Attached Storage (NAS) systems to house their data. While legacy NAS systems generally meet end-user demand for fast and easy access to regularly used “active” data, approximately 80% of the data stored in expensive NAS solutions is inactive and rarely accessed by end users – if at all. Storing all that “cold” data in “hot” access mediums is both inefficient and extremely expensive. Adding up the cost of necessary data protection, hardware, software, floor space, electrical power, and staff to manage the storage process, each gigabyte of NAS storage costs an organization an estimated $0.75 per month. Over the course of a year, snowballing storage costs result in a very expensive line item at $9,000 per terabyte. Ideally, an enterprise IT professional could identify and move those cold files easily, placing them in much cheaper internal or external cloud storage costing as little as $0.01 per gigabyte. However, the task of moving the older files from one storage location to another – manually – is a daunting task. An IT professional must face a lot of questions: What is the best way to identify the files to be moved? How often are the files used? What if older files moved out of primary storage are needed? How can all that data be maintained securely regardless of its storage location? How can the process be automated? The Big Data challenge is a big one indeed. As a solution provider, Equus regularly encounters enterprise customers facing this type of challenge. To deliver a proof-of-concept solution, infinite io turned to Equus for access to cutting edge Intel technology which aided in new product development. In turn, infinite io was able to deliver advanced solutions with a lengthy five-year product life cycle. The infinite io team, based in Austin, Texas, have solved these problems by tapping the latest Intel technologies incorporated in the Intel® Server System S2600WT for their new Network-Based Storage Controllers. infinite io’s controller scans metadata to identify the most-used data and documents. Active data is flagged for “hot” onsite storage, providing the fastest access for end-users. The controllers also ease the process of identifying cold data which can be moved to much more cost effective storage, while continuing to make the data readily accessible. The NSC controllers maintain added data security though deep packet inspection, bump-on-a-wire capability, advanced encryption, and access control list (ACL) support. infinite io chose the Intel® Server System S2600WT after an extensive search for a server product that meets the extreme performance and reliability specifications of their controllers. Each Intel product undergoes a rigorous design and testing process to ensure each element is capable of meeting the high demands of enterprise organizations. On top of this, Intel backs its products with a three-year warranty that includes option to extend coverage to five years. Customers can also count on Intel’s 24/7 support and have confidence in their purchases knowing Intel will replace or refund any product that fails. Similarly, infinite io relies on Equus Onsite Warranty and Support programs in order to tap the benefits of the technical service provider network Equus has established, and expedite parts replacement if necessary. What’s Inside Counts The NSC-055s Network Based Metadata Accelerator represents the entry point into infinite io’s product line, working in tandem with an enterprise’s storage filers the NSC-055s creates a memory-based “metadata map” for file systems and mounts being supported. After the initial file systems scan, deep packet inspection monitors and responds to metadata operations off-loading attached storage systems from the operation. With “always hot” status, and the ability to deliver 1,500,000 metadata operations per second thanks to the performance and technology contained in the Intel server system, the NSC-055s is able to enhance the performance of NAS systems – even those which are flash memory-based. The reduced workload on the NAS can also extend the life of primary storage. For those seeking an integrated network controller, the NSC-110 controller offers the NSC-055s’s capabilities, and builds upon them. The built-in network storage controller handles the directing and re-directing of data to the appropriate NAS or Cloud storage location. Up to 80% of all storage request are for metadata The NSC maps all storage metadata in RAM, which accelerates the response and offloads the filers from these requests. For an end-user, the experience is seamless and transparent. Data is served very quickly regardless of the file’s actual storage location. By utilizing different Intel processor and memory configurations, the NSC platform addresses different customer performance and functional requirements. According to David Sommers, VP Operations, infinite io, the NSC-110s flagship – their highest performance controller, also powered by performance-packed Intel servers -- accounts for 90% of their sales. It offers the best combination of performance and versatility in demanding enterprise scenarios. Set it and forget it Regardless of the version implemented, each controller is managed through a simple web interface, allowing an IT administrator to monitor status anytime and anywhere. The NSC’s learning curve is minor. Sommers highlights the simplicity of the controller management and reporting interface, “It’s created to be very intuitive. Most IT administrators are quickly up and running with infiniview*.” Speaking in more detail about hardware installation, he continues, “each controller is designed as a plug-and-play transparent solution, requiring no new file systems or storage mount points.” Once installed, the controller empowers an administrator to analyze, migrate, and manage enterprise-scale data. By scanning all attached data volumes, the NSC’s software provides an IT professional detailed information about the data itself by evaluating metadata like file size, user type, and date last used. With these insights, IT professionals can create policies to define what data characteristics flag a file for movement from the NAS to an internal or external cloud location. infinite io’s solutions can be utilized in any of three modes. “Out-of-Band” mode helps an IT professional identify which files should be moved. “Passive” mode adds the capability to assess the impact to performance, by exposing the device to the inline data-flow. Finally, “Active” mode enables the automatic movement of files based on the IT professional’s defined policies. Continuing to evaluate cold data residing in less expensive cloud solutions, the controller’s analysis engine monitors file status and cost savings reaped through the data migration. Sommers notes, “It has been extremely rewarding to develop a product that literally makes the IT professional a hero. Instant reports created through the controller’s web interface show just how much an enterprise is saving every day.” Inside the Controllers The NSC’s capability requires some innovative and very specialized technology under the hood. Intel’s® Trusted Platform Module System running with Intel® Xeon® processor E5 family - alongside Intel® Network Adapters, Intel® RAID Modules and maintenance-free backup, Intel® 10GbE LAN, and more – offers the speed and throughput necessary to make the infinite io solution seamless for an enterprise customer. As a systems provider, Equus augments the value of infinite io controller solutions through enterprise-level customer consulting, on-site support, and warranty management. Regarding infinite io’s controllers, Sommers reflects, “This achievement would not have been possible without many advanced technologies contained in Intel Server Products, and the great customer engagement from Equus.” Conclusions IT professionals find themselves pressured like never before to reduce corporate costs, while simultaneously ensuring end-users have fast and easy access to the data they need. infinite io’s controller utilizes policy-based rules to identify hot (active) and cold (inactive) data and then migrates the cold data to the cloud, while making it appear to still be on the local filer. Up to 80% of data currently stored on filers is stored in cold. With the help of Intel server compute-intensive capabilities, infinite io’s Network-Based Storage Controller and Metadata Accelerator implementations can offer the performance, value, and reliability needed for business-critical storage management. Combining Intel’s technology with solutions implementation expertise and support from Equus, infinite io’s plug-and-play solutions help enterprises solve some of the biggest data challenges today.

A coalition of tech firms including Uber, Intel and internet of things (IoT) provider Aeris, formed to secure the connected cars of the future, Wednesday released a manifesto inviting automakers to join together and pool resources to redesign key vehicle information architecture components with cyber-security in mind. Future of Automotive Security Technology Research (FASTR) promised to deliver precompetitive technological building blocks such as whitepapers, reference architectures, code samples, workshop best-known methods and other resources that automotive manufacturers can use across their supply chains.   The firms also are looking to offer multilayered security throughout vehicles to preserve data confidentiality, system integrity and system availability. They will establish, train and audit a Security Design Lifecycle process that incorporates early design architecture considerations. A holistic perspective will: look across in-vehicle, connectivity and data centre; follow industry best practices across all network interfaces; utilise software over the air solutions; and embrace the diverse perspectives of the evolving automotive ecosystem. The coalition will include original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), transportation network companies, automotive supply chain providers, autonomous vehicle specialists, SoC providers and hardware and software suppliers, specialist automotive security companies, academics, researchers and hackers. Craig Hurst, executive director of FASTR and director of the industry alliances and marketing transportation solutions division at Intel, told SC Media, "FASTR membership is open to all companies across the automotive ecosystem, including rivals, with the belief that together through a holistic, systems-level approach we can move more quickly toward the organically secure vehicle of the future." “FASTR conducts its meeting under Chatham House Rules to allow for open dialogue with invited OEMs, tier ones and leading automotive software/hardware suppliers to foster the pre-competitive nature of the consortium.” Hurst went on to say that members are part of the three working groups within the technical steering committee (TSC) which include in-vehicle systems, cloud/connectivity and autonomous. Separately, other firms have been joining together for similar causes to share the responsibility of securing connected vehicles as car hacks and cyber-threats pose a significant threat to user safety. Earlier this year, researchers created an open-source connected car platform, Uptane, to help manage connected car system updates. Regulators are taking note as well. Last month, a bipartisan group of legislators recently proposed a bill that would call for industry professionals to study how to secure connected vehicles.

 2 trades that could benefit from Trump David Galland, Garret/Galland Research Feb. 14, 2017, 4:36 PM 808 facebook linkedin twitter email print President Donald Trump sits during a meeting with Chief Executive Officer of Intel Brian Krzanich in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, U.S., February 8, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts There are aspects to Trump’s public comments that concern me. He says stuff that makes me sit up and take notice, especially on the military front. Yet, rather than blindly accepting the “news” that best supports my biases, I try to view each new Trump “event” objectively. By contrast, the progressives/liberals unfailingly fall for every bit of click-bait that reinforces their view that Trump is a detestable, woman-hating, earth killer and the epitome of a capitalist pig. On the other side of the philosophical wall, there are an almost equal number of people who view Trump as a Knight Exemplar, come to smite the corrupt politicos and smash down the self-loathing, politically correct, climate-alarmist, and meddling-big-government, perfect-world socialists that have all but destroyed the American dream. The extreme distance between the two perspectives creates a tradeable opportunity. Actually, a series of tradeable opportunities, which I cover below. (For more trading ideas, subscribe to my free investment newsletter, The Passing Parade.) This is especially true because of the extraordinary media bias that takes every small thing Trump does or says and blows it way out of proportion. Any investor worth the moniker knows markets operate largely on emotion. And that gives rise to the Trump Trade. What Most People Are Missing… and How to Profit from It A more nuanced view of Trump’s various strong words has to take into account his deep experience negotiating hundred-million-dollar deals in the hardball world of New York and New Jersey real estate. We’re talking about sitting across the table from dozens of the world’s highest-paid lawyers and hammering out deals that mollify not just the sellers of the prime real estate, but also the zoning boards, unions, owners of neighboring properties, etc. Succeeding in that world requires a level of focus, determination, and skill that is impossible for the average person to even imagine. It is as hardball as it comes. Anywhere. Now ask yourself, how would someone with Trump’s negotiating credentials approach a counterparty ahead of a negotiation? Would they signal in advance what they wanted and all that they were willing to give up in order to get what they were after? Or would they come in hard with outsized threats and posturing, setting the stage to ultimately prevail on the points that count? Case in point, Trump has made much of the idea that he’ll make Mexico pay for a wall between the two countries. Among the many rejoinders to the idea, former Mexican President Fox said, “I’m not going to pay for that f#&#ing wall!” And so, thanks to Trump’s posturing, the negotiations began with arguing about who is going to pay for the wall—not even the wall itself. Getting the opposition to negotiate at the top of the range you set, in order to eventually settle for what you actually want, is Negotiation 101. And Trump is way, way past Negotiation 101. Viewed through that particular lens—and I think I am at least directionally correct, as Trump would be hard pressed to forget all he has learned about negotiating just because he’s been elected president—we can expect his administration to be something of a rollercoaster ride. That’s because he has a big agenda. And he has a lot of opposition to cut through in order to accomplish that agenda. As such, I suspect hardly a week will go by without Trump saying or doing something—loudly—that seems outrageous, ill-advised, or bullying. And the media, as set against Trump as they are, can predictably be expected to scream as loud as they can about his latest outrage and all the dire consequences. Viewed from the negotiator’s perspective, they are playing right into his hands. Likewise, we need to look past the posturing and try to ascertain what Trump’s end goals are. What does Trump want accomplished in each of these situations?  In most cases, he’ll be trying to deliver on his “America First” promise. That was by far the most prominent plank in his platform and in his inauguration speech. To get it done, he’ll need to improve the competitiveness of American business by cutting taxes, slashing regulations, and directly negotiating more equitable trade agreements with important trading partners. In Trump’s view, he is America’s negotiator-in-chief. It’s in his blood. It’s what he does best. Therefore, you can choose to get hung up on the optics, or you can take advantage of the situation by taking stock of whatever his next target may be and trading against all the easily frightened sheeple. To make the point, let’s return to the situation with Mexico. Trade Idea #1: Mexico The chart here shows the six-month performance of the Mexican Bolsa, their stock market. Garret/Galland Since the election, the Bolsa has traded like a yo-yo, based entirely on Trump’s pre-negotiation rhetoric and the biased media’s reaction to it. On this particular trade, which will likely be a buy of Mexican stocks, I’m going to watch things a bit more closely before taking a position. The real money will be made by waiting until it seems Mexico and the US are on the verge of a total breakdown in trade. In fact, what will really be happening is Trump wearing the Mexican politicians down to ensure he gets exactly what he wants. And make no mistake, the US will come out on top. That’s because over 81% of all Mexican exports—about $310 billion worth—go to the US. Mexico’s second-largest trading partner is Canada at a miserly $10.5 billion. There are a number of ways to play volatility in the Mexican market. You can concentrate your investments in specific Mexican exporting companies who trade as ADRs on US exchanges. But for most investors, the best approach is likely buying a large and liquid diversified ETF such as the iShares MSCI Mexico Capped ETF (EWW). Trade Idea #2: Pounding on Pharma Another recent example of the Trump Trade can be seen in the pharmaceutical sector. That Trump would take on the sector is understandable; his most ardent supporters skew toward the 50+ age demographics. These are the people most affected by the skyrocketing insurance costs triggered by Obamacare and by the indefensibly high cost of certain drugs required for the patient to live a normal life. A friend of mine is currently spending over $2,000 a month for a single drug, so I understand the angst on a personal level. During his campaign, Trump promised to bring those drug costs down, and now he is ramping up the negotiations to do just that. Here’s a three-month chart of the price action in PowerShares Dynamic Pharmaceuticals (PJP), one of the more popular pharmaceutical ETFs. Garret/Galland Like the Mexican stock market, you can see a sell-off after Trump won, and the subsequent gyrations as Trump began to use the bully pulpit of his presidency to set the stage for negotiating with the drug industry. The recent spike in the index came after Trump sat down with key industry executives and offered to trade them a big reduction in regulation if they play ball with him on the pricing. That’s what’s called a win-win in the business world. Trump gets what he’s after (or at least there’s a good chance he does), and the drug companies get relief from the time and money regulatory regime that is the bane of their business. When the Media Sells, We’ll Buy Given Trump’s background, you can expect the president to go in hard every single time. And the media will inadvertently help him by whipping certain members of the public—including the investment community—into a frenzy of action. When they sell, we’ll be looking to buy. And when they buy, we’ll be looking to sell. In the end, successful investment speculation—and make no mistake, this is speculation—requires volatility. If nothing else, Trump is volatile. Or is happy to seem that way if, in the end, it gets him what he wants.

Y’know, Moore’s law and all that. Now though, it’s going for “process - architecture - optimisation”, a three-year cycle that’ll mean smaller gains, but still plenty to get excited about for anyone upgrading. This year’s chips aren’t about to blow holes in benchmark leaderboards or crank out unbeatable overclocks - but you should still be excited that Razer’s sticking them in its Blade laptops. Because Kaby Lake uses a slightly updated manufacturing process, each chip can squeeze out a few extra megahertz without draining a whole lot more power. That means you’ll get slightly better performance, and won’t spend as long plugged into the mains between charges. The Blade is also getting faster DDR4 memory, and finally gets a 4K touchscreen display option - the first time a UHD panel has wormed its way inside the 14in laptop. READ NEXT: Review: Asus GL502VS with GeForce GTX 1070 That brings it on par with the smaller Blade Stealth, which has had a 4K touchscreen option since launch. It should be ideal for image and video editing, and means you’ll be able to get your game on at 4K resolutions without having to plug into an external monitor, although that might be asking a lot of the GeForce GTX 1060 graphics card. The 14in Blade is one of the skinniest gaming-grade notebooks around. The all-metal black chassis is basically an inverted MacBook Pro, complete with super-speed Thunderbolt connections and a nifty colour-changing keyboard. The updated Blade is on sale through Razer’s online store right now, with prices starting from $2799 here in Australia.

The national security columnist also quoted a senior intelligence official telling him that Trump “will die in jail.” “Now we go nuclear. [Intelligence community] war going to new levels. Just got an [email from] from senior [intelligence community] friend, it began: ‘He will die in jail,'” Schindler tweeted. The Observer columnist has for months taken a strong stance against Trump. He recently wrote an article called “The Spy Revolt Against Trump Begins.” (RELATED: Rep King: Leakers In Intel Community Have To Be ‘Purged’) This came after President Trump angrily tweeted about continued leaks to major media outlets. “Information is being illegally given to the failing [New York Times] & [Washington Post] by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?). Just like Russia,” Trump wrote. (RELATED: Journalists Go Nuts Over Rehashed New York Times Story) Schindler received heat for his tweet suggesting a coup by the intelligence community. ABC News chief foreign correspondent Terry Moran tweeted, “If this source is for real, talk of a ‘Deep State’ coup aren’t insane. [The president] will ‘die in jail’? Who do you think you are?” The former NSA analyst stood by his comment and said, “Surprisingly, some US spies consider [the president] colluding with [Russian intelligence services] + Kremlin, [including] election theft, to be kinda treason-y.” Tags: Donald Trump, John Schindler, leaks Hide Comments   Show comments Free News Alerts Privacy: We never share your email Sections Politics US Opinion Entertainment World Business Sports Tech Featured Partners Columns Ann Coulter Ask Matt Labash Matt Lewis The Mirror DC Trawler Ginni Thomas Corporate About Us Advertise With Us Employment Terms Of Use Privacy Policy Contact Us Follow Facebook Twitter Google+ © Copyright 2010 - 2017 | The Daily Caller

Nunes said the probe should focus not on Flynn's conversation with a Russian diplomat prior to the inauguration, but on the leak that exposed the discussion. But Rep. Adam SchiffAdam SchiffPresident rekindles feud with intelligence agencies Intel Dem: House GOP now open to investigating Flynn Overnight Defense: Dems raise pressure for Flynn probe | Trump blames leaks for ouster | Mattis pushes NATO on spending MORE (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the Intel panel, said he spoke with Nunes Wednesday afternoon, and that's no longer the chairman's position. "He assured me that we would investigate everything that the Senate is looking at, including the Flynn allegations," Schiff said, "and that he will not preclude any area that Democratic members thought was a subject of legitimate investigation. "So I was pleased with the discussion." Nunes's office said Wednesday night that "it is possible" the investigation would expand to include the Flynn episode. “[W]e’re not excluding the possibility of investigating anything related to Russian intelligence and counter-intelligence activities,” a spokesman said in an email. Schiff's comments suggest that House GOP leaders — after five days when the Flynn story has monopolized the news cycle, agonized the White House and put intense pressure on congressional Republicans — are ceding some ground in their defense of President Trump's former national security czar. Flynn was pushed out on Monday, just 24 days into his tenure, following revelations that he'd misled Vice President Pence and other top administration officials about the nature of a discussion he'd had with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Flynn told Pence the topic of U.S. sanctions on Russia had not been broached, a claim he walked back after The Washington Post reported Friday that the Justice Department had intercepted information proving it false. Both the Senate and House Intel committees had previously launched investigations into Russian hacking of Democratic campaign offices during the election, and Senate GOP leaders earlier in the week had indicated they were open to expanding that probe to include Flynn.  Sen. Roy BluntRoy BluntJudiciary Committee wants briefing, documents on Flynn resignation Intel Dem: House GOP now open to investigating Flynn Dems: 'Crazy' to trust GOP to investigate Flynn MORE (R-Mo.) said Tuesday that it's "likely" Flynn will be called to appear before the Senate panel. Schiff said the House may now follow suit. "I'm encouraged that we'll have the ability to investigate everything we need to," he said. Schiff said the process may take some time.  "There really isn't a timeline, but this won't be something we can get done overnight," he said. "Frankly, investigations of far less scope have taken years here. "I think there was a sense of urgency about this investigation," he added. "But we have a lot of work to do." - This story was updated at 7:18 p.m. Tags Adam Schiff, Roy Blunt   View the discussion thread.

This family is ideal for a wide range of applications within wireline access networks and cellular infrastructure, the defense and commercial aviation markets, and Industry 4.0 (the term "Industry 4.0" refers to the current trend of automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies, and it encompasses thinks like cyber-physical systems, the Internet of Things, and cloud computing). Microsemi has evolved substantially in recent times. Around 15 years ago, the company was predominantly selling discrete components into the aerospace and defense industries. Today, by comparison, approximately 60% of the company's revenues come from the communications and data center markets, while aerospace and defense account for only 26% of revenue. This should not, of course, be taken to imply that Microsemi's share of the aerospace and defense markets are falling; rather that the other market segments are growing. The leading factor contributing to this evolution was Microsemi's acquisition of FPGA vendor Actel in 2010. Most people at that time thought this was a strange move. As Mark LaPedus wrote in his Microsemi buys Actel for $430 million column: Observers were scratching their heads about the deal. It was a complete surprise. Analog and FPGAs are completely different markets. What many people didnt realize was how having FPGAs in its portfolio would allow Microsemi to sell sub-systems and complete systems based on its newly acquired FPGAs coupled with its discrete components. Even if all a developer does is to download a reference design, can you guess whose components are featured in that design? To this day, I still hear people who arent aware of the past saying "Microsemi FPGAs?" in tones of derision, without understanding that Actel had a rich history regarding the creation of highly reliable and robust FPGAs for use in the harshest environments, including a wealth of space-grade offerings. When it comes to off-the-shelf FPGAs (as opposed to embedded FPGA IP for use in SoCs), there are only four big players left standing: Intel (used to be Altera), Lattice Semiconductor, Microsemi, and Xilinx (there are also a few smaller players in the FPGA world, like Atmel and Achronix, but they account for only a fraction of the overall market). Intel and Xilinx are, of course, focused on the high-end of the market, targeting the highest performance and highest capacity FPGAs the universe has yet seen. Lattice, meanwhile, is happily dominating the lower-end of the market with its ultra-low-power devices that are ideal for consumer and prosumer products. This is not to say that Intel, Lattice, and Xilinx dont have a presence in the mid-range arena, just that this is not their focus, and when something is not your focus it can become a weakness. By comparison, in the case of its FPGAs, Microsemi has set its sights firmly on the mid-range market, hence the introduction of its PolarFire family. The "Polar" portion of the moniker comes from that fact that these devices consume relatively little power (and thus run cooler) than their competitors in this market segment. Meanwhile, the "Fire" part of the name is a metaphor for the relatively high capacity and performance they offer. (Source: Microsemi) As one example, in collaboration with Silicon Creations, Microsemi has developed a 12.7 Gbps transceiver optimized to be area efficient and low power, resulting in total power of less than 90 milliwatts (mW) at 10 Gbps. These transceivers, which are featured in PolarFire FPGAs, satisfy the performance requirements of a wide range of mid-bandwidth applications. The transceivers in higher-end FPGAs can be "turned down" to the 12.7 Gbps level, but the fact they are designed to support much higher bandwidths leaves them less efficient at this lower speed (I cant believe I'm referring to 12.7 Gbps as "lower speed," but that's the way things are these days). Of particular interest to me is the deployment of PolarFire FPGAs in IoT applications, in which security is (finally) recognized as being a key factor. High levels of computation are no longer relegated to the core of the network; instead, more-and-more computation and intelligence is being pushed out to the edge of the network. Similarly, hardware and software security has to be pushed out to the edge of the network. Leveraging Microsemis expertise in security, PolarFire FPGAs offer Cryptography Research Incorporated (CRI)'s patented differential power analysis (DPA) bitstream protection, integrated physically unclonable functions (PUFs), 56 KB of secure embedded non-volatile memory (eNVM), built-in tamper detectors and countermeasures, true random number generators, integrated Athena TeraFire EXP5200B Crypto Co-processors (Suite B capable), and a CRI DPA countermeasures pass-through license. Microsemis PolarFire FPGA product family is shipping to early access customers now; samples for general availability will be offered in the second quarter of 2017 (orders for samples can be placed immediately).

report this ad / Cory Doctorow / 10:08 am Wed Feb 15, 2017 Researchers show they can beat address space layout randomization with Javascript in a browser (!) From the Boing Boing Shop See all deals Popular Posts Follow Us Twitter / Facebook / RSS Address space layout randomization is an important first line of defense against malicious software: by randomizing where in memory instructions are stored, ASLR makes it much harder to overwrite memory with new code that will be jumped to as a program executes, offering significant protection against buffer overflow attacks. report this ad A group of researchers from Vrije Universiteit published a research paper today, in which they demonstrate a side-channel attack against the CPU's memory management unit that allows malicious code to bypass ASLR, using Javascript code running inside a sandboxed browser. The vulnerability is common to at least 22 identified processor architectures from ARM, Intel and AMD. The researchers don't believe there is a cost-effective countermeasure for their attack and say that we should give up on ASLR as a first line of defense immediately. AnC works by using what's known as an EVICT+TIME cache attack that detects which memory locations are accessed by a CPU's MMU. The researchers identified 22 microarchitectures from Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, and ARM that were vulnerable. They went on to say they have yet to test an architecture that didn't provide the MMU signal necessary to exploit the side channel. The vulnerabilities are indexed as CVE-2017-5925 as they apply to Intel processors, CVE-2017-5926 for AMD processors, CVE-2017-5927 for ARM processors, and CVE-2017-5928 for a timing issue affecting multiple browsers. The paper was written by Ben Gras, Keveh Razavi, Erik Bosman, Herbert Bos, and Cristiano Giuffrida of the VUsec systems security group at the University of Amsterdam. They have published this resource page with additional information about the technique. Given how crucial caching is to the performance of modern CPUs, the researchers say architectural fixes are likely to be too costly to be feasible. And even if hardware mitigations are possible—say, by creating a separate cache for page tables—the researchers warn that the vulnerability may resurface in software. They conclude their findings with a recommendation that's sure to get the attention of software developers everywhere: "We hence recommend ASLR to no longer be trusted as a first line of defense against memory error attacks and for future defenses not to rely on it as a pivotal building block."

Steve Symington, Anders Bylund, and Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSymington) Feb 15, 2017 at 10:41AM One of the most important aspects of any business is the strength of its brands. And in today's fast-changing world, it's increasingly difficult for companies to successfully build and maintain thriving brands that continue resonating with consumers. We asked three top Motley Fool contributors each to choose a big-brand stock that they believe investors would be wise to purchase this month. Read on to see why they picked Nike (NYSE:NKE), Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Nike's new Air Jordan I golf shoe. IMAGE SOURCE: NIKE Sprinting your way to investing success Demitri Kalogeropoulos (Nike): Nike, the Dow's worst performer last year, has underperformed the market by a wide margin since last February. Sure, the athletic-apparel titan is going through major challenges right now, including slowing growth and spiking competition in the U.S. Profitability has been trending lower, too, dropping by 1.4 percentage points last quarter, to 44% of sales. But the profit pain of the last few quarters has left Nike in a stronger inventory position that should help it speed up sales gains and earnings growth. It has a packed product portfolio with brands including Jordan, the Air VaporMax, which will likely push its expansion pace higher over the next six months, even as average prices rise. Meanwhile, investors don't have to fear the type of brutal demand slowdown that rocked rival Under Armour (NYSE:UA) (NYSE:UAA) recently, given that Nike is far less reliant on the weakening North American market. Western Europe and China, for example, just logged their 13th- and 10th-straight quarters, respectively, of double-digit revenue growth. The battle for market share in the U.S. could ding profits for both Nike and Under Armour in the short term. Yet Nike has strong advantages on its side, including a broader product line, entrenched sports partnerships, and a dominant marketing budget. These strengths all imply it can withstand any industry slump better than its peers. Meanwhile, investors have a chance to snap up one of the top branded-businesses in the world following a rare double-digit price decline in 2016. IMAGE SOURCE: Yum! Brands. Mouthwatering shareholder value creation Steve Symington (Yum! Brands): Shares of Yum! Brands are up around 13% since late October, when the parent company of Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and KFC completed its planned spinoff of Yum China. But considering the progress Yum! Brands demonstrated in its solid fourth-quarter report last week, I think now is a great time for investors to open, or add, to their positions in the fast-food juggernaut. Fourth-quarter revenue climbed a modest 2.4% year over year, to just over $2 billion, as a 2% decline in comps at Pizza Hut was more than offset by same-store sales growth of 3% at both Taco Bell and KFC -- and this despite what both Yum! and other fast-food specialists describe as exceedingly difficult industry conditions in the United States. Core operating profit simultaneously grew 27% for the quarter, and adjusted earnings per share rose 19%, to $0.79. Perhaps most important, Yum! Brands continued to move forward with its vision for growing its unit base, driving higher traffic, and maximizing profits over the long term. To that end, Yum! Brands refranchised 232 restaurants last quarter alone for proceeds of $200 million. That brought its franchise ownership mix to 93%, up from 77% last October, and a solid step toward its goal of being 98% franchised by the end of fiscal 2018. In addition to plans for optimizing its capital structure in the coming years, Yum! also aims to reduce annual capital expenditures by 80%, to $100 million, and lower general and administrative expenses by $300 million by the end of fiscal 2019. At the quarter's end, Yum! also had $1.9 billion remaining of the $2 billion repurchase plan its board authorized in mid-November. In the end, for investors who are willing to buy now and watch the company continue to realize its vision for maximizing shareholder value, I think Yum! Brands stock still represents a compelling portfolio candidate. An Intel-powered drone. IMAGE SOURCE: Intel. Intel: Modest valuation doesn't match the top-shelf business Anders Bylund (Intel): Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is a chronically undervalued market leader. The largest semiconductor maker is trading below 15 times trailing earnings and 17 times free cash flows right now. That's cheap compared to the average valuation of the S&P 500 (average P/E ratio: 24), or the Dow Industrials (P/E: 20). This valuation gap is only growing larger at the start of 2017. So far this year, Intel shares have trailed the S&P 500 by about 6 percentage points, the index moving up while Intel investors have taken a small haircut. All of this might be fair shakes if Intel had done something to deserve a quick haircut. But that's not what's happening here. The fourth-quarter report at the end of January was of the beat-and-raise variety. The presumably dying PC market showed new signs of life and accounted for 62% of Intel's operating profits. Meanwhile, the company is investing billions in its push into the Internet of Things, including the just-announced $7 billion restart of the dormant Fab 42 manufacturing facility in Arizona. Intel is a proven winner in several markets that aren't going away anytime soon, actively exploring promising growth opportunities, and doing it all with unmatched resources and technical sophistication. And right now, the stock is on sale. So what are you waiting for? Anders Bylund owns shares of Intel. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos owns shares of Nike and Under Armour (C Shares).

There are other specs I can (and will) tell you about this, but really, that’s the most important one: $8,898. Now, to be clear, this is a professional-grade piece of hardware that’s really only meant for companies running servers with big databases. Sure, it’s set a whole bunch of benchmarking records, but it’s not really the kind of chip you’d use to play Overwatch. I’m not even sure you could use this to play Overwatch. Anyway, specs. So, what does your $8,898 investment get you? A 24 core processor with 60MB of cache that runs at 2.4GHz, with a maximum clock speed of 3.4GHz. That makes it pretty similar to Intel’s previous E7-8890 v4 Xeon chip, which has a recommended price of $7,174 (a comparative bargin, I tell you!), but it only runs at a base speed of 2.2GHz. Whether the extra speed boost is worth the $1,716 dollars is entirely up to you. Intel also makes a few other less powerful and cheaper Xeon processors in the E7-8800 line, but the E7-8894 v4 is the best of the bunch. And really, doesn’t your hypothetical industrial-grade server which you will probably never own or interact with deserve the best?

Cellular IoT chip suppliers certainly hope so. In that optimistic spirit, Altair Semiconductor, now a Sony company, announced Wednesday (Feb. 15) a narrow-band CAT-M1 and NB1-based cellular IoT chip, dubbed ALT1250. Although Altair is late coming to the CAT-M1/NB1 market compared to rivals such as Sequans (Paris, France) and Intel, it’s set to leapfrog the others with the new ALT1250, boasted Eran Eshed, Altair’s co-founder and vice president of worldwide sales and marketing. The ALT1250 is more advanced “in terms of cost, ease of integration and service provisioning,” he said in a phone interview with EE Times. “We believe our chip is at least a generation ahead of any other CAT-1/NB1 chips on the market today.” Specifically, the ALT1250 is designed to make it easy for Altair customers “to transform the chip into a [cellular IoT] module,” he noted. Ninety percent of the components in a cellular IoT module -- such as RF, baseband, front-end components, power amplifiers, filters and switches -- are already in the ALT1250. Module vendors won’t need to tune the RF tuner, for example, Eshed added. The only chips that remain external to ALT1250 are “a small flash memory, a bunch of clocks and a few passive components,” he noted. Simon Stanley, principal consultant at Earlswood Marketing Limited, told EE Times, “Key requirements for the cellular-based IoT market to take off are good coverage, and low component costs and attractive connectivity charges.” Certainly, ALT1250’s lower component counts and lower power, and the integration of a GPS receiver, can help, said Stanley. But beyond Eshed’s claims, “I think the wider importance of the Altair announcement is the expected availability of different solutions,” he noted. Chips are coming from Sequans, Altair and Intel, who are all chasing this market, he added. “This gives IoT solution developers and operators the confidence to roll out services and expand the IoT market.” Just like WiFi Since early February, 2016 when Altair was acquired by Sony, the team has worked patiently to completely redefine cellular IoT chip solutions. “We took a whiteboard approach. We knew it would take time for operators to migrate from 2G to LTE networks” for machine-to-machine communication, he said. Altair established a priority to make it painless for service operators to embrace cellular IoT, by lowering cost, increasing security, and simplifying the module design. An easier-to-integrate CAT-1/NB1 solution allows operators to “treat it as though it’s WiFi,” he said. “Obviously, we are not there yet, but we are getting closer.” Why integrate GPS? Now that Altair is part of Sony’s semiconductor operation, it’s adding a new wrinkle to its CAT-1/NB1 chip: integration of a GPS receiver. The integrated GPS suddenly makes the cellular IoT chip more amenable to getting designed into a variety of IoT applications, Altair believes. Such applications range from tracking kids, pets and assets to smart meters and figuring out where any given device is, Eshed explained. “An endless number of applications benefit from the GPS integration.” Next page: FD-SOI on horizon?

Las Vegas Sun February 16, 2017 Currently: 53° — Complete forecast Las Vegas Sun The Sunday News Vegas INC Opinion Sports Politics Entertainment Las Vegas Weekly Events 0 Washington reels amid the turmoil of Trump’s first month Doug Mills / The New York Times President Donald Trump while meeting with Brian Krzanich, chief executive of Intel, in the Oval Office of the White House, in Washington, Feb. 8 2017. By Michael D. Shear, New York Times News Service Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2017 | 2 a.m. WASHINGTON — The resignation of Michael Flynn as national security adviser caps a remarkably tumultuous first month for President Donald Trump’s White House that has burdened the early days of his presidency with scandal, legal challenges, personnel drama and questions about his temperament during interactions with world leaders. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, lasted only 24 days before his tenure was cut short by an admission that he had misled the vice president and other White House colleagues about the contents of a phone call with the Russian ambassador to the United States. The resignation on Monday night and the continuing turmoil inside the National Security Council have deeply rattled the Washington establishment. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., railed against the administration on Tuesday, denouncing the “dysfunction” of the country’s national security apparatus and accusing the White House of being a place where “nobody knows who’s in charge and nobody knows who’s setting policy.” Gen. Tony Thomas, head of the military’s Special Operations Command, expressed concern about upheaval inside the White House. “Our government continues to be in unbelievable turmoil. I hope they sort it out soon because we’re a nation at war,” he said at a military conference Tuesday. Asked about his comments later, Thomas said in a brief interview, “As a commander, I’m concerned our government be as stable as possible.” But Flynn’s late-night departure just added to the broader sense of chaos at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. In record time, the 45th president has set off global outrage with a ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries, fired his acting attorney general for refusing to defend the ban and watched as federal courts swiftly moved to block the policy, calling it an unconstitutional use of executive power. The president angrily provoked the cancellation of a summit meeting with the Mexican president, hung up on Australia’s prime minister, authorized a commando raid that resulted in the death of a Navy SEAL member, repeatedly lied about the existence of millions of fraudulent votes cast in the 2016 election and engaged in Twitter wars with senators, a sports team owner, a Hollywood actor and a major department store chain. His words and actions have generated almost daily protests around the country. “I’ve never been so nervous in my lifetime about what may or may not happen in Washington,” said Leon Panetta, a Democrat who served as chief of staff, secretary of defense and CIA director during a 50-year career that spanned nine presidents from both parties. “I don’t know whether this White House is capable of responding in a thoughtful or careful way should a crisis erupt,” Panetta said in an interview Tuesday. “You can do hit-and-miss stuff over a period of time. But at some point, I don’t give a damn what your particular sense of change is all about, you cannot afford to have change become chaos.” Trump’s allies note that the president has moved forward in areas that are more typical of the early days of a first-term administration. Trump nominated a Supreme Court justice 12 days into his tenure and has issued a dozen executive orders, including ones to limit the influence of lobbyists, reduce regulations, pare the Affordable Care Act, move forward on pipeline construction, end trade deals and speed up deportations. Those accomplishments are catnip for the president’s most fervent supporters across the country, said Sarah Fagen, who served as a senior aide and political director for former President George W. Bush. The perspective on the White House is very different far outside the interstate freeway that rings Washington, she said. “If you’re someone inside the Beltway, you think it’s been really rocky,” she said. “If you are outside the Beltway, you think, ‘That’s why we sent him there.’ There has been a lot of chaos and a lot of growing pains, but they have gotten a lot done.” Still, half of the president’s Cabinet has yet to be confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate, and several other key White House aides have become lightning rods for daily mockery by late-night comedians. It all has official Washington reeling and exhausted as it tries to make sense of — and keep up with — the nearly constant tornado of activity swirling around the president and his advisers. “If you had no-drama Obama, you’ve got all-drama, all-the-time Trump,” said John Feehery, a veteran Republican strategist, who compared the past several weeks to the chaotic start to Newt Gingrich’s tenure as speaker of the House in 1995. “Newt never settled down. It was always one crisis after another,” Feehery recalled. “This might be the new normal. People will start getting used to the new normal but will also be exhausted by it.” As a candidate, Trump promised to move quickly to stop illegal immigration, bring jobs back, end trade deals and reduce crime. Central to his campaign agenda was his pledge to be a disruptive force in Washington — and he has certainly done that. Since winning the election, Trump and his closest aides have embraced the turmoil, viewing it as evidence of their aggressive efforts to fundamentally reorient the government. The West Wing also uses the chaos as a tactical weapon, believing that the flurry of early-morning presidential tweets, controversial statements during the afternoon briefing and surprise executive actions work to keep their adversaries, the media and others off balance. On Tuesday, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, happily kept reporters waiting while he did “a quick recap of the president’s activity,” proceeding to offer a long list of meetings and phone calls with foreign leaders, female entrepreneurs, local officials and educators. Yet the disruptions have come at a cost: the president has so far made little progress on legislation that would repeal President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. The White House has not proposed a promised infrastructure bill to repair deteriorating roads, bridges and tunnels. And the president’s aides have not yet drawn up plans for an overhaul of the nation’s tax code. “It’s pretty predictable,” Feehery said. “This guy has never been in government before and he promised to be disruptive.” It may also have consequences for Trump’s ability to help Republicans win in the 2018 midterm elections. And Republican campaign experts acknowledge that his chances for winning re-election may hinge on his ability to contain the White House frenzy. “You are processing so much information in a day now. This stuff would have doomed anyone else, just one or two of them,” said Thomas M. Davis, a former Republican member of Congress from Virginia. “They have got to produce something. If all you’ve got is a bunch of executive orders and a Twitter feed, you don’t want to go into an election like that.” Kevin Madden, who served as a senior adviser to Mitt Romney during both of his presidential campaigns, said Trump’s voters in 2016 wanted him to overhaul an establishment in Washington, which they view as long on promises, long on process but short on action. “Voters certainly asked for change. They certainly wanted to see disruption,” Madden said. “But if change begins to look like confusion and disruption morphs into disorder, you risk losing a certain level of confidence with voters.” 0 Join the Discussion: Check this out for a full explanation of our conversion to the LiveFyre commenting system and instructions on how to sign up for an account.

 $1 TRILLION WEALTH MANAGER: Invest in America now Tom Naratil, UBS Feb. 12, 2017, 8:41 AM 15,473 facebook linkedin twitter email print U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Chief Executive Officer of Intel Brian Krzanich in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, U.S., February 8, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts Before taking office last month, President Trump said that his administration will follow the rule of “buy American and hire American.” To make success more likely, we must add “invest American.” While anticipated reforms to spur growth can be complex and take time, today we have an immediate opportunity to grow the economy, driven by rising optimism and a willingness among investors and small businesses to put their cash to work. Let’s build on those sentiments and provide reasons to invest in America through incentives, by removing structural impediments, and by focusing on areas that have both the most need and the most interest from investors. In the United States, UBS manages more than $1 trillion of our clients' assets. We speak to investors daily and frequently gauge their feelings about the U.S. economy and prospects for growth. According to our most recent Investor Watch survey of high net worth and ultra-high net worth individuals*, their optimism about the U.S. economy has increased dramatically since the presidential election. A majority of these investors are actively looking for opportunities in the market, with 42% looking to add to their equity portfolios. Meanwhile, our survey of business owners revealed that they are twice as likely to increase investment and hiring in their businesses than to scale back. When you consider these sentiments, along with widely held expectations globally for continued U.S. economic outperformance, the signs of demand for growth are encouraging. Tom Naratil, President Wealth Management Americas and President Americas, UBS REUTERS/Christian Hartmann Let’s be clear that both investors and business owners we spoke with still have a number of concerns. Individual investors continue to express apprehension over the political environment in Washington. Small business owners are chiefly worried about employee healthcare costs, taxes, and regulations. Yet despite those issues, and after an extended period of uncertainty, both groups overwhelmingly indicate that they are ready to get off the sidelines and begin making the kind of decisions that will positively impact the economy. Business and political leaders should be doing everything we can to listen and respond. The challenge, in this polarized political climate, is deciding how to make the most of this momentum. Today, there is a great deal of effort and political capital being spent on pushing more complex policy changes that will take time, such as overhauling the politically-sensitive Affordable Care Act or wholesale tax code reform. Instead, why not pursue "quick wins” on issues where there is more likely to be common ground across the political spectrum? Doing so will make a strong case for investing in the U.S. economy right now, while also building the institutional, bipartisan muscle memory that is necessary to address the long pole items like improving ACA. Investors and business owners suggest two specific areas where policymakers can break the persistent legislative gridlock and make meaningful progress. Residents inspect a washed-out section of collapsed road after Hurricane Matthew hit the state, in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Reuters/Jonathan Drake The first is the continued enthusiasm for infrastructure investment. The American Society of Civil Engineers sees a $1.4 trillion funding gap by 2025 to improve key infrastructure, with mass transit facing the largest shortfall. Encouragingly, there is bipartisan consensus that infrastructure investment—particularly when leveraging private capital—is one of the single best ways to put people to work and to grow the economy. The federal government has a powerful opportunity to shape incremental tax policy that creates incentives for investors to take on more risk from these projects, encouraging private capital to amplify the effect of its own spending. The second area is scientific and medical research. Despite the skyrocketing cost of healthcare, the U.S. share of global medical research funding has declined by nearly 25% since 2004, according to the American Medical Association. Investors see this as an opportunity with economic upside and clear societal benefits through research that unlocks new cures and treatments for diseases and chronic ailments. Here again, tax policy can help drive investment in early-stage commercial research projects that would help satisfy investor appetites while addressing a vital need. These are just two areas where investors tell us that they see opportunity, and which also provide a boost to the economy and more broadly felt benefits. In the coming months, we will surely see a number of bruising legislative battles waged. But if lawmakers can prioritize policies that can be passed in short order, the wider economy will feel the effects much sooner and with the potential for greater long-term growth. Investors are eager to deploy their capital, and the federal government should recognize its role in making that possible. America will be stronger as a result. Tom Naratil is President Wealth Management Americas and President Americas, UBS. UBS Wealth Management Americas had $1.1 trillion in client assets at the end of the fourth quarter.  *  Survey conducted December 20 - 27, 2016, among 2,025 high net worth investors and an oversample of 282 business owners who have at least one employee besides themselves.

This time, we are looking at the official box art of the Ryzen processors which will have several variants at launch. Official AMD Ryzen Processor Box Art Leaks Out – Several Models Listed Online Along With Prices The AMD Ryzen processor models were covered by us earlier this month. We reported that a total of 17 new models based on the Zen architecture would be making their way to the AM4 platform. The lineup would be featuring various SKUs based on 8 core, 6 core and 4 core dies. All models will feature unlocked multipliers and prices that will make AMD very competitive against Intel CPUs (HEDT and mainstream). The lineup was listed on a Thailand based retail outlet along with pre-order pricing. We can tell you that the final prices of Ryzen chips will be lower than that. Prices for the AM4 motherboards were recently covered by us so those of you planning to hop on the new AM4 platform should definitely check out this article. The prices for Ryzen processors are listed in Thai Baht Currency. A Ryzen 7 1800X for 18,790 Baht would be $537 US (Pre-Order). The box art can be seen to be very simple with a full black color theme. The Ryzen logo can be seen on the front along with the AMD logos. The side of the box lists down key features of the processor while the top will feature naming and specifications of the model itself. Based on the size of the box, we can expect a stock HSF (Heat Sink Fan) within the package. AMD Ryzen Processors Listing: AMD Ryzen 7 Series CPUs – Flagship AMD 7 1800X With 8 Cores, 16 Threads, 4 GHz Boost Clocks The AMD Ryzen 7 lineup will feature the fastest “X” variant in the lineup. This processor will be known as the AMD 7 1800X processor and will feature 8 cores and 16 threads. This model is expected to operate at base clocks of 3.6 GHz and boost clocks of 4.0 GHz. The performance of this processor should be on par with Intel’s Core i7 6900K. Other details include an L2 + L3 cache of 20 MB (4 MB + 16 MB) and a TDP of 95W. The chip will have enthusiast level pricing so expect something around $499. The rest of the processors in the Ryzen 7 family are also 8 core and 16 threaded variants. The Ryzen 7 series has clock speeds ranging from 3.0 GHz up to 3.6 GHz. The processors include Ryzen 7 PRO 1800, Ryzen 7 1700X, Ryzen 7 1700 and Ryzen 7 PRO 1700.

AMD will be offering these coolers in three specific models. They include a Wraith based model which is designed to handle thermal loads over 95W so the XFR (Extended Frequency Range) feature can take full benefit of higher clock speeds. The other models include a 95W and a 65W model which are designed for the rest of the lineup. Prices on the coolers have not been confirmed but at least two variants, the 95W and 65W, will be bundled with a range of processors. The Wraith cooler will possibly be sold separately or there will be a bundle package that comes with a “X” series processor along with the cooler itself. A recent picture uploaded by AMD’s Raja Koduri shows that the new coolers could feature LED lightning which is something cool to have on stock bundled HSFs. AMD X370 Platform Specs: As for the platform itself, AM4 X370 will be top of the line. Aside from the budget friendly B350 and A320 chips, the X370 PCH will offer increased PCIe lanes and increased storage / connectivity features. AMD has planned a total of 16 new AM4 motherboards which will be available at launch through their partners. The boards are detailed in our post here. AMD Ryzen AM4 Motherboard Chipsets: Wccftech X370 B350 A320 X300 PCIe 3 Lanes 24 24 TBA TBA CrossfireX/SLI Tri-Fire/2-Way SLI TBC N/A N/A PCIe 2 Lanes 8 6 TBA TBA USB 3.1 Gen2 2 2 TBA TBA USB 3.1 Gen1 8 4 TBA TBA USB 2 6 6 TBA TBA SATA 6Gb/s 8 6 TBA 8 DDR4 DIMMs 4 4 TBA 2 Overclocking Support Yes Yes No Yes NVMe Yes Yes TBA TBA Form Factor ATX ATX, M-ATX M-ATX, Mini-ITX Mini-ITX Estimated Price Range ~$129+ ~$99-$59 <$59 ~$129+ So there you have it, the first pictures of Ryzen processor box packages. We can expect more leaks on AMD’s Ryzen processors and AM4 platform in the coming days as launch comes closer. AMD is expected to unleash their next generation processor family at GDC 2017 which begins on 28th February, 2017. The actual day for launch will be 2nd March which aligns with what AMD has revealed themselves.

Home Archives Ed Morrissey Show Newsletters   Chaffetz: No need for Oversight to investigate Flynn now — but …. posted at 12:01 pm on February 14, 2017 by Ed Morrissey Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES … that doesn’t mean that Congress has closed the case of Michael Flynn, either. House Oversight chair Jason Chaffetz responded to calls from Democrats on his committee to conduct a full investigation of now-former national security adviser Michael Flynn and his contacts with Russia. Chaffetz told reporters this morning that Flynn’s resignation means that the matter is no longer in his jurisdiction — but predicted that the House Intelligence Committee will pick up the matter instead: House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) said Tuesday that his panel won’t investigate the circumstances that led to Michael Flynn stepping down Monday as President Trump’s national security adviser. … Chaffetz said that sensitive intelligence methods falls to the House Intelligence Committee, rather than his House Oversight Committee. “It really is the purview of the Intel Committee. They really are the only ones that can look at that type of information, particularly when you’re talking about interactions with a nation state like that. It’s not something the Oversight Committee can actually look at because sources and methods are the exclusive purview of the Intel Committee,” Chaffetz said. However, Intelligence chair Devin Nuñes (R-CA) told CNN that the matter may fall within the realm of executive privilege, and he has no plans to launch a probe yet — of Flynn, anyway. Instead, Nuñes wants to investigate the leaks that made the issue public [see update below]: Rep. Devin Nunes says the Intelligence Committee won't look into discussions between Trump and Flynn, citing executive privilege — Manu Raju (@mkraju) February 14, 2017 House Intel Chair @DevinNunes says Cmte will look into IC leaks of Flynn/Russia call. — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 14, 2017 Conversations between Trump and Flynn would fall under executive privilege, but what about between Flynn and the Russian envoy? That wouldn’t fall under executive privilege, as ranking Intelligence committee member Adam Schiff (D-CA) argued: Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) told House Democrats Tuesday that the recent revelations about former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn’s conversations with the Russians are only the beginning, and more information will surface in the coming days, according to multiple sources in a closed party meeting. Schiff (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, also said that any conversations that Flynn had with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak before Donald Trump took office would not be covered by executive privilege, potentially making some information subject to congressional investigations. Republicans have so far balked at probing this matter. That may not be covered under executive privilege even if it took place after Trump’s inauguration. However, the more basic question was whether it violated the law. The Logan Act forbids private citizens and public officials from conducting foreign policy without authorization from the president, a law that has been on the books for more than two hundred years and has been used for prosecution exactly zero times. As I argued last week, there is certainly an ethical question about having an incoming administration undermine the foreign policy of the existing one, but the punishment for that should be a high-profile firing and political shaming, which has now been fulfilled. Unless Democrats find evidence of actual espionage — and that seems highly unlikely — the best they can do is to keep using this to beat up the Trump administration. At this point, it’s tough to argue that the White House hasn’t earned this public beating, either, but that doesn’t mean that Republicans will be anxious to hand them more bats. Paul Ryan suggested earlier today that the Trump administration will offer up a more complete explanation of the events of the last few weeks soon. That seems a bit optimistic; right now they seem to have gone into tight-messaging mode and are looking for subject-changers. Ryan also gave his support to Trump for having asked for Flynn’s resignation, which is slightly different than the “Flynn resigned on his own” explanation from last night and early this morning. If nothing else, the White House should cheer that take, as it makes Trump look a little more decisive in dealing with the chaos of the last few days. "I think the administration will explain the circumstances that led to this," Speaker Ryan on Flynn's resignation https://t.co/pR7UNjb2BV pic.twitter.com/5VeYMkPhYx — CBS News (@CBSNews) February 14, 2017 .@SpeakerRyan: "I think the president was right to ask for [Michael Flynn's] resignation" https://t.co/W9NDINUSxy pic.twitter.com/06umKECnPb — POLITICO (@politico) February 14, 2017 Update: Eli Lake makes a very good case for Nuñes’ investigative focus: Normally intercepts of U.S. officials and citizens are some of the most tightly held government secrets. This is for good reason. Selectively disclosing details of private conversations monitored by the FBI or NSA gives the permanent state the power to destroy reputations from the cloak of anonymity. This is what police states do. In the past it was considered scandalous for senior U.S. officials to even request the identities of U.S. officials incidentally monitored by the government (normally they are redacted from intelligence reports). John Bolton’s nomination to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations was derailed in 2006 after the NSA confirmed he had made 10 such requests when he was Undersecretary of State for Arms Control in George W. Bush’s first term. The fact that the intercepts of Flynn’s conversations with Kislyak appear to have been widely distributed inside the government is a red flag. Representative Devin Nunes, the Republican chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, told me Monday that he saw the leaks about Flynn’s conversations with Kislyak as part of a pattern. “There does appear to be a well orchestrated effort to attack Flynn and others in the administration,” he said. “From the leaking of phone calls between the president and foreign leaders to what appears to be high-level FISA Court information, to the leaking of American citizens being denied security clearances, it looks like a pattern.” … In the end, it was Trump’s decision to cut Flynn loose. In doing this he caved in to his political and bureaucratic opposition. Nunes told me Monday night that this will not end well. “First it’s Flynn, next it will be Kellyanne Conway, then it will be Steve Bannon, then it will be Reince Priebus,” he said. Put another way, Flynn is only the appetizer. Trump is the entree. Be sure to read it all.

The advice given was "Use Internet Explorer and make sure to clear all cookies and cache". There are multiple issues here. The first is coding to a single browser platform, and all too often that is still Internet Explorer. According to www.w3counter.com, the current usage stats for browsers is Chrome at the top (with 58.4%), followed by Safari (13.3%), Firefox (9.5%), IE and Edge (8.1%), and Opera (4.4%). Another problem is with the advice to clear all cookies. This is like using an atomic bomb to get rid of a mosquito. If you have years of cookies working for you, then one bad one shouldn't be taken care of by getting rid of the lot. I advised the help-desk staff member to review their suggestions, especially since this was the first time I had used IE to access that site, so there would be a fresh cookie. Western Digital, the hard-drive manufacturer, is starting to make 512GB, 64-layer 3D NAND chips in Japan. The new chips use a 3-bit-per-cell design to pack in the extra density. It will take around six months before we see the new chips on the market. Another manufacturer, Micro, is also working on a 64-layer 3D NAND chip, but 256GB on a tiny 59mm² surface area. Samsung had claimed they would get their version out before the others, but I suspect the Note 7 woes delayed that move. What this means to us is more memory, hopefully at a lower price, in microSD, thumb drives and in other devices like smartphones. There has been much said about new US President Donald Trump in the past weeks but keeping it in the IT sphere, at the time of writing he has yet to sign the cybersecurity executive order. This will add accountability to department heads for any computer security failures and ensure implementation of the NIST-developed cybersecurity defence framework. This executive order at least should be something everyone from both sides of the fence would support. The aim would be to then extend responsibility for security down the system to network admins and programme managers. The Australian government is having problems with the concept of anonymous data. The result is a de-anonymisation bill before Parliament that will ban any research into the field. Admittedly, this comes about after some clever researchers worked out that it was quite easy to trace health data back to its individual owners, but that is the fault of those anonymising it. The wording means that any legitimate researcher must now apply to be able to carry out any research of public data, which seems a little backward. It also puts no onus on those anonymising data to be better at their jobs. As one analyst put it, it's like not allowing people to look at other bridges to figure out why one collapsed. It turns out -- and you will probably laugh at this -- that the Atom series of Intel processors has a flaw. Not laughing yet? Intel has known about it for around 18 months. The result of the flaw is a bricked system, highlighted by the high rate of return that started about 18 months back. It was only two months back that Intel reported it was a flaw in the chip blueprints. Cisco, for example, noted their units failing about 18 months ago, and finally started blaming it on the CPUs. Intel refused to acknowledge there was any link. Lots of other companies were affected, but Intel has some very strong non-disclosure agreements in place. Thanks to the delay in admitting they had an issue, companies with issues are now working on fixing what they can on their side, including any poor press they had on their products not performing correctly. So what is a chipset and why should you care? A chipset is the communications hub and data-traffic manager on your motherboard. It determines what kind of memory you can use, what bits and pieces can be connected to your motherboard, and if for example you can engage in overclocking. Overclocking is tuning the speed of your CPU, usually faster than its normally rated speed. These things help to decide what kind of motherboard you are going to buy or have in your next computer. Back in the beginning, the chips were separate integrated circuits that talked to each other over the data bus. There were chips that responded to the keyboard, generated graphics and sound, and talked to the mouse. Over time these discrete chips were integrated into two chips called northbridge and southbridge. In more recent times these were all integrated into a single unit so the chipset became just one chip, still called the chipset. The system is still a couple of chips, but one of them is quite small and handles fewer functions than the main one. The purpose is to decrease latency so that things happen faster.

Sen. Roy Blunt indicated Flynn will “likely” be called to testify before the committee, according to Chad Pergram of Fox News. Flynn admitted to “inadvertently” briefing Vice President Mike Pence and others with “incomplete information” regarding his phone calls with the Russian ambassador in his resignation letter Monday. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer confirmed Tuesday that President Donald Trump’s trust in Flynn had been “eroded” and that he asked for the former general’s resignation. Flynn is suspected of discussing U.S. sanctions on Russia with Russian Amb. Sergey Kislyak before Trump’s inauguration. Such conversations could be illegal under what is known as the Logan Act, which forbids private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments on “disputes or controversies” without proper U.S authority. “There are potential criminal violations here,” said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer Tuesday. “There are potential criminal violations here,” Sen. Chuck Schumer says of Michael Flynn: https://t.co/Okz2bwUl4f pic.twitter.com/QaMCqUy1UP — CBS News (@CBSNews) February 14, 2017 Flynn’s ties to Russia have been an ongoing question since Trump first announced him as his pick for the national security adviser post. The former general is known to have a friendly stance toward Russia, especially compared to other administration officials like Secretary of Defense James Mattis. Flynn traveled to Russia in 2015 to give a paid talk before a gala in honor of Russia Today (RT), a Kremlin-funded television network. The transcripts of the phone calls between Flynn and Kislyak have yet to be released to the public. Follow Russ Read on Twitter Send tips to [email protected] .

When the CEO of Intel appeared at the White House to announce a revived effort to build a factory in Chandler, he talked about the need for more favorable tax policies under the Trump administration. The company also stands to get a big tax break at the state level under a legislation introduced in Arizona that was designed for big manufacturing corporations like Intel. Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File AP Photo Arizona state Rep. Jeff Weninger, R-Chandler, laughs after rushing to his desk to vote on a bill at the Capitol in Phoenix on Tuesday, Feb. 14, 2017. Weninger is proposing a new way for big manufacturing companies like chip-maker Intel to use millions of dollars of tax credits they have on the books but are unable to use. Bob Christie AP Photo 1 of 2 i By BOB CHRISTIE Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story PHOENIX When Intel's CEO appeared at the White House last week to announce a revived effort to build a new factory in Chandler, he talked about the need for more favorable tax policies under the Trump administration. The company also stands to get a big tax break at the state level under legislation introduced in Arizona designed to help big manufacturers like Intel. Manufacturers are sitting on tens of millions of dollars in state income tax credits they can't use because previous cuts in Arizona corporate income taxes favoring them leave them owing no tax here. The legislation by Rep. Jeff Weninger, R-Chandler, would allow them to use those credits in other ways by getting cash refunds or money to offset sales-tax expenses when they invest in new facilities. Manufacturers would they only get half their credits back, the program is capped $10 million per year, and companies must agree to remain in Arizona for five years. The proposal in House Bill 2492 is set for a committee hearing Wednesday. It also contains three other major incentives for big manufacturers like Intel, Raytheon, Honeywell and Boeing. Weninger said the effort is needed to boost the state's competitiveness. He noted increased competition from other states and nations and the need to work to attract and retain high-paying manufacturing jobs. "We have to do whatever we can to remain very, very competitive with those other people," Weninger said in an interview Friday. The proposal was introduced just days before Intel CEO Brian Krzanich announced during a meeting with President Donald Trump last week that the company would invest $7 billion to complete a computer chip plant in Chandler. The plant has been vacant since it was built several years ago. The announcement echoed one Intel made in 2011 with former President Barack Obama that never came to fruition. The plant is expected to be completed in three to four years and directly employ about 3,000 new workers. The CEO indicated that the company was counting on a tax break under the new administration. "It's really in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward that really make it advantageous to be manufacturing in the U.S," he said. Weninger said his proposal isn't linked to Intel's announcement and had been in the works for months during talks with big manufacturing companies, including Raytheon, Boeing, Intel and Honeywell. "This is something that's been going on for a long time, these companies all working together, all trying to figure out something where we can make Arizona more and more competitive," he said. But others believe Intel surely will be a major and early beneficiary. "I don't think there's any doubt about that," said Kevin McCarthy, president of the Arizona Tax Research Association. "They've got all the national news surrounding their expansion. There's probably some link there." Three other incentives that would help Intel are wrapped into Weninger's proposal. One is a new jobs=creation program giving big companies about $3 million a year in tax rebates. The second creates a new sales tax exemption for supplies needed in manufacturing clean rooms, while a third lowers property taxes on new equipment already taxed at an ultra-low rate in special trade zones like the one Intel occupies in Chandler. That and other provisions of the proposal trouble McCarthy, whose association generally opposes tax policies that single out classes of taxpayers because others have to pick up the tab. "We have concerns about the breadth of this," he said. "We definitely have concerns about the expansion of accelerated depreciation to Class 6 property. That much I know for sure, because (trade-zone) property applies to well more than the manufacturers who I know are advocating this."

Organizations are spending more of their budgets to support growing business initiatives. Gartner recently said that this would be a defining year for cloud as private cloud begins to give way to hybrid cloud, and nearly half of large enterprises will have hybrid cloud deployments by the end of 2017. In fact, Gartner describes cloud computing as a style of computing in which scalable and elastic IT-enabled capabilities are delivered “as a service” using internet technologies. It heralds an evolution of business in positive and negative ways. It has also become a hot industry term that has been used in many contradictory ways. Converged infrastructure is helping business look at the modern data center from a different perspective. We’re now creating better systems capable of multi-tenancy and better resource controls. According to Gartner, organizations typically have multiple goals for big data initiatives, including improving the customer experience, streamlining processes, lowering costs and marketing more effectively. The research firm’s survey showed that organizations are overwhelmingly targeting enhanced customer experience as the primary goal of big data projects (64 percent). Forty seven percent have their eyes on process efficiency and more targeted marketing. And a significant number are paying attention to enhancing security capabilities – 23 percent. “As big data becomes the new normal, information and analytics leaders are shifting focus from hype to finding value,” said Lisa Kart, research director at Gartner. “While the perennial challenge of understanding value remains, the practical challenges of skills, governance, funding and return on investment (ROI) come to the fore.” When we examined the results of a recent Data Center Industry Trends survey sponsored by Dell EMC and Intel, we learned that 50% of respondents leverage SaaS-delivered and cloud-based applications. A further 40% are aiming to support new, cloud-ready, applications and workloads. Here’s the interesting part – when asked how prepared they were for these new cloud initiatives, nearly 30% said that they are either not very prepared or not prepared at all for cloud. When you look at this kind of converged infrastructure environment, it’s important to see how a data center is also a gateway into the cloud. Converged infrastructure actually helps create a direct tie into a cloud architecture. Converged Infrastructure Enables Architectural Efficiency. We’re supporting greater numbers of users and workloads, all under the same IT architecture. Converged infrastructure (CI) not only supports more users, it also gives them a better experience. From the administrative perspective, you have your critical resources all under one management plane. Most of all – direct integration with the hypervisor allows you to literally create a bridge into the cloud. On premise converged infrastructure solutions can scale into the cloud or even other private data center solutions. The point is that you have the architectural freedom to design your environment around the growing needs of your business. CI – Helping you Innovate at the Pace of Software. Converged infrastructure is all about hardware and software intelligence. Now, you’re creating powerful profiles capable of dynamically provisioning and de-provisioning critical resources. Basically, converged infrastructure help you create cloud consumption models. Alerts, thresholds, specific policies, and even hypervisor-level controls – all enable easier management of a complex ecosystem. Through convergence, you can rapidly deploy new business units, test out new pieces of technology, and push workloads into the cloud directly from the management layer. This allows for the greatest amount of flexibility around the logical layer and the physical layer it supports. Enabling Systems Ready for Big Data. Virtual applications, desktops, big data, databases, virtual workloads, and a number of other types of solutions can be hosted on a CI platform. You can do things like graphics optimization, big data workload control, and even integrate with cloud systems. The beauty of CI revolves around its flexibility. In the past, heavy workloads (like data analytics) needed their own specific resources to function properly. Now, CI creates a platform where workloads like big data processing, and even virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) can live on the same ecosystem; all managed from one environment. Creating Extensions into Cloud. Modern converged infrastructure solutions now act as the foundation for hybrid cloud systems. Direct integration with virtualization and cloud environments allows administrators to create an intelligent bridge into the cloud. You can integrate with VMware vRealize cloud automation solutions for automation, and even extend into an OpenStack cloud management ecosystem. The important part is that it’s all under one converged platform – with intelligent management built in.  There are powerful integrations with virtualization systems as well as cloud infrastructures. This means that CI acts as a direct bridge into a variety of new types of workloads. This includes big data, hybrid cloud, virtualization, and much more. With greater levels of efficiency, density, and workload optimization, converged infrastructure aims to take on modern business challenges with truly smart IT solutions.   Previous Article Microsoft's Brad Smith: We Need a "Digital Geneva Convention" Next Article Zero One: Cybersecurity, a Business Challenge Tweet Get Daily Email News from DCK!Subscribe now and get our special report, "The World's Most Unique Data Centers."

Credit: Intel More like this HP plans to continue with Itanium in servers for HP-UX customers Intel's new Xeon server chip pushes Itanium closer to end HPE's Itanium server refresh should come in mid-2017 Video Mingis on Tech: Floating solar panels, a VR update -- and Tom Brady? Intel's Itanium chip is hanging by a thread, and after more than three years, the company is shipping the next and possibly final version of the processor, which is code-named Kittson. The chip is shipping to test customers, and volume shipments will commence later this year, a company spokesman said. Itanium chips have been used in mainframes and mission-critical servers. Hewlett Packard Enterprise will ship servers with Kittson later this year. Itanium has been dying a slow and painful death, and Kittson will likely be the end of the line. Support for the chip has been dwindling, and software development has stalled. Intel may be happy to see Itanium sink as it looks to drop irrelevant products in its pursuit of profitable markets. Intel has been openly lobbying customers to switch from Itanium to x86-based Xeon chips, which has a server chip market share of more than 90 percent. Itanium is in maintenance mode, and "you won't see much more going forward," said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. Intel developed Itanium in conjunction HP, and the first chip was released in 2001. The goal of the superfast chip was to replace older mainframe architectures like SPARC and to compete with IBM's Power. Intel considered Itanium the architecture of choice for future high-performance chips, but the Itanium chips flopped and couldn't outrun SPARC or Power. Itanium's biggest enemy was Intel's own Xeon chip, which became successful with mass adoption in fast-growing, low-end and mid-range server markets. Intel then put more resources into developing Xeon. Itanium has been in the news for the wrong reasons. The chip's slow death gained attention when Oracle decided to stop writing software for the architecture in 2011, after it determined the chip "was nearing the end of its life." Microsoft also pulled the plug on Itanium software development. Intel hasn't provided an Itanium roadmap ahead of Kittson. The new chip succeeds the older Itanium 9500 series code-named Poulson, which started shipping in the fourth quarter of 2012. The only big vendor still installing Itanium in servers is HPE, which puts the chip in mission-critical Integrity servers. HPE has reassured customers that it is committed to supporting Itanium until 2025, but the company is also successfully convincing customers to switch over to Xeon chips. HPE will release servers based on the new Itanium chips later this year, a spokeswoman for the company said in an email. "We are refreshing our HPE Integrity Servers with HP-UX to take advantage of Kittson in the second half of 2017," the spokeswoman said. HPE has kept Itanium support active until 2025 mainly due to long-term customer commitments. Many Itanium customers are government agencies, which sign long-term deals with vendors to supply and support servers. In addition to Unix-based HP-UX, the Integrity servers run on Linux and OpenVMS. OpenVMS will get Kittson support in the fourth quarter, according to a recently updated OS product roadmap on the website of VMS Software, which is leading the software development. Many customers may skip Kittson and jump to x86, but that could be an expensive proposition, McGregor said. The process involves porting legacy code over to new systems based on x86, and that process could take years. Some Itanium users -- especially financial organizations who rely on the rock-solid servers for transactions -- may not be willing to take the risk. "Sooner or later these guys have to convert to something else," McGregor said. HPE and Dell are offering services to port code over from mainframe systems to newer x86 servers, but the process is complicated and requires a lot of testing to ensure the code is stable.

Jason Chaffetz Reuters More On: michael flynn Republicans call for probe of Russian ties to Trump campaign Dan Rather warns Flynn scandal may be the next Watergate Flynn's fall should have the intel community in the hot seat Flynn's replacement plans housecleaning and other notable comments The Republican leader of the House Oversight Committee said Tuesday his panel won’t investigate the circumstances surrounding Michael Flynn’s resignation as national security adviser. “I think the situation has taken care of itself. I know that the Intel committee is looking into the hacking issue,” Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) said, adding, “I think he did the right thing stepping down.” The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), said he’s more interested in looking into the leaks coming from the White House than probing what caused Flynn to step down over his contact with the Russian ambassador. Nunes said any communication between President Trump and Flynn is protected by “executive privilege.” But a Republican member of the Senate panel said an “exhaustive” investigation is needed to understand the relationship between the president and Russian officials. “I think everybody needs that investigation to happen,” Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) told St. Louis radio station KTRS. “And the Senate Intelligence Committee, again that I serve on, has been given the principal responsibility to look into this, and I think that we should look into it exhaustively so that at the end of this process, nobody wonders whether there was a stone left unturned, and shouldn’t reach conclusions before you have the information that you need to have to make those conclusions.” House Speaker Paul Ryan applauded Trump for seeking Flynn’s resignation but wouldn’t back an investigation into what the White House knew about Flynn’s contact with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. “I think the president made the right decision to ask for his resignation … I’ll leave it up to the administration to describe the circumstances,” Ryan said at a Tuesday press briefing. Meanwhile, House Democrats are pressuring the Trump administration to hold a classified briefing to explain in detail why Flynn resigned. “We are communicating this request to the Department of Justice and FBI this evening,” Reps. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) and John Conyers (D-Mich.) wrote after Flynn announced his departure late Monday. The lawmakers said they were “shocked and dismayed” that the White House had been informed that Flynn misled the Trump administration about his contacts with Kislyak but “did nothing about it.” “Neither to clarify the truth to the American public or to stop General Flynn from being an ongoing national security concern,” they said in the statement. Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) said “deeply troubling questions” remain. “The American people deserve to know at whose direction Gen. Flynn was acting when he made these calls and why the White House waited until these reports were public to take action,” said Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee. Michael FlynnGetty Images He was referring to reports that then acting-Attorney General Sally Yates warned the White House that Flynn was misleading them on his contacts with Kislyak and feared he could be blackmailed by the Russians. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) called out the Trump administration on Tuesday, saying Flynn’s resignation shines light on the “dysfunction” of the nation’s security operations and raises questions on the president’s relationship with Moscow. “Including statements by the president suggesting moral equivalence between the United States and Russia despite its invasion of Ukraine, annexation of Crimea, threats to our NATO allies, and attempted interference in American elections,” McCain said. The Republican appeared to be referencing comments Trump made in an interview with Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly before the Super Bowl. O’Reilly pressed Trump on Russian President Vladimir Putin being a killer. “There are a lot of killers. You think our country’s so innocent,” Trump responded. SEE ALSO DOJ warned White House that Flynn could be vulnerable to Russian blackmail: report 0:0 The Justice Department reportedly warned The White House that national... In a statement, McCain thanked Flynn for his “many years of distinguished service to our country” and wished him “the very best in his future endeavors.” “As our nation confronts the most complex and diverse array of global challenges since the end of World War II, it is imperative that the president select a new national security adviser who is empowered by clear lines of authority and responsibility and possesses the skills and experience necessary to organize the national security system across our government.” McCain on Tuesday also called for American policy toward Russia to be made “clear and unequivocal.” Filed under congress ,  house oversight committee ,  michael flynn ,  national security Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Trump crashed wedding just after dealing with North Korea Read Next Trump crashed wedding just after dealing with North Korea Share Selection Trending Now in News 48,971 Details emerge of Melania's misery as first lady 13,202 My life sucks since winning the lottery 12,166 Colbert beating Fallon in ratings since Trump took office Now On Ruth Negga on auditioning for ‘Loving’ Tavi Gevinson is working on a new book Frank Pellegrino’s Friars Club memorial included surreal tribute SEE ALL Now On The Boundary-Pushing Sex Scenes of Lena Dunham SEE ALL Most Popular This Week How Obama is scheming to sabotage Trump's presidency Clinton reminds us why we're lucky she lost the election Surgeon jumps from bridge after divorce from TV personality wife $325K wedding nixed after brawl erupts at rehearsal dinner, suit...

After #FlynnResignation, @FBI must accelerate its investigation of the Trump Administration's Russian connection. https://t.co/DB9bqD3kju pic.twitter.com/UMe7bHsInx — Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) February 14, 2017 Despite the outrage, Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), Chair of the House Oversight Committee, confirmed earlier today that his panel won't investigate the circumstances that led to Michael Flynn stepping down Monday as President Trump's national security adviser.  Instead, Chaffetz deferred to the House Intelligence Committee, which is already investigating Russia's attempt to influence the presidential elections, a scope that includes campaign communications with the Russian government.  Per The Hill: *"I think that situation has taken care of itself.* I know that the Intel committee is looking into the hacking issue." *"I think he did the right thing stepping down."* *"It really is the purview of the Intel Committee. They really are the only ones that can look at that type of information, particularly when you’re talking about interactions with a nation state like that.* It’s not something the Oversight Committee can actually look at because sources and methods are the exclusive purview of the Intel Committee." Of course the "Swarm Of Angry Protesters" that took over a Chaffetz town hall meeting last week in Utah, amid chants of "Do Your Job", will likely not be very happy with his decision. Meanwhile, Chaffetz's assertion that the "situation had taken care of itself" didn't stop the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, Elijah Cummings, from demanding a *"full classified briefing"* to determine *"who else within the White House is a current and ongoing risk to our national secruity."* Rep. Elijah Cummings (Md.), the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, called for a full classified briefing about the circumstances leading to Flynn's departure from all the relevant agencies. "Now, we in Congress need to know who authorized his actions, permitted them, and continued to let him have access to our most sensitive national security information despite knowing these risks. *We need to know who else within the White House is a current and ongoing risk to our national security,"* Cummings said in a joint statement with Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. Of course, there's only one logical conclusion to be drawn from all of this, namely that Jason Chaffetz is most likely a Russian spy and should be thoroughly investigated immediately... » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Wochit Headline News - 1 day ago< > Embed Is Trump Breaching Security Protocols? 00:47 The chairman of the House Oversight Committee sent questions to Trump’s chief of staff after photos spread on social media of the president working in the club’s restaurant.

Flynn stepped down from his post late Monday evening after it was revealed he misled Vice President Mike Pence about a call he had with the Russian ambassador discussing the country’s sanctions. Chaffetz said he believes Flynn was right to resign, adding an investigation would just be under the jurisdiction of the House Intelligence Committee. “I think that situation has taken care of itself, I know that the Intel Committee was looking into the hacking issue previously, so I think he did the right thing by stepping down,” he told reporters. “When we get into sources and methods it really is the purview of the Intel Committee — they are the only ones that can look at that kind of information, particularly when you are look at the interactions with a nation-state like that.” GOP Rep. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, a chairman of the moderate Tuesday Group, said he would like to see more information on the topic before determining if an independent investigation is necessary. “I’d like to find out what the facts are, I don’t know the facts — all I know is what I’ve read in the media,” he told reporters. “I’ll have the opportunity to see the vice president today and I’ll raise the issue with him.” House Speaker Paul Ryan, a self-proclaimed Russia hawk, said the Trump administration is not the first to try to repair relations with Russia, praising the president for his call for Flynn to resign. Ryan echoed Dent in saying he thinks it’s premature to determine whether an independent probe is needed. “I think the administration will explain the circumstances that led to this and the Intelligence Committee has been looking into this thing all along, by the way, just in respect to Russia,” he told reporters. ” I think that it’s really important that as soon as they realized they were being misled by the national security advisers they asked for his resignation — I can’t speak to the rest of the circumstances. I think we need to get all of that information before we prejudge anything.” Dent said he would like to see the administration’s policies on Russia veer to where the United States has stood on the issue in the past. “I hope with his departure we will move to a more traditional policy on Russia, the one that has been embraced by both parties over the last several years — since the second World War,” he said.

Measuring only 0.70 inches thin, it weighs a little more than four pounds and is housed in a unibody CNC aluminum chassis.   A Full HD panel comes standard on the new Razer Blade, while a new 4K UHD touchscreen option will be available for the first time on Razer's 14-inch model. Razer Blade users can enjoy extraordinarily clear visuals and intense frame rates in games with the Full HD display, or step up to the clarity of 4K for ultimate picture quality and the convenience of a touchscreen interface.   "The Razer Blade sets the benchmark for performance in thin laptops," says Min-Liang Tan, Razer co-founder and CEO.   "More users embraced this flagship computer model in 2016 than ever before, and we are excited to make it even more available worldwide this year.

The 14” gaming notebook uses the same 17.8 mm-thick chassis introduced last year and has the same I/O capabilities, but some minor differences in weight. Meanwhile, it is important to note that the entry-level Razer Blade now costs $100 less than it used to last year, but at the expense of a lower-resolution display. The new Razer Blade is based on the Intel Core i7-7700HQ (4C/8T, 2.8/3.8 GHz, 6 MB, 45 W) processor as well as the HM175 PCH (so, the same motherboard as before). The new chip is powered by the Kaby Lake microarchitecture, has higher frequencies compared to its predecessor that was used in last year’s Blades (Core i7-6700HQ) and supports Speed Shift v2 technology as well as other improvements. Along with the Kaby Lake CPU, the new Blade also got 16 GB of faster DDR4-2400 memory (soldered to the mainboard). In addition to 256 GB and 512 GB M.2 (NVMe/PCIe) SSDs, Razer now also offers a 1 TB PCIe drive as an option. When it comes to graphics, the new Blade uses NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1060 with 6 GB of GDDR5 memory and an HDMI 2.0b output, just like the predecessor introduced last fall. Apart from the CPU and DRAM upgrades, Razer changed display options for the latest breed of Blade laptops. Last year the company only offered its Blades with touch-enabled IGZO LCDs featuring 3200×1800 resolution, and a matte 1920x1080 on the entry level. This year the higher-end Blade machines will feature touch-enabled UHD displays (3840×2160). Usage of the lower-resolution panel allowed Razer to reduce the price of the entry-level Blade to $1899 (or by $100), but at present we do not know how much the 4K SKUs is going to cost. In any case, systems featuring FHD panels will be slightly lighter and will have a longer battery life than models with UHD monitors. We haven't heard back from Razer on if the new UHD display continues to be a Sharp IGZO panel or not. Apart from displays, different Blade systems will look and feel exactly the same: both use a solid CNC-milled aluminum chassis with a matte black finish.

In a bid to appeal to those who care about security, there is a TPM 2.0 security chip installed. The new Razer Blade notebooks with FHD screens are available now in North America and Europe starting from US$1,899/C$2,749/€2.149/£1.799. The laptops with 4K UHD panels will be available in Q2 and Razer does not have pricing available at the moment, but expect it to be similarly priced to the outgoing QHD+ model.

POST A COMMENT 38 Comments View All Comments Infy2 - Tuesday, February 14, 2017 - link For $2000 I would expect nothing less than GTX 1080. Reply cyrusfox - Tuesday, February 14, 2017 - link but the TDP of the mobile 1060 is only 80 watts, for the 1080 it is 150 watts. You wouldn't have as pretty a package or as light/small form of a laptop with the 1080. This laptop is plenty capable, if you need more oomph, you either have to trade out aesthetics or save that for desktop use. Reply Inteli - Tuesday, February 14, 2017 - link Cooling a 1080 in this sized chassis would be very interesting. Reply Mathieu Bourgie - Tuesday, February 14, 2017 - link As previously mentioned, it isn't realistic to expect a 150W GTX 1080 in a 14" chassis. There are already very few 15.6" laptop with a GTX 1080, due to the challenge of cooling. Also, there's no laptop with a GTX 1080 available for $2000. The least expensive that I could find start at $2100 and most are $2400+. And those don't come with an aluminum unibody or RGB keyboard. The Razer Blade Pro (17" variant with GTX 1080) starts at $3700... Reply Morawka - Tuesday, February 14, 2017 - link unibody.. funny.. half the razer blade is plastic on the bottom Reply SpartanJet - Tuesday, February 14, 2017 - link Do you even own one? I can tell you its an aluminum uni-body, no plastic at all. Reply vincentlaw - Wednesday, February 15, 2017 - link It is most definitely not plastic on the bottom. It's very similar to the older unibody macbooks. Reply DanNeely - Tuesday, February 14, 2017 - link some crazy people made a single slot desktop 1070, that fan could theoretically be shoved into a thin gaming laptop. OTOH at full load I suspect it sounds like a fully loaded B52 using afterburners on takeoff. Reply ckbryant - Tuesday, February 14, 2017 - link B-52 isn't an afterburner capable jet engine. It would do no good for a sub-sonic plane to have afterburners Reply ckbryant - Tuesday, February 14, 2017 - link It does have a water inject feature to use water to increase spool speed for rapid takeoff but thats banned at most airports and etc...due to noise Reply 1 2 3 4 ▶ PIPELINE STORIES + Submit News EVGA's New iCX Range: NVIDIA GPUs with More Control for Cooling Toshiba Announces MN-Series HDDs: Up to 8 TB NVIDIA Releases 378.66 WHQL Driver: Game Ready, More Ansel, With 10 and 12-bit video Razer Blade Gets Core i7-7700HQ, Adds 4K Touchscreen, 1 TB SSD Options AMD Releases Radeon Software Crimson ReLive Edition 17.2.1 Intel Announces the Xeon E7-8894 v4 CPU: 24 Cores at 2.4 GHz for $8898 Qualcomm Announces 802.11ax Access Point and Client Solutions NVIDIA Releases Android 7.0 Update for SHIELD Tablet Eurocom Launches a 780 W External PSU for Laptops GlobalFoundries to Expand Capacities, Build a Fab in China NVIDIA Reports Q4 2017 And Fiscal 2017 Results: Record Revenue Intel Confirms 8th Gen Core on 14nm, Data Center First to New Nodes TWEETS IanCutress: Internet seems to be back - 20 minutes of big WTF.

The morning after National Security Adviser Michael Flynn resigned amid a firestorm of controversy over his dealings with Russia, the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee stated that he won’t be probing President Donald Trump over his discussions with Flynn. However, he is interested in looking at something else — leaks to the press. According to CNN’s Manu Raju, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) spoke to reporters this morning on Capitol Hill and cited executive privilege as covering Trump regarding his conversations with his NSA. At the same time, Nunes said that he is “very concerned with the leaks” surrounding Flynn’s calls with the Russian ambassador and that it’s something he “wants to look into.” Nunes’ comments seem to reflect those made by the president this morning, via Twitter. The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 14, 2017 The scandal involving Flynn over his communications with Russia blew up following a well-sourced report by the Washington Post  Thursday evening revealing that Flynn discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador prior to Trump’s inauguration. This was followed by another report last night indicating that former acting Attorney General Sally Yates informed the Trump administration that Flynn was susceptible to blackmail from Russia.

Of course More like this Intel Data Center Storage XPoint: Leaked Intel specs reveal 'launch-ready' SSD – report Roses are nice, but SSDs from Chipzilla (if these specs are true) are DRAM-NAND gap-filler 14 Feb 2017 at 14:01, Chris Mellor Leaked Intel Optane SSD specs show much higher endurance and lower latency than NAND SSDs and good, but not great, IO performance. M.2 format 16GB and 32GB caching Optane drives have already been announced, but no add-in-card/SSD-type drives yet. However, the Chinese TechBang website says it has seen a data sheet for an Intel Optane SSD, the DC P4800X, and says the product is ready for launch. Ignoring all of Intel's previous XPoint hype and treating this as just another solid-state drive, we can see that its IO performance is not radically better than existing SSDs – in fact it's inferior to many – but its latency is lower than other SSDs, at less than 10 µs, and its endurance is far longer, at 30 drive writes per day. Its quality of service with 4KB and a random queue depth of 16 is 99.999 per cent, with reads completing in less than 150µs and writes in less than 200 µs. We don't know its price so cannot judge its price/performance, but we can certainly say it reacts faster than NAND SSDs, has higher write performance and lasts much longer. The data sheet specifies its capacity as 375GB and provides much performance and interface information. It says it is a half-height, half-length low profile add-in card, for example, and uses an Intel controller with Intel firmware: Copy of Intel DC P4800X data sheet We have tabulated some data from this data sheet and compared it to existing Intel, Samsung and WD NAND SSDs also using NVMe interfaces. All the numbers are "up to" values. Product Capacity Media Random Read IOPS Random Write IOPS Seq Read Seq Write Latency Endurance Intel DC P3608 1.6, 3.2, 4TB 20nm HET MLC NAND 850,000 150,000 5GB/sec 3GB/sec 20μs read/ write Up to 21.9PB writen.

Samsung PM1725a 1.6, 3.2, 6.4TB 3D V-NAND 48-layer TLC 1,050,000 160,000 6.4GB/sec 2.9GB/sec Read/write 90/20 µs. 5 DWPD 5 years 960 PRO 512GB, 1TB V-NAND 48-layer 21nm MLC 440,00 360,000 3.5GB/sec 2.1GB/sec 1.2/2PB written or 5-year warranty WD Black 256, 512GB 15nm TLC NAND 170,000 134,000 2.05GB/sec 512GB/sec 160TB written, 5-year warranty A glance at the table shows that Samsung's PM1725a has a 1,050,000 random read IOPS rating, making the XPoint SSD's 550,000 look slow. However, Optane's 500,000 random write IOPS looks good, being double or triple other SSDs. Several drives in the table exceed the Optane product's sequential IO bandwidth; we can say it's respectable but not in the lead. Intel's own DC P3608 exceeds it comfortably. The Optane drive's endurance is outstanding, up to 10 times better in drive writes per day compared to the other drives in our table. This is no device whose weak write performance/endurance means it has to be used for read-centric applications. Is this leak genuine? Tom's Hardware found a conformity certificate on Intel's website, which is no longer available. We have asked Intel about this DC P4800X and expect a firm "no comment". If we get anything else, we'll let you know. ® Tips and corrections 16 Comments More from The Register Regular or premium?

OpenGL 4.0 Patches For Intel Ivy Bridge Revised Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 14 February 2017 at 08:11 AM EST. 22 Comments While yesterday's Mesa 17.0 release took Intel Haswell hardware from OpenGL 3.3 to OpenGL 4.5, this quarterly update didn't end up bring the older Ivy Bridge hardware past OpenGL 3.3. But consulting firm Igalia has continued working on their patches to bring Ivy Bridge hardware up to OpenGL 4.0. Hopefully we'll see this patch series land for Mesa 17.1: Igalia has sent out their third revision to a set of patches for enabling ARB_gpu_shader_fp64 for Ivy Bridge and it's the last extension needed for this generation prior to Haswell for having OpenGL 4.0 support. Let's just hope now that the patches will be reviewed in a timely manner so that they can land. The 24 patches sent out today add FP64 support to the Intel driver's align16 and align1 back-ends, allowing OpenGL 4.0 to be exposed for IVB. From Samuel Iglesias Gonsálvez, "This is the third version of the patch series that includes, among other fixes, a working DF MOV INDIRECT support for IvyBridge, improvements in the d2x legalization pass, improvements in the regioning parameters handling for DF instructions on IVB, and validator changes to detect misbehaviours in the generated code." These patches, however, do not have register spilling support for 64-bit FP64 data. The patches can be found on Mesa-dev. 22 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Benchmarks: Gaming Power Consumption, Picking a Winner 381 Facebook Twitter Reddit RSS Comments Although the launch of Intel's seventh-generation processor series in January was a relatively uneventful affair, there were a few items of interest -- namely the unlocked Core i3 7350K, which captured most of Kaby Lake's headlines early on. Despite that early intrigue, with a current retail price of $180, the 7350K is a mighty expensive dual-core processor and for $20 more you can land the quad-core Core i5-7400 (confusingly, both cost the same amount in Australia and other regions). Given their similar prices, quite a few of you have asked which is the better buy between the Core i3-7350K and Core i5-7400. The advantage of the slightly pricier Core i5-7400 is that it has four cores and larger L3 cache while its disadvantage is that it's locked at a base clock frequency of 3GHz with a maximum single core operating frequency of 3.5GHz. There is a bit more to this comparison but that's the gist of it. The Core i3-7350K on the other hand comes clocked at least 20% higher, 40% higher in fact when compared to the i5's base clock frequency. This is also an unlocked-K processor which means it can be overclocked to achieve even greater frequencies. I got my chip up to 4.8GHz without much fuss and that's almost 40% above the i5's maximum turbo boost frequency. A clock speed advantage of roughly 40 to 60% is huge and with its support for Hyper-Threading the 7350K should really challenge the 7400. There are however a few other factors at play here which make the 7350K look a whole lot less enticing, so let's touch on that before we even get to the benchmarks. Watch Steve cover the shootout in the video below... Consumers can pretty much get the most out of the Core i5-7400 on a $50 H110 motherboard with the standard Intel box cooler, while the 7350K requires a Z-series motherboard. Z170 boards start at $90 and Z270-based models start at $110, which is quite a bit more than an H110 motherboard. Not only, that but the 7350K will require an aftermarket cooler so you can add another $30 to the price. Therefore, you're looking at $250 for the Core i5-7400 with an entry-level motherboard whereas the 7350K will set you back at least $300 with a basic Z170 board and budget tower style air-cooler. So in the end you are paying about 20% more for the 7350K and its required components. Keeping all that in mind, let's find out how the two compare... Test System Specs Kaby Lake System Specs Intel Core i5-7400K (3.0GHz - 3.5GHz) Intel Core i3-7350 (4.2 GHz) Asrock Z270 Gaming K6 32GB DDR4-3000 RAM Nvidia Titan XP Samsung SSD 960 Pro 1TB Silverstone Essential Gold 750w Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Vishera System Specs AMD FX-8370 (4.0GHz - 4.30GHz) Asrock Fatal1ty 990FX Professional 32GB DDR3-2400 RAM Nvidia Titan XP Samsung SSD 960 Pro 1TB SilverStone Essential Gold 750w Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Skylake System Specs Intel Core i7-6700K (4.0GHz - 4.2GHz) Intel Core i5-6600K (3.50GHz - 3.90GHz) Intel Core i3-6100 (3.70GHz) Asrock Z170 Gaming K6+ 32GB DDR4-3000 RAM Nvidia Titan XP Samsung SSD 960 Pro 1TB Silverstone Essential Gold 750w Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Sandy Bridge System Specs Intel Core i7-2600K (3.4GHz - 3.8GHz) Intel Core i5-2500K (3.3GHz - 3.7GHz) Asrock P67 Transformer 16GB DDR3-1600 RAM Nvidia Titan XP Samsung SSD 960 Pro 1TB Silverstone Essential Gold 750w Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Benchmarks: Applications Excel is an application that has no problem utilizing a large number of threads and as such the Core i5-7400 performs much better than the 7350K. Even overclocked the 7350K simply couldn't match the 7400, taking over 10% longer to complete the workload. Surprisingly the overclocked 7350K was able to nudge ahead of the 7400 in the 7-Zip benchmark, that said it was just 4% faster. For any kind of encoding work having four physical cores will always beat trump two cores with Hyper-Threading and we see that here when testing with Premiere Pro CC. Even at 4.8 GHz the 7350K was 4% slower than the 7100 taking 18 minutes and 16 seconds to complete the workload. First up let's check out the single and multi-threaded performance using Cinebench R15. Here we see despite a massive clock speed advantage the 7350K is still quite a bit slower than the 7400 when comparing multi-threaded performance. That said, when overclocked the 7350K looks to be almost 40% faster for single threaded tasks. Next Page Benchmarks: Gaming Article Index More GHz or More Cores?

Mark Walton - Feb 13, 2017 11:07 am UTC Enlarge reader comments 175 Share this story Intel's eighth-generation Core CPUs, codenamed Coffee Lake, will launch in the second half of 2017—far earlier than the 2018 launch period suggested by supposed product roadmaps leaked last year. At its Investor Day event last week, Intel confirmed that its 8th-gen chips will once again be based on a 14nm process, much like Broadwell, Skylake, and Kaby Lake before it. The first Broadwell chips were released way back in 2014. Intel officially abandoned its previous "Tick-Tock" strategy—with each "tick" representing a die shrink and each "tock" representing a new microarchitecture—in early 2016, and instead promised a three-phase model of Process, Architecture, Optimization. But now, with Coffee Lake, it seems Intel might have abandoned that new model, too. Technically, Kaby Lake is the "Optimization" to the "Architecture" of Skylake and the "Process" of Broadwell, which makes the early launch of Coffee Lake on 14nm something of an anomaly. Further ReadingIntel Kaby Lake Core i7-7700K review: Is the desktop CPU dead? Intel is promising around a 15 percent jump in performance versus Kaby Lake, although it hasn't noted whether this refers to desktop or mobile chips. Intel promised a similar performance jump between Skylake and Kaby Lake, but this was largely based on a bump in base clock speed for desktop chips; IPC (instructions-per-clock) remained identical. Where Intel will find the required performance improvements given it's stringing out 14nm for another year remains to be seen, although—as AMD has demonstrated with its Bristol Ridge CPUs—there are efficiency gains to be had with some clever engineering. Intel is keeping schtum about the full Coffee Lake lineup, but it's expected to include a six-core CPU as part of the standard range of i7 products. Currently, Intel only offers more than four cores in its Xeon and Extreme Edition ranges, which typically retail at much higher prices. The Coffee Lake chips will go head-to-head with AMD's upcoming Ryzen CPUs, which launch in March. Ryzen will feature eight cores and 16 threads in its top-end part, with six- and quad-core versions making up the rest of the line. Pricing for Ryzen is yet to be announced. Intel's highly anticipated Cannon Lake CPUs—which are based on a new 10nm process—do not currently have a release date. However, when they do eventually arrive, Intel has said that "Data centre [is] first for [the] next process node," meaning enterprise users will get their hands on their chips before consumers. Intel also noted that future process uses will be "fluid," depending on the market segment, meaning 14nm may be sticking around for longer than some had hoped. Further ReadingThe desktop CPU isn’t dead, it just needs a swift kick in the butt Further ReadingIntel forges ahead to 10nm, will move away from silicon at 7nmThe first 10nm chips consumers will get their hands on won't come from Intel but from Samsung and Qualcomm. The upcoming Snapdragon 835 SoC will be built on Samsung's 10nm process, enabling a 30 percent smaller die size and a claimed 40 percent reduction in power consumption. No devices using the Snapdragon 835 have been announced, but the chips are in production and are promised to arrive in the first half of 2017.

(Photo: George Frey, Getty Images) 36621 CONNECTTWEET 21 LINKEDIN 556 COMMENTEMAILMORE National security adviser Michael Flynn resigned Monday, citing "incomplete information" that he provided top White House officials about his dealings with the Russian ambassador. "Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the vice-president elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador," Flynn wrote in a public statement. "I have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted my apology." Trump immediately named Lt. General Joseph Keith Kellogg, Jr., as acting national security adviser, the White House reported. Former acting attorney general Sally Yates warned the White House that Flynn was misleading about the interactions with the ambassador, an official told USA TODAY. The official, who is not authorized to comment publicly on the matter, said Yates’ communication to the White House was prompted by assertions from top Trump officials, including Vice President Pence, that Flynn had not discussed sanctions imposed by the Obama administration for Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election. The Washington Post first reported the development earlier Monday. Yates, a holdover from the Obama administration, was abruptly dismissed by the White House late last month after directing Justice lawyers not to defend the new administration’s travel ban against seven Muslim-majority countries. Former director of national intelligence James Clapper and former CIA director John Brennan concurred with Yates, the Post reported. In the message, Yates and the other official named Vice President Mike Pence as one of the officials that Flynn misled about his communication with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak shortly after sanctions were announced in the final days of the Obama administration. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in a statement released Monday night that President Trump is evaluating the situation with Flynn.

"He's speaking to the vice president relative to the conversation the vice president had with Gen. Flynn, and also speaking to various other people about what he considers the single most important subject there is: our national security." On Feb. 8, Flynn categorically denied to the Post that he discussed sanctions with Kislyak, but the next day, he changed his testimony, telling the news organization that he "couldn't be certain that the topic never came up," according to the Post. U.S. intelligence reports during the White House campaign last year show that Kislyak and Flynn were in touch, the Post reported. Kislyak confirmed he and Flynn communicated but he declined to discuss the topic, according to the Post.

But one official told CNN that Flynn's future could be shaky given the development. "There's a lot of unhappiness over this," the official told the news organization. Yates was dismissed by President Trump on Jan. 30 after instructing the Department of Justice not to defend his travel ban in court. Late Monday night, Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Colo.., weighed in on the controversy, saying Flynn should resign from his position if the reports are deemed true. “As national security advisor, Michael Flynn is responsible to the President, the Vice President, and the American people,” Coffman said on his official Twitter account.

Short term: Prices are stalling. Intermediate term: Prices are ranging. The projected upper bound is: 36.97. The projected lower bound is: 34.67. The projected closing price is: 35.82. Candlesticks A white body occurred (because prices closed higher than they opened). During the past 10 bars, there have been 4 white candles and 6 black candles for a net of 2 black candles. During the past 50 bars, there have been 26 white candles and 24 black candles for a net of 2 white candles. Momentum Indicators Momentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators. Stochastic Oscillator One method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 30.1587. This is not an overbought or oversold reading. The last signal was a sell 11 period(s) ago. Relative Strength Index (RSI) The RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 41.32. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a buy 66 period(s) ago. Commodity Channel Index (CCI) The CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is -101.This is an oversold reading. However, a signal isn’t generated until the indicator crosses above -100. The last signal was a buy 4 period(s) ago. MACD The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a sell 8 period(s) ago.

USA TODAY NETWORK U.S. President Donald Trump speaks as he participates in a joint news conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the East Room of the White House on February 13, 2017 in Washington, DC. The two leaders participated in a roundtable discussion on the advancement of women entrepreneurs and business leaders. (Photo: Alex Wong, Getty Images) 40 CONNECTTWEET 2 LINKEDIN 85 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON — As he met for the first time with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, President Donald Trump said Monday he is looking at no more than “tweaking” rules regarding trade with Canada, compared to what is under consideration in the U.S.-Mexico trade relationship. “It’s a much less severe situation than what’s happening on the southern border,” Trump said when asked what plans to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement could mean for Canada. “Our relationship with Canada is outstanding, and we’re going to work to make it even better.” That could be good news for Detroit automakers and suppliers who see goods pour back and forth across the Canadian border. While automakers have largely remained silent on Trump’s threat to impose a border tax on autos and supplies imported into the U.S. from Mexico, such a move — which would require a rewriting of or a withdrawal from NAFTA — could impact their bottom line. Related: Trump soft pedals NAFTA criticism with Canadian PM, says Mexico the issue Trump is 'evaluating situation' about Flynn, spokesman says Trudeau, who opened his remarks by noting that the U.S. and Canada have some $2 billion worth in trade between them every day, acknowledged that any move to rewrite NAFTA “is a real concern to Canadians,” given the jobs affected. “We will be talking about how we will continue to keep those jobs for citizens on both sides of the border,” said Trudeau. “We have to allow this free flow of goods and services, and we have to be aware of the integration of both of our economies.” The border crossing at Detroit is the busiest between the two countries, and Canada is the United States’ largest trading partner. Related: Windsor school board bans student trips to U.S. The meeting came as Trump has started welcoming world leaders to visit him in Washington. Last week, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe traveled to the U.S. as he and Trump discussed trade and other issues. Trump has pledged to get the U.S. out of what he has called bad trade deals that he and other critics argue have resulted in manufacturing jobs in Michigan and elsewhere fleeing the country. Few specifics came up at today’s news conference between the two leaders. There was no mention, for instance, of a proposed underground nuclear-waste facility under consideration near Lake Huron on the Canadian side of the border, even though several Michigan policymakers have urged Trump to press Trudeau to block the proposal. In a joint release before the news conference, Trump and Trudeau did note a “shared focus on infrastructure investments,” including the Gordie Howe International Bridge in Detroit, which they said “will serve as a vital economic link between our two countries.” They said they look forward to the bridge’s “expeditious completion.” FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn President Trump: A new era in Washington begins  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

Trudeau said it was not his intention in coming to Washington to “lecture another country” as to how it should govern itself. “There have been times when we have differences in our approaches,” Trudeau said, adding that when that has occurred, both sides have voiced their opinions “firmly and respectfully.” “Relationships between neighbors are pretty complex, and we won’t always agree on everything,” said Trudeau, who maintained that Canada takes its responsibilities for national security seriously when it comes to vetting immigrants and refugees. “Make no mistake, at the end of the day, Canada and the U.S. will always remain each other’s most essential partner.” Trump didn’t answer a question as to whether he had concerns about Canada’s refugee or immigration policies involving nations targeted in his travel policy, but reiterated his belief that security must be improved. “We have problems that a lot of people have no idea how bad they are, how serious they are. … We have problems in every corner of the globe, no matter where you look,” he said.

Reuters/Joshua Roberts Donald Trump’s inauguration poster was taken down from its online store. This comes after social media users pointed out a typo in the print of the souvenir poster. “No dream is too big, no challenge is to great. Nothing we want for the future is beyond our reach,” the quote featured on the poster reads. However, the poster misspells “too” as “to.” The poster was pulled from the website on Sunday, somewhere between 9:30 p.m. and 10 p.m., as noted by the Hill. The poster was described by the Library of Congress on the original page as one that “captures the essence of Donald Trump's campaign for the presidency of the United States.” Nevertheless, it did not take long for social media users to notice, and point out, the error. Users were able to access it through an archived version that was available on the Internet Archive website. “No joke: Purchasable copy of Trump’s Inauguration Print, direct from the Library of Congress site. A 5th grader would’ve spotted this typo,” one user commented on the error. “‘Captures the essence of Trump’s campaign’ ‘to great.’” another user wrote. “Get’cher official Trump print from the Library of Congress. Extra ‘o’ in ‘too’ available separately,” another user commented. The error comes ahead of Trump’s first talks with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The two leaders will have “tough talks” on free trade. It is not the first time the Trump administration has caused misspelling errors in the time of Trump’s presidency. On Sunday, the Department of Education spelled W.E.B. Du Bois’ name on social media as “W.E.B DeBois.” "Education must not simply teach work – it must teach life. – W.E.B. DeBois,” the department had tweeted. Its subsequent apology post also contained a misspelling error. “Our deepest apologizes,” the department wrote on its Twitter account. The department eventually rectified the error, correcting the misspelling.

Instead, realize that this is a sea change, where the market is no longer influenced by the things that used hold it back before President Donald Trump won the election. Technology stocks in particular have roared since the election, with Apple hitting a new closing high on Monday. So much of the rally has roots that started in Silicon Valley, Cramer said. Thus, the price of Apple's stock is not determined by the White House. Yes, it has a large cash hoard overseas that could benefit from Trump's agenda of repatriation, but that's not the main thing powering Apple higher. "What is really driving the stock of Apple is something quite different. A realization that Apple's worldwide sales are coming in better than expected, its service revenue stream is on fire and its design and manufacturing supremacy is leaving long-time competitor Samsung in the dust," Cramer said. Getty Images Apple CEO Tim Cook looks at a display of the new 9.7' iPad Pro during an Apple special event at the Apple headquarters on March 21, 2016 in Cupertino, California. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said that regardless of the administration in the White House, it is important to have an open dialogue and to build a relationship in every country that his company operates in. Krzanich met with President Trump on Feb. 8 and followed the meeting with an announcement that Intel would invest $7 billion in a factory that will employ up to 3,000 people in Chandler, Arizona. The investment would complete plans for a plant that was previously started. According to Krzanich, Trump's position on taxes is what inspired him to revive the factory. Under the current tax system in the U.S., relative to overseas, Krzanich said it would cost approximately $2 billion more over the span of 10 years. "The tax plan that the administration is putting forward would drastically reduce that … we are betting on that tax plan coming into fruition," Krzanich said. As the transformation of technology continues to span the globe, VMware COO Sanjay Poonen told Jim Cramer on Monday that the company is watching the "America First" stance of immigration in U.S. very closely. "Our general philosophy is software changes the world … software is our birthright — Silicon Valley, and the United States — it is the reason people like me are here," Poonen said. Poonen immigrated to the United States from India in 1987 to attend Dartmouth College on a scholarship, and moved to Silicon Valley in 1991. As VMware continues to be the global leader in cloud infrastructure and virtualization, Poonen considers the opportunity for immigration to the U.S. to be very important. Munshi Ahmed | Bloomberg | Getty Images Copper production in Johor, Malaysia Cloud-based software company New Relic also launched a partnership with Amazon Web Services. New Relic specializes in helping their clients monitor and measure what their business software is doing and how users interact with it in real time. Its analytics engine provides a sophisticated dashboard for companies to provide insight into their digital operations. Cramer spoke with New Relic's CEO Lew Cirne, who explained that there are two big trends happening right now in enterprise software. The first trend is the digital imperative to reach customers. The second is the secular move to the cloud as companies exit the data center business. "While these big changes are happening, they need a dashboard to see how their software is running in the cloud … New Relic's dashboard plus the new infrastructure platforms provided by cloud providers helps enterprises make that migration," Cirne said. If one thing is certain for Cramer, it is that metal and copper stocks continue to roar higher, reaching levels not seen in the last two years. However, that doesn't mean Cramer recommends investing in these stocks. "I say you can trade the metal stocks, but not invest in them," Cramer said. Ultimately, he thinks that the stocks can only rally so far before they hit a wall looking for growth. And right now, growth is getting hard to find. In the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his take on a few stocks from callers: Chesapeake Energy Corporation: "I think it's the year of natural gas. People just don't realize it because we've had such warm weather and I do think that Chesapeake is a buy right here at $6." Ubiquiti Networks Inc: "They missed the quarter badly and in a lot of different ways. Therefore, I can't recommend it. It's in the penalty box. We've got to wait for the next quarter."

The OpenFog Reference Architecture aims to set a baseline for guiding work on standards and product design, starting with security. The year-old group defines “fog” broadly to cover everything from IoT end nodes to cloud services. It aims to define ways to minimize backhaul while providing reliable communications and deterministic latencies. Ultimately its recommendations will touch everything from the design of end node SoCs to gateways and applications. The OpenFog Consortium does not expect all IoT nodes will be compliant with its requirements. But it does aim to enable every IoT deployment with its vision of interoperable services that span eight technical areas and many vertical markets. Along the way it will create test beds and certify products for compliance with itsa requirements. Not surprisingly, security got special attention in the baseline document published this week. “It has a 30-page appendix with many detailed calls for action, mainly for security where we did a deep dive…that every silicon and security stack vendor should review,” said Chuck Byers, co-chair of the consortium’s architecture group and a principal engineer at Cisco Systems. Specifically, the Trusted Computing Group’s standards for a hardware root of trust and how chip designers implement them may need to be modified for IoT, said Rob Swanson, chair of the consortium’s technical group and a principal engineer at Intel. In addition, rivals such as ARM and Intel need to align the security primitives in their competing architectures “to serve app developers in a consistent way, [for example in] common crypto mechanisms for hardware acceleration,” Swanson said. (ARM is a member of the consortium which so far includes few chip vendors.) The OpenFog Reference Architecture covers a broad waterfront from end-node SoCs to cloud services. (Image: OpenFog Consortium) Security is just one of eight tech areas the framework addresses, but it’s currently “the biggest source of heartburn,” said Byers, noting the group also will define APIs and processes for orchestrating IoT services. “The calls to action will come in the next phase,” said Swanson. “We first needed to set the baseline with the reference architecture so we can show how systems are comprised for a given scenario,” he said. Now the group has turned its attention to defining specific low-level functions, minimal viable interfaces and methods for testing them. “There’s quite a bit to do here,” Swanson said. For example, two unannounced open source projects are already in the works that may become part of the consortium’s recommendations in the future. Meanwhile the group is setting up liaisons to collaborate with standards organizations and other IoT efforts including the Industrial Internet Consortium which has its own general and security frameworks. — Rick Merritt, Silicon Valley Bureau Chief, EE Times Related posts: China Signs IoT Interop Plan Industrial IoT Nets Blossom IoT Convergence Is Coming Security Experts Cite IoT Risks Email This Print Comment More Related Links Altair Readies Cellular IoT IC with GPS Inside Security Experts Cite IoT Risks SoC Could Power Star Trek-like Medical Scanner 16 Views of ISSCC IoT Convergence Is Coming Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] Be the first to post a comment regarding this story.

Over the next decade alone such vehicles — and vehicles with assisted-driving technology — could deliver $1 trillion in societal and consumer benefits due to their improved safety. For autonomous vehicles to make good on that promise they will need onboard artificial intelligence (AI) technology able to link them to highly detailed maps that reflect every change in the status of lanes, hazards, obstacles and speed limits in real-time. Researchers at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering are making this critical machine-to-machine handshake possible.

Wong, an associate professor in the NYU Tandon Department of Computer Science and Engineering, are developing a deep learning system that will allow self-driving cars to navigate, maneuver and respond to changing road conditions by mating data from onboard sensors to information on HERE HD Live Map, a cloud-based service for automated driving. The NYU Multimedia and Visual Computing Lab directed by Fang will house the collaborative project. Fang and Wong recently received a gift fund from HERE, a global leader in mapping and location-based services owned by Audi, BMW, Daimler and Intel, with Tencent and NavInfo of China and GIC of Singapore also poised to become investors during 2017. NYU Tandon is one of HERE's first university research and development partners in HERE HD Live Map. High-definition maps meant for machine-to-machine communication must be accurate to within 10 to 20 centimeters. Self-driving vehicles need to continuously update, or register, their location on these maps with an equally high degree of accuracy, according to Fang, who said that the goal of the collaborative research is to enhance car-to-map precision to within 10 centimeters. "Essentially, we want to be able to precisely match what the car sees with what's in the cloud database. An incredibly precise ruler isn't of much use if your vision is blurry," Fang explained. "Our work involves employing computer vision techniques to refine the vehicle's ability to continually locate itself with respect to HERE's cloud-based service," said Wong. "That requires real-time images of the street and surrounding objects derived from cameras, LiDAR [a laser-based range-finding technology] and other on-board sensors." The researchers added that this precision is also important because automobiles connected to HERE's HD Live Map service will deliver data to the cloud on road conditions, traffic, weather, obstacles, speed limits and other variables, allowing the service to upgrade nearly in real-time to reflect changing conditions. "3D computer vision and Deep Neural Network are the technologies driving the development of high- definition live maps for self-driving cars," said Xin Chen, HERE senior engineering manager and research scientist. "We're excited to kick off a long-term research collaboration with Professors Wong and Fang individually based upon their expertise in this domain as well as with NYU as a top institution for research and learning in the field." "The convergence of cybersecurity, big data, wireless technology and artificial intelligence is already revolutionizing how people live and travel, and it holds the promise of safer transportation for billions across the globe," said NYU Dean of Engineering Katepalli R. Sreenivasan. "We gratefully acknowledge this research gift funding from HERE, which will advance the important work of Professors Wong and Fang and the students assisting them in this new frontier." The HERE mapping project joins a number of recent initiatives at NYU Tandon addressing safer and smarter transportation. The U.S. Department of Transportation selected a research consortium led by NYU Tandon Department of Civil and Urban Engineering researchers to become the first Tier 1 University Transportation Center (UTC) in New York City, dedicated to using data to make every mode of surface transportation — from walking to mass transit — more efficient and safe.  Another venture — headed by a cybersecurity research team in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering — is developing the first free, open-source method for automakers to secure software updates. Uptane will protect vehicles from cyber criminals and cyber war while providing the auto industry with an inexpensive and quick way to install safety fixes.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Performance, pricing details for AMD’s upcoming Ryzen CPU leak online Performance, pricing details for AMD’s upcoming Ryzen CPU leak online By Joel Hruska on February 13, 2017 at 7:30 am Comment Over the weekend, a brace of leaks spilled critical information on how AMD’s Ryzen will compare with Intel’s Core i7 family, and how the chips will supposedly be priced. All of this information should be taken as preliminary and with a substantial grain of salt given the websites involved in leaking it and their records (WCCFTech’s in particular) of playing fast and loose with the truth. This is rumor, not fact, and should be treated equivalently. That said, these rumors are at least plausible. According to VideoCardz, which leaked the performance data, these numbers reflect a CPU without Turbo Mode, apparently running at a flat 3.4GHz. The RAM used was DDR4-2400, and not great DDR4 at that — timings were set to 17-17-17-39 2T. The motherboard was an MSI A320 board (meaning a budget model) rather than a high-end product. Clearly AMD felt these chips were close enough to shipping product to represent Ryzen, but there were obviously a few issues still to be sorted out. Furthermore, VC used Passmark, a synthetic test with limited value for telling us how performance will look in the real world. Caveats aside, let’s examine the data. These figures look plausible enough to me to be worth writing about, even if I wouldn’t draw any firm conclusions on them. Synthetic tests don’t always translate well to the real-world, and the CPU in question is clearly an early core. But what these figures show most importantly is an AMD that’s once again in a position to compete with Intel. CPU pricing will determine how much truth is in that statement, but let’s be honest for a moment — it doesn’t cost Intel anything like $400 to build a six-core processor and it certainly doesn’t cost $1000 to build an eight-core chip. These are price bands Intel has maintained solely to boost its own revenue. Even if you believe accusations of Intel acting in bad faith to slow the speed of performance improvements are unfounded (and I do), there’s no arguing that the company’s price structure is optimized to earn itself the most amount of money, not to push higher CPU core counts into markets that could plausibly use them. And speaking of rumors on pricing… Pricing, positioning details WCCFTech is claiming to have the full suite of AMD SKUs for its eight, six, and quad-core parts. According to the site, AMD will have a set of “Ryzen 3” parts with quad-core chips (no SMT), while “Ryzen 5” chips will a mixture of six-and-eight-core parts, all with SMT. The eight-core chips will be “Ryzen 7” models, and all of them will carry SMT as well. Supposedly all Ryzen cores will have a TDP between 65W and 95W. I am uncertain as to the validity of the entire SKU lineup and so will not address it in further detail. What’s more interesting are three specific claims WCCFTech makes about the “Ryzen 7” product family. If these figures are remotely in the ballpark, Intel is in for a world of hurt. The chip most closely resembling the Ryzen tested above is the Ryzen 7 1700X, a 3.4GHz chip with a 3.8GHz Turbo. The results above suggest (tentatively!) that AMD’s $389 core will land between the Core i7-6800K ($441) and the 6850K ($628). Meanwhile, the top-end Ryzen 4GHz chip will land at $500 — less than half the price of Intel’s current eight-core CPU family. That $389 price point could blow the quad-core Core i7 out of the water at an equivalent price and should be advantageous against the “middle” of Intel’s HEDT lineup. I suspect Intel will hold its fire and avoid changing its product lines further until it sees how Ryzen actually stacks up in representative suites of benchmarks. But these results could mean we’re about to see a competitive CPU market again for the first time in a half-decade. AMD doesn’t need to match Intel at every price point or SKU to build a compelling product; it just needs to offer a CPU that compares well with Intel in overall price/performance. Ryzen looks like it could be shaping up to do just that.

Linux Kernel 4.9.10 Has ARM, x86 and PowerPC Improvements, Updated Drivers GO All users of the Linux 4.9 kernel series must update Feb 15, 2017 22:00 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Greg Kroah-Hartman announced today the availability of the tenth maintenance update to the long-term supported and most advanced Linux kernel series, Linux 4.9, for all supported operating systems. Linux kernel 4.9.10 comes one week after the release of Linux kernel 4.9.9, and from the appended shortlog, it looks like it's a normal update that changes a total of 72 files, with 463 insertions and 290 deletions. As for what's included in this new point release of the Linux 4.9 kernel series, half of the patch includes updated drivers, this time for things like Intel i915, crypto, ACPI, CPUFreq, HV, InfiniBand, MD, NVDIMM, SCSI, and networking. "I'm announcing the release of the 4.9.10 kernel. All users of the 4.9 kernel series must upgrade. The updated 4.9.y git tree can be found at: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git linux-4.9.y and can be browsed at the normal kernel.org git web browser: http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git a=summary," said Greg Kroah-Hartman. ARM, x86, and PowerPC improvements, updated sound stack The other half of the Linux kernel 4.9.10 patch is split between various improvements to the ARM, x86, and PowerPC (PPC) hardware architectures and updated networking (mac80211 and wireless) and sound stacks. There's also a little bit of perf, mm, and core kernel work, along with a fix for the Btrfs file system to address btrfs_compat_ioctl failures on non-compatible ioctls, and another SELinux fix for off-by-one in setprocattr. If you're using a GNU/Linux distribution that's powered by a kernel from the long-term supported Linux 4.9 branch, you are urged to update to today's 4.9.10 release as soon as possible, or as soon as the new version lands in the stable software repositories of your operating system. OS vendors are also urged to download the Linux kernel 4.9.10 source tarball from kernel.org or via our website, compile and tweak it for their supported architectures. #Linux 4.9.10#Linux kernel 4.9.10#Linux 4.9#Linux LTS#Linux subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news GNOME Calendar App to Finally Add a Week View in GNOME 3.24, Flatpak Support Nautilus 3.24 File Manager Enters Beta, Adds New Keyboard Shortcuts and Features New Fedora 25 Live ISO Respins Now Available with Linux Kernel 4.9.8, Bug Fixes Flatpak Linux App Sandboxing Tool Now Works Out of the Box with OpenGL Drivers Apple Edges Out Samsung to Become Top Global Smartphone Vendor in Q4 Microsoft Extends Support for Original Windows 10 Version DebConf18 Will Be Hosted in Hsinchu, Taiwan, as First Debian Conference in Asia Moto G5 and G5 Plus Press Renders and Specs Revealed by Spanish Retailer Apple’s iPhone 8 to Ditch Home Button in Favor of Virtual Capacitive Buttons No New Windows 10 Cumulative Updates Coming This Month After All Apple Edges Out Samsung to Become Top Global Smartphone Vendor in Q4 Microsoft’s February Security Updates to Launch in March    Linux kernel 4.9.10 released New Linux Apps mpv: A lightweight and high quality video player based on the mplayer2 and MPlayer projects Suricata: A network intrusion prevention and detection solution for Linux operating systems Google Chrome: The powerful, lightweight and easy-to-use web browser developed by the well known Google company Linux Kernel: What you are about to download is the core of all the Linux operating systems in the world Linux Kernel: The core of the Linux operating systems, created and maintained by Linus Torvalds Clonezilla LiveCD: A Debian-based Live CD that allows you to clone hard disks without installing any software SQLite: The world's most widely deployed SQL database engine is now available on Softpedia Reader comments The Best Operating System for Linux Gaming: Which One Do You Use and Why? more on: Ubuntu i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

It moved to TV in 1952 and in 2014 starting streaming games online. This Saturday night Hockey Night in Canada is going to do its first virtual reality (VR) broadcast when the Calgary Flames take on the Vancouver Canucks. The VR presentation was a long time comes and took several partnerships to make it happen. Beer producer Molson Canadian along with NHL rights holder Rogers Sportsnet are working together for this 360 VR game between the Flames and Canuck. Earlier this month, the NFL along with Intel produced a VR Super Bowl, but there will be a big difference between the Fox Sports VR and the one on Hockey Night in Canada. Hockey Night’s will be live as opposed to nearly live with the Fox Sports broadcast. This will mark the first time 360 VR will be used in an NHL broadcast. It will use the same concept as the VR Super Bowl, however, providing hockey fans a virtual front-row seat inside the arena. And, this 360 VR game will not be a one off, either. The plan is to have six consecutive Saturday night hockey broadcasts. You can watch the games live in 360 VR on Sportsnet.ca Web site and on the Sportsnet app by using special virtual reality viewfinders. These viewfinders are currently available only in select beer cases of Molson Canadian across Canada. The Molson VR headset is a kit with a unique pin code to access all the VR content along with instructions to download the VR compatible mobile Sportsnet app available on the App Store and Google Play.

Data for these analytics is currently sourced through cameras in stadiums and courts and is incredibly expensive to acquire. In an effort to make big data analytics more accessible for the sports industry, researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have utilized IoT devices--low-cost sensors and radios--that can be embedded into sports equipment (e.g., balls, rackets, and shoes), as well as in wearable devices. "There's a lot of interest in analyzing sports data though high-speed cameras, but a system can cost up to $1 million to implement and maintain. It's only accessible to big clubs," said Mahanth Gowda, a PhD candidate in computer science and lead author of the study, "Bringing IoT to Sports Analytics." "We want to cut down the expense significantly by replacing cameras with inexpensive internet-of-things devices (costing less than $100 in total) to make it possible for many other organizations to use the technology." The team--led by Romit Roy Choudhury, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering and computer science at Illinois, jointly with Sharon Yang from Intel--has developed advanced motion tracking algorithms from the various incomplete and noisy measurements of inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors and wireless radios, fitted inside a ball and players' shoes. If the technology gains traction, real-time analytics should be possible at anytime, anywhere. The tiny sensors, which are wrapped in a protective case and distributed evenly in equipment, employ inferencing algorithms that can track movement to within a few centimeters. They can accurately characterize 3D ball motion, such as trajectory, orientation, and revolutions per second. "This level of accuracy and accessibility could help players in local clubs read their own performance from their smartphones via Bluetooth, or school coaches could offer quantifiable feedback to their students," said Roy Choudhury, who is also a research professor at Illinois' Coordinated Science Lab. The feedback could also help with detecting and analyzing player injuries, such as concussions. The sensor inside a soccer ball, for example, can measure how hard it hits a player's head, giving coaches an indication about whether to treat the player for head injury. "We've truly scratched the surface for applications with these sensors. The algorithms provide extremely fine-grained detail and accuracy in measurements, but use common measuring tools that can be found in any smartphone," said Gowda. The paper, to be published in USENIX NSDI 2017, explores tracking the 3D trajectory and spin parameters of a cricket ball; however, the core motion tracking techniques can be generalized to many different sports analytics. The team, composed of students Ashutosh Dhekne, Sheng Shen, along with other Intel collaborators, have also been developing methods to charge the sensors, including harvesting energy from the spin of the ball. "We're motivated to develop this technology to help coaches make better decisions on and off the field and provide enhanced entertainment to viewers," said Roy Choudhury. "We want to bring advanced but affordable sports analytics to everyone, anywhere, anytime." ### Disclaimer: AAAS and EurekAlert! are not responsible for the accuracy of news releases posted to EurekAlert! by contributing institutions or for the use of any information through the EurekAlert system.

Michael Flynn, left, attends a 10-year anniversary dinner for Russia Today with Russian President Vladimir Putin. (Michael Klimentyev / EPA) Malcolm Lazin Imagine that President Donald Trump is awoken by his national security adviser because of a threat to America. Among Trump's options: put American troops in harm's way, call for drone strikes or launch a nuclear weapon. Until Monday, the national security adviser, who is not subject to Senate confirmation, was retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn. After just 24 days on the job, Flynn entered the Guinness World Records for having served the shortest tenure as national security adviser. Among Flynn's transgressions was misleading Vice President Mike Pence about whether he discussed lifting sanctions with Russia's ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak. There are numerous important issues that require investigation. Among them is what was the vetting, extreme or otherwise, for this sensitive position? Gen. Flynn was "let go" as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency by President Barack Obama, allegedly for his conspiracy theories, temperament and aberrant management skills. Was Obama or his national defense team contacted by the Trump transition team about Flynn? Following Gen. Flynn's termination as Obama's DIA director, Flynn formed Intel Group, which provided services for international clients, including lobbying on behalf of Turkey. In 2015, Flynn sat at Russian President Vladimir Putin's table at a dinner in Moscow marking the 10th anniversary of RT (formerly "Russia Today," the country's state-operated TV station). Flynn appeared on the English-language global cable network that's described by U.S. intelligence as "the Kremlin's principal international propaganda outlet." Were these potential conflicts vetted? For Trump's presidential campaign, Flynn was a top military adviser; spoke at rallies and the Republican National Convention; and joined "Lock Her Up" anti-Hillary Clinton chants at Trump campaign events. To what extent did these partisan activities play into his appointment? Before being named the national security adviser, Flynn misled then Vice President-elect Mike Pence about Flynn's son needing a security clearance. To what extent did vetting include instances of Flynn providing misinformation to senior officials? Russia denies that intelligence agents were in contact with Trump's campaign team Democrats push for an independent inquiry into White House ties with Russia. Democrats push for an independent inquiry into White House ties with Russia. See more videos It was reported that the Russians had allegedly hacked into and leaked information harmful to Hillary Clinton and that Trump aides had contact with Russian intelligence operatives. Was there an inquiry into whether Flynn was among those under scrutiny? Trending on social media are the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution and the Logan Act. Among other federal officials, the clause prohibits those with military title from receiving money from a foreign government without the consent of Congress. Flynn is under Army investigation for taking money from the Russians. Was that investigation considered in the vetting? The Logan Act bars private citizens from interfering with diplomatic relations between the United States and foreign government. Violation of the act carries a fine and a criminal penalty. Did Flynn's pre-inauguration conversations with Ambassador Kislyak violate the Logan Act? As a former U.S. Department of Justice attorney, I prosecuted cases involving making false statements to the government including FBI agents. Having intercepted Flynn's conversations with Kislyak and possibly others, the FBI within days after the inauguration interviewed Flynn. If Flynn was untruthful, he could be sentenced to prison for up to five years. In response to Flynn's resignation, Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said, "I think the situation has taken care of itself." Republican Sen. Rand Paul opined that "it makes no sense" for Republicans to investigate Republicans. GOP Rep. Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, intoned, "It just seems like there's a lot of nothing there." With a Republican majority in the House and Senate, this national security imbroglio requires an independent inquiry. An inquiry with subpoena power and adequate staffing and budget and led by a pre-eminently qualified and respected American. Among those on the top of the list is Colin Powell, a retired four-star general and former national security adviser, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and secretary of state. As to potential criminal violations, the information should be turned over to an independent special prosecutor. Malcolm Lazin is a former Department of Justice attorney and a former chair of the Pennsylvania Crime Commission.

James has earned more than $600 million since turning pro in 2003. James’ salary this season is $31 million after re-signing with the Cavs this summer for three years and $99.9 million, while he'll make $55 million in off-court earnings. James added endorsement deals with Intel and Verizon over the last year, while parting ways with Samsung and Tencent. The new partners join Nike, Coca-Cola (Sprite), Beats Electronics and Kia Motor in James’ endorsement stable with James “lifetime” Nike deal potentially worth $1 billion, according to his business manager Maverick Carter. Kevin Durant will make the second most money this season with earnings of $62.5 million, followed by Stephen Curry at $47.1 million. Curry’s $12.1 million salary ranks No. 83 in the NBA but he will make $35 million off the court. Rounding out the top five highest-paid NBA players are James Harden ($46.5 million) and Russell Westbrook ($41.5 million).

Apple is currently doing opposite, pushing back against shareholders who are calling for the company to accelerate its efforts. A small group of shareholders led by investor Tony Maldonado have submitted a proposal to Apple asking the company to “adopt an accelerated recruitment policy...to increase the diversity of senior management and its board of directors." If the proposal is approved, it would require Apple to make diversity a priority when hiring at the top levels of the company. The timeline and initiatives put in place would be up to Apple, the proposal would just get the ball moving a bit faster. Maldonado has suggested tying executive pay to diversity goals—a move that Intel and Microsoft have made—or adopting a policy that would require the company to regularly search for potential new board members from diverse backgrounds. According to the company’s 2016 report, 87 of its 107 executive or senior official positions are held by men, and 88 of those seats are occupied by a white person. It is the second year that Maldonado has submitted his suggestion to increase diversity, though he has additional support in his effort this year thanks to backing from Zevin Asset Management, an investment firm that emphasizes what it calls “socially responsible investing.” Related Stories Tech Industry Trails Behind When It Comes To Diversity, New Report Shows Apple Planning To Fight ‘Right To Repair’ Bill Despite the support, Maldonado’s suggestion is unlikely to pass, thanks in large part to opposition from Apple. The company has advised shareholders to vote against the proposal, according to a filing from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Apple told shareholders in the letter that it is already exploring diversity efforts across its workforce and has made progress in attracting “more women and underrepresented minorities.” According to Apple, Maldonado’s proposal is “not necessary or appropriate because we have already demonstrated our commitment to a holistic view of inclusion and diversity." Apple has made strides in its diversity efforts. The company has reportedly removed pay disparities among its employees and has made some progress in its diversity hires. However, much of the changes have happened at the retail and non-tech parts of the company. Maldonado may not get the policy passed this year, but he doesn’t need the full support of shareholders to continue pushing his initiative. Last year the proposal got just over five percent support among shareholders, which was above the three percent threshold required to allow him to submit the idea again this year. He’ll need six percent support to be able to submit again in 2018. Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Falcon Northwest's Oculus Ready desktops get a splash of Kaby Lake by Eric Born  2:00 PM on February 15, 2017 Boutique builder Falcon Northwest has a long history of working with Oculus, having built development and demo rigs for the VR headset maker for a few years now. Falcon Northwest's support for the Oculus Ready program continues with its new Tiki and Talon desktop configurations, both recently upgraded with Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors. Falcon Northwest's Oculus Ready Tiki desktop has a slim 4" wide chassis, but that's enough room for some serious hardware. Buyers can choose between Core i5-7500, Core i5-7600K, and Core i7-7700K CPUs, and there's liquid cooling available as an option. The Tiki ships with either 16GB or 32GB of DDR4 RAM clocked at 2400 MT/s. Graphics card options on the Nvidia side include the GeForce GTX 1060, GTX 1070, GTX 1080, and Titan X, along with a small selection of Quadro cards. AMD's RX480 is also an option for buyers. The Oculus Ready Talon system is designed to give users the option of adding a second graphics card down the road—or immediately, if a single Titan X just won't cut it. The Talon has the same processor and graphics cards options as the Tiki, but its larger motherboard has enough slots for a total 64GB of RAM. The Talon's beefy 750W power supply means that installing a second graphics card probably won't require grabbing a new PSU. The Oculus Ready Tiki system equipped with a GTX 1080 and an i7-7700K starts at $3040. A similarly-configured Talon starts at $3200. Prices vary significantly depending on components and extras. Interested folks can configure a custom Tiki or Talon at Falcon Northwest's website.   Tags: Graphics Systems Gaming Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Hynes Convention Center in Boston. It was the latest testament to growing adoption of Apache Spark, and the event underscored promising developments in areas including machine learning, deep learning and streaming applications. The Summit had outgrown last year's east coast home at the New York Hilton, but the contrast between those cramped quarters and the cavernous Hynes made comparison difficult. As I wrote of last year's event, the audience was technical, and if anything, this year's agenda seemed more how-to than visionary. There were fewer keynotes from big enterprise adopters and more from vendors. Mataei Zaharia of Databricks recapped Spark progress last year, highlighting growing adoptionand performance improvements in areas including streaming data analysis. The Summit saw plenty of mainstream talks on SQL and machine learning best practices as well as more niche topics, such "Spark for Scalable Metagenomics Analysis" and "Analysis Andromeda Galaxy Data Using Spark." Standout big-picture keynotes included the following: Mataei Zaharia, the founder of Spark and chief technology officer at Databricks, gave an overview of recent progress and coming developments in the open source project. The centerpiece of Zaharia's talk concerned maturing support for continuous applications requiring simultaneous analysis of both historical and streaming, real-time information. One of the many use cases is fraud analysis, where you need to continuously compare the latest, streaming information with historical patterns in order to detect abnormal activity and reject possibly fraudulent transactions in real time. Spark already addressed fast batch analytics, but support for streaming was previously limited to micro-batch (meaning up to seconds of latency) until last February's Spark 2.0 release. Zaharia said even more progress was made with December's Spark 2.1 release with advances on Structured Streaming, a new, high-level API that addresses both batch and stream querying. Viacom, an early beta customer, is using Structured Streaming to analyze viewership of cable channels including MTV and Comedy Central in real time while iPass is using it to continuously monitor WiFi network performance and security. Alexis Roos, a senior engineering manager at Salesforce, detailed the role of Spark in powering the machine learning, natural language processing and deep learning behind emerging Salesforce Einstein capabilities. Addressing the future of artificial intelligence on Spark, Ziya Ma, a VP of Big Data Technologies at Intel, offered a keynote on "Accelerating Machine Learning and Deep Learning at Scale with Apache Spark." James Kobielus of IBM does a good job of recapping Deep Learning progress on Spark in this blog. Ion Stoica, executive chairman of Databricks, picked up where Zaharia left off on streaming, detailing the efforts of UC Berkeley's RISELab, the successor of AMPLab, to advance real-time analytics. Stoica shared benchmark performance data showing advances promised by Apache Drizzle, a new streaming execution engine for Spark, in comparison with Spark without Drizzle and streaming-oriented rival Apache Flink. Stoica stressed the time- and cost-saving advantages of using a single API, the same execution engine and the same query optimizations to address both streaming and batch workloads. In a conversation after his keynote, Stoica told me Drizzle will likely debut in Databricks' cloud-based Spark environment within a matter of weeks and he predicted that it will show up in Apache Spark software as soon as the third quarter of this year. The Apache Drizzle execution engine being developed by RISELabs promises better streaming query performance as compared to today's Spark or Apache Flink. MyPOV of Spark Progress Databricks is still measuring Spark success in terms of number of contributors and number of Spark Meetup participants (the latter count is 300,000-plus, according to Zaharia), but to my mind, it's time to start measuring success by mainstream enterprise adoption. That's why I was a bit disappointed that the Summit's list of presenters in the CapitalOne, Comcast, Verizon and Walmart Labs mold was far shorter than the list of vendors and Internet giants like Facebook and Netflix presenting. Databricks says it now has somewhere north of 500 organizations using its hosted Spark Service, but I suspect the bulk of mainstream Spark adoption is now being driven by the likes of Amazon (first and foremost) as well as IBM, Google, Microsoft and others now offering cloud-based Spark services. A key appeal of these sources of Spark is the availability of infrastructure and developer services as well as broader analytical capabilities beyond Spark. Meanwhile, as recently as last summer I heard Cloudera executives assert that the company's software distribution was behind more Spark adoption than that of any other vendor. In a though-provoking keynote on "Virtualizing Analytics," Arsalan Tavakoli, Databricks' VP of customer engagement, dismissed Hadoop-based data lakes as a "second-generation" solution challenged by disparate and complex tools and access limited to big data developer types. But Tavakoli also acknowledged that Spark is only "part of the answer" to delivering a "new paradigm" that decouples compute and storage, provides uniform data management and security, unifies analytics and supports broad collaboration among many users. Indeed, it was telling when Zaharia noted that 95% of Spark users employ SQL in addition to whatever else they're doing with the project. That tells me that Spark SQL is important, but it also tells me that as appealing as Spark's broad analytical capabilities and in-memory performance may be, it's still just part of the total analytics picture. Developers, data scientists and data engineers that use Spark are also using non-Spark options ranging from the prosaic, like databases and database services and Hive, to the cutting edge, such as emerging GPU- and high-performance-computing-based options. As influential, widely adopted, widely supported and widely available as Spark may now be, organizations have a wide range of cost, latency, ease-of-development, ease-of-use and technology maturity considerations that don't always point to Spark. At least one presentation at Spark Summit cautioned attendees not to think of Spark Streaming, for example, as a panacea for next-generation continuous applications. Spark is today where Hadoop was in 2010, as measured by age, but I would argue that it's progressing more quickly and promises wider hands-on use by developers and data scientists than that earlier disruptive platform.

If the company does in fact announce an full unveiling date, plus a “teaser” for the device, MWC should be pretty exciting for Galaxy fans. With that said, though, all intel we currently have points to a late-March unveiling, followed by a mid-April US launch. As of today, the general belief among Android bloggers is that Samsung will have two versions of the S8: The Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus. Both devices could potentially feature fancy AMOLED “Infinity” displays, Snapdragon 835 processors, plus plenty of other bells and whistles. MWC is right around the corner. Can you contain your excitement?

Synacks are you still stuck on those older 2yr contracts? john lens Im on prepaid, but I will be skipping S8 since I dont think it will be much of an upgrade. Osaz E. You messed up on that one. Should have skipped the S7 instead. That was the small upgrade, john lens I had the S5, skipped s6, and now I own S7. LOL Turb0wned S7 was a huge step forward from the crap S6. Me It was.

Shawn Spring Looking forward to a packed MWC with stuff from LG, Huawei, this from Sammy, and perhaps a surprise or two from someone else? Synacks I’m just glad I can actually have a choice between Samsung and something else this time of the year. The G6 is shaping up to be a decent device while Samsung is still exploring the boundaries of the 5th gen Edge devices. I wish they’d be a little less edgy so when I hand my phone to people they aren’t clicking literally everything on the sides of the screen. 2001400ex Between this and G6. Here’s hoping for removable battery and SD card. Things that have kept me on my G3. DanG SD card = yes Removable battery = no Even LG doesn’t have removable battery this for G6. discopunkk LG is pretty much killing off the removable batteries for their phones. The G6 won’t have it and if they do another LG V phone I could see them dropping it from that too. Sadly 2017 will be the end of flagship phones with them. 2001400ex Exactly. I can still hope. I don’t need one to change out daily. But I have bought 3 new batteries for my G3. Cheap way to refresh your phone. discopunkk I’m bummed about it but I expected it. I get that water resistance is a big thing but honestly I don’t need to use my phone in the shower, tub, pool, etc. I’ve been a smartphone user since 2007 and I have not ONCE got a phone wet.

Samsung Welcome to Mossberg, a weekly commentary and reviews column on The Verge and Recode by veteran tech journalist Walt Mossberg, executive editor at The Verge and editor at large of Recode. About a year ago, I wrote a column suggesting what the major tech companies should try and accomplish in 2016. For Google, I said: “It would be pretty great if Chromebooks could, out of the box, run all Android apps — provided that, unlike on the recent Pixel C tablet, the Android apps were able to adapt better to a bigger screen.” I’m happy to report that the first Chromebook designed from the ground up to run Android apps out of the box has arrived, albeit a little past the end of 2016. It goes on sale this week for $450. It’s called the Samsung Chromebook Plus, and it runs on an ARM processor, the same type of processor that powers the vast majority of smartphones and tablets. It was designed in close cooperation with Google. Alas, in my tests of the Plus over the last few days, I found the Android execution frustrating. Google Play The Android app feature is still in beta, not all apps work, and too many of those that do run seem like awkwardly blown-up phone apps, not software that’s tailored for the Chromebook's 12-inch screen. And there are other issues. Of course, the Plus, which has a touchscreen and comes with a stylus, is still a Chromebook. That means it runs the Chrome OS along with Android apps. And, purely as a Chromebook, it’s very nice. Chrome OS, which is basically a browser that runs everything, including web apps, does fine on this model and its ARM processor. But if you’re looking for a laptop-style, bigger-screen version of your favorite Android phone, I can’t recommend the Plus now. Optimizing a large number of Android apps for the Chromebook is “going to be a long process, to be honest,” one Google official conceded, noting the beta label on the Google Play Store for the Chromebook. Samsung A second, very similar, new Samsung Chromebook, the Pro, is due out in April. The only significant difference between the two is that the Pro runs on a low-end Intel processor and costs $100 more. I tested it briefly, and found it to be even buggier in its current, very pre-release state. I won’t say much about the otherwise identical hardware on these two Samsung machines, since I think it’s the Google-driven Android / Chrome OS combo software that’s their key claim to fame. Their screens are vivid, sharp and responsive. As on many laptops, you can rotate the screen around so that the relatively thin, light, 2.4-pound laptop becomes a relatively heavy, thick tablet. The stylus fits nicely in a slot and works well for things like screen capture, taking handwritten notes and annotating images. The overall design isn’t especially sexy or sleek. The keyboard lacks a backlight, and the touchpad is a tad small. In my tests, battery life was just shy of eight hours, even with heavy web and app use and streaming a full-length movie. For a better understanding of the hardware (as well as his own take on the software), I recommend my colleague Dieter Bohn’s reviews of the Plus and the Pro. Android writ large. Um, no. Compared to running apps on a smartphone, or, more aptly, an iPad, the app experience on the Samsung Chromebook Plus is distinctly subpar. There are likely several reasons for this. Even though this laptop uses the same processor family most Android devices use, the apps are running atop Chrome OS. Google deserves credit for making this work at all, but it’s still a bit laggy and buggy. For instance, in one case I ran into, two Android apps on the Plus were open but unusable, because they kept blinking and jumping in front and in back of each other rapidly. This happened while I was on the phone with a Google exec who worked on the project. He said it was a known bug that will be patched this week. And there are other bugs. In my tests, Android apps just crashed or froze multiple times a day on the Plus. Even a hugely popular app like Facebook only loaded into part of the screen with an endless spinning circle in a blank right rail. And Google’s own Gmail crashed when I was attaching a photo to a message. Samsung But there’s a larger, more fundamental problem: Android apps, including Google’s own, are almost never designed to look right and run right on a large screen — even a standard-sized tablet, let alone a laptop. There are two elements to this. One is visual: Many Android apps look like blown-up phone apps. Some, like Google News & Weather and Google Docs, don’t seem to resize for the bigger screen, so they present a relatively narrow column of text swimming in unnaturally large borders. Others, like Facebook Messenger, stretch the text horizontally to fill the space, in a weird way that makes the type tiny. The other is functional: Most Android apps I downloaded to the Plus didn’t use the larger screens to add helpful extra panels or other UI elements, but still had the narrow, cramped UI of a phone screen. This is in stark contrast to the way iOS apps behave on larger iPad screens versus iPhone screens. For instance, on the iPad, Facebook Messenger has two panels — one for contacts and one for conversations. It doesn’t look like the single-column version on iPhones and Android phones — and on the Plus. That’s because Apple has long given developers the tools and the encouragement to do dual (or “universal”) versions of their apps, and its app store installs the bigger-screen versions on iPads. Samsung Google says it is working hard to do this, but it has been saying that for years. The company says it’s optimizing its own apps for the Chromebook and urging third parties to do the same. But, judging from the 20 or so well-known Android apps I tested, this process is just starting. The company conceded it had done special work to make several of its most popular Android apps, such as Gmail and Google Calendar, look and work well. But it also said that it believes most Chromebook users will still use many productivity apps like these in the browser. Another issue: In tablet mode, apps are always full screen. You can’t create the multi-app views or even narrow sidebar views of apps that you can on an iPad or a Windows tablet. Google says this will be possible in a future release. Bottom line If you buy the Chromebook Plus and intend to use it mainly as a Chromebook, I expect you’ll have a good experience. But if you plan to rely heavily on Android apps, you’re basically buying into the start of a journey, replete with odd-looking presentations of familiar apps, bugs and crashes. You can certainly go along with Google and Samsung on this journey, but I can’t recommend that for a mainstream Android lover who just wants things to work right.

A look at the key players Ray Locker , USA TODAY Published 12:09 p.m. ET Feb. 15, 2017 | Updated 11 hours ago 19 Shares CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Fresh off White House National Security Advisor Michael Flynn’s resignation, questions are swirling, with democratic lawmakers calling for an investigation. Nathan Rousseau Smith (@fantasticmrnate) has the story. Buzz60 The rapidly unfolding saga of President Trump and the connections between the Russian government, Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and the Trump administration involves a series of political operatives, government officials and diplomats worthy of a John le Carré novel. Here are some of they key players. Paul Manafort Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager, represented the former leader of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, when the longtime ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin ran Ukraine. A longtime lobbyist in Washington and international political consultant, Manafort signed on to run Trump's campaign but left in August following disclosures that his name surfaced in secret ledgers kept by the Yanukovych government that showed he was paid $12.7 million. The New York Times reported Wednesday that Manafort spoke last year to Russian intelligence officials in telephone calls that were monitored by U.S. intelligence agencies. On Wednesday, Manafort denied any contact with Russian officials, either directly or indirectly. Michael Flynn The recently departed national security adviser worked for the state-owned Russia Today after he was fired by former president Barack Obama as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He advocated for closer relations with Russia. In 2015, Flynn traveled to Moscow to speak at the 10th anniversary gala for Russia Today in an event also attended by Putin. Flynn has acknowledged he was paid for the visit, which — if not approved by the secretaries of Defense and State — would violate federal law. He has not said how much he was paid or whether it was approved. His downfall started when U.S. intelligence agencies intercepted a telephone call from Flynn to Sergey Kislyak, Russia's ambassador to the United States, in which the two discussed new sanctions to be placed on Russia by the Obama administration. Russia Today was identified in an intelligence assessment as one of the Kremlin's top purveyors of propaganda and misinformation in the 2016 presidential election, leading to a heightened sensitivity over Flynn's participation in the event, which Flynn said was arranged by a speaker's bureau. House Democrats have called for an investigation into those connections. Former national security adviser Michael Flynn.  (Photo: Jim Lo Scalzo, European Pressphoto Agency) Carter Page Page, who runs an investment company called Global Energy Capital, was named as an early foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. He was accused last year by former Senate minority leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., of being a conduit between Trump and the Russian government, which Page denied. Last year, Page gave a speech in which he accused the U.S. government of having a “hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change” toward Russia and other former Soviet republics. Vladimir Putin The president of Russia has been the source of fascination for Trump for years. During the 2016 election, both Trump and Vice President Pence, then the governor of Indiana, praised Putin's leadership style in contrast to Obama's. The Kremlin has denied that Putin had anything to do with the Russian-led hacking of the Democratic National Committee emails, which spawned a series of leaks from the website WikiLeaks during the final weeks of the 2016 general election campaign. WikiLeaks published multiple emails from John Podesta, a longtime associate of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, that cast Clinton and the campaign in a negative light. Russian President Vladimir Putin in July 2014.  (Photo: Mikhail Klimentyev, AFP/Getty Images) Sergey Kislyak Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, received a telephone call from Flynn last December in which the two men discussed new sanctions that were to be placed on Russia by the Obama administration. The Obama administration also expelled 35 Russian diplomats from the United States for their alleged role in interfering with the U.S. elections, a move that was expected to bring a Russian response. Instead, Putin elected to do nothing.

He asked whether Putin would attend and whether he would become Trump's new best friend. April 2014 The White House moves to fire Flynn over his brusque management style.   Do you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow - if so, will he become my new best friend?— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 19, 2013 September 2015 The FBI informs the Democratic National Committee that a Russian-linked cyber-spy group had likely compromised its computer network. February 2016 Flynn tweets that fear of Muslims is "rational." Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL: please forward this to others: the truth fears no questions... https://t.co/NLIfKFD9lU— General Flynn (@GenFlynn) February 27, 2016 May 6, 2016 Trump says in a television interview that he knows Russia well. "I had a major event in Russia two or three years ago, Miss Universe contest, which was a big, big, incredible event. An incredible success," Trump said. June 14, 2016 Russian government hackers penetrated DNC servers, according to The Washington Post. The Russian government denied the charges. July 20, 2016 Flynn leads chants of “Lock Her Up!” at the Republican National Convention aimed at Hillary Clinton. “You know why we’re saying that? We’re saying that because if I, a guy who knows this business, if I did a tenth of what (Clinton) did I would be in jail today.” July 22, 2016 WikiLeaks releases private emails from DNC officials in the days leading up to the Democratic National Convention. Some of the emails showed DNC staffers favoring Clinton over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. July 27, 2016 Republican nominee Donald Trump says he doubts Russian involvement in the DNC hack. But he invites them to hack into emails Clinton had deemed personal and deleted for her official account when she was secretary of State. “I will tell you this, Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.” Donald Trump holds a press conference on July 27, 2016 in Doral, Fla.  (Photo: Gustavo Caballero, Getty Images) Sept. 26, 2016 Trump, in his first debate with Clinton, continues to express skepticism about Russian involvement. “I mean it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?” Oct. 7, 2016 Government intelligence officials call out the Russians for the first time on the hacks. The director of national intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security say they have confidence that “the Russian government directed the recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including U.S. political organizations.” WikiLeaks also releases the first batch of emails from the personal account of John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chairman. Nov. 8, 2016 Trump beats Clinton in presidential election. Nov. 18, 2016 Trump names Flynn as his national security adviser. “I am pleased that Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn will be by my side as we work to defeat radical Islamic terrorism, navigate geopolitical challenges and keep Americans safe at home and abroad,” Trump said. Dec. 9, 2016 President Obama orders a review of foreign attempts to tamper with U.S. elections. Trump dismisses the CIA’s finding that the Russians sought to sway the election in his favor. “These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.” Dec. 12, 2016 Republican leaders announce that congressional committees will investigate the CIA findings. Dec. 16, 2016 Obama says the Russian government, at the “highest levels,” initiated the hacks of emails, not voting machines. He vows to retaliate. President Obama speaks during a news conference in the briefing room of the White House on Dec. 16, 2016.  (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) Dec. 28, 2016 Trump, responding to reports of impending sanctions against Russia, says, “I think we ought to get on with our lives.” Dec. 29, 2016 Obama announces the Russian sanctions, which include expelling 35 Russian diplomats and the closing of Russian compounds in Maryland and New York that had been suspected of spying. Trump insists the issue should be put to bed but agrees to meet with intelligence officials for a briefing. “It’s time for our country to move on to bigger and better things,” Trump says. Flynn has conversations about this time with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, and urged Russia not to retaliate. The call was captured on a wiretap of diplomats’ calls. Jan. 12, 2017 Washington Post columnist David Ignatius first reports that Flynn had conversations with Kislyak. Jan. 13, 2017 Trump press aide Sean Spicer acknowledges one call between Flynn and Kislyak but says it was for “logistical information.” Jan. 22, 2017 Flynn is sworn in as national security adviser, a position that does not require Senate confirmation. Michael Flynn arrives for a White House senior staff swearing-in ceremony in the East Room of the White House on Jan. 22, 2017.  (Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP) Jan. 26, 2017 Acting Attorney General Sally Yates informs the White House counsel that Flynn lied about the nature of his calls with Kislyak and is vulnerable to blackmail. Feb. 8, 2017 Flynn denies discussing sanctions with Russian officials in an interview with The Washington Post. A spokesman for Flynn later tries to amend Flynn’s comments, saying Flynn had “no recollection” of discussing sanctions. Feb. 10, 2017 Trump says he’s not aware of the Post report that Flynn may have discussed sanctions but will look into it. Feb. 13, 2017 White House adviser Kellyanne Conway tells MSNBC that Trump has “full confidence” in Flynn. Hours later, Flynn resigns, saying he had “inadvertently briefed the Vice President-Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador.” Feb. 14, 2017 Spicer says Trump asked Flynn to resign because of an “erosion of trust.” Feb. 15, 2017 The New York Times reports that telephone records and intercepted calls show that "members of Donald J. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election."

Bottom Line It may take some time to integrate into your workflow, but the Wacom MobileStudio Pro 16 is a powerful portable drawing device that offers the full Windows 10 experience, fast components, and top-notch build quality. By Matthew Buzzi, James Jacobsen There are plenty of tools on the market designed to aid digital creation, but many are hampered by their software or a physical setup that requires you to stay at your desk. The Wacom MobileStudio Pro 16 (starts at $2,399.95; $2,999.95 as tested), on the other hand, is a drawing tablet that works equally well in your office, at home, or on the road. It's a highly specialized product that will take some adjustment to use to the utmost. But because it runs full Windows 10, you have a virtually unlimited selection of powerful software choices. This, combined with fast components, a high-resolution display, and a comfortable and intuitive pen, the MobileStudio Pro 16 is a capable, thoughtfully designed tablet for artists. //Compare Similar Products Compare Microsoft Surface Book (2016, Intel Core i7)   %displayPrice%%seller% Apple iPad Pro (12.9 inch)   %displayPrice%%seller% Acer Aspire Switch 11 V (SW5-173-632W)   %displayPrice%%seller% Asus Transformer Book T100HA   %displayPrice%%seller% Asus Transformer Mini (T102HA-D4-GR)   %displayPrice%%seller% Lenovo IdeaPad Miix 700   %displayPrice%%seller% Lenovo Miix 510   %displayPrice%%seller% Microsoft Surface Pro 4   %displayPrice%%seller% Xplore XSlate R12   %displayPrice%%seller% Acer Switch Alpha 12   %displayPrice%%seller% HP Spectre x2   %displayPrice%%seller% Your Mobile Canvas The tablet reviewed here is the larger and more potent of the two versions of the MobileStudio Pro (the other is the more modestly outfitted 13-inch MobileStudio Pro 13, which ranges in price from $1,499.95 to $2,499.95). The display itself is 15.6 inches, while the tablet as a whole measures 0.75 by 16.5 by 10.3 inches (HWD) and weighs 4.86 pounds. Holding it in one arm can get tiring quickly, but you're more likely to rest it in your lap or on a desk when drawing, anyway. (The Wacom Stand, sold separately for $99.95, can prop up the MobileStudio Pro 16 at a variety of angles, too.) There are silicone grips on the rear side of the tablet at both ends, for the times you are holding or propping it up. The black and silver color scheme gives the tablet a sleek look. View All 12 Photos in Gallery The roomy touch display's resolution is 4K (3,840 by 2,160); any artist should appreciate this, as higher resolution is better for individual pixel work. Images look vibrant, and the finish prevents irritating reflections. The display covers 94 percent of the Adobe RGB color spectrum, which is good, though it's a bit disappointing that this art-focused device does not hit 100 percent. Laptops aimed at creatives often boast 100 percent coverage to reproduce completely accurate colors, which is important for matching what you see on the screen to real-life colors on samples or prints. Multiple Ways to Create In addition to the touch-screen input, there are a number of physical buttons to help with executing controls and shortcuts. On the left-hand side are a four-direction rocker ring with a middle-click button, and two columns of four buttons above and below it. (Other Wacom devices have buttons like these in the same place, so if you've used one of those, you should have an easy time adapting.) These buttons are designed to save you the time needed to head back up to the toolbar if you're not using a keyboard, and having a set of commands on hand speeds up any process once you memorize the setup. (You could, of course, connect the tablet to a keyboard via Bluetooth so you can use key combinations you're more familiar with, but that would reduce the MobileStudio Pro's portability somewhat.) By using the Wacom Tablet Properties interface (accessible through Windows or the Wacom Desktop Center app), you can assign a variety of different shortcuts to these hardware controls. You may want to configure the touch ring to rotate or auto scroll, one button to activate a specific key combination, a third to act as the Shift key, and so on, and you can have a different set of assignments for each program you use (Photoshop and Illustrator are somewhat different, after all). Through the Wacom utility you can also make other adjustments, such as deactivating the touch screen in Illustrator, so you don't have to worry about your hand smudging the digital canvas. Last but certainly not least is the included Wacom Pro Pen 2, which is your main tool for manipulating the touch screen. It features 8,192 levels of pressure sensitivity, as well as tilt and multitouch support. The back end can be used as an eraser, a concept inherently comfortable to most users, and the two slim buttons toward the tip can either be used for their default functions of left- and right-clicking, or be assigned different commands in the Wacom app. You can read our artist's impressions of using the pen below, but it's highly customizable, and its lack of battery removes a potentially irritating aspect of digital art. Like the Apple Pencil, which is designed to work with the Apple iPad Pro, the Pen 2 lets you make the most of the MobileStudio Pro. Full Windows Power As mentioned, the MobileStudio Pro 16 is a full Windows 10 tablet, not merely a drawing device that runs pared-down versions of creative software. That means it supports the same programs you're used to on a PC, and may also be used for browsing the web, checking your email, and doing anything else you can on manage on your laptop. The on-board SSD has a capacity of 512GB, which is a good amount for storing all different types of media projects and other files, though it could potentially fill up relatively quickly if you have a lot of raw photos or 4K video clips. In addition to Bluetooth 4.1, the MobileStudio features 802.11ac wireless, a 5-megapixel (MP) front camera, and an 8MP back camera equipped with Intel RealSense technology for capturing objects in 3D space. (You also get a 12-month license for using Artec Studio 11 Ultimate 3D scanning and processing software.) To reduce lag or delay while working in your favorite demanding Adobe program (and to generally run all Windows programs quickly), there's a 3.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i7-6567U processor and 16GB of memory. On the graphics side, there's a professional-class Nvidia Quadro M1000M discrete card. Other physical buttons and ports include a Power slider on the left flank alongside a headphone jack, volume buttons, and an SD card slot. The right edge holds three USB-C ports for charging with the included power brick and connecting peripherals (there are no USB Type-A ports, so you'll need adapters if they don't already use USB-C), as well as a Kensington security slot. Performance Because the MobileStudio Pro 16 is designed for a different purpose and audience than conventional Windows tablets or laptops, and because we haven't reviewed many directly comparable products, we didn't perform our typical full battery of performance tests. Still, to get an idea of how it stacks up to other tablets, we pitted it against the 2016 Microsoft Surface Book ($3,299 in our review configuration) in two of our basic performance tests. On PCMark 8 Work Conventional, the MobileStudio Pro 16's score of 2,637 was just a few steps behind the Surface Book's (2,735). And with its score of 368, the Wacom surpassed the Surface Book's 326 on the CineBench R15 rendering test. Given the systems' similar processors, these performance numbers were not surprising. In any case, you should have little trouble running any of the software you need to do your everyday design work. On our battery rundown test, the MobileStudio Pro 16 lasted 3 hours, 43 minutes. That's quite close to what we saw when we ran a similar test on the 12.9-inch Apple iPad Pro (3:51), but nowhere close to the Surface Book's 15:41. As with a gaming laptop, the MobileStudio Pro 16 is big enough that you won't likely use it very far away from a power outlet for long periods of time, whereas the Surface Book and similar tablets are designed specifically to travel with you. Wacom rates the MobileStudio Pro 16's battery life at about 6 hours, and under normal usage conditions, which doesn't seem out of the question, and when our designer tested the tablet (see the next section), he had no specific complaints about the battery life. Still, the MobileStudio Pro 16's battery life is not legendary, so keep that in mind while planning your day. An Artist's Perspective If you're interested in using the MobileStudio Pro 16 for its intended purpose of drawing, chances are its exact performance will matter less to you than how it functions in the real world of design. To learn how it fares in the hands of a genuine creative type, one of PCMag's in-house designers, James Jacobsen, tested the tablet for a couple of weeks and attempted to integrate it into his normal workflow. Here's his description of his experience. General comments. With the available screen real estate, the program interfaces feel clean, and for the most part the MobileStudio Pro 16 is fast and responsive. Using the pen quickly became second nature in my testing. Web searching by handwriting-to-text conversion was about 95 percent accurate, though that will vary depending on your penmanship. On the whole, the screen looks on par with, or maybe even better than, the display on my 15-inch MacBook Pro. And the shortcut buttons' placement is vastly superior here, as a keyboard often gets between you and the screen. Adobe Photoshop. One distinctive feature of the MobileStudio Pro 16 while using Photoshop is canvas rotation, so you can easily change your point of view on what you're drawing just by pinching and rotating the image on the screen. This is an interesting bonus that might be good for print designers, but as I primarily work on the web, I didn't find it all that helpful; most of my work is straight-on. But for those who do draw and sketch in Photoshop, this is a clear plus over competing tablets. The shortcut buttons are nice, but as I rely heavily on muscle memory, learning them was not easy. A week or two using the MobileStudio Pro wasn't enough to fully adjust to the system, and I often had to switch back to my MacBook to meet my deadlines. To see if it was just me, I handed the tablet off to one of my colleagues in the art department, who became frustrated and gave up after only 30 minutes. While I don't see the buttons as major negatives if you have the time to commit to them, it may take you a while if you've been using the same keyboard shortcuts for years. Adobe Illustrator. The first thing I noticed was a bit of lag when I opened a 460MB multilayered vector file. I sometimes experience some lag on my MacBook when opening this file if I have other programs running, but Illustrator was the only thing running on the MobileStudio at the time. All of my drawing and illustrating is done in Illustrator, so I was excited to use it to test the limits of the rotating canvas. To my dismay, however, it wasn't available. I searched for about half an hour, but found nothing that indicated it was a feature, which is confusing given its inclusion in Photoshop. (Others online mentioned noticing its absence as well.) This would be good functionality to add for Illustrator. Handling vectors and points with the pen was amazing, though. I felt like I had a lot more control moving and adjusting my vectors than I do with a mouse. Drawing felt natural and accurate, almost as if I was using pen and paper. If there's any single incentive to push through all the relearning the MobileStudio Pro 16 requires, it would be to do all my illustrations and artwork. Worth It, If You Can Commit Ultimately, the Wacom MobileStudio Pro 16 is best seen as a drawing tablet with an unusually rich set of capabilities. It can't really replace a full computer, but it gives you a lot of opportunities you don't get with other portable drawing devices or even the (far less expensive) Apple iPad Pro with the Apple Pencil. The ability the PC-grade components give you to run full-featured software is a big plus, as you don't have to worry about compromising on features. And the screen's spacious surface and high resolution are ideal for Illustrator and other drawing programs; you're unlikely to find a more enjoyable or intuitive way to use them. For the MobileStudio Pro 16 to be worth its high price, you have to know you need it, and be willing to invest the necessary time to master its unique features and commit to learning them inside and out. If not, you may be better off with a more traditional Wacom device or a tablet like the iPad Pro or the Microsoft Surface Book. But if you're a determined digital artist who can afford it (or have your employer provide it for you), the MobileStudio Pro 16 is a very appealing solution you will likely come to love.

Published on February 15, 2017. TBWA/Chiat/Day L.A. Chief Creative Officer Renato Fernandez Credit: TBWA Most Popular TBWA/Chiat/Day Los Angeles has named Renato Fernandez its new chief creative officer. Mr. Fernandez steps up from his former post of executive creative director at the agency's Los Angeles headquarters, filling the post vacated by Brent Anderson, who last fall became CCO of TBWA/Media Arts Lab. Mr. Fernandez joined the agency as an ACD in 2011 and has overseen TBWA's Gatorade work both in the States and globally. He first took charge of the U.S. account in 2014 but then in 2015 moved up to assume leadership of all global projects as worldwide creative director. Mr. Fernanadez's arrival comes at a major turning point for the Omnicom agency. Late last week, the holding company announced it was shifting Nissan, one of the agency's top three clients which it has overseen since 1987, to the East Coast to be closer to the client's headquarters in Nashville. The move will lead to a headcount reduction in L.A. In the meantime, he'll help to steer work for new clients such as Intel, whose B-to-B global account the shop won last fall. Related Stories Gatorade's Serena Williams Snapchat Ad-Game Scoring Well With Users How Omnicom Is Shaking Up Its Nissan Account TBWA/Media Arts Lab Names Brent Anderson Chief Creative Officer Notable work under his watch includes Gatorade's poignant goodbyes to retiring pros, including the Emmy-nominated "Made in New York" starring Derek Jeter, the "Dear Peyton" ode to Peyton Manning, and the gripping "Forget Me" starring Abby Wambach. He also oversaw hilarious "Sweat It to Get It" pranks starring JJ Watt and the Manning brothers, as well as Gatorade's in-app Snapchat video game that followed Serena Williams as she competed for her 23rd Grand Slam victory. His leadership last year helped the agency to see its most successful performance in Cannes in six years. "Renato is a master craftsman, and his ability to tell stories across multiple platforms and media is second to none," said TBWA/Chiat/Day Los Angeles Creative Chairman Stephen Butler in a statement. "He challenges himself to create impactful ideas while solving big problems." After starting in advertising in his hometown of Curitiba, Brazil, in 1994, Mr. Fernandez eventually moved to storied creative shop Almap BBDO, where he created work for brands including Volkswagen, Havaianas and Gatorade. He began his career in 1994, in his hometown of Curitiba.

A few troubling aspects of the futuristic device should give prospective buyers pause, though. The advertising may not live up to the device’s performance. To illustrate, watch a video highlighting the primary features of the A12: If you were to judge a book by its cover, the Yoga A12 looks like one of the best devices ever made. It boasts a razor thin profile of 11mm and 13 hours of battery life. On top of that, it offers superior build quality, incorporating magnesium and aluminum into its chassis. However, don’t let appearances fool you. The A12 won’t fit the needs of anyone interested in productivity. 1. Touch Keyboards (Halo Keyboard) Suck A touch keyboard dispenses with physical keys and relies on the same touch technology in a smartphone for registering key presses. To date, few manufacturers employ touch keyboard panels. Other than allowing for an impossibly slim profile, touch keyboards offer spill resistance, touchpad capabilities, and mechanical reliability. But that’s where the advantages end and the problem start. In brief, they suck at the one thing they promise to do: typing. Lauren Goode, of the Verge, reviewed a similar touch keyboard-equipped laptop: the Yoga Book. While one of the most impressive looking devices ever produced, the Yoga Book suffered from a truckload of shortcomings. Namely, its touch keyboard makes typing difficult. Lenovo Yoga Book- FHD 10.1" Android Tablet - 2 in 1 Tablet (Intel Atom x5-Z8550 Processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB SSD), Black, ZA0V0224US Lenovo Yoga Book- FHD 10.1" Android Tablet - 2 in 1 Tablet (Intel Atom x5-Z8550 Processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB SSD), Black, ZA0V0224US At just under 2 lbs, it's the world's thinnest and lightest 2-in-1 android tablet Buy Now At Amazon $475.71 But if you’re dying to try the underlying technology, check out the $500 Yoga Book. It may not offer the state-of-art in hardware, but it does double as a functional Wacom for designers. 2. It’s Actually a Downgraded Yoga Book The Yoga A12 offers similar specs to last year’s Yoga Book. Like the Yoga Book, the A12 features a 360-degree keyboard. Users can flip the keyboard back, turning the device into a tablet. We refer to these devices as 2-in-1 convertible laptops because they can transform from a laptop into a tablet. If you aren’t familiar with 2-in-1 devices (what’s a 2-in-1? What Are 2-In-1 Laptops and How to Pick the Best One? What Are 2-In-1 Laptops and How to Pick the Best One? 2-in-1 laptops combine the portability of tablets with the ergonomics of a laptop, but are they any good?

But instead of Android, the Flip uses ChromeOS What Is A Chromebook? [MakeUseOf Explains] What Is A Chromebook?

The biggest difference between the Yoga Book and the A12: its operating system. The A12 comes with Android, instead of Windows 10. And that can prove problematic for those interested in productivity. 3. Android Isn’t a Complete Desktop Operating System While the Yoga Book offers both Windows and Android, the Yoga A12 includes just Android. Unfortunately, that leaves out many Windows desktop applications. On top of that, Android’s user interface doesn’t scale properly on anything larger than a 5-inch smartphone. To Lenovo’s credit, they included the ability to run some apps in tablet mode. The result? You get a somewhat awkward-to-use, oversized Android tablet. For productivity, a superior alternative is the Windows 10-equipped Dell Inspiron 15 3000 (CA). It comes with double the RAM, 31-times the storage, and a far more powerful Intel Core i3 processor for $313. It does not include a touchscreen or a rotatable hinge, though. 2016 Newest Dell Inspiron i3558-5500BLK 15.6" Laptop (Core i3-5015U 2.1Ghz, 4GB Memory, 1TB Hard Drive, Windows 10, Black) 2016 Newest Dell Inspiron i3558-5500BLK 15.6" Laptop (Core i3-5015U 2.1Ghz, 4GB Memory, 1TB Hard Drive, Windows 10, Black) 15.6" display, typical 1366 x 768 HD resolution. Energy-efficient LED backlight. Buy Now At Amazon $298.30 4. It’s Probably Never Getting a System Update There are two reasons why the A12 won’t get a system update (or firmware update): first, Lenovo ranks near the bottom of manufacturers in how often it updates the software of its Android devices, and second, Intel discontinued future Atom processors for mobile, which means a probable end to device updates. Lenovo’s own Android firmware update table leaves out last year’s Yoga Book — meaning, it never received a firmware update. If Lenovo can’t even update a $500 product, it almost certainly isn’t going to update a $300 device. On top of that, the Atom processor suffers from compatibility issues with many Android games. Unless a game provides specific compatibility with x86 processors, there’s a good chance it won’t work. For those interested in running Android apps on a 2-in-1, look no further than a Chromebook. Because ChromeOS uses an emulation technique for running games, it suffers from almost none of the compatibility issues associated with x86 hardware on Android. A great example is the $280 Acer Chromebook 14 (CA), which employs an Atom-based Celeron N3160 processor. Acer Chromebook 14, Aluminum, 14-inch Full HD, Intel Celeron Quad-Core N3160, 4GB LPDDR3, 32GB, Chrome, CB3-431-C5FM Acer Chromebook 14, Aluminum, 14-inch Full HD, Intel Celeron Quad-Core N3160, 4GB LPDDR3, 32GB, Chrome, CB3-431-C5FM Intel Celeron N3160 Quad-Core Processor 1.6GHz (Up to 2.24GHz) Buy Now At Amazon $271.98 5. The Specifications Are Woefully Overpriced Perhaps the clearest indicators of its horribleness are the A12’s specifications. Take a quick look: Intel Atom x5 system-on-a-chip 12.2-inch 1200 x 800 touchscreen 2 GB of RAM 32 GB of storage Touch keyboard These specifications approximately equal the impulse-buy $100 laptops sold at Walmart. On the other hand, for slightly less money, you can pick up the $200 Chuwi Hi10 (CA). The Hi10 features double the storage and RAM, a Full High Definition (FHD) 1080p IPS display, and the ability to dual-boot Android and Windows 10. On top of that, the Hi10 includes a tablet-optimized version of Android, known as Remix OS. While the keyboard sells separately, all together, the cost comes out to less than the Yoga A12. The Chuwi keyboard costs around $57. CHUWI Hi10 Plus 10.8 inch Windows 10/Remix OS(Optimized Android) Dual Boot 2-in-1 Tablet PC,featuring 3:2 FHD IPS Screen,Intel X5 Processor,4GB RAM/64GB ROM,Docking Keyboard and Stylus Support CHUWI Hi10 Plus 10.8 inch Windows 10/Remix OS(Optimized Android) Dual Boot 2-in-1 Tablet PC,featuring 3:2 FHD IPS Screen,Intel X5 Processor,4GB RAM/64GB ROM,Docking Keyboard and Stylus Support Comes with Windows 10/Remix 2.0, free choice between dual boot.

Even so, you can find cheaper 11.5-inch (only an inch smaller) tablets for around $100. 6. Its Screen Won’t Impress Anyone If you prefer large screens, the A12 comes up short again. The 1200 x 800 resolution on a large 12.2-inch display won’t impress anyone in the $300 price range. You can find similar or larger screens for much less. For example, the $80 RCA 11.5-inch Galileo Pro offers comparable specifications but at $220 cheaper. If you love HD-resolution screens, you can find a much better deal in the $300 Acer Chromebook R11. The R11 offers a slightly better screen, along with overall superior specifications to the A12. Most important, it can also run Android apps on ChromeOS All New Chromebooks Will Run Android Apps All New Chromebooks Will Run Android Apps Any new Chromebooks launched in 2017 and beyond will ship with access to the Google Play Store included as standard without the need for an update.

It also injects ads into browsers. While Lenovo offers a tool for removing its malware, some manufacturers don’t include any unwanted software. For example, Olimex. For those concerned about security, Olimex announced a mostly open-source, build-it-yourself laptop for around $250. It offers substantially weaker specs than the A12, but with a better screen. Unfortunately, the laptop kit went out of stock immediately after its announcement — but a restock should be imminent. Who Should Buy a Lenovo Yoga A12? No one should purchase a Yoga A12. The A12 is best seen as an aesthetic triumph and perhaps a portent of things to come. Unfortunately, its design won’t accommodate the vast majority of users’ needs. On top of that, even at $300, the price falls dramatically short of its competition. In 2017, $300 buys a lot of machine. The A12 offers little in the way of specifications, value, and functionality. Had it included ChromeOS instead of Android, it might have been salvageable — but as it stands, you are likely to find a better device by throwing a dart inside a used electronics store, blindfolded, and heavily medicated.

If you hate Android and Lenovo, it probably doesn't make much sense for you to write an article featuring both brands in the same machine. Reply Kannon February 16, 2017 at 8:44 am Right now one of the best desktop operating systems around is Remix OS, which is based on Android. It's great because it combines Android with a desktop user-interface. While the version of Android used on A12 includes a degree of tablet optimization, it's by no means fully tablet optimized. What I'm saying is that there are better Android devices out there. I'd recommend the Chuwi Hi10. It has Remix OS AND Windows in a dual boot configuration for less money.

 Among the various planned activities, RIFT.io will feature real-world use case demonstrations that show how mobile operators can accelerate their transformation to virtualized network services through network functions virtualization (NFV). RIFT.io has been on the forefront of helping mobile operators and other service providers achieve this transformation in two significant ways. First, RIFT.io is a founding member and a major contributor of seed code to the ETSI Open Source MANO (OSM) project that was introduced at Mobile World Congress in 2016. RIFT.io is also the first company to ship a commercial distribution of OSM (Release ONE code). Second, RIFT.io continues to innovate on the RIFT.ware platform, which is the industry's only solution for orchestrating and automating multi-vendor network services that is backed by a robust open source community. To showcase progress in these areas, RIFT.io will feature seven solution demonstrations of the RIFT.ware and OSM platforms in concert with partner solutions and technologies. The descriptions of the planned demos are as follows:

We round up all of the rumours about a new MacBook Air in 2017, including its likely UK release date and tech specs, as well as rumoured new features. Here's everything you need to know about the new MacBook Air in 2017 by Ashleigh Macro | 15 Feb 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents UK release date Will the MacBook Air be discontinued? When was the MacBook Air last updated? Price Dimensions  Specs & new features When will Apple release a new MacBook Air in 2017? What tech specs and new features will the new MacBook Air get? Is the 'Air' brand being killed off? Will the new MacBook Air get a Retina display at last? Apple did technically update the MacBook Air in 2016, but it was a minor and frankly disappointing update - merely including what had been an optional RAM upgrade in the standard package for the 13in model, and not touching the 11in model at all. Will 2017 see a proper update to the MacBook Air lineup? Or will the MacBook Air be killed off for good? In this article, we round up all the rumours, hints and clues about the new MacBook Air release for 2017, including the new MacBook Air's UK release date, tech specs, new features, design, along with speculation that Apple may be phasing out the 'Air' lineup completely. Read next: Best MacBook buying guide | Best Mac buying guide 2017 | Best cheap MacBook deals Last updated to include rumours that Apple is manufacturing more of its own chips for use in Mac laptops New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: UK release date Back in March 2016, MacBook Air fans were eagerly awaiting an update to their favourite laptop at Apple's special event; after all, the spring event represented one year since it was last updated. But instead, Apple used the event to show off the iPhone SE and the iPad Pro with 9.7in screen. We had to wait until 19 April for Apple to release new MacBooks and the updated MacBook Air. But the MacBook Air update was underwhelming, to say the least. While the MacBook got a power boost and a new Rose Gold colour option, the MacBook Air simply got a new 8GB onboard memory standard, and that was for the 13in model only. So when will we get a proper update to the MacBook Air line-up? If the lineup isn't getting the chop, we assume that Apple will stick to its yearly upgrade cycle and should release the new MacBook Air at some point in early 2017, possibly between March and May as has been the case in previous years. But it does seem likely that the MacBook Air line is being quietly wound down. See also: New MacBook Pro release | New MacBook release | New iMac release | New Mac Pro release | New Mac mini release New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Will the MacBook Air be discontinued? After the March event and its derisory MacBook Air update, and the subsequent Apple event that took place on 27 October 2016, it's unclear if the MacBook Air line will ever be updated again. No new MacBook Air was announced in October and the new MacBook Pro 2016 was compared in size, performance and weight to the MacBook Air. The new MacBook Pro is smaller in dimensions and is also thinner than the existing MacBook Air, which was launched with portability in mind. It should also be noted that the 11in MacBook Air has now been discontinued, with the 13in variant receiving a £100 price bump - taking the basic model from £849 up to £949 and the 256GB model up from £999 to £1,099. (This price increase is most likely due to Brexit.) Some have taken this as gentle way of bringing the Air product line to a close, as not many people will want a costly Air with more powerful, and thinner, Mac laptops available. Following the October 2016 Mac event, there are strong suggestions that the MacBook Air line will be completely discontinued. This does mean that the entry-level MacBooks are now a little more appealing, but does mean that an 11in MacBook Air will now be missed by some who were hoping for it to be replaced by a similar variant - we presume Apple didn't see a huge market for 11in laptops and thus decided to axe the product line. However, the 11in model may not be the only MacBook Air to be discontinued. We suspect that Apple is about to discontinue the MacBook Air line altogether. Tech Blogger Jack March claims to have spoken with a source close to the situation who says that Apple is about to ditch the Air brand completely, including the MacBook Air and iPad Air products in its lineup. Right now, we think Jack could be absolutely right. There are rumours that Apple won't release an iPad Air 3 now that the iPad Pro has a 9.7in option, and the MacBook Air doesn't seem to fit naturally in Apple's line-up now that the new MacBook is here and is thinner and lighter than ever. With the advent of the 12in MacBook and the 12.9in iPad Pro, it's no surprise that rumourmongers are starting to predict that at least the 11in MacBook Air, with a smaller screen than either of those devices, will be discontinued. The iPad Pro may indeed be viewed by Apple as a replacement for the 11in MacBook Air if Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments to the Telegraph are taken into account (published on 1 December 2015). Following the launch of the iPad Pro, Cook told the Telegraph: "I think if you're looking at a PC, why would you buy a PC anymore? No really, why would you buy one? "Yes, the iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop for many, many people. They will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else, other than their phones." However, should Apple discontinue the 11in MacBook Air, it does remove the lower price of entry from the line-up. But as mentioned, it may not just be the 11in MacBook Air that is discontinued. When the new MacBook launched on 9 March 2015, analysts began to suggest that the MacBook Air might not be around for much longer. "This wasn't the MacBook Air, but instead leapt past the Air," said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research. "They kept the MacBook Air around just as they do with older iPhones, but the MacBook is now in the same position as the newest iPhone. That makes me wonder if the Air will go away over time." Carolina Milanesi, chief of research and head of US business for Kantar WorldPanel Comtech, also predicted a contraction of Apple's line-up. "All [notebooks] need to be more mobile, so something like the Air doesn't need to be branched out anymore," she said of the differentiation Apple made for the line since its introduction more than eight years ago. "And it's to Apple's benefit not to have so many 'families' of Macs." More recently, KGI Securities analyst and Apple guru Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that Apple is planning on launching a 13in MacBook to sit alongside the 12in MacBook, which would serve as a replacement to the MacBook Air going forward. In a note obtained by AppleInsider, the analyst foresees an end to the meaningful development of the MacBook Air. Apple won't remove the line from its stores just yet, though - it'll serve as an entry-level device for Apple adopters, much like it did with the original MacBook before it was discontinued in 2011. Over time, it seems likely that the MacBook Air range could be discontinued and eventually replaced by a Retina MacBook range at a lower price. In January 2017, DigiTimes cited Chinese site Economic Daily News and said Apple is going to drop the price of the non-Touch Bar 13in MacBook Pro and discontinue the MacBook Air, which only exists now in the 13in size. It added: "Apple is expected to unveil a new 12-inch MacBook in early second quarter with an additional memory option of 16GB" - this would all but render the Air unnecessary to Apple, even if consumers might lament the absence of its lower price point. We don't expect the 12in MacBook to drop in price. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: When was the MacBook Air last updated? We originally expected the MacBook Air to be updated with a Retina display back on 9 March 2015 at Apple's Spring Forward event. And were quite surprised when we got something else: a Retina MacBook, yes, but one with a 12in display and a USB-C port (and very few other ports), a new strand of products for Apple's MacBook laptop line-up. Less glamorously, Apple's MacBook Air did get an update at the same time, with new, faster processors, faster flash storage and better graphics, and was updated more recently in April 2016 with increased RAM, but the screen and overall design remained the same, with no Retina display for the Air line. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Price The last time that there was a Mac laptop that had more advanced specs than a more expensive model was the old MacBooks (aluminium, then white and black, and then eventually aluminium again). These older MacBook models were eventually discontinued and the price of the MacBook Air was reduced to make it the new entry level (when the MacBook Air initially launched it was quite overpriced for the specs, just like the current Retina MacBook). It seems likely that the same will happen with the new MacBook models eventually replacing the MacBook Airs, at a lower price, but for now that seems a long way off. The 11in MacBook Air started at £749, while the entry-level 13in model was £849 - this has now changed with the 11in axed - making the new 13in model, with a £100 price hike start at £949. If the 11in MacBook Air is removed from the line-up perhaps the cost of entry of the 13in model will reduce to the level that the 11in model is currently, with a rumoured 15in model coming in at a higher price at some point in the future. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Dimensions  If Apple does update the MacBook Air range, what dimensions should we expect? As mentioned above, rumours suggest that the 11in MacBook Air will be discontinued, after all, the 11in MacBook Air is both smaller than the MacBook and the new iPad Pro, and didn’t receive an update when the 13in model did. However, 9to5Mac points out that the new 13in and 15in MacBook Air models could be additional sizes to the MacBook range. That site predicts that sometime in 2017 we will have just two ranges of Mac laptops: the MacBook at the ultraportable level, and the more advanced MacBook Pro. Maybe the 17in MacBook Pro will make a comeback too, with a 4K display. New MacBook Air 2017 release date rumours: Specs & new features These new MacBook Air models are said to be thinner and lighter, with internal spec enhancements. Apparently, the new MacBook Air will feature new batteries, cooling modules, and chassis, according to the Economic Daily News. We also expect to see USB Type-C across the range, especially now that Intel has integrated Thunderbolt 3 into USB-C - more on that below. Processors The next-generation MacBook Air is likely to feature next-generation Intel processors, as well as graphics and RAM upgrades. Intel has started shipping its Kaby Lake processors - that's the generation of chips after Skylake, and offers support for Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2. But here's a leftfield alternative. The Dutch-language site Techtastic has posted a reference in the kernel of macOS Sierra to "ARM HURRICANE", a chip family that is now supported. This isn't a chip that anyone has heard of, but it would make sense for this to be an Apple custom ARM chip, fitting in as it does with the company's previous naming conventions: the A7 (in the iPhone 5s) was codenamed Cyclone, the A8 Typhoon and the A9 Twister. Those are iPad/iPhone chips, of course, so does this mean Apple is going to let iDevices run macOS Sierra? Certainly not - but it might be about to put ARM chips in the MacBook Air. Image courtesy of Techtastic Update 08/02/2017: It's not just the CPU that's getting an upgrade either, as a recent Bloomberg report claims that Apple is working on a processor that's meant to improve the battery life of its laptop range. According to the report, the chip is said to handle basic tasks like checking for email and installing updates while the computer is asleep. Apple's current way of working relies on the MacBook's main processor to handle the tasks, but by implementing a dedicated low-power processor, Apple can further reduce battery consumption and provide a longer battery life.   Those with knowledge of the subject claim that the chip is similar to that used by Apple in the MacBook Pro to manage the Touch Bar, and that the new chip may make an appearance in the 2017 MacBook Pro, along with other laptops. It makes sense, as Apple's 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar has been criticised since launch for its poor battery life. New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: E-ink keyboard Rumours are rife concerning Apple's 2016 MacBook Pro and, more specifically, its OLED touch bar. The OLED touch bar is rumoured to provide contextual shortcuts to the user based on the application that they're using at the time - but the most recent report suggests Apple isn't happy enough with the feature. 9to5Mac and TrustedReviews report that Apple has been in talks to use a laptop variant of Sonder Design's dynamic keyboard technology. Sonder Design is famous for developing an E-ink keyboard, using E-ink to change the key labels on the fly. This means that the entire keyboard is customisable, providing multiple languages as well as contextual shortcuts from a single keyboard. It allows users that are, for example, editing in Final Cut Pro to look down at the keyboard and see exactly which tool they need to use without having to memorise them before hand. What isn't clear is how Apple is planning on implementing the software, or which laptop it could be featured on, leading us to believe that it could possibly make an appearance on the 2017 MacBook Air. Sonder has confirmed that talks between Apple and the company has taken place, although it won't comment on whether or not it's a deal - it has only confirmed that it's "closing B2B procurement contracts" with three laptop makers. New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Retina display When Apple updated its MacBook Air in March of 2015, we had been convinced that the company was about to give the laptop a Retina display. Instead, it launched a brand-new MacBook line that's super-thin, super-light and does offer that high-resolution display, but does that mean Apple won't enhance the MacBook Air with a Retina display in the future? With the 2016 update only adding more RAM to the basic 13in model, it may be the case. The suggestion that the MacBook Air will feature a Retina display has been long running but those rumours were prior to the launch of the 12in Retina MacBook and the iPad Pro - suggesting the sightings of the Retina display some thought was destined for the MacBook Air was instead for these models. Does this mean that there will be no Retina display on the new MacBook Air when (or if) it launches? If Apple wants to keep the price down maybe not. Or perhaps the newly rumoured 15in Macbook Air will feature a Retina display, while the 13in model will lack the high-res display, but come in at a lower price, one similar to the older 11in MacBook Air. Read more: What is a Retina display? New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: MacBook Air to feature USB-C port While we assumed the next MacBook Air would feature USB-C ports, a recent report from Taiwanese website DigiTimes seems to confirm our theory - if believed, anyway. The publication claims that Apple is planning to release a MacBook Air with USB-C ports in future, but doesn't provide a launch timeframe for the upgraded laptop.  "Currently, Apple has decided to adopt the USB Type-C interface for its MacBook Air, while Asustek Computer and Hewlett-Packard (HP) are upgrading one of their notebooks' regular USB port to the Type-C. Lenovo, Acer and Dell are still evaluating the option." The issue with DigiTimes is that it isn't always accurate - the site has previously claimed that Apple would start shipping ultra-thin 13in and 15in MacBooks by the end of Q2 2016, which ended in June with no appearance, although the site's sources have proven reliable at times in the past. So, how accurate is this report? We're not 100 percent sure, but we imagine that if Apple wants to keep the MacBook Air alive, this is the road it'll be headed down.  However, Bloomberg reported in August 2016, one week before the reported iPhone 7 launch, that Apple is preparing a MacBook Air update "as soon as October". This might mean that the MacBooks are announced at the 7 September event, but won't ship until the following month. This seems a logical step; the MacBook has just one USB-C port and the rumoured new MacBook Pro will also feature this connection type. It would still represent a bold move overall for Apple however - it'd mean all of its laptops would no longer support standard USB-A connections, a move sure to annoy a few people, but ultimately shape the future of mobile computing.  New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Apple Pencil-enabled Trackpad While this isn't a new patent (it was originally filed back in 2014), a patent application has recently been granted that allows the Apple Pencil to work with Mac trackpads. What is most interesting about the patent is that it depicts a more sophisticated Apple Pencil than the one currently available, suggesting that the accessory is due to get an overhaul at some point in the future. It even goes as far to describe the Pencil being used as a general input device like a joystick or an 'air mouse'. "Inertial sensor input may be gathered when operating the stylus in one or more inertial sensor input modes such as an air mouse mode, a rotational controller mode, a joystick mode, and/or other inertial sensor input modes." What isn't clear is if the upgraded Apple Pencil will only work with certain trackpads - if this is the case, we imagine that the technology would make its way to the next-gen MacBook Air. However, Apple has a habit of applying for a patent and then doing nothing with it, so it isn't set in stone that we'll be seeing this featured on the next MacBook Air - but we can sure hope.  New MacBook Air 2017 rumours: Touch ID and Force Touch We expect this feature to come on the Air model - if it isn't already discontinued!  There are also reports to suggest that it'll boast Touch ID within its Trackpad, which may also get the Force Touch upgrade that was given to the 13in MacBook Pro back in March 2015, and comes with the new MacBook. Touch ID is the fingerprint sensor that's built into the Home button of the iPhone 5S, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. It's also used to make Apple Pay more secure and with the recent announcement of Apple Pay coming to Mac as part of macOS Sierra, this rumour makes a lot of sense. According to an Independent report, Touch ID for the Mac line would require a dedicated chip to be built into the device. The rumour started with Taiwanese blog AppleCorner, which cited sources in the supply chain. Apparently, the Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad may get a biometric update too, enabling users to make Apple Pay payments on the web, but both those accessories were updated alongside the launch of a new 4K iMac so that seems unlikely to happen anytime soon.  We'll be updating this article as more information about the rumoured Retina MacBook Air emerges so check back from time to time for the latest news.

(Feb. 15) AP President Trump shakes hands with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a news conference in the East Room of the White House, Wednesday. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) 9852 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 92 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON — President Trump hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House Wednesday for a series of meetings intended to "show there is no daylight" between the two leaders on a range of issues. And that includes the so-called "two-state solution" that has been a hallmark of U.S. policy in the Middle East — and a source of friction between the Netanyahu government and Trump's predecessor, President Barack Obama. Trump professed to be agnostic on the policy. "So I'm looking at two-state or the one-state," Trump said. "I was thinking for a while that the two-state was looking like the easier of the two." He concluded that the matter is up to Israel and Palestine to decide. "I'm happy with the one they like best," he said. The one-state solution would include Israelis and Palestinians in a single, secular country with equal citizenship. The two-state solution calls for a negotiated settlement leading to a Palestinian nation alongside Israel, and it was the U.S. policy under both the Bush and Obama administrations. But with Trump stepping back, Netanyahu reasserted his position that a two-state solution can only happen under two conditions: The new Palestinian state must recognize Israel's legitimacy, and Israel must maintain security control of the West Bank. And he suggested that the very "two-state" label was a hindrance to progress."Rather than deal with labels, I'd like to deal with substance," Netanyahu said. Trump and Netanyahu appeared to have an easy chemistry, even bantering among themselves during the press conference. "Bibi and I have known each other a long time — a smart man, great negotiator. And I think we're going to make a deal. It might be a bigger and better deal than people in this room even understand. That's a possibility. So let’s see what we do," Trump said. "Let’s try it," Netanyahu interjected. "Doesn't sound too optimistic, but he’s a good negotiator," Trump said. "That's the Art of the Deal," replied the prime minister. To underscore the close relationship, first lady Melania Trump made a rare appearance in the East Room of the White House Wednesday, and Netanyahu pointed out Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, who Trump has appointed as his deal-maker on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. But even as the two leaders made a public showing of solidarity, the Trump White House has been slow to distance itself from the policies of his predecessors in a number of areas, including: ► The location of the U.S. Embassy. A 1995 law requires the president to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but every president since has invoked a national security waiver to block the move. Trump has signaled that he wants to end that policy, but has moved cautiously in his first weeks. "I'd love to see that happen. We're looking at it very, very strongly. We’re looking at it with great care," Trump said. "Great care, believe me, and we'll see what happens." ► The Iran nuclear deal. During the campaign, Trump threatened to "rip up" the agreement negotiated by the Obama administration and five other global powers with Iran to scale down its nuclear program. But even as the Trump administration has leveled new sanctions for Iran's missile tests, Trump has not made any moves to break the Obama-era agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. On Wednesday, Trump called the deal "one of the worst deals I've ever seen." "I will do more to prevent Iran from ever developing, I mean ever, a nuclear weapon," he said. ► Israeli settlements. In an unexpected change in tone this month, the White House responded to continued Israeli settlements in the West Bank with a statement saying those settlements "may not be helpful" in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. "I'd like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit. We'll work something out, but I would like to see a deal be made," Trump told Netanyahu. Netanyahu downplayed the significance of the issue, but pledged to work with Trump "so we don’t keep on bumping into each other all the time." The two leaders also discussed counter-terrorism operations in the region. Trump has made defeating the terrorist group in Syria and Iraq the overarching goal of his foreign policy — to the extent that he's been willing to rethink the role of old rivalries and alliances. As the closest U.S. ally in the region, Trump will seek to coordinate anti-terrorism strategy with Israel, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday. "They will discuss ways to advance and strengthen the special relationship between our two countries and stability in the Middle East," he said. A Middle East peace agreement has eluded U.S. presidents for generations, but Trump — who lacks diplomatic experience but built a real estate empire — has said he thinks he can broker "the ultimate deal" where predecessors have failed. "I think a deal will be made. I know that every president would like to. Most of them have not started until late because they never thought it was possible. And it wasn’t possible because they didn't do it," he said.

Obama was particularly concerned about Israeli settlements, prompting him to tell Jewish leaders that there needed to be "daylight" between U.S. and Israel if he was going to successfully negotiate a peace deal with the Palestinians. Netanyahu's visit to the Trump White House came at a time of turmoil. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn resigned Monday after Trump and others believed that he misled them about a phone conversation he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Flynn had been a key player in the Trump administration's early overtures to Netanyahu's government. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported this month that Flynn's Israeli counterpart and the chief of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service, made secret visits to Washington during the transition to meet with Flynn. But the Flynn resignation re-opened questions about the relationship between Trump and aides and the Russians, the subject of investigation by the FBI and congressional committees. Netanyahu's visit makes him the fourth foreign leader to pay a call on Trump's White House, following British Prime Minister Theresa May, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, in addition to dozens of phone calls Trump has made to world leaders in his first month. Trump has not spoken to officials with the Palestinian Authority. FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn President Trump: A new era in Washington begins  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

(Feb. 15) AP Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer meets with reporters on Capitol Hill on Feb. 14, 2017. (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP) 945 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 111 COMMENTEMAILMORE Democrats in Congress raced to every open microphone Wednesday to demand a broad and independent investigation of Russian ties to Donald Trump's presidential campaign and the president's handling of information about his subordinates' contacts with Russia. Democratic leaders said National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's resignation over his pre-inauguration telephone calls with the Russian ambassador and news reports indicating additional contacts between Trump's camp and Russian intelligence agents have raised a spate of new questions requiring an independent probe. "Every White House press briefing and early morning tweet seemingly introduces new inconsistencies and contradictions that demand a full accounting," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on the Senate floor Wednesday. "Every report that suggests deeper ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government needs to be followed up on and verified." Read more: White House under siege over probe into Russian contacts with Trump campaign Plenty of unanswered questions about Michael Flynn's contacts with Russia Donald Trump's ties to Russia go back 30 years Senate Democrats convened an "emergency" meeting of their caucus on Wednesday to discuss their strategy for advancing investigations. Immediately following that meeting, Schumer said Democrats had agreed on three principles to guide investigations: Attorney General Jeff Sessions must recuse himself from any investigations by the FBI and federal prosecutors because of his previous role as a national security adviser to the Trump campaign. All emails and other records relevant to the investigations must be preserved from the Trump campaign, the transition team and the administration. Campaign and transition officials, including Flynn and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, must be available to testify — publicly and under oath — before congressional committees conducting investigations. Manafort resigned from the Trump campaign last August amid controversy over his lobbying work for pro-Russian Ukrainian oligarchs. "I've been in Congress for a long time; I've never seen anything like this," Schumer told reporters. "These reports and revelations should not pit the two parties against one another. They should unite the parties in pursuit of the full truth. We are Americans before we are Democrats or Republicans. Nothing less than our system of checks and balances, democratic institutions, the rule of law and our national security is at stake." A group of 11 Democratic senators, led by Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, called for the appointment of an independent special counsel to investigate Flynn's contacts with Russia. "An independent investigation is now necessary to determine what General Flynn did, who knew about it, and when," the senators wrote in a Wednesday letter to Sessions. "To maintain the confidence, credibility and impartiality of the Department of Justice, we urge you to immediately appoint an independent Special Counsel to investigate collusion with the Russian government by General Flynn and other Trump campaign, transition, and Administrative officials."

Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., speaks with reporters on Feb. 8, 2017.  (Photo: Michael Reynolds, European Pressphoto Agency) In a rare bipartisan approach to the issue, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the senior Democrat on the panel, wrote a joint letter to Sessions and to FBI Director James Comey on Wednesday requesting a Justice Department briefing and documents about the events that led to Flynn's resignation. Specifically, the two senators are seeking details of Flynn’s reported communications with Russian officials, the Justice Department’s response, and potential leaks of classified material. They asked for a briefing for committee members during the week of Feb. 27. "We request that individuals with specific knowledge of these issues from both the FBI and Justice Department brief committee members and staff," the senators wrote. "We similarly request copies of the transcripts of Mr. Flynn's intercepted calls and the FBI report summarizing the intercepted calls referenced in the media. We anticipate that some of these documents may be classified, some may not, and others may contain both classified and unclassified information." Feinstein said she is satisfied — for now — that the investigation can be handled by the Judiciary and Intelligence committees. “I think we just need to move forward very aggressively," she said. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., a member of the Intelligence Committee, said he supports any and all investigations into the matter. The Intelligence Committee is "thick and heavy" into its own investigation, he said, and he hopes the panel will call Flynn, Manafort and others to testify in public sessions if possible. "Let’s bring them all in,” Manchin said. “We’re very much concerned about being as public as we can up to the secure level." Manchin said the panel's chairman, Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., is on board with conducting the probe "in the most open light that we can."

A look at the key players Most Republicans on Tuesday said they supported investigating Flynn's contacts with Russia, but they suggested it could be handled by the House and Senate intelligence committees, which are already probing Russian attempts to interfere in the election last year. But Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told ABC News on Wednesday, “If there are contacts between Trump officials and Russian intelligence operatives during the campaign, we need a joint select committee in Congress to get to the bottom of it and also look at Trump's business ties to Russia — if it is true.” Graham said there should be a preliminary investigation first to make sure there is credibility to the allegations of repeated contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence operatives. If they are credible, Graham said, a joint select committee would be the best way to investigate. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Congress needed to find “a non-hysterical but sobering way” to get to the bottom of the allegations. He said the constant “dribble” of damaging news about Trump and Russia was interfering with Congress’ ability to focus on urgent policy matters. “It’s obviously disruptive to governing,” Corker said. “We need to figure out way to better handle this and I don’t know what the answer is.” Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn. arrives on Capitol Hill on Feb. 9, 2017, for the committee's hearing about the future of U.S. relations with Russia.  (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP) He said the Senate Intelligence Committee probe might be the best way for that to happen and expressed concern that an independent probe would simply drag the process out. “The last independent probe was a 2 ½ year process,” Corker said, referring to the commission created to probe the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. “I’m not sure that’s what the American people would sign up for." Intelligence agencies announced last year that Russia was behind the hacking of Democratic Party email accounts in an attempt to undermine the presidential election. Top House Democrats sent a letter Wednesday to White House Counsel Donald McGahn asking a series of questions about his office's review of Flynn's contacts with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. The White House has indicated that Trump was alerted several weeks ago that Flynn had not accurately described the content of those calls, yet Flynn continued to serve while the counsel's office reviewed whether he had broken any laws by discussing U.S. sanctions with Kislyak. The House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday adopted a non-binding list of oversight activities for the year, saying the committee will “continue to conduct oversight into allegations of misconduct” by executive branch officials – including any evidence that classified material had been leaked. The Republican majority on the committee rejected Democratic efforts to specifically promise an investigation of Flynn, but did agree that the committee can investigate any allegations of “improper interference” with American institutions or elections. In a press conference Wednesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump said Flynn was "a wonderful man" who had been mistreated by "criminal" leaks from intelligence agencies.

 FACT CHECK: Trump is taking credit for immigration and job creation initiatives that happened before he took office Alicia A. Caldwell and Josh Boak, Associated Press Feb. 14, 2017, 11:44 AM 8,383 facebook linkedin twitter email print President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with parents and teachers, Tuesday, Feb. 14, 2017, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington. Associated Press/Evan Vucci WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is patting himself on the back for immigration and job-creation initiatives that started before he took office. A look at his statements during a news conference Monday with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau: TRUMP: "We're actually taking people that are criminals, very, very, hardened criminals in some cases ... with a tremendous track record of abuse and problems, and we're getting them out and that's what I said I would do ... And I said at the beginning, we are going to get the bad ones, the really bad ones, we're getting them out and that's exactly what we're doing." THE FACTS: Officials said an operation last week that resulted in the arrest of more than 680 immigrants in various cities was a routine enforcement action like those undertaken during the administration of Barack Obama, who deported an unprecedented number of people as president. More specifically, David Marin, Immigration and Customs Enforcement's field office director for enforcement and removal operations in greater Los Angeles, said the agency carries out such large-scale operations two or three times a year in his region. The California operation was in the planning stages "before the administration came out with their current executive orders," he said. More than 100 of the arrests were in the Los Angeles area. In this Tuesday, Feb. 7, 2017, photo released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, foreign nationals are arrested during a targeted enforcement operation conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) aimed at immigration fugitives, re-entrants and at-large criminal aliens in Los Angeles. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement via Associated Press The notion that raids have been stepped up under Trump has been advanced both by the White House, to show that Trump is keeping a promise, and by advocates of those who have been targeted, to illustrate what they call the new president's heavy-handed tactics. But statistical evidence has not come in to show that enforcement has surged under the new Trump administration or that actual deportations are up. A similar series of raids under Obama in March 2015 resulted in the arrest of more than 2,000 criminals, the government said at the time. After the latest raids, immigration officials put out a statement saying a "rash of recent reports about purported ICE checkpoints and random sweeps are false, dangerous and irresponsible." And Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said: "ICE conducts these kind of targeted enforcement operations regularly and has for many years. The focus of these enforcement operations is consistent with the routine, targeted arrests carried out by ICE's Fugitive Operations teams on a daily basis." Trump's promise of a secure border was central to his campaign and he signed an executive order in his first week as president aimed at making dangerous people a priority for deportation. It's too early to know if that is working. ___ President Donald Trump looks at Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, holding a silicon wafer, during their meeting in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Feb. 8, 2017. Associated Press/Pablo Martinez Monsivais TRUMP: "You probably have noticed that Ford is making billions of dollars of new investments in this country. You saw Intel, the other day, announce that because of what I've been doing and what I'm doing in terms of regulation, lowering taxes, et cetera, they're coming in with billions and billions of dollars of investment and thousands and thousands of jobs. General Motors, likewise, is expanding plants and going to build new plants. Fiat Chrysler was at a meeting where they're doing the same." THE FACTS: Trump is taking credit for corporate decisions that largely predate his presidential win, making it unlikely that his administration is the sole reason for the expected hiring. Several job announcements have come after companies, such as the wireless carrier Sprint, reduced their total number of employees. In the case of Intel, construction of the Chandler, Arizona, factory referred to by Trump actually began during Barack Obama's presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel's high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he made his announcement about the Arizona investment at the White House in support of the president's tax and regulatory policies, perhaps giving Trump an invitation to brag, which he quickly seized. But those policies have yet to be detailed publicly, much less enacted. The best jobs measure for Trump's administration will probably be the monthly employment reports from the Labor Department. They provide the unemployment rate and the total number of net jobs added or lost during each month. ___ Find all AP Fact Checks here: http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd ___ Associated Press writers Calvin Woodward and Jim Drinkard contributed to this report.

Jorge Aristóteles Sandoval Díaz Sandoval is visiting Silicon Valley next week to woo tech companies to bring jobs to Mexico. (Photo: Jalisco government, for USA TODAY) 14440 CONNECTTWEET 62 LINKEDIN 17 COMMENTEMAILMORE SAN FRANCISCO — The governor of Mexico's state of Jalisco is visiting more than 40 U.S. tech companies with the message that it's a great place for high tech, the latest cross-border recruitment effort to respond to U.S. immigration policy. Jalisco Gov. Jorge Aristóteles Sandoval Díaz will meet with California Gov. Jerry Brown, 13 large tech companies including Facebook and Google, and 30 startups beginning this week in California. It's an annual trip for officials from Jalisco, birthplace of tequila, synonymous with hot sauce, and sometimes called Mexico's Silicon Valley for its already thriving tech scene. This year, the trip has an added purpose: to talk to Brown about a bi-lateral agenda to support Mexican citizens to remain in the U.S. And, Sandoval will promote capital city Guadalajara and the rest of Jalisco as a friendly environment for skilled workers that may have trouble getting hired by U.S. tech firms if the Trump administration passes more restrictions on H-1B visas, as a draft order indicated. "We want tech companies to know there is a huge opportunity in Jalisco for them to grow," Sandoval, who has created a cabinet-level Innovation Department, told USA TODAY in a phone interview Tuesday. "Jalisco has many advantages" — a close time zone to Silicon Valley, talent, strong university system, government support and infrastructure, Sandoval said. The Trump administration's policies, in particular the possibility of an executive order that could curtail H-1B work visas, also work in Jalisco's favor, he said. The pitch is hardly a slam-dunk. Some tech companies remain reluctant to expand in Mexico, with a threatened 35% tariff from Trump on goods made there looming as large as his much-heralded wall. (Trump floated the idea of a 20% tax on Mexican imports to pay for the wall, though White House spokesman Sean Spicer said it was one of several proposals.) There are also lingering questions about Jalisco's overall tech talent, poor broadband access in some areas and costs related to opening operations offshore. Nonetheless, Sandoval's push to raise awareness about Jalisco comes at a time when the U.S.'s northern neighbor, Canada, is also attempting to recruit tech workers as the U.S. halts entries of immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim nations and threatens to further limit H-1Bs, which offer a pipeline of talent from abroad. Canadian venture firms and companies are enticing U.S. start-ups with funding, sparkling new work spaces, broadband access and a relatively affordable cost of living. Jalisco's pitch is similar. The state  on the western coast of central Mexico has blossomed into a thriving tech hub worth $21 billion. Guadalajara or coastal Puerto Vallarta are home to manufacturing, design and research-and-development operations for Intel, Hewlett Packard and Oracle, among others. Oracle and Intel house innovation centers in Guadalajara, and a 940-acre media-business center is under construction. Wizeline CEO Bismarck Lepe is big fan of Guadalajara as a tech hub.  (Photo: Wizeline, for USA TODAY) Technology goods represent about 55% of Jalisco's exports, and account for 25,000 jobs in the state. Nearly a third of Mexico's tech business comes from Jalisco, according to a spokesman for Sandoval. "The Jalisco government is 100% focused on technology," says Bismarck Lepe, CEO of San Francisco-based tech services firm Wizeline. "It's an ideal region for intellectual property, and not cheap manufacturing." Lepe has deep ties to Mexico. His parents are from there, but left for the U.S. for a better economic opportunity. Lepe, who studied at Stanford University and worked at Google, decided to return in 2010 after a third-party analysis determined Guadalajara was fertile ground for tech talent. Half of Wizeline's 270 employees are in Guadalajara, most of them engineers. DROPBOX mensaje Gobernador Silicon_v2 subt.mp4 Canada seizes chance to skim talent from disaffected U.S. tech companies "We want to make Guadalajara a tech hub for the world — from multinational companies to mid-tiers and start-ups," says Cindy Blanco, general director of StartupGDL, a nonprofit organization that champions the region. Guadalajara has lured entrepreneurs with a pool of tech talent fed by the university system, a comparable time zone (Central) to Silicon Valley and direct flights, Blanco says. Cindy Blanco, general director of nonprofit StartupGDL.  (Photo: StartupGDL, for USA TODAY) The close proximity of Mexico and Canada could offer concerned American companies — and workers — an option should Trump issue executive orders on a revised travel ban, curtail H-1Bs and revise the NAFTA trade accord. Job seekers are likely to choose Canada as a backup. It was the most popular second destination, at 43%, followed by Australia (12%) and the United Kingdom (5%), based on 1,200 people tracked last week by Indeed, a job-search engine. Mexico was No. 12 on the list. 'Not an ideal solution' Mexico is at a disadvantage when it comes to talent, say tech executives. Its engineering pool isn't as bountiful in Mexico as it is in India and China, and salaries for Mexican engineers are significantly higher because competition for them is so fierce, says Stephen Stokols, CEO of FreedomPop, a wireless Internet and mobile virtual network operator. "Mexico is a primary market for us, but it's not an ideal solution," Stokols says. His Los Angeles-based company has 20 people — about 10% of its worldwide workforce — in Mexico City, mostly engineers. "We would have more people there, if the engineering talent were available." Mexico's new economy starts to take off It can also be expensive to open operations south of the border and establish a payment system, says Jesus Hoyos, managing director at Solvis Consulting, which resells tech products in Mexico. Still, Mexico might offer as compelling a case for job seekers turned away by the U.S. It is a huge trade partner with the U.S. — trade between the two companies totaled $583.6 billion in 2015, according to the U.S. Trade Representative — and the home to  more than 1million Americans, the largest community for expatriates. (Nearly 40,000 American and Canadian expats are among Jalisco's population of seven million.)

The senior U.S. official said the Navy is monitoring the ship on its radar systems. NBC Connecticut has not independently confirmed the reports of the ship being off the shores of Connecticut. Trump Quiet After Russia Deploys Missile, Sends Ship Off US Coast A U.S. defense official told The Associated Press that a Russian intelligence-collection ship has been operating off the East Coast, in international waters. If the ship is in international waters, it is legal for them to be there.  Trump Aides Spoke to Russian Intel Before Elections: Report Gov. Dannel Malloy said "the fact that we know that it's there is probably a good thing and I suspect that we have some of our ships in delicate places as well." "I think it’s getting a lot of coverage because of the President’s changed policy towards Russia, which is very different than has been sustained by other administrations. It’s not that we shouldn’t be talking to the Russians, but we shouldn’t necessarily be embracing everything they are doing. And quite frankly, now that we understand that they have recently been active in our own elections, we should be wary of that. But that there are spy ships in the world – we shouldn’t be surprised,” Malloy said. After Flynn Ouster, Dems Push for Probe Into WH Russia Ties The reports that the ship is near the submarine base in Groton also brought a response from many Connecticut congressional representatives, who by and large called the action aggressive and concerning. NBC Connecticut reached out to officials at the base, who said they don’t have a comment and referred inquiries to the U.S. Department of Defense. Officials from the DOD have not yet responded. Trump's Labor Secretary Pick Withdraws Nomination The White House didn't respond to a request for comment. Groton is home the the Naval sub base, as well as Electric Boat, which designs and builds submarines. Analysis: Few Good Alternatives to Palestine State “I think that clearly they like to track submarines. We know that they do," Malloy said about the ship's proximity to Groton. "This is not something that is brand new. It’s getting a lot of coverage because, again, I think of other Russian stories related to the Trump administration. They seek to understand how we have the best submarines in the world. And they’re made here.” U.S. Senator Chris Murphy’s office said that this is not “unprecedented,” but the senator is concerned this is “part of a pattern of continued Russian ‘boldness.’” 'Firefall' Returns to Light Up Yosemite National Park “Russia is acting like it has a permission slip to expand influence, test limits of reach,” Murphy tweeted. “Questions are obvious: does it, and if so, why?” Russia is acting like it has a permission slip to expand influence, test limits of reach. Questions are obvious: does it, and if so, why? https://t.co/6Hsm7T2GO2 — Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) February 15, 2017 "While this is not wholly unprecedented, it’s part of a series of aggressive actions by Russia that threaten U.S. national security and the security of our allies," Murphy said in a statement. "Just yesterday, news broke that Russia violated an Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Coupled with escalating fighting in eastern Ukraine and Russian jets buzzing a U.S. Navy destroyer in the Black Sea, Putin clearly thinks the Trump administration has given him a permission slip to flex his muscles. President Trump and his administration must end their silence and immediately respond to these threats to our national security.” U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal said in a statement that the presence of the spy ship "has to be regarded very seriously because Russia is an increasingly aggressive adversary." More Than 55,000 US Bridges Structurally Deficient: Report "It reflects a clear need to harden our defenses against electronic surveillance and cyber espionage. I am personally monitoring this situation and remain in close contact with both the Department of Defense and the U.S. Coast Guard," Blumenthal said in the statement. "The return of a Russian vessel is particularly concerning in the context of escalating Russian aggression - within days of the Russian's buzzing a U.S. Navy ship in the Black Sea, as well as deploying a cruise missile in violation of our arms control treaty - which only underscores the need for an independent investigation into possible collusion between the Trump administration and Russian agents." U.S. Rep. Jim Himes issued a statement saying residents should know that the presence of the ship does not present "a direct threat to our physical safety." NYC Police Use Stun Gun on Pregnant Teen in Scuffle: Video "Its appearance is troubling, however, viewed in conjunction with the ongoing stories of Russian ties and interference in the Trump Administration and the recent deployment of a Russian cruise missile in apparent violation of international agreements," Himes said in a statement. "In my opinion, Russia is making a show of strength and pushing established boundaries and norms to gauge the reaction of a new administration in disarray.” U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro tweeted that “Russia is flexing its muscles.” Pope Francis: Native People Have Rights Over Their Lands U.S. Rep. John Larson responded to the reports with a tweet as well. "This is a stark reminder of why we need a full account of Russia's influence in the White House & meddling in our election," Larson tweeted. Pentagon Chief Says NATO Members Must Boost Defense Spending U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney also responded to the reports in a statement. “A Russian spy ship patrolling 30 miles from the Groton SUBASE underscores that the threats posed by a resurgent Russia are real,” Courtney wrote. “This unacceptable, aggressive action, combined with the buzzing of US Navy ships in the Red Sea yesterday are clearly testing the resolve of a new administration. While I have total confidence in our Navy’s vigilant, responsible readiness, the White House needs to move past their seeming infatuation with Putin and treat him like the serious threat to global peace and security that he has been for the last five years.” Husband's Valentine's Day Surprise: Lobster a la L Train Courtney also made a speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives about this ship. U.S. Rep. Elizabeth Esty also responded with a statement. “Russia’s escalating aggression is a serious national security threat," Esty wrote. "Yet again, the Kremlin is testing the resolve of the Trump administration. It is long past time for the White House to stop making excuses for Vladimir Putin and respond to his acts of thuggery with the toughness our security demands.” Check back for updates on this developing story.

Andrew Cunningham - Feb 15, 2017 3:50 pm UTC Enlarge / Intel's 7th- and 6th-gen processors now support the Vulkan API. reader comments 49 Share this story After months in beta, Intel's latest driver for its integrated GPUs (version 15.45.14.4590) adds support for the low-overhead Vulkan API for recent GPUs running in Windows 10. The driver supports HD and Iris 500- and 600-series GPUs, the ones that ship with 6th- and 7th-generation Skylake and Kaby Lake processors. Further ReadingVulkan now official, with 1.0 API release and AMD driver [Updated]Vulkan, currently just a day away from its first birthday, is the open source version of Microsoft's DirectX 12 or Apple's Metal, a low-overhead counterpart to OpenGL. It hasn't yet picked up much support in actual games, but adoption is slowly growing as driver and operating system support improves. Modern AMD and Nvidia GPUs have had Vulkan driver support for nearly a year now, and Google announced that Android would use Vulkan as its main low-overhead graphics API (support was added in version 7.0, which most Android users will probably eventually use at some point in the next couple of years). Intel's support of the API in Windows is just a piece of the puzzle, but given that Intel ships more PC GPUs than anyone else, it's still a noteworthy piece. Unfortunately, it looks like owners of 4th- and 5th-generation Haswell and Broadwell CPUs and GPUs won't be getting Vulkan support in Windows, despite the fact that the GPUs seem to be able to use the API.

Minyanville Intel Corporation (INTC) Stock Will Claw Its Way Higher By Scutify Feb 14, 2017 3:11 pm PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. Shares of semiconductor powerhouse Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) have bounced over the past two trading days, joining the broader stock market. But unlike many parts of the market - which broke higher from sideways consolidation phases - INTC stock bounced off a critical near-term technical support area. This not only promises a further bounce in Intel shares - it allows traders to clearly define their risk. When Intel reported its latest batch of earnings a few weeks ago, its numbers - and its outlook - looked good. However, INTC stock sold off on the news. The post-earnings pullback totaled about 10% by last Friday. Semiconductor stocks as a group currently find themselves at an interesting juncture in the sense that some of the larger stocks in the group trade like a mixed bag of fruit. Intel stock fell after earnings, but now it's bouncing. Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) exhausted itself after earnings last week and has since dropped, yet the broader semiconductor as represented by the Market Vectors Semiconductor ETF (MUTF:SMH) continues to plug higher. To me, this says that the trading opportunities should be focused on single-stock technical levels. INTC Stock Charts On the multiyear weekly chart, we see that while Intel continues to hold its 2009 support trendline, it has found plenty of technical resistance around the $38 area since late 2014. 7 Stocks to Buy for the Death of Obamacare Of all the things the GOP and President Donald Trump want to accomplish in 2017, killing Obamacare is at the top of the list. But how will they do it - and more importantly, which companies will benefit most from the changes in policy and regulations? I've handpicked 7 stocks that are the best investments in the entire sector as these changes take hold. Get their names here FREE! Click to Enlarge So far this area has been rejected three times, most recently following the latest earnings report in January. Note also that the purple-dotted 2009 support line coincides with the 200-week simple moving average (red), making this a critical area of support, currently around the $30-$31 area. While this support area is of no direct concern to my trade idea in INTC stock today, it is important for greater context. Next Page Moving on to the daily chart, we see that Intel stock had a classic "pop-and-drop" move on Jan. 27 following its earnings report. This is pretty similar to what we've witnessed in NVDA after its earnings report late last week. Click to Enlarge INTC stock initially popped on Jan. 27, but quickly reversed lower and closed in the red for the day. This set in motion the aforementioned 10% selloff that came to a halt last Friday (at least for now). Last Friday, INTC found support at its 200-day simple moving average (red), which currently also coincides with the 2015 diagonal support line (purple-dotted line). The stock closed well off its intraday lows last Friday. This was followed by an up-day Monday, which in turn led my proprietary B2 Reversal Indicator to flash a buy signal for a trade. Traders should eye a next upside target around $36.50, while using last Friday's lows around $34.80 as a last-resort stop-loss. Like what you see?

Nathan Rousseau Smith (@fantasticmrnate) reports. Buzz60 President Trump (Photo: Susan Walsh, AP) 15317 CONNECTTWEET 16 LINKEDIN 935 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON — A months-long inquiry into contacts between Russian government officials and associates of President Trump's campaign and business interests will continue despite the firing of national security adviser Michael Flynn for misleading White House officials about his communication with Russia, a U.S. official told USA TODAY on Wednesday. The federal inquiry — which has amassed intercepts of telephone calls, business records and subject interviews — is looking at how Russian officials sought to meddle in the November election, said the official who is not authorized to comment publicly. The official added that there was no current evidence of collusion to tilt the election. The extent and purpose of those alleged contacts, believed to involve a limited number of Trump campaign and business associates, continue to be weighed, including whether the associates were aware they were communicating with Russian intelligence officials or those working on behalf of the Russian government, the official said. TheNew York Times reported Wednesday that phone records and intercepted calls show Trump campaign officials had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election. The White House faced new questions about links between Flynn, President Trump, his campaign and Russia, as attacks from across Washington consumed the White House and Congress. Trump even defended Flynn in a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Wednesday. Flynn was interviewed by FBI agents following last month's inauguration after public statements by top administration officials, including Vice President Pence, about Flynn's pre-inaugural discussions with the Russian ambassador did not track the contents of the intercepted telephone calls. The administration officials had strongly refuted claims that Flynn had discussed sanctions imposed against Russia by the Obama administration. The transcripts of the calls suggested otherwise, prompting then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates to alert White House counsel Donald McGahn that Flynn could be vulnerable to blackmail as a result of his misrepresentations to senior officials. Amid the renewed questions and investigations about contacts between his associates and Russia over last year's election, Trump Wednesday denounced "conspiracy theories" about his relationship with the Russians and said "illegal" news leaks brought down Flynn. "It's a criminal act, and it's been going on for a long time — before me, but now it's really going on," Trump said during a joint news conference with Netanyahu. Though aides said Trump demanded Flynn's resignation Monday over lying about his talk with the Russian ambassador, the president praised his former aide as "a wonderful man" who has been treated "very unfairly" by what he called the "fake media, in many cases." Trump's comments came as congressional Democrats, and some Republicans, served notice that the Russia story is not going away, especially in light of Flynn's resignation and reports that Trump campaign aides had contacts with Russian operatives during an election in which Russian hackers were accused of sabotaging the Democrats. "It is now readily apparent that Gen. Flynn's resignation is not the end of the story but only the beginning," said Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer of New York. Schumer called on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from overseeing the Russia inquiry, saying the former Alabama Republican senator's close ties to Trump and the campaign disqualified him. During confirmation hearings last month, Sessions said he was not aware of conflicts that would force his recusal and a close aide to the attorney general said Wednesday that position had not changed. The aide, who is not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said the attorney general's oversight of the inquiry would be re-evaluated if developments warranted. In a morning tweet storm, Trump denounced the media and critics over Russia. "The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred," Trump said. "@MSNBC & @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!" CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Fresh off White House National Security Advisor Michael Flynn’s resignation, questions are swirling, with democratic lawmakers calling for an investigation. Nathan Rousseau Smith (@fantasticmrnate) has the story. Buzz60 In another tweet, Trump accused his critics of scandal-mongering out of deference to defeated Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. "This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton's losing campaign," Trump wrote. Trump complained about news leaks in a third tweet: "Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia." He added, "The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by 'intelligence' like candy. Very un-American!" Read more: Donald Trump's ties to Russia go back 30 years 'NYT': Intercepted communications show Trump associates, Russians in contact The first 100 days of the Trump presidency Plenty of unanswered questions about Michael Flynn's contacts with Russia While Democrats push Republican lawmakers for a more aggressive investigation of Trump and Russia, some GOP members say new reports are worth more scrutiny. "If there’s contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence officials outside the norm, that’s not only big league bad, that’s a game changer," Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on ABC's Good Morning America. Graham is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, which is conducting an investigation into Russia and the 2016 election. In yet another tweet, Trump contrasted his Russia policy with that of predecessor Barack Obama. "Crimea was TAKEN by Russia during the Obama Administration. Was Obama too soft on Russia?" Trump said. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, will meet Thursday with top Russian military officials in Azerbaijan to discuss “the current state of U.S.-Russian military relations and clear military-to-military communication to prevent miscalculation and potential crises,” according to a statement from the Pentagon. Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  (Photo: Manuel Balce Ceneta, AP) Dunford’s meeting with the defense chiefs comes as the Pentagon deals with increasing tensions with Russia over its deployment of banned nuclear-tipped cruise missiles, Russian warplanes buzzing U.S. ships in the Black Sea and the allegations of election interference. In calling for a stepped-up investigation of any ties between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia, Democratic lawmakers renewed demands that Trump release his tax returns, saying they would show any financial relationship with Russia. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., tweeted Tuesday, "Your nightly reminder that at the center of this strengthening hurricane are the tax returns." A prominent Republican — Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee — expressed concern about the Russia story. "The question is whether the White House is going to be able to stabilize itself," Corker told MSNBC's Morning Joe.
