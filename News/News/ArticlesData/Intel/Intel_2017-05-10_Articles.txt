Flynn resigned as President Donald Trump's national security adviser on Feb. 13, 2017. AP featured More inconsistencies in Flynn consulting By STEPHEN BRAUN and CHAD DAY The Associated Press 1 hr ago 0 Carolyn Kaster Associated Press | Carolyn Kaster, File WASHINGTON -- Targeted in widening investigations of his foreign entanglements, President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is at odds with his former Turkish client over two unusual payments totaling $80,000 that Flynn's firm sent back last year to the client. The disagreement points to inconsistencies in Flynn's accounts to the U.S. government about his work for interests outside the United States. Flynn's company, Flynn Intel Group, told the Justice Department in March that the two $40,000 payments were consulting fees for unspecified work. But Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin has told The Associated Press that the payments from Flynn's firm were refunds for unperformed lobbying. The difference matters because Flynn's foreign business relationships and the veracity of his disclosures are under scrutiny by congressional, military and intelligence inquiries. The Senate intelligence committee said late Wednesday it issued a subpoena to compel Flynn to turn over documents related to its investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner declined to comment on the newly issued subpoena. Flynn had previously been in talks with the committee about agreeing to be interviewed as long as he was granted immunity. In March, Kelner said in a statement that Flynn had a "story to tell," but said no reasonable person would agree to be questioned by the committee without "assurances against unfair prosecution." Other congressional committees and the Pentagon's inspector general are separately examining whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. His firm's Turkish work occurred while he was a top Trump campaign adviser. Earlier in the week, on Monday, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates told senators that Flynn's misstatements about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. raised concerns that Flynn could be targeted for blackmail. Yates also cited the possibility that Flynn could have broken federal law by operating as a paid foreign agent for the Turkish client without U.S. government permission. The Senate intelligence committee said it had previously asked Flynn on April 28 to voluntarily turn over the records it requested, and Flynn declined. The retired Army lieutenant general and former chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency formally told the Justice Department in March that his now-defunct Flynn Intel Group was paid $530,000 for operating as a foreign agent for Alptekin's firm, Inovo BV, and performing work that could have benefited the Turkish government. That filing, prompted by Justice Department pressure, came just weeks after Trump fired Flynn from his national security post. The president has said he made the decision after it became clear Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The paperwork Flynn filed with the Justice Department raised new questions because it cited two consulting payments back to Alptekin's company without specifying what, if any, work was performed. Alptekin told the AP in an email that the payments were refunds guided by a verbal agreement he worked out last year with Flynn Intel that set out how much Flynn's firm was to receive each month for lobbying and other contractual work. When Alptekin didn't see any lobbying work, he said, he asked Flynn Intel to refund $80,000. But Flynn's filing with the Justice Department did not disclose those discussions or the payment arrangements cited by Alptekin. The U.S. foreign agent law requires disclosure of all written and verbal contracts and modifications. National security law experts said the failure to disclose such discussions could spur additional scrutiny of Flynn if Justice Department officials were to determine the missing material was legally significant. The law "says disclosure has to include material fact and makes it a crime to omit such material," said Stephen I. Vladeck, a professor and national security law expert at the University of Texas School of Law. Flynn's foreign agent filing included only one contract signed by Flynn and Alptekin. The contract did not mention any adjustments made verbally, Alptekin's lobbying demands, arranging for allotting payments or any consulting role for Alptekin's company, Inovo BV. In the filing, Flynn's firm said the description of each payment back to Inovo as a "consultancy fee" came from the firm's accounting records. Similar "consultancy fee" entries described payments to other members of the team hired for the work. Asked about the discrepancies between Alptekin's statements and the filing, Kelner said: "We'll stick with what's in the filing." Kelner declined to answer additional questions from the AP about the payment arrangement. In a brief statement Tuesday, Alptekin again said the payments to his firm from Flynn Intel were refunds for unperformed work. Alptekin also suggested that Flynn Intel's description of the payments as consulting fees was an accounting error. Flynn Intel's work last year centered on developing evidence for a criminal case against Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania. Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, wants Gulen extradited because he believes Gulen inspired last year's attempted coup against him. Flynn and Alptekin have, at times, provided inconsistent explanations of the work. Alptekin said last fall that his company paid only tens of thousands of dollars, but later acknowledged that the $530,000 in payments listed in Flynn's foreign agent filing was correct. Alptekin's contention that Flynn didn't carry out any lobbying also appears to conflict with Flynn's filing with the Justice Department since the firm reported lobbying activity. It registered with Congress as a lobbyist in September, and Flynn Intel and a contracted public relations firm disclosed lobbying a House committee and an Arkansas state official. ------ Have a tip about this story?

Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumour Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Contact Us The Bitbag Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumors Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Reviews Tablet HP Elite x2 vs Surface Pro 4: HP Rivals Famous Microsoft 2-in-1 Tablet By Kiko Antonio https://twitter.com/kikoTBB on May 11, 2017 11:52 AM The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 is indeed an impressive piece of technology. However, because the 2-in-1 tablet is almost two years old by now, there are a number of new devices that can rival its performance. Still sporting a Skylake chip, it can easily be taken to the court by a tablet that has the newest Kaby Lake processor. This is the case for the new HP Elite x2; a contender for the niche that the Surface Pro 4 currently owns. Skylake vs Kaby Lake Perhaps the biggest flaw of the Surface Pro 4 right now is the fact that it still uses the previous generation Intel processor. It has been almost three months since Intel released the Kaby Lake chips for tablets and hybrid devices. However, Microsoft is still taking its sweet time and delaying the release of the Surface Pro 5. On the other hand, for those who cannot wait for Microsoft any longer, the HP Elite x2 sports the latest generation of Intel processors available in the market; the Kaby Lake. This means, performance wise, the HP Elite x2 can outstrip the Surface Pro 4 with a considerable margin between them. Microsoft Surface Pro 4 (via microsoftstore.com) Major specs upgrade Just like the Surface Pro 4, users can also choose between an i5 or i7 processor on the HP Elite x2. Furthermore, the HP Elite x2 supports a maximum memory of 16GB and 1TB of flash storage, similar to the Surface Pro 4. However, what the Surface Pro 4 does not have is the Intel HD Graphics 620 support. This part of the Kaby Lake is responsible for much of the native 4K video processing that the chip boasts. While the Microsoft’s tablet boasts a magnesium alloy chassis, the HP version is housed in a sturdy aluminum chassis. On the flip side, the Elite x2 is a tad thinner than the Surface Pro 4 at 0.36 inches thick. The HP Elite x2’s display was also upgraded from the 11.6-inch panel of the previous model to a 12.3-inch LCD display. It has the same resolution of 2,736×1,824 pixels as with the Surface Pro 4. Unfortunately, it is not made from the same PixelSense display as the Microsoft tablet. More juice and extra ports to boot Because the HP hybrid sports an Intel Kaby Lake chip, it means that power efficiency is considerably better than the previous iteration. In fact, HP boasts a 10-hour mixed use battery life on the hybrid tablet. Users get an extra hour when compared with the Surface Pro 4. HP Elite x2 (via hpstore.com) Apart from the impressive battery life, the Elite x2 also comes with a bevy of connectivity standards. To start with, the hybrid tablet has a USB Type-C Thunderbolt 3.0 port; something the Pro 4 users have been asking from Microsoft for a long time. In addition to this, it also has a full-sized USB 3.0 port, a 3.5mm headphone jack, microSD slot, and a SIM card slot. It is quite nice to know that the HP Elite x2, unlike the Surface Pro 4, has an extra connectivity feature apart from the usual Wi-Fi. Finally, the last piece of the puzzle is the Collaboration Keyboard and the Active Pen. The detachable keyboard functions the same way as the Type Keyboard for the Pro 4; the backlit keys have a 1.5mm travel for that solid and comfortable typing feel. Extra features and performance means extra pricey Unfortunately, the HP Elite x2 is a bit pricier than its counterpart. The Pro 4 starts at $899 while the Elite x2 begins at $1,099. However, the one important thing that need to be considered is the fact that the HP Elite x2 will go on sale sometime around July this year. The same cannot be said for the Surface Pro 4.

Franklin) PHOENIX (AP) — Arizona lawmakers completed their 2017 session Wednesday night by approving last-minute tax breaks for corporations and corporate jet buyers and only partially restoring welfare benefits to thousands of recipients who had lost them under a 2015 law pushed by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey. The tax breaks came despite criticism from minority Democrats who said there's no evidence similar cuts have boosted the economy and complained Republicans granted teachers just a small pay boost when they enacted a $9.8 billion budget last week. The Legislature approved a new $10 million "angel investor" tax credit program for capital infusions into small businesses and approved another measure that expands eligibility for a state job training fund to smaller businesses. Opposition to another economic development proposal designed to benefit big manufacturers such as computer chip-maker Intel evaporated Wednesday after the sponsor narrowed an amendment that would have extended its scope. The House and Senate then approved the measure by Rep. Jeff Weninger that extended to 2025 a job-creation tax credit for big companies that was set to expire this year. Senate Bill 1416 also includes new lower property taxes for Intel and other manufacturers in special trade zones that already pay an ultra-low tax rate on new equipment. Weninger tried to amend the bill Tuesday to increase the amount of sales tax revenues normally sent to the state that cities could use to expand roads and other support facilities. Intel announced in February that it would finally complete a multi-billion dollar computer chip plant in Chandler that was build several years ago but never used. Also slipped into that measure is a tax break pushed by corporate jet seller NetJets exempting it from sales taxes. Gov. Doug Ducey vetoed the measure by Republican Rep. Jill Norgaard last month, but she revived it Wednesday. Norgaard called the measure a good part of the commerce package but said Ducey didn't assure he would sign it. However, its inclusion in the Intel bill that he and Republican legislative leaders back makes another veto unlikely. Democrats mainly opposed the tax breaks, saying the state has given away billions of dollars to special interests while the Republican majority begs poverty when it comes to social services and public schools. "At the end of the day there will always be the excuse that we just don't have the revenue to provide for the developmentally disabled, we just don't have the revenue to provide for public schools," Democratic Minority Leader Rebecca Rios said. "And this is why." One House Democrat backed the measure, Rep. Cesar Chavez of Phoenix. "Not only will SB1416 provide high-paying jobs to thousands of Arizonans, but it will catapult economic development in the right direction," Chavez said. Senate President Steve Yarbrough praised the bill, which will benefit Intel's operations in his hometown of Chandler. "We authorized a manufacturer to take the (sales tax) from their own facility, their own property where they are building in this case an enormous investment, and use that money to benefit the citizens of the community, whether it be roads or sewers or lights," Yarbrough said. "We think that's a wise investment." The Legislature adjourned for the year at an unusually early time: 7 p.m. Typically, the final day goes into the wee hours and has often extended until dawn. Left in the dust was a major rural development tax credit bill that was the subject of furious debate when Republican House members met Wednesday morning. Many rural Republicans urged backing for Senate Bill 1212, which would allow out-of-state companies that generate $50 million in rural investment capital to get $30 million in tax credits, which they would sell to generate cash to repay investors. Many Republicans also oppose the measure, which they say would create a program with little oversight and only a vague promise of benefits. Republican House Speaker J.D. Mesnard decided to withdraw a proposal he rolled out last-minute Tuesday that would have required school districts to spend half of their yearly inflation increases on teacher raises. The proposal, an amendment to an unrelated education bill, would have required school districts to spend about $38 million a year on raises for their teachers. The state budget passed last week gave teachers a 1 percent raise at the cost of $34 million. The House speaker said he wanted to focus on the issue and will continue to do so. In the Senate, Republicans mainly backed a restoration of a welfare cut Ducey made in his first year in office, with little support from Democrats, who wanted a full restoration. The Republican governor pushed through a measure in 2015 that limited lifetime welfare payments to one year, the shortest in the nation. The measure includes work or job training requirements for adults and that they ensure their children are regularly attending school. It also reduces or eliminates payments if the person is caught with a controlled substance or quits a job. As part of Ducey's plan to help drug offenders re-enter society, his proposal would allow people convicted of a drug offence to get food stamps and it waives licensing fees for those people.

Franklin AP Photo 1 of 2 i By BOB CHRISTIE and CLARICE SILBER Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story PHOENIX After approving a small teacher pay raise when they passed a $9.8 billion state budget package last week, the Arizona Legislature's 2017 session raced toward its conclusion Wednesday with Republican lawmakers focused on giving tax breaks to corporate interests to drive economic development in the state. The House joined the Senate in approving a new $10 million "angel investor" tax credit program for capital infusions into small businesses and approved another measure that expands eligibility for a state job training fund to smaller businesses. Opposition to another economic development proposal designed to benefit big manufacturers like chip-maker Intel evaporated Wednesday after the sponsor narrowed an amendment that would have extended its scope. The House approved the measure and sent it to the Senate The measure by Rep. Jeff Weninger would extend to 2025 a job-creation tax credit for big companies that was set to expire this year. Senate Bill 1416 also includes new lower property taxes for Intel and other manufacturers in special trade zones that already pay an ultra-low tax rate on new equipment. Weninger tried to amend the bill Tuesday to increase the amount of sales tax revenues normally sent to the state that cities could use to expand roads and other support facilities. Intel announced in February that it would finally complete a multi-billion dollar computer chip plant in Chandler that was build several years ago but never used. He narrowed that Wednesday and the bill passed on a 32-21 vote, with almost no Democratic support. It now awaits a final Senate vote. Also slipped into that measure is a tax break pushed by corporate jet seller NetJets exempting it from sales taxes. Gov. Doug Ducey vetoed the measure by Republican Rep. Jill Norgaard last month, but she revived it Wednesday. Norgaard called the measure a good part of the commerce package but said Ducey didn't assure he would sign it. However, its inclusion in the Intel bill that he and Republican legislative leaders back makes another veto unlikely. Democrats mainly opposed the tax breaks, saying the state has given away billions of dollars to special interests while the Republican majority begs poverty when it comes to social services and public schools "At the end of the day there will always be the excuse that we just don't have the revenue to provide for the developmentally disabled, we just don't have the revenue to provide for public schools," minority leader Rebecca Rios said. "And this is why." One Democrat backed the measure, Rep. Cesar Chavez of Phoenix. "Not only will SB1416 provide high-paying jobs to thousands of Arizonans, but it will catapult economic development in the right direction," Chavez of Glendale said. Left in the dust was a major rural development tax credit bill that was the subject of furious debate when Republican House members met Wednesday morning. Many rural Republicans urged backing for Senate Bill 1212, which would allow out-of-state companies that generate $50 million in rural investment capital to get $30 million in tax credits, which they would sell to generate cash to repay investors. Many Republicans also oppose the measure, which they say would create a program with little oversight and only a vague promise of benefits. Republican House Speaker J.D. Mesnard decided to withdraw a proposal he rolled out last-minute Tuesday that would have required school districts to spend half of their yearly inflation increases on teacher raises. The proposal, an amendment to an unrelated education bill, would have required school districts to spend about $38 million a year on raises for their teachers. The state budget passed last week gave teachers a 1 percent raise at the cost of $34 million. The House speaker said he wanted to focus on the issue and will continue to do so. In the Senate, the most contentious remaining issue was a restoration of a welfare cut Ducey made in his first year in office. The Republican governor pushed through a measure in 2015 that limited lifetime welfare payments to one year, the shortest in the nation. He has proposed a restoration with strings attached that has drawn opposition from minority Democrats. The strings include work or job training requirements for adults and that they ensure their children are regularly attending school. It also reduces or eliminates payments if the person is caught with a controlled substance or quits a job. As part of Ducey's plan to help drug offenders re-enter society, his proposal would allow people convicted of a drug offence to get food stamps and it waives licensing fees for those people. The Senate approved the repeal of a requirement that welfare recipients be fingerprinted in order to qualify for benefits. Lawmakers were pushing to adjourn Wednesday by nightfall, although that might be optimistic.

Franklin) PHOENIX (AP) — After approving a small teacher pay raise when they passed a $9.8 billion state budget package last week, the Arizona Legislature's 2017 session concluded Wednesday after majority Republican lawmakers passed tax breaks to corporate interests to drive economic development in the state. The Senate also passed a partial restoration of a welfare cut Gov. Doug Ducey pushed through two years ago when he made the state the stingiest in the nation for aid to the very poor. The Legislature approved a new $10 million "angel investor" tax credit program for capital infusions into small businesses and approved another measure that expands eligibility for a state job training fund to smaller businesses. Opposition to another economic development proposal designed to benefit big manufacturers like chip-maker Intel evaporated Wednesday after the sponsor narrowed an amendment that would have extended its scope.

"Not only will SB1416 provide high-paying jobs to thousands of Arizonans, but it will catapult economic development in the right direction," Chavez of Glendale said. Senate President Steve Yarbrough praised the bill, which will benefit Intel's operations in his hometown of Chandler. "We authorized a manufacturer to take the (sales tax) from their own facility, their own property where they are building in this case an enormous investment, and use that money to benefit the citizens of the community, whether it be roads or sewers or lights," Yarbrough said. "We think that's a wise investment." The Legislature adjourned for the year at an unusually early time: 7 p.m. Typically, the final day goes into the wee hours and has often extended until dawn.

The session ended Wednesday after Republican lawmakers focused on giving tax breaks to corporate interests to drive economic development in the state. The Legislature passed a series of business tax breaks. One helps chip-maker Intel and other big manufacturers. Another creates a $10 million tax credit program for capital infusions into small businesses, while a third expands eligibility for a state job training fund to smaller businesses. Another bill restores a welfare cut Gov. Doug Ducey made in his first year in office. Wednesday's action comes nearly a week after lawmakers passed a $9.8 billion budget. ___ 6:50 p.m. The Arizona Senate has approved what President Steve Yarbrough says is its last bill of the 2017 session. The Senate approved its most contentious remaining issue on a 17-12 vote. That measure would restore a welfare cut Gov. Doug Ducey made in his first year in office. The Republican governor pushed through a measure in 2015 that limited lifetime welfare payments to one year, the shortest in the nation. The chamber joined the House in voting to extend a job-creation tax credit for big companies that had been set to expire this year until 2025. Lawmakers voted 21-8 on the measure that also makes it easier for the city of Chandler to add infrastructure for a new intel plant using tax money instead of charging the chip-maker. ___ 5:41 p.m. The Arizona House has approved what Speaker J.D. Mesnard says is its last bill of the 2017 session. Wednesday's 32-21 vote extends a job-creation tax credit for big companies that had been set to expire this year until 2025. The measure also makes it easier for the city of Chandler to add infrastructure for a new Intel plant using tax money instead of charging the chip-maker. It now goes to the Senate for a final vote. Senate Bill 1416 by sponsor Rep. Jeff Weninger also includes new lower property taxes for Intel and other manufacturers in special trade zones that already pay an ultra-low tax rate on new equipment. Weninger amended the bill on the House floor to Chandler to keep sales taxes normally sent to the state for new roads and other facilities. But he narrowed the scope, overcoming opposition from numerous fellow Republicans. ___ 4:45 p.m. A bill that Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey vetoed has been revived on the last day of the legislative session. Ducey vetoed the sales tax exemption for people who buy partial ownership interests in corporate jets last month. The tax cut was backed by NetJets, a company owned by billionaire Warren Buffet's company, Berkshire Hathaway. Lobbyists for NetJets testified that state sales taxes are forcing Arizona buyers to finalize deals in other states. Republican Rep. Jill Norgaard of Phoenix inserted the same language in a bill extending a research and development tax credit program and giving a big tax break to chip-maker Intel on Wednesday. Ducey said in a veto letter that the tax cut would likely have state budget implications and should have been part of discussions on spending and revenue priorities. Norgaard said the governor has not said if he supports her effort to revive the bill, but the bill helping Intel has broad support from top Legislative leaders. ___ 4:10 p.m. The House has given initial approval to a measure that would extend to 2025 a job-creation tax credit for big companies that was set to expire this year. The measure also makes it easier for the city of Chandler to add infrastructure for a new Intel plant using tax money instead of charging the chip-maker. Senate Bill 1416 by sponsor Rep. Jeff Weninger also includes new lower property taxes for Intel and other manufacturers in special trade zones that already pay an ultra-low tax rate on new equipment. The House gave initial approval to Weninger's bill Wednesday and it awaits a formal vote. Weninger amended the bill on the House floor to Chandler to keep sales taxes normally sent to the state for new roads and other facilities. But he narrowed the scope, overcoming opposition from numerous fellow Republicans. ___ 3:15 p.m. Republican House Speaker J.D. Mesnard has withdrawn his last-minute proposal requiring school districts to spend half of their yearly inflation increases on teacher raises. The amendment to an unrelated education bill would have required school districts to spend about $38 million a year on raises for their teachers. Mesnard says he wanted to focus on the issue and will continue to do so. The state budget passed last week gave teachers a 1 percent raise at a cost of $34 million. The Arizona School Boards Association quickly came out in opposition of the proposal. The group said the requirement directly violates a voter-approved law requiring the Legislature to provide yearly inflation increases and last year's Proposition 123, which added about $350 million in new funding for schools each year. ___ 1:46 p.m. The House has joined the Senate in voting to provide lawsuit protections for people who break into cars to rescue children or pets. The House approved House Bill 2494 by Republican Sen. John Kavanagh on a 35-20 vote Wednesday. Kavanagh revived it after it failed to get a House committee hearing. The Senate approved it for a second time on a 20-7 vote in April. The vote sends the measure to Gov. Doug Ducey's desk for consideration. Ducey mentioned the proposal in January's state of the state address and said he will sign the bill if it hits his desk. Republican Rep. Eddie Farnsworth said the bill is unneeded because of good Samaritan laws already in place and it wrongly raises animals to the level and rights of children. ___ 12:45 p.m. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey has signed a bill that increases the personal income tax exemption and requires it to be adjusted annually for inflation. Ducey called for indexing the annual exemption to create a small tax cut in his state of the state address at a yearly cost of $2.8 million. But during budget negotiations, some House Republicans pushed for an increase in the personal exemption from $2,100 to $2,200 over two years. That adds nearly $11 million to the cost and saves the average taxpayer less than $5. The bill Ducey signed Wednesday also eliminates several tax credits that haven't been used in recent years. Ducey also signed legislation allowing unused parts of the state mental hospital in Phoenix to be leased to private operators. A proposal urging a reduction of the state transportation fleet was also signed. ___ 11:30 a.m. House Republicans are sharply divided on a proposal that creates a new tax credit plan for investments in rural businesses. Senate Bill 1212 would allow out-of-state companies who generate $50 million in investment capital to get $30 million in tax credits, which they would sell to generate cash to repay investors. House Republicans meeting Wednesday were split, with many rural members pleading for a vote on the plan and other members strongly opposed. Republican Speaker J.D. Mesnard says he hasn't decided whether to put the bill up for a vote on the final day of the 2017 legislative session. The Arizona Free Enterprise Club opposes the bill by Rep. T.J. Shope, saying the state should avoid adopting a complex tax credit scheme that lets the funding company profit for questionable results. ___ 11 a.m. The Arizona Senate has approved the repeal of a requirement that welfare recipients be fingerprinted in order to qualify for benefits. Wednesday's 20-9 vote was among the first of the expected final day of the 2017 legislative session. Just 7 of 1.1 million welfare recipients were found to have inappropriately applied for benefits in 2015. The state is expected to save more than $390,000 by stopping fingerprinting. The Senate also passed bills legalizing hemp farming and waiving taxes on the sale of U.S. gold coins. it also approved a bill increasing eligibility for a job-creation fund to very small businesses. ___ 3 a.m. The Arizona Legislature's 2017 session is expected to come to an end after the passage of bill requiring cities and counties to put sales tax increase measures before voters only during November general elections. The passage Tuesday evening broke a logjam that had threatened to extend the session into next week. With the deal, it's likely to end sometime Wednesday. House Speaker J.D. Mesnard had insisted that the Senate pass the bill before adjourning because it was part of a budget deal. Republican Sen. Kate Brophy McGee opposed the measure but finally agreed to back it after getting small concessions from Republican legislative leaders. Remaining issues include the partial restoration of a cut to welfare Gov. Doug Ducey pushed through in 2015 and a series of business tax breaks. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Michael Flynn, shown here in a February file photo, is at odds with his former Turkish client over two unusual payments totalling $80,000 that Flynn’s firm sent back last year to the client.  (STEPHEN CROWLEY / The New York times file photo)   By Stephen Braun And Chad DayThe Associated Press Wed., May 10, 2017 WASHINGTON—Targeted in widening investigations of his foreign entanglements, U.S. President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is at odds with his former Turkish client over two unusual payments totalling $80,000 that Flynn’s firm sent back last year to the client. The disagreement points to inconsistencies in Flynn’s accounts to the U.S. government about his work for interests outside the United States. Flynn’s company, Flynn Intel Group, told the Justice Department in March that the two $40,000 payments were consulting fees for unspecified work. But Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin has told The Associated Press that the payments from Flynn’s firm were refunds for unperformed lobbying. The difference matters because Flynn’s foreign business relationships and the veracity of his disclosures are under scrutiny by congressional, military and intelligence inquiries. Read the latest news on U.S. President Donald Trump Article Continued Below The Senate intelligence committee said late Wednesday it issued a subpoena to compel Flynn to turn over documents related to its investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner declined to comment on the newly issued subpoena. Flynn had previously been in talks with the committee about agreeing to be interviewed as long as he was granted immunity. In March, Kelner said in a statement that Flynn had a “story to tell,” but said no reasonable person would agree to be questioned by the committee without “assurances against unfair prosecution.” Other congressional committees and the Pentagon’s inspector general are separately examining whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. His firm’s Turkish work occurred while he was a top Trump campaign adviser. Earlier in the week, on Monday, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates told senators that Flynn’s misstatements about his contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. raised concerns that Flynn could be targeted for blackmail. Yates also cited the possibility that Flynn could have broken federal law by operating as a paid foreign agent for the Turkish client without U.S. government permission. The Senate intelligence committee said it had previously asked Flynn on April 28 to voluntarily turn over the records it requested, and Flynn declined. The retired Army lieutenant-general and former chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency formally told the Justice Department in March that his now-defunct Flynn Intel Group was paid $530,000 for operating as a foreign agent for Alptekin’s firm, Inovo BV, and performing work that could have benefited the Turkish government. That filing, prompted by Justice Department pressure, came just weeks after Trump fired Flynn from his national security post. The president has said he made the decision after it became clear Flynn had misled Vice-President Mike Pence about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The paperwork Flynn filed with the Justice Department raised new questions because it cited two consulting payments back to Alptekin’s company without specifying what, if any, work was performed. Alptekin told the AP in an email that the payments were refunds guided by a verbal agreement he worked out last year with Flynn Intel that set out how much Flynn’s firm was to receive each month for lobbying and other contractual work. When Alptekin didn’t see any lobbying work, he said, he asked Flynn Intel to refund $80,000. But Flynn’s filing with the Justice Department did not disclose those discussions or the payment arrangements cited by Alptekin. The U.S. foreign agent law requires disclosure of all written and verbal contracts and modifications. National security law experts said the failure to disclose such discussions could spur additional scrutiny of Flynn if Justice Department officials were to determine the missing material was legally significant. The law “says disclosure has to include material fact and makes it a crime to omit such material,” said Stephen I. Vladeck, a professor and national security law expert at the University of Texas School of Law. Flynn’s foreign agent filing included only one contract signed by Flynn and Alptekin. The contract did not mention any adjustments made verbally, Alptekin’s lobbying demands, arranging for allotting payments or any consulting role for Alptekin’s company, Inovo BV.

He did it anyway In the filing, Flynn’s firm said the description of each payment back to Inovo as a “consultancy fee” came from the firm’s accounting records. Similar “consultancy fee” entries described payments to other members of the team hired for the work. Asked about the discrepancies between Alptekin’s statements and the filing, Kelner said: “We’ll stick with what’s in the filing.” Kelner declined to answer additional questions from the AP about the payment arrangement. In a brief statement Tuesday, Alptekin again said the payments to his firm from Flynn Intel were refunds for unperformed work. Alptekin also suggested that Flynn Intel’s description of the payments as consulting fees was an accounting error. Flynn Intel’s work last year centred on developing evidence for a criminal case against Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, wants Gulen extradited because he believes Gulen inspired last year’s attempted coup against him. Flynn and Alptekin have, at times, provided inconsistent explanations of the work. Alptekin said last fall that his company paid only tens of thousands of dollars, but later acknowledged that the $530,000 in payments listed in Flynn’s foreign agent filing was correct. Alptekin’s contention that Flynn didn’t carry out any lobbying also appears to conflict with Flynn’s filing with the Justice Department since the firm reported lobbying activity. It registered with Congress as a lobbyist in September, and Flynn Intel and a contracted public relations firm disclosed lobbying a House committee and an Arkansas state official.

Targeted in widening investigations of his foreign entanglements, President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is at odds with his former Turkish client over two unusual payments totaling $80,000 that Flynn’s firm sent back last year to the client.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) Published May 10. 2017 9:36PM  By STEPHEN BRAUN and CHAD DAY, Associated Press WASHINGTON — Targeted in widening investigations of his foreign entanglements, President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is at odds with his former Turkish client over two unusual payments totaling $80,000 that Flynn's firm sent back last year to the client. The disagreement points to inconsistencies in Flynn's accounts to the U.S. government about his work for interests outside the United States. Flynn's company, Flynn Intel Group, told the Justice Department in March that the two $40,000 payments were consulting fees for unspecified work. But Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin has told The Associated Press that the payments from Flynn's firm were refunds for unperformed lobbying. The difference matters because Flynn's foreign business relationships and the veracity of his disclosures are under scrutiny by congressional, military and intelligence inquiries. Congressional committees and the Pentagon's inspector general are separately examining whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. His firm's Turkish work occurred while he was a top Trump campaign adviser. On Monday, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates told senators that Flynn's misstatements about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. raised concerns that Flynn could be targeted for blackmail. Yates also cited the possibility that Flynn could have broken federal law by operating as a paid foreign agent for the Turkish client without U.S. government permission. The retired Army lieutenant general and former chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency formally told the Justice Department in March that his now-defunct Flynn Intel Group was paid $530,000 for operating as a foreign agent for Alptekin's firm, Inovo BV, and performing work that could have benefited the Turkish government. That filing, prompted by Justice Department pressure, came just weeks after Trump fired Flynn from his national security post. The president has said he made the decision after it became clear Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The paperwork Flynn filed with the Justice Department raised new questions because it cited two consulting payments back to Alptekin's company without specifying what, if any, work was performed. Alptekin told the AP in an email that the payments were refunds guided by a verbal agreement he worked out last year with Flynn Intel that set out how much Flynn's firm was to receive each month for lobbying and other contractual work. When Alptekin didn't see any lobbying work, he said, he asked Flynn Intel to refund $80,000. But Flynn's filing with the Justice Department did not disclose those discussions or the payment arrangements cited by Alptekin. The U.S. foreign agent law requires disclosure of all written and verbal contracts and modifications. National security law experts said the failure to disclose such discussions could spur additional scrutiny of Flynn if Justice Department officials were to determine the missing material was legally significant. The law "says disclosure has to include material fact and makes it a crime to omit such material," said Stephen I. Vladeck, a professor and national security law expert at the University of Texas School of Law. Flynn's foreign agent filing included only one contract signed by Flynn and Alptekin. The contract did not mention any adjustments made verbally, Alptekin's lobbying demands, arranging for allotting payments or any consulting role for Alptekin's company, Inovo BV. In the filing, Flynn's firm said the description of each payment back to Inovo as a "consultancy fee" came from the firm's accounting records. Similar "consultancy fee" entries described payments to other members of the team hired for the work. Asked about the discrepancies between Alptekin's statements and the filing, Flynn's lawyer, Robert Kelner, said: "We'll stick with what's in the filing." Kelner declined to answer additional questions from the AP about the payment arrangement. In a brief statement Tuesday, Alptekin again said the payments to his firm from Flynn Intel were refunds for unperformed work. Alptekin also suggested that Flynn Intel's description of the payments as consulting fees was an accounting error. Flynn Intel's work last year centered on developing evidence for a criminal case against Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania. Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, wants Gulen extradited because he believes Gulen inspired last year's attempted coup against him. Flynn and Alptekin have, at times, provided inconsistent explanations of the work. Alptekin said last fall that his company paid only tens of thousands of dollars, but later acknowledged that the $530,000 in payments listed in Flynn's foreign agent filing was correct. Alptekin's contention that Flynn didn't carry out any lobbying also appears to conflict with Flynn's filing with the Justice Department since the firm reported lobbying activity. It registered with Congress as a lobbyist in September, and Flynn Intel and a contracted public relations firm disclosed lobbying a House committee and an Arkansas state official.     Previous Article Next Article Loading comment count...

The disagreement points to inconsistencies in Flynn's accounts to the U.S. government about his work for foreign interests. Flynn's company, Flynn Intel Group, told the Justice Department in March that the two $40,000 payments were consulting fees for unspecified work. But Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin has told The Associated Press that the payments from Flynn's firm were refunds for unperformed lobbying. The difference matters because Flynn's foreign business relationships and the veracity of his disclosures are under scrutiny by congressional, military and intelligence inquiries. The Senate intelligence committee said late Wednesday it issued a subpoena to compel Flynn to turn over documents related to its investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner declined to comment on the newly issued subpoena. Flynn had previously been in talks with the committee about agreeing to be interviewed as long as he was granted immunity. In March, Kelner said in a statement that Flynn had a "story to tell," but said no reasonable person would agree to be questioned by the committee without "assurances against unfair prosecution." Other congressional committees and the Pentagon's inspector general are separately examining whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey.

Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., that Flynn could face legal trouble for failing to disclose his foreign work and payments properly. Leaders of a bipartisan House inquiry into Flynn's foreign earnings have said they found no evidence that Flynn asked for permission from the Defence Department or the State Department to accept foreign payments, though they said any likely penalty for that violation would be fines, not prosecution. The Defence Department's inspector general is investigating. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who leads the inquiry as chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, told the AP he had not looked into Flynn's foreign agent disclosures but he "would urge the Justice Department to pursue that if they feel it's necessary." The panel's senior Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, added that Flynn's "work on behalf of Turkey while a top national security adviser for President Trump's campaign raises grave questions."

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wants Gulen extradited because he believes Gulen inspired last year's attempted coup against him. The Obama administration rebuffed Turkey's extradition requests. It's unclear whether the Trump administration will change that stance, though U.S.-Turkish relations have warmed under Trump, who congratulated Erdogan after a recent referendum expanded his presidential powers. International monitors called the referendum an undemocratic power grab. Alptekin said he disagrees with Flynn Intel's decision to register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent because he says the work wasn't orchestrated by the Turkish government and he doesn't have any ties to Erdogan's administration. But Alptekin serves on an economic committee overseen by Turkey's finance ministry. In its Justice Department filing, Flynn Intel also disclosed that Alptekin had consulted with Turkish government officials about the Gulen-related work. Flynn and Alptekin have yet to provide full and consistent explanations. Alptekin initially said last fall that his company paid only tens of thousands of dollars, but later acknowledged that the $530,000 in payments listed in Flynn's foreign agent filing was correct. Alptekin also told the AP that his firm and Flynn Intel had agreed verbally in August to divide monthly $200,000 installments for lobbying, public relations, research and other work. That arrangement specified Flynn's firm would be paid $40,000 a month for lobbying and $15,000 a month for public relations, Alptekin said. Alptekin justified the two $40,000 payments— one in September and the other in October— as refunds, saying he saw no evidence that Flynn Intel performed any lobbying. But Flynn's firm reported lobbying activity. It registered with Congress as a lobbyist in September, midway through the contract. And Flynn Intel and a contracted public relations firm disclosed in their paperwork with the Justice Department that it had lobbied a House committee and an Arkansas state official. ___ Have a tip about this story?

And Flynn Intel and a contracted public relations firm disclosed in their paperwork with the Justice Department that it had lobbied a House committee and an Arkansas state official.

By STEPHEN BRAUN and CHAD DAYAssociated Press Share Comment Read Article WASHINGTON — Targeted in widening investigations of his foreign entanglements, President Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is at odds with his former Turkish client over two unusual payments totaling $80,000 that Flynn’s firm sent back last year to the client. The disagreement points to inconsistencies in Flynn’s accounts to the U.S. government about his work for interests outside the United States. Flynn’s company, Flynn Intel Group, told the Justice Department in March that the two $40,000 payments were consulting fees for unspecified work. But Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin has told The Associated Press that the payments from Flynn’s firm were refunds for unperformed lobbying. The difference matters because Flynn’s foreign business relationships and the veracity of his disclosures are under scrutiny by congressional, military and intelligence inquiries. The Senate intelligence committee said late Wednesday it issued a subpoena to compel Flynn to turn over documents related to its investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election. Other congressional committees and the Pentagon’s inspector general are separately examining whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. His firm’s Turkish work occurred while he was a top Trump campaign adviser. Earlier in the week, on Monday, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates told senators that Flynn’s misstatements about his contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. raised concerns that Flynn could be targeted for blackmail. Yates also cited the possibility that Flynn could have broken federal law by operating as a paid foreign agent for the Turkish client without U.S. government permission. The Senate intelligence committee said it had previously asked Flynn on April 28 to voluntarily turn over the records it requested, and Flynn declined. The retired Army lieutenant general and former chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency formally told the Justice Department in March that his now-defunct Flynn Intel Group was paid $530,000 for operating as a foreign agent for Alptekin’s firm, Inovo BV, and performing work that could have benefited the Turkish government. That filing, prompted by Justice Department pressure, came just weeks after Trump fired Flynn from his national security post. The president has said he made the decision after it became clear Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The paperwork Flynn filed with the Justice Department raised new questions because it cited two consulting payments back to Alptekin’s company without specifying what, if any, work was performed. Alptekin told the AP in an email that the payments were refunds guided by a verbal agreement he worked out last year with Flynn Intel that set out how much Flynn’s firm was to receive each month for lobbying and other contractual work. When Alptekin didn’t see any lobbying work, he said, he asked Flynn Intel to refund $80,000. But Flynn’s filing with the Justice Department did not disclose those discussions or the payment arrangements cited by Alptekin. The U.S. foreign agent law requires disclosure of all written and verbal contracts and modifications. National security law experts said the failure to disclose such discussions could spur additional scrutiny of Flynn if Justice Department officials were to determine the missing material was legally significant. The law “says disclosure has to include material fact and makes it a crime to omit such material,” said Stephen I. Vladeck, a professor and national security law expert at the University of Texas School of Law. Flynn’s foreign agent filing included only one contract signed by Flynn and Alptekin. The contract did not mention any adjustments made verbally, Alptekin’s lobbying demands, arranging for allotting payments or any consulting role for Alptekin’s company, Inovo BV. In the filing, Flynn’s firm said the description of each payment back to Inovo as a “consultancy fee” came from the firm’s accounting records. Similar “consultancy fee” entries described payments to other members of the team hired for the work. Asked about the discrepancies between Alptekin’s statements and the filing, Flynn’s lawyer, Robert Kelner, said: “We’ll stick with what’s in the filing.” Kelner declined to answer additional questions from the AP about the payment arrangement. In a brief statement Tuesday, Alptekin again said the payments to his firm from Flynn Intel were refunds for unperformed work. Alptekin also suggested that Flynn Intel’s description of the payments as consulting fees was an accounting error. Flynn Intel’s work last year centered on developing evidence for a criminal case against Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, wants Gulen extradited because he believes Gulen inspired last year’s attempted coup against him. Flynn and Alptekin have, at times, provided inconsistent explanations of the work. Alptekin said last fall that his company paid only tens of thousands of dollars, but later acknowledged that the $530,000 in payments listed in Flynn’s foreign agent filing was correct. Alptekin’s contention that Flynn didn’t carry out any lobbying also appears to conflict with Flynn’s filing with the Justice Department since the firm reported lobbying activity. It registered with Congress as a lobbyist in September, and Flynn Intel and a contracted public relations firm disclosed lobbying a House committee and an Arkansas state official.

The Senate approved its most contentious remaining issue on a 17-12 vote. That measure would restore a welfare cut Gov. Doug Ducey made in his first year in office. The Republican governor pushed through a measure in 2015 that limited lifetime welfare payments to one year, the shortest in the nation. The chamber joined the House in voting to extend a job-creation tax credit for big companies that had been set to expire this year until 2025. Lawmakers voted 21-8 on the measure that also makes it easier for the city of Chandler to add infrastructure for a new intel plant using tax money instead of charging the chip-maker. ___ 5:41 p.m. The Arizona House has approved what Speaker J.D. Mesnard says is its last bill of the 2017 session. Wednesday's 32-21 vote extends a job-creation tax credit for big companies that had been set to expire this year until 2025. The measure also makes it easier for the city of Chandler to add infrastructure for a new Intel plant using tax money instead of charging the chip-maker. It now goes to the Senate for a final vote. Senate Bill 1416 by sponsor Rep. Jeff Weninger also includes new lower property taxes for Intel and other manufacturers in special trade zones that already pay an ultra-low tax rate on new equipment. Weninger amended the bill on the House floor to Chandler to keep sales taxes normally sent to the state for new roads and other facilities. But he narrowed the scope, overcoming opposition from numerous fellow Republicans. ___ 4:45 p.m. A bill that Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey vetoed has been revived on the last day of the legislative session. Ducey vetoed the sales tax exemption for people who buy partial ownership interests in corporate jets last month. The tax cut was backed by NetJets, a company owned by billionaire Warren Buffet's company, Berkshire Hathaway. Lobbyists for NetJets testified that state sales taxes are forcing Arizona buyers to finalize deals in other states. Republican Rep. Jill Norgaard of Phoenix inserted the same language in a bill extending a research and development tax credit program and giving a big tax break to chip-maker Intel on Wednesday. Ducey said in a veto letter that the tax cut would likely have state budget implications and should have been part of discussions on spending and revenue priorities. Norgaard said the governor has not said if he supports her effort to revive the bill, but the bill helping Intel has broad support from top Legislative leaders. ___ 4:10 p.m. The House has given initial approval to a measure that would extend to 2025 a job-creation tax credit for big companies that was set to expire this year. The measure also makes it easier for the city of Chandler to add infrastructure for a new Intel plant using tax money instead of charging the chip-maker. Senate Bill 1416 by sponsor Rep. Jeff Weninger also includes new lower property taxes for Intel and other manufacturers in special trade zones that already pay an ultra-low tax rate on new equipment. The House gave initial approval to Weninger's bill Wednesday and it awaits a formal vote. Weninger amended the bill on the House floor to Chandler to keep sales taxes normally sent to the state for new roads and other facilities. But he narrowed the scope, overcoming opposition from numerous fellow Republicans. ___ 3:15 p.m. Republican House Speaker J.D. Mesnard has withdrawn his last-minute proposal requiring school districts to spend half of their yearly inflation increases on teacher raises. The amendment to an unrelated education bill would have required school districts to spend about $38 million a year on raises for their teachers. Mesnard says he wanted to focus on the issue and will continue to do so. The state budget passed last week gave teachers a 1 percent raise at a cost of $34 million. The Arizona School Boards Association quickly came out in opposition of the proposal. The group said the requirement directly violates a voter-approved law requiring the Legislature to provide yearly inflation increases and last year's Proposition 123, which added about $350 million in new funding for schools each year. ___ 1:46 p.m. The House has joined the Senate in voting to provide lawsuit protections for people who break into cars to rescue children or pets. The House approved House Bill 2494 by Republican Sen. John Kavanagh on a 35-20 vote Wednesday. Kavanagh revived it after it failed to get a House committee hearing. The Senate approved it for a second time on a 20-7 vote in April. The vote sends the measure to Gov. Doug Ducey's desk for consideration. Ducey mentioned the proposal in January's state of the state address and said he will sign the bill if it hits his desk. Republican Rep. Eddie Farnsworth said the bill is unneeded because of good Samaritan laws already in place and it wrongly raises animals to the level and rights of children. ___ 12:45 p.m. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey has signed a bill that increases the personal income tax exemption and requires it to be adjusted annually for inflation. Ducey called for indexing the annual exemption to create a small tax cut in his state of the state address at a yearly cost of $2.8 million. But during budget negotiations, some House Republicans pushed for an increase in the personal exemption from $2,100 to $2,200 over two years. That adds nearly $11 million to the cost and saves the average taxpayer less than $5. The bill Ducey signed Wednesday also eliminates several tax credits that haven't been used in recent years. Ducey also signed legislation allowing unused parts of the state mental hospital in Phoenix to be leased to private operators. A proposal urging a reduction of the state transportation fleet was also signed. ___ 11:30 a.m. House Republicans are sharply divided on a proposal that creates a new tax credit plan for investments in rural businesses. Senate Bill 1212 would allow out-of-state companies who generate $50 million in investment capital to get $30 million in tax credits, which they would sell to generate cash to repay investors. House Republicans meeting Wednesday were split, with many rural members pleading for a vote on the plan and other members strongly opposed. Republican Speaker J.D. Mesnard says he hasn't decided whether to put the bill up for a vote on the final day of the 2017 legislative session. The Arizona Free Enterprise Club opposes the bill by Rep. T.J. Shope, saying the state should avoid adopting a complex tax credit scheme that lets the funding company profit for questionable results. ___ 11 a.m. The Arizona Senate has approved the repeal of a requirement that welfare recipients be fingerprinted in order to qualify for benefits. Wednesday's 20-9 vote was among the first of the expected final day of the 2017 legislative session. Just 7 of 1.1 million welfare recipients were found to have inappropriately applied for benefits in 2015. The state is expected to save more than $390,000 by stopping fingerprinting. The Senate also passed bills legalizing hemp farming and waiving taxes on the sale of U.S. gold coins. it also approved a bill increasing eligibility for a job-creation fund to very small businesses. ___ 3 a.m. The Arizona Legislature's 2017 session is expected to come to an end after the passage of bill requiring cities and counties to put sales tax increase measures before voters only during November general elections. The passage Tuesday evening broke a logjam that had threatened to extend the session into next week. With the deal, it's likely to end sometime Wednesday. House Speaker J.D. Mesnard had insisted that the Senate pass the bill before adjourning because it was part of a budget deal. Republican Sen. Kate Brophy McGee opposed the measure but finally agreed to back it after getting small concessions from Republican legislative leaders. Remaining issues include the partial restoration of a cut to welfare Gov. Doug Ducey pushed through in 2015 and a series of business tax breaks. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

AP Exclusive: More inconsistencies in Flynn consulting work Associated Press | WASHINGTON (AP) — Targeted in widening investigations of his foreign entanglements, President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is at odds with his former Turkish client over two unusual payments totaling $80,000 that Flynn's firm sent back last year to the client. The disagreement points to inconsistencies in Flynn's accounts to the U.S. government about his work for foreign interests. Flynn's company, Flynn Intel Group, told the Justice Department in March that the two $40,000 payments were consulting fees for unspecified work. But Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin has told The Associated Press that the payments from Flynn's firm were refunds for unperformed lobbying. The difference matters because Flynn's foreign business relationships and the veracity of his disclosures are under scrutiny by congressional, military and intelligence inquiries. The Senate intelligence committee said late Wednesday it issued a subpoena to compel Flynn to turn over documents related to its investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner declined to comment on the newly issued subpoena. Flynn had previously been in talks with the committee about agreeing to be interviewed as long as he was granted immunity. In March, Kelner said in a statement that Flynn had a "story to tell," but said no reasonable person would agree to be questioned by the committee without "assurances against unfair prosecution." Other congressional committees and the Pentagon's inspector general are separately examining whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. His firm's Turkish work occurred while he was a top Trump campaign adviser. Earlier in the week, on Monday, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates told senators that Flynn's misstatements about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. raised concerns that he could be targeted for blackmail.

That filing — prompted by Justice Department pressure — came just weeks after Trump fired Flynn from his national security post. The president has said he made the decision after it became clear Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. The paperwork Flynn filed with the Justice Department raised new questions because it cited two consulting payments back to Alptekin's company without specifying what, if any, work was performed.

When Alptekin didn't see any lobbying work, he said, he asked Flynn Intel to refund $80,000 to his firm. But Flynn's filing with the Justice Department did not disclose those discussions or the payment arrangements cited by Alptekin. The U.S. foreign agent law requires disclosure of all written and verbal contracts and modifications. National security law experts said the failure to disclose such discussions could spur additional scrutiny of Flynn if Justice Department officials were to determine the missing material was legally significant. The law "says disclosure has to include material fact and makes it a crime to omit such material," said Stephen I. Vladeck, a professor and national security law expert at the University of Texas School of Law. Flynn's foreign agent filing included only one contract signed by Flynn and Alptekin. The contract did not mention any adjustments made verbally, Alptekin's lobbying demands, arranging for allotting payments or any consulting role for Alptekin's company, Inovo BV. In the filing, Flynn's firm said the description of each payment back to Inovo as a "consultancy fee" came from the firm's accounting records. Similar "consultancy fee" entries described payments to other members of the team hired for the work. Asked about the discrepancies between Alptekin's statements and the filing, Kelner, said: "We'll stick with what's in the filing." Kelner declined to answer additional questions from the AP about the payment arrangement. In a brief statement Tuesday, Alptekin again said the payments to his firm from Flynn Intel were refunds for unperformed work. Alptekin also suggested that Flynn Intel's description of the payments as consulting fees was an accounting error. In Monday's Senate hearing, Yates told Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., that Flynn could face legal trouble for failing to disclose his foreign work and payments properly. Leaders of a bipartisan House inquiry into Flynn's foreign earnings have said they found no evidence that Flynn asked for permission from the Defense Department or the State Department to accept foreign payments, though they said any likely penalty for that violation would be fines, not prosecution. The Defense Department's inspector general is investigating. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who leads the inquiry as chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, told the AP he had not looked into Flynn's foreign agent disclosures but he "would urge the Justice Department to pursue that if they feel it's necessary." The panel's senior Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, added that Flynn's "work on behalf of Turkey while a top national security adviser for President Trump's campaign raises grave questions." Flynn Intel's work last year centered on developing evidence for a criminal case against Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wants Gulen extradited because he believes Gulen inspired last year's attempted coup against him. The Obama administration rebuffed Turkey's extradition requests. It's unclear whether the Trump administration will change that stance, though U.S.-Turkish relations have warmed under Trump, who congratulated Erdogan after a recent referendum expanded his presidential powers. International monitors called the referendum an undemocratic power grab. Alptekin said he disagrees with Flynn Intel's decision to register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent because he says the work wasn't orchestrated by the Turkish government and he doesn't have any ties to Erdogan's administration. But Alptekin serves on an economic committee overseen by Turkey's finance ministry. In its Justice Department filing, Flynn Intel also disclosed that Alptekin had consulted with Turkish government officials about the Gulen-related work. Flynn and Alptekin have yet to provide full and consistent explanations. Alptekin initially said last fall that his company paid only tens of thousands of dollars, but later acknowledged that the $530,000 in payments listed in Flynn's foreign agent filing was correct. Alptekin also told the AP that his firm and Flynn Intel had agreed verbally in August to divide monthly $200,000 installments for lobbying, public relations, research and other work. That arrangement specified Flynn's firm would be paid $40,000 a month for lobbying and $15,000 a month for public relations, Alptekin said. Alptekin justified the two $40,000 payments— one in September and the other in October— as refunds, saying he saw no evidence that Flynn Intel performed any lobbying. But Flynn's firm reported lobbying activity. It registered with Congress as a lobbyist in September, midway through the contract. And Flynn Intel and a contracted public relations firm disclosed in their paperwork with the Justice Department that it had lobbied a House committee and an Arkansas state official. ___ Have a tip about this story?

Doug Ducey vetoed has been revived on the last day of the legislative session. Ducey vetoed the sales tax exemption for people who buy partial ownership interests in corporate jets last month. The tax cut was backed by NetJets, a company owned by billionaire Warren Buffet's company, Berkshire Hathaway. Lobbyists for NetJets testified that state sales taxes are forcing Arizona buyers to finalize deals in other states. Republican Rep. Jill Norgaard of Phoenix inserted the same language in a bill extending a research and development tax credit program and giving a big tax break to chip-maker Intel on Wednesday. Ducey said in a veto letter that the tax cut would likely have state budget implications and should have been part of discussions on spending and revenue priorities. Norgaard said the governor has not said if he supports her effort to revive the bill, but the bill helping Intel has broad support from top Legislative leaders. 4:10 p.m. The House has given initial approval to a measure that would extend to 2025 a job-creation tax credit for big companies that was set to expire this year. The measure also makes it easier for the city of Chandler to add infrastructure for a new Intel plant using tax money instead of charging the chip-maker. Senate Bill 1416 by sponsor Rep. Jeff Weninger also includes new lower property taxes for Intel and other manufacturers in special trade zones that already pay an ultra-low tax rate on new equipment. The House gave initial approval to Weninger's bill Wednesday and it awaits a formal vote. Weninger amended the bill on the House floor to Chandler to keep sales taxes normally sent to the state for new roads and other facilities. But he narrowed the scope, overcoming opposition from numerous fellow Republicans. ___ 3:15 p.m. Republican House Speaker J.D. Mesnard has withdrawn his last-minute proposal requiring school districts to spend half of their yearly inflation increases on teacher raises. The amendment to an unrelated education bill would have required school districts to spend about $38 million a year on raises for their teachers. Mesnard says he wanted to focus on the issue and will continue to do so. The state budget passed last week gave teachers a 1 percent raise at a cost of $34 million. The Arizona School Boards Association quickly came out in opposition of the proposal. The group said the requirement directly violates a voter-approved law requiring the Legislature to provide yearly inflation increases and last year's Proposition 123, which added about $350 million in new funding for schools each year. ___ 1:46 p.m. The House has joined the Senate in voting to provide lawsuit protections for people who break into cars to rescue children or pets. The House approved House Bill 2494 by Republican Sen. John Kavanagh on a 35-20 vote Wednesday. Kavanagh revived it after it failed to get a House committee hearing. The Senate approved it for a second time on a 20-7 vote in April. The vote sends the measure to Gov. Doug Ducey's desk for consideration. Ducey mentioned the proposal in January's state of the state address and said he will sign the bill if it hits his desk. Republican Rep. Eddie Farnsworth said the bill is unneeded because of good Samaritan laws already in place and it wrongly raises animals to the level and rights of children. ___ 12:45 p.m. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey has signed a bill that increases the personal income tax exemption and requires it to be adjusted annually for inflation. Ducey called for indexing the annual exemption to create a small tax cut in his state of the state address at a yearly cost of $2.8 million. But during budget negotiations, some House Republicans pushed for an increase in the personal exemption from $2,100 to $2,200 over two years. That adds nearly $11 million to the cost and saves the average taxpayer less than $5. The bill Ducey signed Wednesday also eliminates several tax credits that haven't been used in recent years. Ducey also signed legislation allowing unused parts of the state mental hospital in Phoenix to be leased to private operators. A proposal urging a reduction of the state transportation fleet was also signed. ___ Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up! I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site consitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy. 11:30 a.m. House Republicans are sharply divided on a proposal that creates a new tax credit plan for investments in rural businesses. Senate Bill 1212 would allow out-of-state companies who generate $50 million in investment capital to get $30 million in tax credits, which they would sell to generate cash to repay investors. House Republicans meeting Wednesday were split, with many rural members pleading for a vote on the plan and other members strongly opposed. Republican Speaker J.D. Mesnard says he hasn't decided whether to put the bill up for a vote on the final day of the 2017 legislative session. The Arizona Free Enterprise Club opposes the bill by Rep. T.J. Shope, saying the state should avoid adopting a complex tax credit scheme that lets the funding company profit for questionable results. ___ 11 a.m. The Arizona Senate has approved the repeal of a requirement that welfare recipients be fingerprinted in order to qualify for benefits. Wednesday's 20-9 vote was among the first of the expected final day of the 2017 legislative session. Just 7 of 1.1 million welfare recipients were found to have inappropriately applied for benefits in 2015. The state is expected to save more than $390,000 by stopping fingerprinting. The Senate also passed bills legalizing hemp farming and waiving taxes on the sale of U.S. gold coins. it also approved a bill increasing eligibility for a job-creation fund to very small businesses. ___ 3 a.m. The Arizona Legislature's 2017 session is expected to come to an end after the passage of bill requiring cities and counties to put sales tax increase measures before voters only during November general elections. The passage Tuesday evening broke a logjam that had threatened to extend the session into next week. With the deal, it's likely to end sometime Wednesday. House Speaker J.D. Mesnard had insisted that the Senate pass the bill before adjourning because it was part of a budget deal. Republican Sen. Kate Brophy McGee opposed the measure but finally agreed to back it after getting small concessions from Republican legislative leaders. Remaining issues include the partial restoration of a cut to welfare Gov. Doug Ducey pushed through in 2015 and a series of business tax breaks. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

The disagreement points to inconsistencies in Flynn's accounts to the U.S. government about his work for foreign interests. Flynn's company, Flynn Intel Group, told the Justice Department in March that the two $40,000 payments were consulting fees for unspecified work. But Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin has told The Associated Press that the payments from Flynn's firm were refunds for unperformed lobbying. The difference matters because Flynn's foreign business relationships and the veracity of his disclosures are under scrutiny by congressional, military and intelligence inquiries. The Senate intelligence committee said late Wednesday it issued a subpoena to compel Flynn to turn over documents related to its investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner declined to comment on the newly issued subpoena. Flynn had previously been in talks with the committee about agreeing to be interviewed as long as he was granted immunity. In March, Kelner said in a statement that Flynn had a "story to tell," but said no reasonable person would agree to be questioned by the committee without "assurances against unfair prosecution." • Last month: Pentagon probes former Trump aide Flynn's foreign payments Other congressional committees and the Pentagon's inspector general are separately examining whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. His firm's Turkish work occurred while he was a top Trump campaign adviser. Earlier in the week, on Monday, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates told senators that Flynn's misstatements about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. raised concerns that he could be targeted for blackmail. Yates also cited the possibility that Flynn could have broken federal law by operating as a paid foreign agent for the Turkish client without U.S. government permission. The Senate intelligence committee said it had previously asked Flynn on April 28 to voluntarily turn over the records it requested, and Flynn declined. The retired Army lieutenant general and former chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency formally told the Justice Department in March that his now-defunct Flynn Intel Group was paid $530,000 for operating as a foreign agent for Alptekin's firm, Inovo BV, and performing work that could have benefited the Turkish government. That filing — prompted by Justice Department pressure — came just weeks after Trump fired Flynn from his national security post. The president has said he made the decision after it became clear Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. The paperwork Flynn filed with the Justice Department raised new questions because it cited two consulting payments back to Alptekin's company without specifying what, if any, work was performed. Alptekin told The Associated Press in an email that the payments were refunds guided by a verbal agreement he worked out last year with Flynn Intel that set out how much Flynn's firm was to receive each month for lobbying and other contractual work. When Alptekin didn't see any lobbying work, he said, he asked Flynn Intel to refund $80,000 to his firm. But Flynn's filing with the Justice Department did not disclose those discussions or the payment arrangements cited by Alptekin. The U.S. foreign agent law requires disclosure of all written and verbal contracts and modifications. National security law experts said the failure to disclose such discussions could spur additional scrutiny of Flynn if Justice Department officials were to determine the missing material was legally significant. The law "says disclosure has to include material fact and makes it a crime to omit such material," said Stephen I. Vladeck, a professor and national security law expert at the University of Texas School of Law. Flynn's foreign agent filing included only one contract signed by Flynn and Alptekin. The contract did not mention any adjustments made verbally, Alptekin's lobbying demands, arranging for allotting payments or any consulting role for Alptekin's company, Inovo BV. In the filing, Flynn's firm said the description of each payment back to Inovo as a "consultancy fee" came from the firm's accounting records. Similar "consultancy fee" entries described payments to other members of the team hired for the work. Asked about the discrepancies between Alptekin's statements and the filing, Kelner, said: "We'll stick with what's in the filing." Kelner declined to answer additional questions from the AP about the payment arrangement. In a brief statement Tuesday, Alptekin again said the payments to his firm from Flynn Intel were refunds for unperformed work. Alptekin also suggested that Flynn Intel's description of the payments as consulting fees was an accounting error. In Monday's Senate hearing, Yates told Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., that Flynn could face legal trouble for failing to disclose his foreign work and payments properly. Leaders of a bipartisan House inquiry into Flynn's foreign earnings have said they found no evidence that Flynn asked for permission from the Defense Department or the State Department to accept foreign payments, though they said any likely penalty for that violation would be fines, not prosecution. The Defense Department's inspector general is investigating. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who leads the inquiry as chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, told the AP he had not looked into Flynn's foreign agent disclosures but he "would urge the Justice Department to pursue that if they feel it's necessary." The panel's senior Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, added that Flynn's "work on behalf of Turkey while a top national security adviser for President Trump's campaign raises grave questions." Flynn Intel's work last year centered on developing evidence for a criminal case against Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wants Gulen extradited because he believes Gulen inspired last year's attempted coup against him. The Obama administration rebuffed Turkey's extradition requests. It's unclear whether the Trump administration will change that stance, though U.S.-Turkish relations have warmed under Trump, who congratulated Erdogan after a recent referendum expanded his presidential powers. International monitors called the referendum an undemocratic power grab. Alptekin said he disagrees with Flynn Intel's decision to register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent because he says the work wasn't orchestrated by the Turkish government and he doesn't have any ties to Erdogan's administration. But Alptekin serves on an economic committee overseen by Turkey's finance ministry. In its Justice Department filing, Flynn Intel also disclosed that Alptekin had consulted with Turkish government officials about the Gulen-related work. Flynn and Alptekin have yet to provide full and consistent explanations. Alptekin initially said last fall that his company paid only tens of thousands of dollars, but later acknowledged that the $530,000 in payments listed in Flynn's foreign agent filing was correct. Alptekin also told the AP that his firm and Flynn Intel had agreed verbally in August to divide monthly $200,000 installments for lobbying, public relations, research and other work. That arrangement specified Flynn's firm would be paid $40,000 a month for lobbying and $15,000 a month for public relations, Alptekin said. Alptekin justified the two $40,000 payments — one in September and the other in October — as refunds, saying he saw no evidence that Flynn Intel performed any lobbying. But Flynn's firm reported lobbying activity. It registered with Congress as a lobbyist in September, midway through the contract. And Flynn Intel and a contracted public relations firm disclosed in their paperwork with the Justice Department that it had lobbied a House committee and an Arkansas state official.

The Senate also passed bills legalizing hemp farming and waiving taxes on the sale of U.S. gold coins. it also approved a bill increasing eligibility for a job-creation fund to very small businesses. ___ 3 a.m. The Arizona Legislature's 2017 session is expected to come to an end after the passage of bill requiring cities and counties to put sales tax increase measures before voters only during November general elections. The passage Tuesday evening broke a logjam that had threatened to extend the session into next week. With the deal, it's likely to end sometime Wednesday. House Speaker J.D. Mesnard had insisted that the Senate pass the bill before adjourning because it was part of a budget deal. Republican Sen. Kate Brophy McGee opposed the measure but finally agreed to back it after getting small concessions from Republican legislative leaders. Remaining issues include the partial restoration of a cut to welfare Gov. Doug Ducey pushed through in 2015 and a series of business tax breaks. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

 More inconsistencies about Michael Flynn's consulting work emerge as Senate committee issues subpoena Chad Day and Stephen Braun, Associated Press May 10, 2017, 7:23 PM 2,008 facebook linkedin twitter email print Michael T. Flynn, President-elect Donald Trump's choice for National Security Advisor, waits for an elevator at Trump Tower, Monday, Dec. 12, 2016, in New York. Associated Press/Kathy Willens WASHINGTON (AP) — Targeted in widening investigations of his foreign entanglements, President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is at odds with his former Turkish client over two unusual payments totaling $80,000 that Flynn's firm sent back last year to the client. The disagreement points to inconsistencies in Flynn's accounts to the U.S. government about his work for foreign interests. Flynn's company, Flynn Intel Group, told the Justice Department in March that the two $40,000 payments were consulting fees for unspecified work. But Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin has told The Associated Press that the payments from Flynn's firm were refunds for unperformed lobbying. The difference matters because Flynn's foreign business relationships and the veracity of his disclosures are under scrutiny by congressional, military and intelligence inquiries. The Senate intelligence committee said late Wednesday it issued a subpoena to compel Flynn to turn over documents related to its investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election. Other congressional committees and the Pentagon's inspector general are separately examining whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. His firm's Turkish work occurred while he was a top Trump campaign adviser. Earlier in the week, on Monday, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates told senators that Flynn's misstatements about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. raised concerns that he could be targeted for blackmail. Yates also cited the possibility that Flynn could have broken federal law by operating as a paid foreign agent for the Turkish client without U.S. government permission. Sally Yates. Eric Thayer/Getty Images The Senate intelligence committee said it had previously asked Flynn on April 28 to voluntarily turn over the records it requested, and Flynn declined. The retired Army lieutenant general and former chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency formally told the Justice Department in March that his now-defunct Flynn Intel Group was paid $530,000 for operating as a foreign agent for Alptekin's firm, Inovo BV, and performing work that could have benefited the Turkish government. That filing — prompted by Justice Department pressure — came just weeks after Trump fired Flynn from his national security post. The president has said he made the decision after it became clear Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. The paperwork Flynn filed with the Justice Department raised new questions because it cited two consulting payments back to Alptekin's company without specifying what, if any, work was performed. Alptekin told The Associated Press in an email that the payments were refunds guided by a verbal agreement he worked out last year with Flynn Intel that set out how much Flynn's firm was to receive each month for lobbying and other contractual work. When Alptekin didn't see any lobbying work, he said, he asked Flynn Intel to refund $80,000 to his firm. But Flynn's filing with the Justice Department did not disclose those discussions or the payment arrangements cited by Alptekin. The U.S. foreign agent law requires disclosure of all written and verbal contracts and modifications. National security law experts said the failure to disclose such discussions could spur additional scrutiny of Flynn if Justice Department officials were to determine the missing material was legally significant. The law "says disclosure has to include material fact and makes it a crime to omit such material," said Stephen I. Vladeck, a professor and national security law expert at the University of Texas School of Law. Michael Flynn. Mario Tama/Getty Images Flynn's foreign agent filing included only one contract signed by Flynn and Alptekin. The contract did not mention any adjustments made verbally, Alptekin's lobbying demands, arranging for allotting payments or any consulting role for Alptekin's company, Inovo BV. In the filing, Flynn's firm said the description of each payment back to Inovo as a "consultancy fee" came from the firm's accounting records. Similar "consultancy fee" entries described payments to other members of the team hired for the work. Asked about the discrepancies between Alptekin's statements and the filing, Flynn's attorney, Robert Kelner, said: "We'll stick with what's in the filing." Kelner declined to answer additional questions from the AP about the payment arrangement. In a brief statement Tuesday, Alptekin again said the payments to his firm from Flynn Intel were refunds for unperformed work. Alptekin also suggested that Flynn Intel's description of the payments as consulting fees was an accounting error. In Monday's Senate hearing, Yates told Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., that Flynn could face legal trouble for failing to disclose his foreign work and payments properly. Leaders of a bipartisan House inquiry into Flynn's foreign earnings have said they found no evidence that Flynn asked for permission from the Defense Department or the State Department to accept foreign payments, though they said any likely penalty for that violation would be fines, not prosecution. The Defense Department's inspector general is investigating. George Frey/Getty Images Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who leads the inquiry as chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, told the AP he had not looked into Flynn's foreign agent disclosures but he "would urge the Justice Department to pursue that if they feel it's necessary." The panel's senior Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, added that Flynn's "work on behalf of Turkey while a top national security adviser for President Trump's campaign raises grave questions." Flynn Intel's work last year centered on developing evidence for a criminal case against Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wants Gulen extradited because he believes Gulen inspired last year's attempted coup against him. The Obama administration rebuffed Turkey's extradition requests. It's unclear whether the Trump administration will change that stance, though U.S.-Turkish relations have warmed under Trump, who congratulated Erdogan after a recent referendum expanded his presidential powers. International monitors called the referendum an undemocratic power grab. Alptekin said he disagrees with Flynn Intel's decision to register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent because he says the work wasn't orchestrated by the Turkish government and he doesn't have any ties to Erdogan's administration. But Alptekin serves on an economic committee overseen by Turkey's finance ministry. In its Justice Department filing, Flynn Intel also disclosed that Alptekin had consulted with Turkish government officials about the Gulen-related work. Flynn and Alptekin have yet to provide full and consistent explanations. Alptekin initially said last fall that his company paid only tens of thousands of dollars, but later acknowledged that the $530,000 in payments listed in Flynn's foreign agent filing was correct. Alptekin also told the AP that his firm and Flynn Intel had agreed verbally in August to divide monthly $200,000 installments for lobbying, public relations, research and other work. That arrangement specified Flynn's firm would be paid $40,000 a month for lobbying and $15,000 a month for public relations, Alptekin said. Alptekin justified the two $40,000 payments— one in September and the other in October— as refunds, saying he saw no evidence that Flynn Intel performed any lobbying. But Flynn's firm reported lobbying activity. It registered with Congress as a lobbyist in September, midway through the contract. And Flynn Intel and a contracted public relations firm disclosed in their paperwork with the Justice Department that it had lobbied a House committee and an Arkansas state official. ___ Have a tip about this story?

Flynn had previously offered to testify before the Senate and House intelligence committees — which are both investigating Russian interference in the election — in exchange for immunity, but it does not appear that either committee has accepted the offer. ADVERTISEMENT The former intelligence head was fired in February for misleading Vice President Pence and other White House officials about the contents of a December phone call with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn has also been under scrutiny for accepting payments from Russia and Turkey and allegedly misleading the government about them. In April, the committee sent a series of requests for records from Trump associates on any dealings with Russians. As of the deadline to produce documents Tuesday afternoon, Burr told reporters that the committee had received only two responses — and hinted that he was willing to issue subpoenas to compel the rest. One of those responses, from former Trump foreign policy advisor Carter Page, is publicly known. Burr declined to disclose the second. Aside from Page and Flynn, informal Trump adviser Roger Stone and former foreign policy adviser Paul Manafort were also reportedly sent letters. The letters ask for the men to list any meetings they might have had with Russian officials between June 16, 2015 — the day Trump formally launched his campaign — and Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, as well as records of any communications during the period. The senators also want details on any financial assets or real estate holding tied to Russia, and a broader list of meetings between any Trump campaign aides and Russians. In December 2015, Flynn was paid $45,000 to speak at an event hosted in Moscow by the Kremlin-backed network RT, during which he was seated with Russian President Vladimir Putin. He also received payments for additional speeches to Russian firms Kaspersky and Volga Dnepr. As a retired military officer, Flynn is prohibited under the emoluments clause of the Constitution from accepting payment from a foreign government without advance permission from both the secretary of State and the secretary of the Army. According to documents released by House Oversight Committee ranking member Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), Flynn did not disclose the RT payment when he applied to renew his security clearance in January 2016, just a month after he traveled to Moscow. Flynn’s lawyer has claimed that he briefed the DIA “extensively” both before and after the 2015 trip. Tags Richard Burr Mark Warner   View the discussion thread.

Some owners of Intel Core i7-7700 and i7-7700K chips have been complaining for months about mysterious temperature spikes, and now Intel has responded. However, that response was little more than canned PR nonsense, which has served only to further enrage affected users. The Core i7-7700 and 7700K are both quad-core chips with Hyper-Threading to bring the number of threads to eight. These are both designed to be enthusiast CPUs, but the K variant is particularly popular. The 7700K has a clock speed of 4.2GHz compared with 3.6GHz for the regular 7700, and you can push it far past the stock setting thanks to its unlocked multiplier. You always need to be aware of temperatures when overclocking a chip, and this is where some owners of the 7700s are running into issues. Multiple users have been noticing unusual temperature spikes as high as 90 degrees Celsius. In case you’re not familiar with CPU temperature ranges, that’s very high. The Core architecture has a maximum temperature threshold of 100 degrees, so owners have been understandably concerned. After 37 pages of complaints on Intel’s community forums, someone from the company finally issued a statement. It reads in part, “We do not recommend running outside the processor specifications, such as by exceeding processor frequency or voltage specifications, or removing of the integrated heat spreader (sometimes called “de-lidding”). These actions will void the processor warranty.” The spokesperson also said Intel has not identified any unexpected temperature variations in its testing. Basically, it thinks the temperature spikes are normal. This isn’t sitting well with users on the forum, who point out it makes no sense for Intel to sell a K-series CPU with an unlocked multiplier while telling people not to overclock. Even some chips that aren’t overclocked seem to be affected, making the response all the more aggravating. The only useful bit of advice from Intel is to alter the fan speed curve so it ramps up more gradually. That will at least lessen the frantic whirring as fans race to catch up with the temperature spikes. Several posters have pledged to ditch their Intel hardware and pick up an AMD CPU. That would have seemed like an idle threat in the recent past, but the new AMD Ryzen chips are getting high praise. This is not really the time for Intel to be upsetting its enthusiast base.

The disagreement points to inconsistencies in Flynn’s accounts to the U.S. government about his work for interests outside the United States. Flynn’s company, Flynn Intel Group, told the Justice Department in March that the two $40,000 payments were consulting fees for unspecified work. But Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin has told The Associated Press that the payments from Flynn’s firm were refunds for unperformed lobbying. The difference matters because Flynn’s foreign business relationships and the veracity of his disclosures are under scrutiny by congressional, military and intelligence inquiries. Sign up for the online chat with Col. Brandon Pearce, NGA's chief information security officer, May 15, 12:30 p.m. Advertisement The Senate intelligence committee said late Wednesday it issued a subpoena to compel Flynn to turn over documents related to its investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner declined to comment on the newly issued subpoena. Flynn had previously been in talks with the committee about agreeing to be interviewed as long as he was granted immunity. In March, Kelner said in a statement that Flynn had a “story to tell,” but said no reasonable person would agree to be questioned by the committee without “assurances against unfair prosecution.” Other congressional committees and the Pentagon’s inspector general are separately examining whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. His firm’s Turkish work occurred while he was a top Trump campaign adviser. Earlier in the week, on Monday, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates told senators that Flynn’s misstatements about his contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. raised concerns that Flynn could be targeted for blackmail. Yates also cited the possibility that Flynn could have broken federal law by operating as a paid foreign agent for the Turkish client without U.S. government permission. The Senate intelligence committee said it had previously asked Flynn on April 28 to voluntarily turn over the records it requested, and Flynn declined. ‘If you’re a really good federal worker, you should welcome’ the reorganization plan, OMB says The retired Army lieutenant general and former chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency formally told the Justice Department in March that his now-defunct Flynn Intel Group was paid $530,000 for operating as a foreign agent for Alptekin’s firm, Inovo BV, and performing work that could have benefited the Turkish government. That filing, prompted by Justice Department pressure, came just weeks after Trump fired Flynn from his national security post. The president has said he made the decision after it became clear Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The paperwork Flynn filed with the Justice Department raised new questions because it cited two consulting payments back to Alptekin’s company without specifying what, if any, work was performed. Alptekin told the AP in an email that the payments were refunds guided by a verbal agreement he worked out last year with Flynn Intel that set out how much Flynn’s firm was to receive each month for lobbying and other contractual work. When Alptekin didn’t see any lobbying work, he said, he asked Flynn Intel to refund $80,000. But Flynn’s filing with the Justice Department did not disclose those discussions or the payment arrangements cited by Alptekin. The U.S. foreign agent law requires disclosure of all written and verbal contracts and modifications. National security law experts said the failure to disclose such discussions could spur additional scrutiny of Flynn if Justice Department officials were to determine the missing material was legally significant. The law “says disclosure has to include material fact and makes it a crime to omit such material,” said Stephen I. Vladeck, a professor and national security law expert at the University of Texas School of Law. Flynn’s foreign agent filing included only one contract signed by Flynn and Alptekin. The contract did not mention any adjustments made verbally, Alptekin’s lobbying demands, arranging for allotting payments or any consulting role for Alptekin’s company, Inovo BV. In the filing, Flynn’s firm said the description of each payment back to Inovo as a “consultancy fee” came from the firm’s accounting records. Similar “consultancy fee” entries described payments to other members of the team hired for the work. Asked about the discrepancies between Alptekin’s statements and the filing, Kelner said: “We’ll stick with what’s in the filing.” Kelner declined to answer additional questions from the AP about the payment arrangement. In a brief statement Tuesday, Alptekin again said the payments to his firm from Flynn Intel were refunds for unperformed work. Alptekin also suggested that Flynn Intel’s description of the payments as consulting fees was an accounting error. Flynn Intel’s work last year centered on developing evidence for a criminal case against Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, wants Gulen extradited because he believes Gulen inspired last year’s attempted coup against him. Flynn and Alptekin have, at times, provided inconsistent explanations of the work. Alptekin said last fall that his company paid only tens of thousands of dollars, but later acknowledged that the $530,000 in payments listed in Flynn’s foreign agent filing was correct. Alptekin’s contention that Flynn didn’t carry out any lobbying also appears to conflict with Flynn’s filing with the Justice Department since the firm reported lobbying activity. It registered with Congress as a lobbyist in September, and Flynn Intel and a contracted public relations firm disclosed lobbying a House committee and an Arkansas state official. ___ Have a tip about this story?

Many say income gaps. I'd say... not quite. I'd say income anxiety and the stress over what it now takes to secure and hold a good job. I believe the accelerations set loose by Silicon Valley in technology and digital globalisation have created a world where every decent job demands more skill and, now, lifelong learning. More people can't keep up, and clearly some have reached for leaders who promise to stop the wind. Get The Straits Times newsletters in your inbox Sign Up Let me elaborate through a few conversations, starting with Mr Brian Krzanich, the chief executive of Intel, who recently remarked to me: "I believe my grandchildren will not drive." Since he has teenage daughters, that means self-driving vehicles should be fully deployed in 25 years, at which time you won't "steer" your car but will program it on a smartphone or watch or glasses. Sounds like fun - unless you're one of the millions who drive a truck or cab for a living. But don't think you're safe as an accountant, either. Mr Mark Bohr, Intel's senior fellow for technology, explained to me that Intel's main workhorse microprocessor today is the 14-nanometre chip it introduced in 2014. It packs 37.5 million transistors per square millimetre. By the end of this year, thanks to Moore's Law, Intel will begin producing a 10nm chip that will pack "100 million transistors per square millimetre - more than double the previous density with less heat and power usage", said Mr Bohr. If you think machines are smart today... wait a year. It's this move from 14nm to 10nm chips that will help enable carmakers to shrink the brain of a self-driving car - a brain that has to take in sensor data from 360 degrees and instantly process whether it's a dog, a human, a biker or another car - from something that fills a whole trunk to a small box under the front seat, so these cars can scale. When you get that much processing power, putting out that much data exhaust with ever-improving software, you create a world where we can analyse, prophesy and optimise with a precision unknown in human history. We can see trends we never saw, predict when engine parts will break and replace them before they do, with great savings, and we can optimise everything - from the most energy-saving flight path for an airplane to the ideal drilling path for a natural gas well. I recently visited the control room at Devon Energy, a large oil and gas producer, in Oklahoma City. It's half a floor of computer screens displaying data coming out of every well Devon is drilling around the world. At the bottom of each screen are two boxes that blew my mind. One box displays how much money was budgeted to drill that particular well per foot, and the other box displays - in real time - how much the drilling of that well is actually costing, as it bores through different rocks, and it's updated every foot. A typical well might involve sending a pipe 3km down and then turning horizontally for 3km east or west - with such precision it can hit a seam of gas as small as 6m wide. If you're working on a Devon oil rig today, you're holding a computer, not just an oily wrench. And if you're getting a degree in auto mechanics at a community college today, it's not to be a "grease monkey". It's to be a repairman for a computer with wheels. The notion that we can go to college for four years and then spend that knowledge for the next 30 is over. If you want to be a lifelong employee anywhere today, you have to be a lifelong learner. And that means: More is now on you . And that means self-motivation to learn and keep learning becomes the most important life skill. That's why education-to-work expert Heather E. McGowan likes to say: "Stop asking a young person WHAT you want to be when you grow up. It freezes their identity into a job that may not be there. Ask them HOW you want to be when you grow up. Having an agile learning mindset will be the new skill set of the 21st century." Some are up for that, some not, and many want to but don't know how, which is why the College Board has reshaped the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) and Preliminary SAT (PSAT) exams to encourage lifelong learning. "We analysed 250,000 students from the high school graduating Class of 2017 who took the new PSAT and then the new SAT," College Board president David Coleman told me. "Students who took advantage of their PSAT results to launch their own free personalised improvement practice through (non-profit company) Khan Academy advanced dramatically: 20 hours of practice was associated with an average 115-point increase from the PSAT to the SAT - double the average gain among students who did not. "Practice advances all students without respect to high school GPA (grade point average), gender, race and ethnicity or parental education. And it's free. "Our aim is to transform the SAT into an invitation for students to own their future." So the tough news is that more will be on you. The good news is that systems - like the Khan-College Board - are emerging everywhere to enable anyone to accelerate learning for the age of acceleration. Step back from all of this and it's clear that thriving countries today won't elect a strongman. They'll elect leaders who inspire and equip their citizens to be strong people who can own their own futures.

Intel snaps up Nervana for a crash course on deep learning Is this the year IoT standards will finally make sense? Video Windows 10 S hands-on Research into artificial intelligence is going gangbusters, and the frenetic pace won't let up for about five years -- after which the industry will concentrate around a handful of core technologies and leaders, the head of Intel's new AI division predicts. Intel is keen to be among them. In March, it formed an Artificial Intelligence Products Group headed by Naveen Rao. He previously was CEO of Nervana Systems, a deep-learning startup Intel acquired in 2016. Rao sees the industry moving at breakneck speed. "It's incredible," he said. "You go three weeks without reading a paper and you're behind. It's just amazing." [ Further reading: Your new PC needs these 15 free, excellent programs ] It wasn't so long ago that artificial intelligence research was solely the domain of university research labs, but tech companies have stormed into the space in the last couple of years and sent technical hurdles tumbling. "We've hit upon a set of fundamental principles, and now we can really get to that point where we can innovate and iterate quickly on them and build really new cool things," he said. Rao likened it to the development of concrete. It took a while for humans to invent and perfect concrete, but once that happened, all sorts of things suddenly became possible. "That's why I think the next five or six years are going to be really, really fast moving. It will stabilize at that point after we figure out what the stack looks like and who the players are in the stack," he said. Intel's new AI group represents its biggest step yet toward being one of those leaders. The group brings together all of the company's hardware and software research tied to machine learning, algorithms and deep learning. While Intel is best known as a chip maker, its AI research also includes software packages that help developers add AI capabilities to Intel-based hardware. By doing some of the software work, Intel aims to make it easier for its customers to build AI-based systems. That, in turn, will help it sell hardware. The company does something similar in other areas of its business. One of the areas it's already focused on is self-driving cars. The vehicles use artificial intelligence to make split-second decisions about how to navigate roads and are a good example of a research area that's seen rapid progress. Martyn Williams A car used by Intel to test the company's autonomous driving technology as seen on May 3, 2017 in San Jose, California. A lot of Intel's competition comes from the big tech companies of Silicon Valley. The U.S. is one of the biggest players in AI, thanks to companies like Google and Facebook, and Rao also credits Canada and the U.K. as pioneers. But China is beginning to make its presence felt. "I was in China a few months ago. It's really taking off," he said. "The folks there are very hungry to build these kinds of things, and the skill sets are building up really quick, so I think in the next couple of years you'll start seeing China be a major player."

Windows device makers have released their own versions of the Surface Pro 4 for two years now. The Samsung Galaxy Book 12-Inch improves on the design and adds new features. Both the Galaxy Book 12-Inch and Surface Pro 4 are for the person that needs a laptop and a tablet. They blend the two form factors together by offering add-on keyboards with touchpads for getting things done. The same productivity programs that make laptops indispensable are available on the Galaxy Book and Surface Pro 4. Users can remove their keyboards to get a tablet-like experience and touch-friendly apps. Read: Surface Pro 4 Review: The Best There Is Before you buy a Surface Pro 4, you should consider buying the Samsung Galaxy Book. Look at how the two compare. Surface Pro 4 vs Samsung Galaxy Book: Design & Durability The Samsung Galaxy Book 12-inch’s edges taper so it is more comfortable to hold. This curved edge also makes the tablet look thinner than it is. The Galaxy Book 12-inch is 0.29-inches thick. It weighs 1.58 pounds. You’ll barely notice it in a bag. The only physical buttons on it are the power button and volume controls. Surface Pro 4’s edges don’t curve at all, which makes it feel a bit thick when you pick it up. Surface Pro 4 can weigh as little as 1.73 pounds. That more than the Galaxy Book 12-inch. The lightest and least powerful Surface Pro 4 still weighs 1.69 pounds and is 0.33-inches thick. Surface Pro 4 includes a built-in kickstand directly into it. There are times that you don’t want a keyboard but do want to see your device’s display from afar. On the other hand, that kickstand contributes to the heft of the device. The Galaxy Book uses a kickstand on its keyboard cover to hold itself up. You lose access to that kickstand when you remove the keyboard, but you end up with something that’s thinner and feels like a tablet when you’re reading, watching videos or playing games. Surface Pro 4 vs Samsung Galaxy Book: Screen, Processors & Storage Space Microsoft uses its PixelSense technology for the 12.3-inch 2736 x 1824 display inside the Surface Pro 4. The screen supports pressure sensitive digital pens and gestures. It’s more detailed than a high-definition television set. The Galaxy Book 12-inch’s 2160 x 1440 display isn’t as sharp. Samsung is reusing its Super AMOLED screen technology from the Galaxy smartphones for the Galaxy Book 12-inch. Colors are brighter and blacks are very dark. There’s also HDR or High-Dynamic Range color contrast technology at work here, Samsung says. You should find the Galaxy Book’s display more vibrant. The Galaxy Book works with the S-Pen and can sense pressure when users are writing with it. Processors, RAM & Storage Surface Pro 4 tablets were the first to come with 6th Generation Intel processors. The cheapest Intel Core M3 model has 4GB of RAM to back up its entry-level processor. Intel Core M3 allowed Microsoft to make a Surface Pro 4 without a fan. Unfortunately, this model doesn’t perform all that well outside of word processing, browsing the web and watching videos. The Intel Core i5 and Intel Core i7 models have 8GB and 16GB RAM options. 128GB, 256GB, 512GB and 1TB storage options are available directly from Microsoft Store. The Galaxy Book 12-inch has 7th Generation Intel Core i5 processors inside. Intel says that these latest processors handle high-resolution video and 4K video more efficiently than their older chips. They’re also slightly faster than the processors in Surface Pro 4. The Galaxy Book 12-inch devices have 8GB of RAM or 4GB of RAM. Samsung is keeping storage simple with 256GB and 128GB options. Surface Pro 4 vs Samsung Galaxy Book: Ports & Extras The Galaxy Book 12-inch comes with USB Type-C. It’s a new port that you may have seen on new Android phones as well. USB Type-C allows you to create workstations that require just a single cable to get going. They also offer fast transfer speeds. The Galaxy Book uses USB Type-C to connect to other devices and fully charge in less than three hours. That’s really fast. There’s also a headset jack and MicroSD storage slot. Microsoft uses a full-size USB 3.0 port on Surface Pro 4. You can avoid carrying around dongles and adapters to connect to your favorite accessories because of this. There’s a MicroSD card slot for more storage and a headset jack too. Surface Connect, a port of Microsoft’s own design, handles charging and connecting to docking stations. Samsung’s decision to use USB Type-C is more forward thinking. Soon all our devices will use a single cable to charge and connect to each other. That future’s far off though. Today, a full-size USB 3.0 port makes life easier for most buyers. Accessories Samsung is the world’s biggest Android smartphone maker, so chances are that you have a Samsung Galaxy phone. The Galaxy Book’s Flow software allows you to transfer files to and from your Samsung smartphone with ease. The notifications that you get on your phone sync between the two. You can use the Galaxy Book as a GPS navigation device thanks to an internal GPS sensor. The Galaxy Book is compatible with Samsung S-Pen and a keyboard cover, just like the Surface Pro 4. This keyboard’s kickstand props the device up for better viewing angles. There’s a touchpad built into it for easy navigation. You may want to take photos with Samsung’s tablet. The Galaxy Book’s 13-megapixel rear-facing camera has nearly twice the picture quality of the Surface Pro 4’s 8-megapixel camera. Read: 6 Best Surface Pro 4 Keyboards The Surface Pro 4 does come equipped with a Windows Hello camera sensor that lets you sign in to Windows without typing in your password. The Galaxy Book 12-inch doesn’t. Its 5-megapixel front-facing camera is strictly for taking self-portraits. The Galaxy Book scores against the Surface Pro 4 in another major way. With the Surface Pro 4, you’ll need to find an internet connection or tether to your phone to browse the web. The Galaxy Book 12-inch will have a Verizon model that gives it access to websites on its own. Surface Pro 4 vs Samsung Galaxy Book: Battery Life We expect all our devices to get us through a long day. The Samsung Galaxy Book can last an impressive 11 hours during video playback. That’s a stark contrast from the 9 hours of video playback that Microsoft promises for Surface Pro 4. It’s certainly enough for another movie on a long flight. The Galaxy Book should last longer when browsing the web or working in productivity apps too. Surface Pro 4 vs Samsung Galaxy Book: Price The Surface Pro 4 with Intel Core M3 processor, 128GB of storage and 4GB of RAM now costs $799. An Intel Core i5 model with 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM is $1,199. $1,499 gets you an Intel Core i7 Surface Pro 4 with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. These prices include the Surface Pen and exclude the $129.99 Surface Type Cover. A keyboard and the cheapest Surface Pro 4 will cost you $928. Read: Best Surface Pro 4 Deals Samsung gives shoppers the tools they need with the tablet. Both the Galaxy Book keyboard and S-Pen come with each device on Samsung.com. $1,329.99 gets buyers a device with 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage and an Intel Core i5 processor. The $1,129.99 Galaxy Book 12-inch with 4GB of RAM and Intel Core i5 processor is $1,129.99. The Galaxy Book that includes Verizon mobile data, 4GB of RAM and 8GB of storage is $1,299.99. Surface Pro 4 vs Samsung Galaxy Book: Which to Buy? The Surface Pro 4 inspired lots of companies to make a tablet that could replace the notebook. It’s still a good option. Buy the cheapest Surface Pro 4, if you’re looking to save some money. Buy the more expensive versions, if you want a Core i7 processor and 1TB of storage. The Samsung Galaxy Book Is the better buy today. It offers more battery life so that users can stay productive or entertained longer. It’s thinner and lighter than Surface Pro 4. Its cameras are better, and built-in mobile data and GPS allow users to stay connected without the help of Wi-Fi or their phone’s data plan. The Galaxy Book 12-inch also more likely to work with the phone that’s in your pocket. You get everything that you need in the box. Those with their eye on the future should check out the Samsung Galaxy Book. Samsung.com is already taking pre-orders. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

The disagreement points to inconsistencies in Flynn's accounts to the U.S. government about his work for interests outside the United States. Flynn's company, Flynn Intel Group, told the Justice Department in March that the two $40,000 payments were consulting fees for unspecified work. But Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin has told The Associated Press that the payments from Flynn's firm were refunds for unperformed lobbying. The difference matters because Flynn's foreign business relationships and the veracity of his disclosures are under scrutiny by congressional, military and intelligence inquiries. Congressional committees and the Pentagon's inspector general are separately examining whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. His firm's Turkish work occurred while he was a top Trump campaign adviser. On Monday, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates told senators that Flynn's misstatements about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. raised concerns that Flynn could be targeted for blackmail. Yates also cited the possibility that Flynn could have broken federal law by operating as a paid foreign agent for the Turkish client without U.S. government permission. The retired Army lieutenant general and former chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency formally told the Justice Department in March that his now-defunct Flynn Intel Group was paid $530,000 for operating as a foreign agent for Alptekin's firm, Inovo BV, and performing work that could have benefited the Turkish government. That filing, prompted by Justice Department pressure, came just weeks after Trump fired Flynn from his national security post. The president has said he made the decision after it became clear Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The paperwork Flynn filed with the Justice Department raised new questions because it cited two consulting payments back to Alptekin's company without specifying what, if any, work was performed. Alptekin told the AP in an email that the payments were refunds guided by a verbal agreement he worked out last year with Flynn Intel that set out how much Flynn's firm was to receive each month for lobbying and other contractual work. When Alptekin didn't see any lobbying work, he said, he asked Flynn Intel to refund $80,000. But Flynn's filing with the Justice Department did not disclose those discussions or the payment arrangements cited by Alptekin. The U.S. foreign agent law requires disclosure of all written and verbal contracts and modifications. National security law experts said the failure to disclose such discussions could spur additional scrutiny of Flynn if Justice Department officials were to determine the missing material was legally significant. The law "says disclosure has to include material fact and makes it a crime to omit such material," said Stephen I. Vladeck, a professor and national security law expert at the University of Texas School of Law. Flynn's foreign agent filing included only one contract signed by Flynn and Alptekin. The contract did not mention any adjustments made verbally, Alptekin's lobbying demands, arranging for allotting payments or any consulting role for Alptekin's company, Inovo BV. In the filing, Flynn's firm said the description of each payment back to Inovo as a "consultancy fee" came from the firm's accounting records. Similar "consultancy fee" entries described payments to other members of the team hired for the work. Asked about the discrepancies between Alptekin's statements and the filing, Flynn's lawyer, Robert Kelner, said: "We'll stick with what's in the filing." Kelner declined to answer additional questions from the AP about the payment arrangement. In a brief statement Tuesday, Alptekin again said the payments to his firm from Flynn Intel were refunds for unperformed work. Alptekin also suggested that Flynn Intel's description of the payments as consulting fees was an accounting error. Flynn Intel's work last year centered on developing evidence for a criminal case against Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania. Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, wants Gulen extradited because he believes Gulen inspired last year's attempted coup against him. Flynn and Alptekin have, at times, provided inconsistent explanations of the work. Alptekin said last fall that his company paid only tens of thousands of dollars, but later acknowledged that the $530,000 in payments listed in Flynn's foreign agent filing was correct. Alptekin's contention that Flynn didn't carry out any lobbying also appears to conflict with Flynn's filing with the Justice Department since the firm reported lobbying activity. It registered with Congress as a lobbyist in September, and Flynn Intel and a contracted public relations firm disclosed lobbying a House committee and an Arkansas state official. ___ Have a tip about this story?

Today, the healthcare application program interface  (API) platform PokitDok announced one such partnership with Intel. They will offer an open source blockchain ledger solution called Dokchain. It will use Intel chips to record transactions and the patient’s medical history, all while immediately processing the administrative aspects of the patient’s care. That means hospital staff can spend less time on bureaucracy and more time with patients. Some blockchain experts say this technology could simplify the medical industry’s infrastructure, just like bitcoin uses blockchain ledgers for digital currency exchanges. PokitDok already has raised $48 million and garnered support from 40 industry influencers, including Amazon, Capital One, Guardian and Ascension. Although PokitDok attracted notable interest from established tech power players, that API platform isn’t the only game in town. Read: UN Using Blockchain Technology To Help Refugees, Fight World Hunger “Estonia has done it and it works,” entrepreneur Chrissa McFarlane told International Business Times. “And they don’t have any issues with breach of patient health information.” Last year, Estonian authorities partnered with the blockchain security firm Guardtime to secure more than 1 million health care records. Estonia is now the first country to nationalize a blockchain healthcare system, which Quartz called “the world’s most hack-proof health care records.” Dubai’s healthcare ecosystem took note and is currently experimenting with its own blockchain solutions. .   Meanwhile, many American hospitals and clinics still keep their recorders on internal servers. A 2015 survey by the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society indiated around 4 percent of American hospitals spend more than $10 million a year on cybersecurity, and 33 percent of hospitals couldn’t estimate their cybersecurity costs. McFarlane was inspired by Estonia’s success to launch her own blockchain startup in Atlanta, Patientory, to offer a more affordable solution for health care providers. “We’re building a blockchain network to secure patient health care information,” McFarlane said. “It’s encrypted and the information is cut up and distributed across the network, that helps secure the information.” This year Patientory will launch a nationwide pilot program with Kaiser Permanente, handling more than 25,000 records for chronically ill patients. Its system also has a corresponding app for patients, to help them communicate directly with their doctors. Read: 3 Things You Need To Know About Ethereum, The Next Big Thing In Cryptocurrency Even for patients who don’t need constant contact with their doctors, blockchain medical records could prove incredibly convenient. For example, a blockchain system could replace paperwork with a quick digital records transfer. It could also have wider implications for prescription drugs, billing and insurance. “Instead of waiting 90-180 days for a claim to be processed, or spending hours on the phone trying to get your bill paid, it can in theory be processed on the spot,” TechCrunch reported. Could blockchain be a panacea for the broken health care system? The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology recently chose 15 research papers about blockchain innovation for healthcare, which will be discussed at a government-sponsored conference in September. Maybe the U.S. will be the next country to follow in Estonia’s footsteps.   Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

Intel Editorial: Driverless Cars Need Assorted Processors, Like Golfers Need Many Clubs Intel Offers Specialized Tools Perfectly Suited to Each Data Type Created by Autonomous Cars Kathy Winter, vice president and general manager of the Automated Driving Solutions Division at Intel Corporation, writes: "Just as you need different clubs to get you through 18 holes of golf, you need different kinds of processors to 'drive' an autonomous car."

Golf is one of my favorite pastimes and despite my very high handicap, I enjoy both the mental and physical challenge of the game. It takes a certain amount of strategy and creativity to decide which clubs to use along the way. Some shots are fairly obvious: a driver off the tee, a wedge for the sand trap or a putter for the green. Others require a bit more ingenuity, such as a 3-iron to punch out from under a tree. I like to think of my bag of clubs as my golfing toolkit – each club chosen to provide optimal performance and power for the circumstances. My bag of clubs also provides a useful analogy for thinking about Intel’s approach to autonomous car design. Just as you need different clubs to get you through 18 holes of golf, you need different kinds of processors to “drive” an autonomous car. Take sensors as an example. Each type of sensor generates a very different kind of data: cameras generate pixels, LIDAR generates point clouds and RADAR generates analog waveforms. All of these data types need to be processed differently. And if you were developing an autonomous car brain, you would choose very specialized tools perfectly suited to each data type rather than a single gaming processor for all of it. The same is true for artificial intelligence inside the car. We often hear that the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in autonomous cars is for “computer vision,” and that a specific kind of computing element can be used for all AI in autonomous driving. But that’s an incomplete picture of the challenge. Artificial intelligence is much more than computer vision and is, in fact, used throughout the driverless car to do everything from natural language processing to personalization to decision-making. Those are all very different kinds of AI, each with very different and unique computing needs. So instead of choosing one processor for all of the artificial intelligence tasks in the car, you need a processing toolkit with computing elements designed for each of those very different tasks. Similar to how golfers need a full bag of clubs to play the game, autonomous car designers need a suite of computing technologies to engineer an autonomous car brain. Although golf gives us an interesting way to describe the complexity of autonomous car design, I have to end my analogy there. Golf is a fun game that brings me a lot of personal challenges, but a game nonetheless. Autonomous driving is not. At Intel we know exactly how serious it is build a computing platform with the potential to save millions of lives. We also know exactly how challenging it is. If you ask the leaders in autonomous driving what kind of computer they would design for deployment in cars five years from now, none of them can tell you. The rate of change and innovation in this industry is staggering. That’s why Intel provides carmakers with a portfolio of compute technologies so developers can choose the combination that best fits their needs. It’s exactly what they’ll need to accelerate their way down the unknown road ahead. Kathy Winter is vice president and general manager of the Automated Driving Solutions Division at Intel Corporation.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Better Buy: Intel Corporation vs. Qualcomm Analyzing these two semiconductor stocks to see which is the better stock to own today. Andrew Tonner (TMFTheDude) May 10, 2017 at 12:06PM The two largest semiconductor companies in the world, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), share a long rivalry, even though they specialize in and dominate different areas of the global processor market. So let's examine Qualcomm and Intel in three important areas to find which stock looks like the better buy today. Financial fortitude Through the power of their business franchises, Intel and Qualcomm each earn a clean bill of financial health. Here's an overview of several of the most important measures for liquidity and solvency for the two companies: Company Cash and Investments Debt Cash From Operations Current Ratio Intel $17.3 billion $25.7 billion $21.6 billion 1.6 Qualcomm  $28.9 billion $11.8 billion $6.1 billion 1.6 Data sources: Intel and Qualcomm investor relations and Yahoo! Finance.  The companies excel in these measures of financial fortitude in different regards. When it comes to net cash -- financial shorthand for cash and investments minus debt -- Qualcomm's $17.1 billion in net cash is miles ahead of Intel's $8.4 billion in net debt. It should be noted, though, that Intel's capital structure should be more leveraged than Qualcomm's, since Intel owns its own chip-fabrication foundries, which require significant annual capital expenditures. Qualcomm, on the other hand, outsources its foundry needs, making its business model more capital-light. Intel enjoys an overwhelming advantage against Qualcomm in the cash generation of its core operations, although the company's capex requirements are also much higher than those of Qualcomm. However, this advantage is so disproportionate that it tips the balance between the two companies. This preposterous cash-flow production gives Intel so much more flexibility in terms of pursuing acquisitions, moving into new areas of business, rewarding its shareholders, and the like that this alone makes Intel more desirable than Qualcomm on this count. Winner: Intel. Image source: Getty Images Durable competitive advantage Intel and Qualcomm each exhibit dominant business models under normal circumstances. That "normal" qualifier matters, especially in Qualcomm's case, because the status quo at the San Diego-based chipmaker is anything but normal. Qualcomm generates about two-thirds of its sales from its mobile-chip business and 85% of its pre-tax profits from its patent licensing division. This intellectual-property licensing segment uses Qualcomm's trove of patents to collect royalties from mobile-device makers that use critical 3G and 4G technologies Qualcomm helped invent. Unfortunately for Qualcomm, it's been stung by a series of fines and antitrust lawsuits from a growing list that includes the Chinese government, South Korean regulators, the European Union, the Federal Trade Commission, and Apple. All told, the resultant penalties -- both paid and those still outstanding -- total nearly $3 billion, and Qualcomm has vowed to fight the ongoing legal battles. So while Qualcomm's business is formidable under normal circumstances, it's hard to tell how circumstances could change for the company in the next year or two. On the other hand, Intel's primary problems have been growth-related. The company dominates the markets for PC and server microprocessors, which gives it a massive base of high-margin sales. However, product-development missteps caused Intel fail to capture much of the massive growth that the smartphone market unleashed over the past decade, much to Qualcomm's and others' benefit. Intel is determined to learn from that mistake. It has moved aggressively to produce chips that cater to some of the largest tech trends of the day, areas such as the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence. For example, Intel raised eyebrows in the tech community when it paid $15.3 billion for self-driving-car hardware start-up Mobileye. Intel claims the transaction opens it to a $100 billion long-term opportunity. Under normal circumstances, it might be hard to determine which of the two companies enjoyed better competitive dynamics. However, because of Qualcomm's legal woes and Intel's aggressive efforts to break into next-gen growth markets, Intel wins this segment of our analysis. Winner: Intel. Valuation Intel and Qualcomm share a lot in common in terms of their valuations. Here are three of the most commonly used valuation metrics for each name: Company  P/E  Forward P/E  EV/EBITDA  Intel 15.9  12.3 7.5 Qualcomm   17.7 10.3 10.3 Data source: Yahoo! Finance.  The two chipmakers' earnings multiples sit largely in line with one another, and Intel's lower EV/EBITDA ratio results from Intel's superior cash-flow generation. So what are the investing implications? The important thing to remember whenever you look at valuations is that they don't occur in a vacuum. Instead, investors must compare valuation to the business' current outlook to understand whether it looks like an attractive investment. Applying this point to Qualcomm and Intel, we see two companies with similar valuations but differing degrees of competitive strength. Intel is on stronger footing at present, so its valuation should also be seen as more appealing in this instance. Winner: Intel. And the winner is... Intel Between the two, it requires far less imagination to predict what will happen to Intel. As a large company flexing its muscle as an incumbent, Intel is unlikely to remain the de facto power in the PC and server markets. This financial power will also allow it to successfully bull-rush its way into important growth markets. Given its size, it's unlikely to produce ten-bagger returns, but the future generally appears positive. Qualcomm, on the other hand, remains much more of a wild card. given the complexity of its legal woes. If the current suits are proved invalid, those holding its shares could be treated to some kind of a relief rally. However, a potential negative ruling could threaten its entire patent licensing business model. For that reason, Intel deserves to win this analysis as the better stock to own today.

It's a busy earnings morning, As Nvidia and Electronic Arts shares surge, while Yelp and Acacia plunge. Some said Nvidia's CEO Jen-Hsun Huang is finally reaching his tipping point as his sales of data center chips looks like it can be a serious detriment to Intel. Worries about Apple's iPhone having delays are back in the news. Also back in the news is talk of a tie-up between Sprint and T-Mobile, fueled, of course, by SoftBank chairman Masayoshi Son. By Tiernan Ray May 10, 2017 11:08 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Here are some things going on today in your world of tech: Snap (SNAP) is expected to report Q1 results tonight after the market closes, its first public report since its March 2nd IPO The Street is looking for $158 million in revenue and a net loss of 21 cents, with a wide variety of expectations for user growth, from zero to 10%. Should be interesting. The stock is down 26 cents, or 1%, at $23.06, just below its first-day close of $24.48. Here’s Nvidia’s moment Shares of graphics chip maker Nvidia (NVDA) are up after last night’s better-than-expected fiscal Q1 and outlook, which is leading some bulls to say the company is giving Intel (INTC) serious trouble in the data center, Intel’s stronghold. Some bears are coming around, though others insist there are signs of slowing growth in Nvidia’s report. Shares of Nvidia competitor Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), by the way, are up 48 cents, or almost 5%, at $10.66, in sympathy. Cloud spending Speaking of the data center, RBC Capital’s Amit Daryanani, who follows names such as Western Digital (WDC), writes that capital spending on cloud computing by companies such as Amazon (AMZN) slowed in Q1, by his estimate, dropping 14% from Q4’s level, even though it was still up 8%, year over year. Daryanani thinks this year will continue to see “tough comparisons” to last year, when spending rose 17%. But it may still be up 13%, which is very good, he thinks, for chip makers such as Nvidia and for storage companies such as Western. Toshiba V. WDC Speaking of Western, following reports yesterday that Toshiba (6502JP) pushed back against Western in the debate between the two over the sale of Toshiba’s flash-memory-chip unit, J.P. Morgan’s Rod Hall, who follows Western stock, writes today that “it is difficult to know how much of this is posturing and how much is real,” but that "we do see increased short term risk to NAND supply continuity given the nature of the comments allegedly coming from Toshiba." Western stock today is up 60 cents, or 0.7%, at $89.48. Sprint and T-Mo tie-up back in the news SoftBank chairman Masayoshi Son said that he will “aim to launch negotiations” between Sprint (S), in which he is the top shareholder, and T-Mobile US (TMUS), as reports Kana Inagaki of The Financial Times this morning. Son told the audience at a press conference for SoftBank’s financial results that he is open to other partnerships that would “re-align” the wireless industry “under better conditions.” Shares of T-Mobile are up 75 cents, or 1%, at $66.25, while shares of Sprint are up 9 cents, or 1%, at $7.99. Apple iPhone worries resurface Another thing that’s back in the news today are worries about delays for Apple’s (AAPL) next iPhone. After the report of Lumentum Holdings (LITE) last week seemed to relieve worries about a production issue for the device, a new missive from Ming Chi Kuo yesterday suggested that Apple "is still facing production difficulties,” according to a write-up by 9to5 Mac’s Chance Miler. Apple shares today are down $1.05, or 0.7%, at $152.94. Yelp, help! Shares of local listings and reviews purveyor Yelp (YELP) are down $8.64, or 25%, at $26.06, in early trading, backing off from the worst levels of last night’s sell-off as RBC Capital’s Mark Mahaney and others throw in the towel after the company cut its year outlook. But Goldman Sachs’s Heath Terry actually raised his rating to a Buy, writing that the sell-off offers opportunity given Yelp's sudden rise in users last quarter. Nutanix now a value? Shares of storage technology vendor Nutanix (NTNX) are up 70 cents or 4.4%, at $16.97, after Morgan Stanley’s Katy Huberty raised her rating on the shares this morning to Equal Weight from Underweight, writing that after 46% underperformance, this year relative to the S&P 500, worries of higher commodity costs (NAND flash chips) and rising competition and problems with the sales team are all now “priced in." Still, she cut her 2018 revenue estimate on competitive risks, and trimmed her price target to $19 from $20. Acacia’s ZTE problem Shares of fiber-optic component supplier Acacia Communications (ACIA) are down $4.66, or almost 10%, at $43.75, after the company yesterday topped Q1 expectations but forecast this quarter's results well below consensus. While worries about a slowdown in China have weighed on fiber stocks, Jun Zhang of Rosenblatt Securities this morning writes that the issue may be specifically about Acacia customer ZTE (0763HK). Writes Zhang, "Acacia’s June quarter guidance is consistent with our thoughts since we believe ZTE’s June quarter procurement will be down 20-30% sequentially,” as ZTE goes through a "continuous inventory correction." Game on with EA Shares of Electronic Arts (EA) are up $12.36, or 13%, at $108.37, after the company yesterday afternoon reported fiscal Q4 revenue of $1.092 billion, meeting Street expectations, and beat by ten cents with EPS of 85 cents. It is the second positive major game maker report since last week’s Activision-Blizzard (ATVI) report. MKM Partners’ Eric Handler writes that coming into the call, investors had been braced for a glum outlook for this year given some downbeat remarks by the company last quarter. “We believe buysiders were bracing for a $4.00 EPS guidance for the year,” he observes. "Instead EA is beginning FY18 with a $4.10 EPS outlook, a solid starting point in our view especially since the Bioware studio's new action game was pushed out into FY19." Handler reiterates a Buy rating on the shares, and raises his price target to $112 from $109, arguing the outlook may yet prove “conservative,” given the company’s beaten its forecast each of the last four years by 10%. http://www.barrons.com/articles/activision-halted-q1-tops-expectations-q2-view-higher-1493929668 Text Size Regular Medium Large Tiernan Ray tiernan.ray@barrons.com • @barronstechblog PREVIOUS Nvidia Surges: Inflection Point, Say Bulls, Even Some Bears Coming Around NEXT Nvdia, Sprinting from FYQ1 Triumph, Discusses 'Volta' Most Popular Snap CEO Spiegel Explains They Don’t ‘Growth Hack’ Valeant Pharmaceuticals: The End of the Beginning?

Server division president Ashley Gorakhpurwalla told us that he and other product area presidents in Dell EMC all know about the new 14G technologies but can't tell anyone. That tells us a few things, though. One is that the 14G boxes will use processors with the new Xeon Scalable Platform with its Platinum to Bronze branding, which has just been announced. A second is that 14G is largely about new Intel chips and technology. We're not being told model numbers, DRAM amounts, CPU types, sockets, cores, system-on-a-chip (SoC) capabilities or central processor offload chips like GPUs, FPGAs, Phis, or new non-volatile memory like Optane, or communications fabric links between these components. Which tells us that the 14G servers, being used by most of the storage hardware inside Dell EMC, depend on this Intel stuff, the CPU and ancillary chips, for the performance improvements. We did see a PowerEdge M640 Blade server in the Dell EMC World exhibition, an update on the existing M630. This was, the stand guy said, an upcoming server. Might this be an early sighting of a 14G box? Upcoming Dell EMC PowerEdge M640 Blade server 14G processor The 14G processor will be, we think, Skylake-SP (Scalable Platform), Intel's 14nm Xeon E5 v5 technology with a redesigned architecture compared to the current Broadwell v3 and v4 Xeons, also using 14nm tech. These server Xeons are due, we understand, in the second half of this year and will use the AVX-512 instruction set extension. Intel also has Purley coming out, a server platform optimised for Skylake CPUs and Optane 3D Xpoint technology. The server platform is what carries the ancillary chips and chip-level communications fabric. We believe the 14G servers will use the Purley platform with Skylake CPUs. They will use NVMe drives and some form of Optane 3D Xpoint memory, currently announced by Intel in DC P4800X SSD form. Optane as memory will be supported by the Kaby Lake processors and a 200 series chipset, the follow-on to Skylake. Purley will not support Optane memory (Apache Pass). Summing up The Dell EMC World message is that 14G server power is coming, that it will be great but we can't tell you how much and we can't tell you why and when this will happen. Beta test customers are checking out the new 14G servers but can't say anything about them either, it being an Intel-orchestrated conspiracy of silence. When Intel announces its news, probably in the summer, then Dell, Cisco, HPE, Lenovo, Supermicro and the other server suppliers will blast out the same news as it relates to their products.

By Mark Hachman Senior Editor, PCWorld | May 10, 2017 8:00 AM PT Credit: Harman / Kardon More like this Harman Kardon teases the Invoke speaker, a Cortana-powered Echo competitor Windows 10's 500 million devices snub Cortana, impacting Microsoft's AI push Microsoft's next Surface may be a Chromebook competitor for schools Video Microsoft Surface Laptop hands-on Two more hardware manufacturers are lining up behind Microsoft’s new Cortana-powered appliances: HP and Intel, indicating that Microsoft is turning to its tried-and-true PC partners to usher Cortana into the living room. Microsoft announced support from both companies at its Build conference in Seattle on Wednesday, though what each company will eventually manufacture isn’t known. According to Microsoft, the company signed a partnership with HP to build products, and with Intel to provide reference platforms for Cortana-powered devices. Though an alliance with HP is nothing to scoff at, Intel’s support should make the most difference. So far, Cortana competitors like Google Home and Amazon’s small ecosystem of Alexa-powered Echo devices are made just by the individual companies themselves. Intel has established relationships with numerous Asian suppliers, who use Intel’s reference designs as foundations to build their own PCs and gadgets. Intel’s support will help these same companies start building intelligent devices, roo. [ Further reading: We name the best high-resolution digital audio players ] HP, meanwhile, has played its role as a Microsoft hardware partner to the hilt. Microsoft designed its Surface devices as a sort of category-defining product that would eventually be rivaled by products from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, and other PC builders. HP’s Elite x2 convertible tablet looks remarkably like a Surface tablet, but with an improved kickstand, and its Sprout arguably treads the same creativity path as the Surface Studio. It appears HP will take advantage of Cortana to push into the living room. HP and Intel-powered products will compete with the Harman/Kardon Invoke, a desktop speaker that uses Cortana. Harman, which announced the Invoke in the days leading up to Build, has said it will ship its Invoke speaker in the fall. It has not announced a price.  Why this matters: Microsoft may be quite late to the intelligent devices game, but tapping the PC model is a smart move. Some may scoff at legions of “Cortana clones,” but if an HP or an Intel partner can make these devices as ubiquitous as PCs, then you’ll see a lot of happy hardware makers. The persistent risk, though, is that the majority of customers who actually want an intelligent appliance have already bought one.  To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

Even some bears, impressed by its fiscal Q1 server-chip report, are coming around to that point of view. Some bears still maintain growth rates are "decelerating." By Tiernan Ray Updated May 10, 2017 10:00 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang. Illustration: Nvidia Inc. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) are up $14.41, or 14%, at $117.35, holding onto most of last night’s after-hours gains after the company brushed aside worries of a slowing market, with sales into cloud computing data centers surprising to the upside. While price targets are rising at several shops, even some bears are coming around to the view the company is challenging Intel (INTC) in the data center. Remember that the company will today hold its annual analyst day meeting, following a keynote by CEO Jen-Hsun Huang at the GTC Graphics conference in California. Nvidia “simply crushed it,” writes Rosenblatt Securities’s Hans Mosesmann, reiterating a Buy rating, and raising his price target to $152 from $140. The company has “hit a historic infection point,” he writes. "GPUs for computing purposes are no longer just the domain of academia and high performance compute, they are being deployed by ALL the major hyper-scale players and this train has left the station." Moreover, "The strange sense of unease that investors felt after Intel’s recent earnings call now has a name and it’s called Nvidia." BMO Capital’s Ambrish Srivastava, who has a Sell on the stock, and who asked before the call if this was the quarter the company’s video game business would break down, this morning writes that despite an “impressive” show from the data center business, he still sees several points about which to be concerned: Much better and impressive Datacenter business but with no GM leverage, lower opex, balanced by sharply decelerating core gaming business, and a balance sheet where inventory is at a multi-year high and where A/R jumped 18% on a down 11% q-q quarter. But some bears are coming around. Morgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore this morning writes that he’s been “too stubborn” sticking with an Equal Weight rating on the shares, although he continues to do so, while raising his price target to $125 from $115. He data center business was “exceptional,” now challenging Intel’s role in that market: The headline is data center up 38% quarter on quarter, and up 186% y/y, now up to 20% of revenues - with NVIDIA capturing more dollar y/y growth in data center than Intel. This is truly an exceptional result, in our view, emphasizing just how rapidly computing is shifting towards GPU solutions around trends such as machine learning and AI. NVIDIA's data center business grew by $266 million vs. the year ago quarter, surprisingly roughly the same as Intel (whose data center business is over ten times larger than NVIDIA's), which grew its data center business by $233 million year over year. We were surprised by the growth in high performance computing in particular, which was up over 100% y/y, but growth in deep learning and virtualization also maintain a rapid pace. As far as the stock, he’s looking to buy: We have been constructive on the stock, including in our preview for this report, but have been too stubborn staying with an EW rating based on valuation and our view that gaming would start to have weaker y/y comparisons later this year, which could pressure the multiple. Our view of the data center opportunity is starting to trump those concerns, and the decline in gaming in 1q actually derisks the story somewhat. We still think that the gaming cycle of 2016 creates nearly impossibly tough comparisons, so we would expect the nervous volatility to continue, but we would look for that as a buying opportunity. We continue to build our price target around a 30x multiple on CY18, plus cash, a premium to the group based on the superior growth drivers in the data center business. Canaccord Genuity’s Matthew Ramsay reiterates a Buy rating and a $125 price target, writing that “growth was broad based across the business segments and while gaming GPU sales were up an impressive 49% Y/Y, gaming came in slightly below our/consensus estimates." "Overall, our positive thesis continues to play out,” he continues, "with strong gaming GPU growth expected to continue in F'18 and beyond while acknowledging Y/Y growth compares will toughen in coming quarters, and we believe new trends including deep learning, virtual/augmented reality, and autonomous driving will catalyze new market growth longer term." B. Riley & Co.’s Craig Ellis reiterates a Buy rating, and a $135 price target, writing that "fundamentals are solid and look even more encouraging ahead” while "well publicized risks fade – seasonal weakness, license-related GM declines, and early-year profit taking." He thinks the jump in the share price accurately reflects the "surprise magnitude,” and he cites several good things ahead: 1) after a well-above-seasonal decline Gaming’s now ideally situated for sharp qq acceleration and sustained mid-teens or better yy growth, 2) Data Center’s AI adoption and sales again surprised higher helped by HPC and GRID, yet penetration has barely started versus long term potential with RILY F19 estimates still fairly muted, 3) Auto ADAS activity surged, and ramps could provide explosive late-C17 and C18 growth, 4) GM’s navigated license cessation headwinds impressively and opex remained well-controlled, so 60.0% GM/35.0% OM seems possible by mid-C18 in our view.

Business Cybersecurity Detection Disasters Government Infrastructure Public Safety Public health Regional Sci-Tech Surveillance Terrorism Transportation Water PasswordsWhy we choose terrible passwords, and how to fix them By Megan Squire Published 10 May 2017 Share | The first Thursday in May is World Password Day, but don’t buy a cake or send cards. Computer chip maker Intel created the event as an annual reminder that, for most of us, our password habits are nothing to celebrate. Instead, they – and computer professionals like me – hope we will use this day to say our final goodbyes to “qwerty” and “123456,” which are still the most popular passwords. So no more excuses. Let’s put on our party hats and start changing those passwords. World Password Day would be a great time to ditch “qwerty” for good, try out a password manager and turn on multi-factor authentication. Once you’re done, go ahead and have that cake, because you’ll deserve it. The first Thursday in May is World Password Day, but don’t buy a cake or send cards. Computer chip maker Intel created the event as an annual reminder that, for most of us, our password habits are nothing to celebrate. Instead, they – and computer professionals like me – hope we will use this day to say our final goodbyes to “qwerty” and “123456,” which are still the most popular passwords. The problem with short, predictable passwords The purpose of a password is to limit access to information. Having a very common or simple one like “abcdef” or “letmein,” or even normal words like “password” or “dragon,” is barely any security at all, like closing a door but not actually locking it. Hackers’ password cracking tools take advantage of this lack of creativity. When hackers find – or buy – stolen credentials, they will likely find that the passwords have been stored not as the text of the passwords themselves but as unique fingerprints, called “hashes,” of the actual passwords. A hash function mathematically transforms each password into an encoded, fixed-size version of itself. Hashing the same original password will give the same result every time, but it’s computationally nearly impossible to reverse the process, to derive a plaintext password from a specific hash. Instead, the cracking software computes the hash values for large numbers of possible passwords and compares the results to the hashed passwords in the stolen file. If any match, the hacker’s in. The first place these programs start is with known hash values for popular passwords. More savvy users who choose a less common password might still fall prey to what is called a “dictionary attack.” The cracking software tries each of the 171,000 words in the English dictionary. Then the program tries combined words (such as “qwertypassword”), doubled sequences (“qwertyqwerty”), and words followed by numbers (“qwerty123”). Moving on to blind guessing Only if the dictionary attack fails will the attacker reluctantly move to what is called a “brute-force attack,” guessing arbitrary sequences of numbers, letters and characters over and over until one matches. Mathematics tells us that a longer password is less guessable than a shorter password. That’s true even if the shorter password is made from a larger set of possible characters. For example, a six-character password made up of the 95 different symbols on a standard American keyboard yields 956, or 735 billion, possible combinations.

That means that the giveaway is half-way over! But don’t fret, that means we have another 10 days of prizes still to give out, so there’s still plenty of time to win. AnandTech admittedly has a pretty significant gaming focus – it’s a fun pastime and what a lot of high-end consumer systems are purchased for, after all. But then there are those of us who don’t need RGBBQ lighting or red flames, but do want a solid system for getting work done… and, okay, maybe some gaming on the side. To that end, today Supermicro is providing just what the hard-working system builder needs with a pair of products: their C7Z170-OCE Intel motherboard, and their 5130AD-T barebones system. Supermicro C7Z170-OCE Motherboard Supermicro 5130AD-T Barebones System Kit The AnandTech 20th Anniversary Celebration – Super Micro Giveaway Supermicro C7Z170-OCE Motherboard Starting things off is Supermicro’s C7Z170-OCE motherboard. Based on Intel’s Z170 chipset for Skylake and Kaby Lake, this motherboard is an interesting fusion between Supermicro’s pragmatism in design and component selection, and their desire to cross-over with the consumer gaming market. The end result is an ATX board with all of the bells and whistles you need – things like USB 3.1 (Gen 2) ports, an M.2 slot, dual GigE LAN ports, Realtek ALC1150 audio, and an overall sever-grade build quality – without going overboard on superfluous features. Instead, Supermicro puts their attention on PCIe bandwidth, using a PEX 8747 PCIe switch to allow the board’s 3 PCIe x16 slots to split up 32 lanes instead of the 16 lanes that Intel’s CPUs natively provide. Supermicro does admittedly pitch this board more at the gaming crowd as part of their Supero brand – so a focus is of course on improved PCIe bandwidth for multi-GPU – but it also means that there’s plenty of bandwidth for anything else that needs lanes from the CPU, such as high-end PCIe SSDs and accelerator cards. In any case, rounding out matters on the software side is Supermicro’s modern UEFI firmware features, such as one-touch overclocking and a BIOS recovery function. Supermicro 5130AD-T Barebones System Kit But what if you don’t want to bother with the drudgery of actually situating a motherboard and PSU inside of a case, and want to get to the fun stuff of adding the CPU and other components? Then Supermicro has you covered there as well with the 5130AD-T, our first barebones system kit for this giveaway. The 5130AD-T contains a motherboard, case, and PSU all pre-installed. The motherboard is the company’s C7Z270-PG, an Intel Z270 chipset ATX board featuring no shortage of PCIe x16 slots thanks to a PEX 8747 PCIe switch chip, along with USB 3.1 (Gen 2) ports, dual M.2 slots (both PCIe 3.0 x4), and RealTek ALC1150 audio. The board even features a pair of U.2 ports for high-performance 2.5-inch SSDs. Powering said motherboard is a 750W 80Plus Gold PSU (PWS-753-PQ), which offers a semi-modular design for better routing. Housing the system in turn is Supermicro’s CSE-GS5A-753K, an 18.1-inch tall ATX mid-tower. The chassis features 3 pre-installed fans – 2 120mm intakes and a 120mm exhaust – with room for plenty more, including 240mm closed loop liquid coolers. Internally there are 2 5.25-inch drive bays, along with another 6 3.5-inch and 4 2.5-inch bays, all using tool-less trays for quick installation. Otherwise this is a clean and unassuming case, with rubber grommets for cable routing, sound dampening panels, and a brushed aluminum finish. Finally, as with our other giveaways, today’s giveaway is only open for 48 hours, so be sure to enter soon. However please note that for legal reasons, we’re only able to open these giveaways to residents of the United States. Good luck to everyone! And be sure to check in this afternoon for our next giveaway. Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment.

The disagreement points to inconsistencies in Flynn’s accounts to the US government about his work for foreign interests. Flynn’s company, Flynn Intel Group, told the Justice Department in March that the two $40,000 payments were consulting fees for unspecified work. But Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin has told The Associated Press that the payments from Flynn’s firm were refunds for unperformed lobbying. The difference matters because Flynn’s foreign business relationships and the veracity of his disclosures are under scrutiny by congressional, military and intelligence inquiries. Congressional committees and the Pentagon’s inspector general are separately examining whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. His firm’s Turkish work occurred while he was a top Trump campaign adviser. On Monday, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates told senators that Flynn’s misstatements about his contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the US raised concerns that he could be targeted for blackmail. Yates also cited the possibility that Flynn could have broken federal law by operating as a paid foreign agent for the Turkish client without US government permission.

That filing — prompted by Justice Department pressure — came just weeks after Trump fired Flynn from his national security post. The president has said he made the decision after it became clear Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the US The paperwork Flynn filed with the Justice Department raised new questions because it cited two consulting payments back to Alptekin’s company without specifying what, if any, work was performed. Alptekin told The Associated Press in an email that the payments were refunds guided by a verbal agreement he worked out last year with Flynn Intel that set out how much Flynn’s firm was to receive each month for lobbying and other contractual work. When Alptekin didn’t see any lobbying work, he said, he asked Flynn Intel to refund $80,000 to his firm. But Flynn’s filing with the Justice Department did not disclose those discussions or the payment arrangements cited by Alptekin. The US foreign agent law requires disclosure of all written and verbal contracts and modifications. National security law experts said the failure to disclose such discussions could spur additional scrutiny of Flynn if Justice Department officials were to determine the missing material was legally significant. The law “says disclosure has to include material fact and makes it a crime to omit such material,” said Stephen I. Vladeck, a professor and national security law expert at the University of Texas School of Law.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) Flynn’s foreign agent filing included only one contract signed by Flynn and Alptekin. The contract did not mention any adjustments made verbally, Alptekin’s lobbying demands, arranging for allotting payments or any consulting role for Alptekin’s company, Inovo BV. In the filing, Flynn’s firm said the description of each payment back to Inovo as a “consultancy fee” came from the firm’s accounting records. Similar “consultancy fee” entries described payments to other members of the team hired for the work. Asked about the discrepancies between Alptekin’s statements and the filing, Flynn’s attorney, Robert Kelner, said: “We’ll stick with what’s in the filing.” Kelner declined to answer additional questions from the AP about the payment arrangement. In a brief statement Tuesday, Alptekin again said the payments to his firm from Flynn Intel were refunds for unperformed work. Alptekin also suggested that Flynn Intel’s description of the payments as consulting fees was an accounting error. In Monday’s Senate hearing, Yates told Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat Connecticut, that Flynn could face legal trouble for failing to disclose his foreign work and payments properly. Leaders of a bipartisan House inquiry into Flynn’s foreign earnings have said they found no evidence that Flynn asked for permission from the Defense Department or the State Department to accept foreign payments, though they said any likely penalty for that violation would be fines, not prosecution. The Defense Department’s inspector general is investigating. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah. (AP/Cliff Owen) Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican-Utah, who leads the inquiry as chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, told the AP he had not looked into Flynn’s foreign agent disclosures but he “would urge the Justice Department to pursue that if they feel it’s necessary.” The panel’s senior Democrat, Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, added that Flynn’s “work on behalf of Turkey while a top national security adviser for President Trump’s campaign raises grave questions.” Flynn Intel’s work last year centered on developing evidence for a criminal case against Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wants Gulen extradited because he believes Gulen inspired last year’s attempted coup against him. The Obama administration rebuffed Turkey’s extradition requests. It’s unclear whether the Trump administration will change that stance, though US-Turkish relations have warmed under Trump, who congratulated Erdogan after a recent referendum expanded his presidential powers. International monitors called the referendum an undemocratic power grab. Alptekin said he disagrees with Flynn Intel’s decision to register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent because he says the work wasn’t orchestrated by the Turkish government and he doesn’t have any ties to Erdogan’s administration. But Alptekin serves on an economic committee overseen by Turkey’s finance ministry. In its Justice Department filing, Flynn Intel also disclosed that Alptekin had consulted with Turkish government officials about the Gulen-related work.

(Screen capture/YouTube) Flynn and Alptekin have yet to provide full and consistent explanations. Alptekin initially said last fall that his company paid only tens of thousands of dollars, but later acknowledged that the $530,000 in payments listed in Flynn’s foreign agent filing was correct. Alptekin also told the AP that his firm and Flynn Intel had agreed verbally in August to divide monthly $200,000 installments for lobbying, public relations, research and other work. That arrangement specified Flynn’s firm would be paid $40,000 a month for lobbying and $15,000 a month for public relations, Alptekin said. Alptekin justified the two $40,000 payments— one in September and the other in October— as refunds, saying he saw no evidence that Flynn Intel performed any lobbying. But Flynn’s firm reported lobbying activity. It registered with Congress as a lobbyist in September, midway through the contract. And Flynn Intel and a contracted public relations firm disclosed in their paperwork with the Justice Department that it had lobbied a House committee and an Arkansas state official.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Better Buy: Ambarella, Inc. vs. Intel Corporation Which chipmaker has more growth potential -- the tiny maker of image processing chips or the 800-pound gorilla of the PC and data center chip markets? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) May 10, 2017 at 9:00AM Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) aren't often compared to each other. Both are semiconductor companies, but the former's enterprise value of $1.5 billion is dwarfed by Intel's value of over $180 billion. Both chipmakers address different markets. Ambarella makes image processing system on chips (SoCs) for action cameras, drones, cars, and security cameras. Intel produces application processors for PCs and data centers, along with low-power chipsets for Internet of Things devices, programmable chips, and non-volatile memory chips. Image source: Getty Images. However, the companies' interests recently started overlapping in several markets like drones and connected cars. Ambarella's SoCs can process images faster for computer vision chips to analyze, which could guide drones and driverless vehicles along autonomous paths. Intel sells Atom chips for drones and connected cars, and it acquired computer vision start-up Movidius and leading ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems) manufacturer Mobileye to expand its presence across those markets. The market clearly favored Ambarella over Intel over the past 12 months. Ambarella rallied more than 50% during that period, while Intel rose just over 20%. But will those trajectories continue throughout the rest of the year? Let's examine both companies' growth potential, catalysts, challenges, and valuations to find out which stock is the better buy at current prices. How fast are Ambarella and Intel growing? Ambarella's revenue fell 2% to $310.3 million in fiscal 2017, due to waning demand for action camera SoCs, especially from its top customer GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO). Ambarella doesn't disclose how much of its revenue comes from GoPro, but its dependence on the ailing action camera seems to be waning. Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy expects GoPro orders to account for just 5% of Ambarella's revenues this year (fiscal 2018), down from a prior forecast of 10%. This shift is mainly attributed to the growth of Ambarella's security, drone, and automotive businesses offsetting its ongoing softness in action cameras. Ambarella's revenue is expected to stay roughly flat this year, but rise 14% in fiscal 2019. Image source: Ambarella. Intel's revenue rose 7.5% to $59.5 billion in fiscal 2016, but sales are expected to rise just 1% this year and 3% next year. That slowdown is mainly attributed to sluggish sales of PC and data center chips. PC sales are gradually rebounding, but Intel faces tough competition from new chips like AMD's Ryzen. Data center chip sales remain weak due to weaker enterprise spending and a lack of meaningful reasons to upgrade. To make matters worse, rivals like AMD and Qualcomm are now trying to dent Intel's near-monopoly in the data center market with new high-end server chips. Both companies face bottom-line challenges Ambarella's earnings fell 12% in fiscal 2017, and analysts anticipate another 25% decline in 2018 before a 16% rebound in 2018. That bottom-line pressure is attributed to a combination of slowing sales (due to action cameras), higher expenses, and pricing pressure from rivals in the Chinese market. Ambarella expects its full-year gross margin to dip to a multiyear low of 59%-62% this year, and it sees operating expenses rising 12%-14%. Those increased expenses were anticipated as the chipmaker shifts production over to 14nm SoCs and invests heavily in new computer vision chips, but they also indicate that investors should expect choppy bottom-line growth over the next few quarters. Intel's earnings rose 17% last year, but Wall Street expects just 5% growth this year and 4% next year. That slowdown is attributed to the company's slowing sales growth and increased investments in new 10nm manufacturing processes. Rolling out its next batch of 10nm chips (like Cannon Lake) as soon as possible can help Intel widen its moat against companies like AMD and Qualcomm. But unlike Ambarella, Intel expects both its gross and operating margins to improve this year as it cuts expenses. The valuations and verdict Ambarella trades at 35 times earnings, which is much higher than its industry average of 27. Intel trades at just 16 times earnings, which is lower than its industry average of 25. Intel also pays a forward dividend yield of 3%, while Ambarella has never paid a dividend. In the end, I believe that Intel's stable (albeit slowing) growth on the top and bottom lines, lower valuation, and decent dividend make it a better buy than Ambarella today. Ambarella certainly has great growth potential as it diversifies away from GoPro and invests in new image processing technologies, but the stock simply seems too pricey at current levels.   Leo Sun owns shares of Qualcomm.

The disagreement points to inconsistencies in Flynn’s accounts to the U.S. government about his work for foreign interests. Flynn’s company, Flynn Intel Group, told the Justice Department in March that the two $40,000 payments were consulting fees for unspecified work. But Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin has told The Associated Press that the payments from Flynn’s firm were refunds for unperformed lobbying. The difference matters because Flynn’s foreign business relationships and the veracity of his disclosures are under scrutiny by congressional, military and intelligence inquiries. Congressional committees and the Pentagon’s inspector general are separately examining whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. His firm’s Turkish work occurred while he was a top Trump campaign adviser. On Monday, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates told senators that Flynn’s misstatements about his contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. raised concerns that he could be targeted for blackmail. Yates also cited the possibility that Flynn could have broken federal law by operating as a paid foreign agent for the Turkish client without U.S. government permission. The retired Army lieutenant general and former chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency formally told the Justice Department in March that his now-defunct Flynn Intel Group was paid $530,000 for operating as a foreign agent for Alptekin’s firm, Inovo BV, and performing work that could have benefited the Turkish government.

Coincidence? Nope. With something north of 95 per cent market share in laptops, desktops, and servers, Intel-the-company is far from even looking weak. Indeed, it is systematically adding to its strengths with strong indigenous high-density processing CPUs of its own, acquisition of budding AI chip vendors, pushing on storage-class memory, and advanced interconnects. But a revolution is nevertheless afoot. The end of CPU-dominated computing is upon us. Get ready to turn the page. Digitization means lots of data, and making sense of lots of data increasingly looks like either an AI problem or an HPC problem (which are really the same in a lot of ways). Either way, it includes what we call High Density Processing: GPUs, FPGAs, vector processors, network processing, or other, new, types of accelerators. GPUs made deep neural networks practical, and it turns out that after decades of slow progress in AI, such Deep Learning algorithms were the missing ingredient to make AI effective across a range of problems. NVIDIA was there to greet this turn of events and has ridden it to strong leadership of a critical new wave. It’s done all the right things and executed well in its usual competent manner. A fast-growing lucrative market means competition, of course, and a raft of new AI chips is around the corner. Intel already acquired Nervana and Movidius. Google has its TPU, and IBM its neuromorphic chip, TrueNorth. Other AI chip efforts include Mobileye (the company is being bought by Intel), Graphcore, BrainChip, TeraDeep, KnuEdge, Wave Computing, and Horizon Robotics. In addition, there are several well-publicized and respected projects like NeuRAM3, P-Neuro, SpiNNaker, Eyeriss, and krtkl going after different parts of the market. One thing that distinguishes Nvidia is how it addresses several markets with pretty much a single underlying platform. From automobiles to laptops to desktop to gaming to HPC to AI, the company manages to increase its Total Available Market (TAM) with minimal duplication of effort. It remains to be seen whether competitive chips that are super optimized for just one market can get enough traction to pose a serious threat. The world of computing is changing in profound ways and chips are once again an area of intense innovation. The Silicon in Silicon Valley is re-asserting itself in a most welcome manner. ® Tips and corrections 21 Comments MORE Nvidia Intel Gpu Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Nvidia says Google's TPU benchmark compared wrong kit You're faster than the Kepler, but what about the newer and better Pascal? 8 Comments Nvidia's profits so far this year are GPU-ge The anti-AMD racks up 48 per cent revenue jump 5 Comments Google rents out Nvidia Tesla GPUs in its cloud.

Mobileye Logo. (photo credit:Wikimedia Commons) From a business standpoint, the multi-billion dollar Intel-Mobileye deal on the Israeli auto-tech industry had the effect of a level 8 earthquake on the Richter scale shifting the tectonic plates. Not only was it the largest acquisition in Israel's history, but it also provided a concrete financial criterion for the developing sector and was registered on business seismographs all over the world. BM (before Mobileye), the industry attracted attention mostly from professional parties and knowledgeable people in the global auto industry, as well as a few small-to-medium fish in the venture capital industry. AM (after Mobileye), the business ocean's deep water sharks and whales are gathering round. Be the first to know - Join our Facebook page. Intel still on edge Every earthquake of these proportions naturally has aftershocks that continue for a long time afterwards, the results of which in this case are evident. Since the deal was announced in March, Israeli companies concentrating on various aspects of the smart vehicle vision have raised over $120 million. Most of the companies found more money available than they were planning on raising, and had to politely turn down some serious investors. Specialist venture capital funds also raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors all over the world seeking to build a portfolio of investments in seed-stage Israel auto-tech companies and ventures. An airlift of auto industry executives is also continuing under the radar - the very top management level - and that is only the tip of the iceberg. Behind the scenes, these aftershocks are starting to generate structural changes in the young and developing industry: consolidation of the existing players, the entry of new companies from parallel sectors, major strides forward by existing companies, etc. Before trying to map some of these changes, it is worth noting that the earthquake epicenter itself, i.e. Intel, has not necessarily calmed down and stabilized. Last week, Intel unveiled an "autonomous vehicle laboratory" in Silicon Valley, in which it is exposing and focusing research and development in many technological areas of the smart car vision extending far beyond Mobileye's computer vision and mapping. We therefore recommend that analysts ignore this earthquake, and continue following Intel's automotive activity in Israel. It is a real possibility that the Mobileye deal was merely Intel's first acquisition, and will serve as a core for the acquisition of a group of Israeli companies with complementary solutions. Defense industries are discovering vehicles The dimensions of the Intel-Mobileye deal were also a wakeup call for the Israeli defense industries - the dumb giant of the Israeli economy. "Globes" has already commented about the indirect connection between former defense industry figures and the developing auto-tech industry, but other than a few minor civilian automotive spinoffs, most of the defense industry giants have until now preferred to stay off the superhighway and focus on tanks, missiles, and aircraft. There are quite a few reasons for this. First of all, it is mentally difficult for companies accustomed to working with government customers with products costing from tens of thousands to millions of dollars per unit to get used to the auto industry's stringent cost policy, in which every dollar counts. This situation is now changing, and a good illustration of this appeared last month in the form of a very rare visit to Michigan by a "commercial" delegation organized by the Ministry of Defense International Defense Cooperation Authority for 13 representatives of the largest defense industries in Israel. Michigan, of course, is the center of the US auto industry, and the purpose of the delegation's visit was described, among other things, as presenting solutions and products in sub-systems for military vehicles, robotics, and autonomous propulsion. There is a high correlation between civilian and military uses of smart car technologies. Matters such as autonomous propulsion, artificial intelligence, machine vision, connectivity, encryption, and protection of information transmission to and from a vehicle are also an integral part of the smart battlefield vision in which governments throughout the world have been investing trillions in recent years. Anyone gaining a foothold in advanced core technologies in such sectors and successfully making the necessary mental and business adjustment is therefore likely to benefit from a two-way business track. Defense companies can grab a share of the rich global vehicle market, and civilian companies can win military contracts amounting to tens and hundreds of millions of dollars. It cannot be ruled out that we will see cooperative efforts or intensive activity involving local defense industries in civilian uses of their technology, and perhaps even separate stock exchange offerings by subsidiaries in this sector. Check Point looking at vehicles Another sleepy giant now responding to the Mobileye deal fallout is Israeli cyber security firm Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. , the pride of the cyber industry. A connection between Check Point, a software company, and the hardware-intensive auto industry ostensibly appears unnatural. In an era of connected vehicles, however, this situation could change dramatically. The auto industry estimates that a single autonomous vehicle will generate a stream of data amounting to four terabytes every 90 minutes. This prodigious stream of data, multiplied by tens and hundreds of millions of vehicles throughout the world, has to be processed, filtered, and also secured against malicious attempted break-ins. This goal requires integration of advanced hardware capabilities in a vehicle, and but also on the cloud to which the data from the vehicle will be streamed. This integration of capabilities led this month to an interesting announcement of technological cooperation between Check Point, which has been a partner of Argus Cyber Security in developing cyber security solutions for cars for the past two years, and Valens, which has developed unique infrastructure for very high-speed data transmission on a single pair of wires. In recent years, Valens has entered the automotive field, including a contract with Daimler-Mercedes Benz. The announcement mentions the establishment of a "Cyber Security Working Group" that "will define the necessary specifications for a more secure connected car." To the technologically challenged, it sounds complicated, and there is no doubt that many more obstacles await the players in this field in the coming years, headed by the absence of a uniform standard in the auto industry for information security and updating cyberspace security for vehicles. We nonetheless recommend closely following the "elephant hiding in the picture" - in this case, Check Point. Current studies say that by the middle of the next decade, the cyber security market for vehicles will reach billions of dollars a year, and force the auto industry to cooperate with specialist external parties for the purpose of periodic updates about threats and protecting data transmission from the cloud to and from the vehicle. This is Check Point's specialty, and it is doubtful whether a company with global status and an assertive business policy like Check Point can ignore it. Check Point finished 2016 with a pile of cash and cash equivalents amounting to nearly $3.5 billion. Swallowing up several new players in the sector, including its partners, is more than what is needed in order to achieve a breakthrough in the auto industry. Another interesting business focus attracting widespread global attention in recent weeks is the rapid expansion of Gett (formerly GetTaxi). The company made the headlines this month with its acquisition of Juno, its competitor, for $200 million. The attitude towards Gett in Israel is reminiscent of the attitude to Mobileye before its great leap, meaning that it is limited to familiarity with the company's end product - in the case of Gett, a taxi-ordering app - while ignoring the broader picture. Gett is now in the midst of a very ambitious business and technological maneuver being conducted hand-in-hand with the Moia technology division of Volkswagen, the world's largest auto manufacturer, which is the only major investor in Gett. It is a mistake to categorize Gett as just another competitor of Uber in the shared vehicle sector. It is true that Gett's main source of revenue at present and in the immediate future is its vehicle ordering app and various vehicle sharing services. Behind the scenes, however, the company, in cooperation with Volkswagen, is developing advanced solutions for transportation management in the connected and autonomous vehicle era. Over the next five years, some of these solutions are likely to put Gett into territory next to that of the mobility divisions of Google, Waze, and the like, with capabilities for optimizing traffic loads and intelligence direction of public transportation in cities and countries, while taking into account traffic loads, weather, individual external events, etc. Gett also has a close link with the huge Russian auto market, which has been dormant in recent years because of the economic crisis in Russia, but which is likely to again become a focus of global auto industry growth in the future. In any case, this business and technological expansion is currently creating, quietly and behind the scenes, the second multi-billion dollar companies produced so far by the Israeli auto-tech industry. The big question is whether the company can do this independently, or whether it will be swallowed up by some shark or other. A hint of the answer can be found in a report by the Bloomberg agency, which quoted anonymous sources as saying that Gett had hired the services of Wells Fargo and Credit Suisse in order to raise $700 million for expansion at a company value of $2 billion. These are only a few examples of what is going on in the local auto-tech industry before the midpoint of 2017 is reached. It cannot be ruled out that the second half of the year will be just as momentous. Relevant to your professional network?

Targeted in widening investigations of his foreign entanglements, President Donald Trump‚Äôs former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is at odds with his former Turkish client over two unusual payments totaling $80,000 that Flynn‚Äôs firm sent back last year to the client. The disagreement points to inconsistencies in Flynn‚Äôs accounts to the U.S. government about his work for foreign interests.(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) By: Stephen Braun And Chad Day The Associated Press Published on WASHINGTON — Targeted in widening investigations of his foreign entanglements, President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is at odds with his former Turkish client over two unusual payments totalling $80,000 that Flynn's firm sent back last year to the client. The disagreement points to inconsistencies in Flynn's accounts to the U.S. government about his work for foreign interests. Flynn's company, Flynn Intel Group, told the Justice Department in March that the two $40,000 payments were consulting fees for unspecified work. But Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin has told The Associated Press that the payments from Flynn's firm were refunds for unperformed lobbying. The difference matters because Flynn's foreign business relationships and the veracity of his disclosures are under scrutiny by congressional, military and intelligence inquiries. The Senate intelligence committee said late Wednesday it issued a subpoena to compel Flynn to turn over documents related to its investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner declined to comment on the newly issued subpoena. Flynn had previously been in talks with the committee about agreeing to be interviewed as long as he was granted immunity. In March, Kelner said in a statement that Flynn had a "story to tell," but said no reasonable person would agree to be questioned by the committee without "assurances against unfair prosecution." Other congressional committees and the Pentagon's inspector general are separately examining whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. His firm's Turkish work occurred while he was a top Trump campaign adviser. Earlier in the week, on Monday, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates told senators that Flynn's misstatements about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. raised concerns that he could be targeted for blackmail. Yates also cited the possibility that Flynn could have broken federal law by operating as a paid foreign agent for the Turkish client without U.S. government permission. The Senate intelligence committee said it had previously asked Flynn on April 28 to voluntarily turn over the records it requested, and Flynn declined. The retired Army lieutenant general and former chief of the Defence Intelligence Agency formally told the Justice Department in March that his now-defunct Flynn Intel Group was paid $530,000 for operating as a foreign agent for Alptekin's firm, Inovo BV, and performing work that could have benefited the Turkish government. That filing — prompted by Justice Department pressure — came just weeks after Trump fired Flynn from his national security post. The president has said he made the decision after it became clear Flynn had misled Vice-President Mike Pence about conversations with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. The paperwork Flynn filed with the Justice Department raised new questions because it cited two consulting payments back to Alptekin's company without specifying what, if any, work was performed. Alptekin told The Associated Press in an email that the payments were refunds guided by a verbal agreement he worked out last year with Flynn Intel that set out how much Flynn's firm was to receive each month for lobbying and other contractual work. When Alptekin didn't see any lobbying work, he said, he asked Flynn Intel to refund $80,000 to his firm. But Flynn's filing with the Justice Department did not disclose those discussions or the payment arrangements cited by Alptekin. The U.S. foreign agent law requires disclosure of all written and verbal contracts and modifications. National security law experts said the failure to disclose such discussions could spur additional scrutiny of Flynn if Justice Department officials were to determine the missing material was legally significant. The law "says disclosure has to include material fact and makes it a crime to omit such material," said Stephen I. Vladeck, a professor and national security law expert at the University of Texas School of Law. Flynn's foreign agent filing included only one contract signed by Flynn and Alptekin. The contract did not mention any adjustments made verbally, Alptekin's lobbying demands, arranging for allotting payments or any consulting role for Alptekin's company, Inovo BV. In the filing, Flynn's firm said the description of each payment back to Inovo as a "consultancy fee" came from the firm's accounting records. Similar "consultancy fee" entries described payments to other members of the team hired for the work. Asked about the discrepancies between Alptekin's statements and the filing, Kelner, said: "We'll stick with what's in the filing." Kelner declined to answer additional questions from the AP about the payment arrangement. In a brief statement Tuesday, Alptekin again said the payments to his firm from Flynn Intel were refunds for unperformed work. Alptekin also suggested that Flynn Intel's description of the payments as consulting fees was an accounting error. In Monday's Senate hearing, Yates told Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., that Flynn could face legal trouble for failing to disclose his foreign work and payments properly. Leaders of a bipartisan House inquiry into Flynn's foreign earnings have said they found no evidence that Flynn asked for permission from the Defence Department or the State Department to accept foreign payments, though they said any likely penalty for that violation would be fines, not prosecution. The Defence Department's inspector general is investigating. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who leads the inquiry as chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, told the AP he had not looked into Flynn's foreign agent disclosures but he "would urge the Justice Department to pursue that if they feel it's necessary." The panel's senior Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, added that Flynn's "work on behalf of Turkey while a top national security adviser for President Trump's campaign raises grave questions." Flynn Intel's work last year centred on developing evidence for a criminal case against Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wants Gulen extradited because he believes Gulen inspired last year's attempted coup against him. The Obama administration rebuffed Turkey's extradition requests. It's unclear whether the Trump administration will change that stance, though U.S.-Turkish relations have warmed under Trump, who congratulated Erdogan after a recent referendum expanded his presidential powers. International monitors called the referendum an undemocratic power grab. Alptekin said he disagrees with Flynn Intel's decision to register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent because he says the work wasn't orchestrated by the Turkish government and he doesn't have any ties to Erdogan's administration. But Alptekin serves on an economic committee overseen by Turkey's finance ministry. In its Justice Department filing, Flynn Intel also disclosed that Alptekin had consulted with Turkish government officials about the Gulen-related work. Flynn and Alptekin have yet to provide full and consistent explanations. Alptekin initially said last fall that his company paid only tens of thousands of dollars, but later acknowledged that the $530,000 in payments listed in Flynn's foreign agent filing was correct. Alptekin also told the AP that his firm and Flynn Intel had agreed verbally in August to divide monthly $200,000 installments for lobbying, public relations, research and other work. That arrangement specified Flynn's firm would be paid $40,000 a month for lobbying and $15,000 a month for public relations, Alptekin said. Alptekin justified the two $40,000 payments— one in September and the other in October— as refunds, saying he saw no evidence that Flynn Intel performed any lobbying. But Flynn's firm reported lobbying activity. It registered with Congress as a lobbyist in September, midway through the contract. And Flynn Intel and a contracted public relations firm disclosed in their paperwork with the Justice Department that it had lobbied a House committee and an Arkansas state official. ___ Have a tip about this story?

The disagreement points to inconsistencies in Flynn’s accounts to the U.S. government about his work for foreign interests. Flynn’s company, Flynn Intel Group, told the Justice Department in March that the two $40,000 payments were consulting fees for unspecified work. But Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin has told The Associated Press that the payments from Flynn’s firm were refunds for unperformed lobbying. The difference matters because Flynn’s foreign business relationships and the veracity of his disclosures are under scrutiny by congressional, military and intelligence inquiries. The Senate intelligence committee said late Wednesday it issued a subpoena to compel Flynn to turn over documents related to its investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner declined to comment on the newly issued subpoena. Flynn had previously been in talks with the committee about agreeing to be interviewed as long as he was granted immunity. Is the Data Act more boon or boondoggle? Read our special report. Advertisement In March, Kelner said in a statement that Flynn had a “story to tell,” but said no reasonable person would agree to be questioned by the committee without “assurances against unfair prosecution.” Other congressional committees and the Pentagon’s inspector general are separately examining whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. His firm’s Turkish work occurred while he was a top Trump campaign adviser. Earlier in the week, on Monday, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates told senators that Flynn’s misstatements about his contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. raised concerns that he could be targeted for blackmail. Yates also cited the possibility that Flynn could have broken federal law by operating as a paid foreign agent for the Turkish client without U.S. government permission. The Senate intelligence committee said it had previously asked Flynn on April 28 to voluntarily turn over the records it requested, and Flynn declined. The retired Army lieutenant general and former chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency formally told the Justice Department in March that his now-defunct Flynn Intel Group was paid $530,000 for operating as a foreign agent for Alptekin’s firm, Inovo BV, and performing work that could have benefited the Turkish government. That filing — prompted by Justice Department pressure — came just weeks after Trump fired Flynn from his national security post. The president has said he made the decision after it became clear Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. The paperwork Flynn filed with the Justice Department raised new questions because it cited two consulting payments back to Alptekin’s company without specifying what, if any, work was performed. ‘If you’re a really good federal worker, you should welcome’ the reorganization plan, OMB says Alptekin told The Associated Press in an email that the payments were refunds guided by a verbal agreement he worked out last year with Flynn Intel that set out how much Flynn’s firm was to receive each month for lobbying and other contractual work.

Advertisement Practical Investing Is Intel's Buying Binge a Good Thing? Intel’s purchase of Mobileye is its second mega-deal in the past two years, but Intel doesn’t have a stellar history when it comes to big acquisitions. Ranbar via Wikimedia By Kathy Kristof, Contributing Editor From Kiplinger's Personal Finance, June 2017 I’ve learned from experience that investors need to pay close attention when companies go on shopping sprees. That’s because acquisitions, particularly large ones, rarely have a neutral impact on the buyer. Rather, they tend to make the buyer either more competitive and profitable or more distracted and bureaucratic. See Also: 13 Tech Stocks with Big Promise So when Intel (symbol INTC, $36) recently announced plans to buy Mobileye (MBLY) for $15.3 billion—enough to consume nearly all of the cash and investments on the semiconductor giant’s balance sheet—I knew I had to get to work. When I launched the Practical Investing portfolio in October 2011, Intel was one of my first purchases. Including dividends, the stock has earned 88%, despite sluggish sales and declining earnings. Over that period, however, Vanguard Total Market ETF (VTI), the exchange-traded fund I use as my benchmark, has more than doubled. A lagging stock doesn’t necessarily concern me. What does worry me is that Intel’s purchase of Mobileye is its second huge deal in two years, the other being the $16.7 billion deal for Altera Corp., completed in December 2015. Wasted money. Intel doesn’t exactly have a stellar history when it comes to big takeovers. An $11 billion buying spree in the 2000s went nowhere, with Intel eventually selling or shutting down most of the firms it had acquired. Much the same happened with Intel’s acquisition of security software maker McAfee, bought in 2010 for $7.7 billion. Last year, when Intel sold a majority stake in McAfee to a hedge fund, the unit was valued at just $4.2 billion. Responding to questions about this sorry history after the announcement of the Mobileye deal, CEO Brian Krzanich told CNBC that Intel’s buyouts have been more successful since he became CEO in 2013. However, given that Altera is the only major deal Intel has made during his tenure, it seems premature to claim victory. Advertisement That said, Mobileye and Altera bring important benefits to Intel. In short, both own cutting-edge technologies to feed the vast and rapidly expanding market for machines that think and respond to their environments. Mobileye, based in Israel, is a leading developer of camera-based driver-assistance technology. Its sensor systems are used to prevent accidents and, eventually, will serve as the eyes of self-driving cars. Altera, now known as Intel FPGA, makes “field-programmable gate array” technology. Unlike old-style computer chips, which were programmed for life, FPGAs can be reprogrammed to fix bugs or adapt to changing technologies. These chips are already used in car safety systems. Krzanich says he wants Intel to be a leader in self-driving-car technology, a market he believes will eventually generate annual sales of $70 billion. Plus, he believes that the vast quantity of data Intel’s chips can collect while being used in self-driving cars will help the company expand its efforts in artificial intelligence. How? Multiple cameras will gather second-by-second data about the environment outside of a car—whether a bustling city or a serene forest—and the internal workings of a vehicle. The more data, the more connections and correlations and the greater the chance you can teach a machine to react with increasing logic to unfamiliar circumstances and terrain. But a shareholder must ask whether any of this is likely to boost Intel’s profits—and the price of its stock. Krzanich says it will. UBS technology analyst Stephen Chin agrees, predicting that Mobileye will boost Intel’s profits by 3% in the first full year after the merger is completed and 5% in year two. I’m skeptical, but I’m willing to hang on to see if the car of the future can drive better results at Intel.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Drones Intel demonstrates drones' potential for automated infrastructure inspections Eric Mack May 9, 2017 The Falcon 8+ can tote a camera in back in addition to its on board camera in front (Credit: Intel) View gallery - 5 images Intel thinks it could use drones to make infrastructure a little safer, perhaps even making safety checks for bridges something that's done automatically. This week Intel CEO Brian Krzanich presented the company's vision for how its commercial drones can perform inspections and close mapping that have previously required putting human inspectors in some precarious positions. In his opening keynote at the AUVSI Xponential robotics and unmanned systems conference in Dallas, Krzanich shared a simulation video showing off the abilities of Intel's Falcon 8+ drone and Mission Control software. NEW ATLAS NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT Upgrade to a Plus subscription today, and read the site without ads. It's just US$19 a year.UPGRADE NOW You can watch the video for yourself below, which simulates a Falcon 8+ with a front on-board camera and a digital SLR camera mounted on a gimbal at the rear that gives it the ability to rotate and capture images pointing upwards from the underside of a structure like a bridge. The company has touted the drone and its ability to capture detailed images down to millimeter resolution as an ideal solution for inspections and detailed mapping of all sorts of structures. "For example, oil rig inspections can be extremely dangerous, costly and time-consuming," says Anil Nanduri, vice president of unmanned systems. "By incorporating the Intel Falcon 8+ System into an oil rig inspection, businesses are able to transform dozens of critical tasks including aerial surveying/mapping, inspection, progress reporting, and collecting liability evidence, while increasing productivity and helping make their employees safer than before." Such processes, which would normally require a highly skilled drone pilot to repeat inspections as frequently as every six to 12 months, could be automated using Intel's Mission Control software, which can handle flight planning and management, and data processing afterwards. After a flight and the data is synced, the software can begin to provide analysis, comparisons with previously collected data and initial insights at the inspection site. When combined with other software, if can also generate 3D models of structures. Krzanich also revisited some other practical field uses for Intel's drones that we've highlighted in recent months, such as performing aircraft inspections and using a different model – Intel's Shooting Star drone – to put on some pretty impressive light shows. He said his company will be ramping up production of the Falcon 8+ for the North American market and releasing the Mission Control software later this year.

The cures: lifelong learning and career flexibility. May 9, 2017 PALO ALTO, Calif. - Political analysts will long debate over where Brexit, Trump and Le Pen came from. Many say income gaps. I'd say … not quite. I'd say income anxiety and the stress over what it now takes to secure and hold a good job. I believe the accelerations set loose by Silicon Valley in technology and digital globalization have created a world where every decent job demands more skill and, now, lifelong learning. More people can't keep up, and clearly some have reached for leaders who promise to stop the wind. Let me elaborate through a few conversations, starting with Brian Krzanich, the CEO of Intel, who recently remarked to me: "I believe my grandchildren will not drive." Since he has teenage daughters, that means self-driving vehicles should be fully deployed in 25 years, at which time you won't "steer" your car but will program it on a smartphone or watch or glasses. Sounds like fun - unless you're one of the millions who drive a truck or cab for a living. But don't think you're safe as an accountant, either.

Outlook Rodriguez: With SB 4, Texas GOP has turned its back on Latinos Raise the age Craft, Richardson: Clean air makes for good business Ousting Comey Thursday letters: FBI director's dilemma Mark Bohr, Intel's senior fellow for technology, explained to me that Intel's main workhorse microprocessor today is the 14-nanometer chip it introduced in 2014. It packs 37.5 million transistors per square millimeter. By the end of 2017, thanks to Moore's Law, Intel will begin producing a 10-nanometer chip that will pack "100 million transistors per square millimeter - more than double the previous density with less heat and power usage," said Bohr. If you think machines are smart today ... wait a year. It's this move from 14-nm to 10-nm chips that will help enable automakers to shrink the brain of a self-driving car from something that fills a whole trunk to a small box under the front seat, so these cars can scale. When you get that much processing power, putting out that much data exhaust with ever-improving software, you create a world where we can analyze, prophesize and optimize with a precision unknown in human history. We can see trends we never saw, predict when engine parts will break and replace them before they do, with great savings, and we can optimize everything - from the most energy-saving flight path for an airplane to the ideal drilling path for a natural gas well. I recently visited the control room at Devon Energy, a large oil and gas producer, in Oklahoma City. It's half a floor of computer screens displaying data coming out of every well Devon is drilling around the world. At the bottom of each screen are two boxes that blew my mind. One box displays how much money was budgeted to drill that particular well per foot, and the other box displays - in real time - how much the drilling of that well is actually costing, as it bores through different rocks, and it's updated every foot! A typical well might involve sending pipe 2 miles down and then turning horizontally for 2 miles east or west - with such precision it can hit a seam of gas as small as 20 feet wide! If you're working on a Devon oil rig today, you're holding a computer, not just an oily wrench. And if you're getting a degree in auto mechanics at a community college today, it's not to be a "grease monkey." It's to be a repairman for a computer with wheels. The notion that we can go to college for four years and then spend that knowledge for the next 30 is over. If you want to be a lifelong employee anywhere today, you have to be a lifelong learner. And that means: More is now on you. And that means self-motivation to learn and keep learning becomes the most important life skill. That's why education-to-work expert Heather E. McGowan likes to say: "Stop asking a young person WHAT you want to be when you grow up. It freezes their identity into a job that may not be there. Ask them HOW you want to be when you grow up. Having an agile learning mindset will be the new skill set of the 21st century." Some are up for that, some not; and many want to but don't know how, which is why the College Board has reshaped the PSAT and SAT exams to encourage lifelong learning. "We analyzed 250,000 students from the high school graduating Class of 2017 who took the new PSAT and then the new SAT," College Board President David Coleman told me. "Students who took advantage of their PSAT results to launch their own free personalized improvement practice through Khan Academy advanced dramatically: 20 hours of practice was associated with an average 115-point increase from the PSAT to the SAT - double the average gain among students who did not. "Our aim is to transform the SAT into an invitation for students to own their future." So the tough news is that more will be on you. The good news is that systems - like Khan-College Board - are emerging everywhere to enable anyone to accelerate learning for the age of acceleration.

The South Korean memory chip giant rose to become the world’s third-largest chipmaker by first-quarter sales, moving up two notches from a year earlier, according to data provided by research firm IC Insights. SK hynix raised $5.5 billion in sales for the first three months of the year, the data showed.  (Yonhap) The market researcher also noted SK hynix’s improvement from last year. “Memory giant SK Hynix made the biggest move in the 1Q ranking as compared to the full-year 2016 ranking,” said Bill McClean, president of IC Insights. “Spurred by the recent surge in the DRAM and NAND flash markets, the company moved up two spots in the top-10 ranking.” Micron also climbed up two spots to come in fourth. Infineon, which is headquartered in Germany, was a new entrant into the top 10 ranking this year, at 10th place. Korea’s top chipmaker Samsung Electronics came in second with $13.6 billion in sales, after US-based Intel with $14.2 billion. Although Intel held a slim 4 percent lead over Samsung for the No. 1 position in the first quarter, the researcher noted that Samsung is on pace to displace Intel as the world’s largest semiconductor supplier in the second quarter. The top 10 semiconductor suppliers represented a combined 56 percent of the worldwide semiconductor market of $99.6 billion in the first quarter, the data showed. “The second quarter is forecast to be the first ever quarterly semiconductor market to exceed $100 billion,” McClean said. The researcher offered a prediction for further changes in the top 10 ranking throughout the year, considering expected mergers and acquisitions to follow in the market. “As would be expected, given the possible acquisitions and mergers that could/will occur this year, as well as any new ones that may develop, the top 10 semiconductor ranking is likely to undergo some significant changes over the next few years as the semiconductor industry continues along its path to maturity,” he said. US Qualcomm is in the process of incorporating Netherlands’ NXP, while several global chipmakers including SK hynix, Micron and Western Digital are racing to take over Toshiba’s NAND Flash unit.

Steve Yarbrough Submitted photo Pamela Powers Hannley top story Arizona Legislature ends term by passing slew of tax breaks for businesses By Howard Fischer Capitol Media Services May 10, 2017 Updated 2 hrs ago +2  Buy Now Sen. Steve Yarbrough Capitol Media Services / file photo +2  Pamela Powers Hannley Submitted photo Respond: Write a letter to the editor | Write a guest opinion Howard Fischer / Capitol Media Services/ House Minority Leader Rebecca Rios PHOENIX — State lawmakers completed the 2017 legislative session Wednesday evening with millions of dollars in new and expanded tax breaks for businesses that sponsors say will help economic development. Legislators approved providing another $10 million in state income-tax credits for “angel” investors who put money into qualified small businesses. They also revamped a fund to provide grants to “micro-enterprises” — essentially small businesses with few employees. Separately, they gave final approval to restoring lifetime eligibility for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families to two years, the way it was before Gov. Doug Ducey signed legislation trimming that by half two years ago. But the measure includes some conditions on getting that second year of cash assistance, provisions Democrats said are designed to trip up recipients. But the big action Wednesday was the decision to provide even more financial incentives for manufacturers, some of whom already get special property-tax treatment and a few of whom may be paying no state corporate income taxes at all. Senate President Steve Yarbrough did not dispute that existing laws and what is in SB 1416, approved by the Senate 21-6 and the House 32-21, will minimize what some companies pay not only to the state but also in local property taxes. But he said that has to be weighed against the promises by firms such as Intel, which said it will be investing more than $7 billion to refurbish and occupy a vacant chip-manufacturing facility it built years ago in Chandler, Yarbrough’s hometown. And that, he said, will create new revenue streams. “You’re missing all of those people who have jobs at Intel who make six-figure salaries, who pay income tax, who pay property taxes on their home, who pay sales taxes at all the places they buy stuff,” he said. But House Minority Leader Rebecca Rios said the record in Arizona disproves the theory that tax breaks for businesses will grow the economy. She cited a recent report that various tax exemptions and credits in Arizona total $14 billion, more than the $9.8 billion state budget. But Rios said the state budget is essentially equal to what it was a decade ago, “with more than half a million more people in Arizona.” “Where’s all this revenue that’s flooding into the state?” she asked. “We have no proof that tax credits like this one are actually working,” added Sen. Martin Quezada, D-Glendale. Rep. Pamela Powers Hannley, D-Tucson, took issue with provisions of the bill that extend special tax credits to firms to reimburse them for the cost of doing research and development. She said the state is forgoing millions of dollars of taxes. But Powers Hannley said that’s not the worst of it. “This bill also gives away millions of dollars in research royalties into the future, with no end date,” she said, research that was financed by taxpayers in the first place. “Giving away all the intellectual-property rights is a huge potential loss of future revenues,” Powers Hannley said. “When the voters fund research or fund anything, the voters should get a return on their investment.” But not all the Democrats were opposed. “Not only will SB 1416 create thousands of high-paying jobs to thousands of Arizonans, but will catapult economic development in the right direction,” said Rep. César Chávez, D-Phoenix. He said graduates from the state’s three universities are “fleeing” because there are not enough jobs available. House Speaker J.D. Mesnard, reflecting a philosophical difference between the parties, took particular issue with Rios’ contention the state is giving away tax breaks. “Not taxing something is not the same thing as giving it away,” he said. “ ‘Giving it away’ suggests we own it.” The money, he said, belongs to the taxpayers. “They own it and then we force it from them, yes, to provide services for various things,” Mesnard said. “But there’s a very important distinction.” The provisions in SB 1416 come on top of the special tax treatment that certain large corporations already get, including those research-and-development tax credits, which can equal 24 percent of what a company spends. Arizona also has created “foreign-trade zones,” where the property tax on businesses is just a fraction of what it is on firms whose facilities are located elsewhere. And multistate corporations are allowed to compute what they owe in Arizona corporate income taxes based entirely on what percentage of the products they make are sold in the state. That potentially reduces the liability to manufacturers whose products are made here and shipped elsewhere. That break is even more significant for firms like Intel, whose computer chips are sold to other firms nationally and worldwide, and Raytheon which has little Arizona audience for its missiles. SB 1416 would also create an accelerated depreciation schedule for any equipment purchased by manufacturers. That break relates to the fact that Arizona law imposes property taxes not only on land and buildings but also on business equipment, from major presses to computers and desks. The value of that equipment is based on the purchase price, a figure that is adjusted annually for depreciation. This legislation allows businesses to write off half the value in the first year alone, a move that provides an immediate break on what already is a reduced property-tax rate. That will particularly help companies that are in the market for major new equipment, like Intel. On Twitter: @azcapmedia +2  Buy Now Sen.

Legislators approved providing another $10 million in state income tax credits for “angel” investors who put money into qualified small businesses and revamped a fund designed to provide grants to “microenterprises.” In the Senate, lawmakers gave final approval to a bill to restore two-year eligibility for cash assistance for needy families, the way it was before Gov. Doug Ducey signed legislation that cut the limit by half two years ago. The slog of voting Wednesday morning and afternoon finished a session that could have dragged on even longer, were it not for a deal struck Tuesday in the Senate on a bill to consolidate election dates. SB1152, pushed by Rep. Kevin Payne, R-Peoria, is intended to spark a lawsuit against the state of Arizona after lawmakers lost a previous legal battle over their right to consolidate elections at the Arizona Supreme Court. It may not have been a significant policy issue for most lawmakers, including Senate President Steve Yarbrough, R-Chandler. But Yarbrough noted that SB1152 was a critical part of getting enough support to approve a $9.8 billion budget a week ago, and the Senate needed to fulfill its obligation to pass the bill. “Once the commitment was made to get it up there, that became the problem,” Yarbrough said. Senate leadership was prepared to call upon Sen. John Kavanagh, R-Fountain HIlls, to fly back to the Capitol on Thursday from a week-long teaching course in Louisiana, with plans for a late-night vote on several bills shortly after he landed in Phoenix. Brophy McGee Instead, Sen. Kate Brophy McGee, R-Phoenix, reached a deal that ended her opposition to the bill. Her decisive vote on SB1152 allowed the Senate and House to move along and adjourn sine die on Wednesday, and in rare fashion — the last time the Legislature finished its work in the light of day was June 19, 2003. The big action left for Wednesday was the decision to provide even more financial incentives for manufacturers, some of whom already get special property tax treatment and a few of whom may be paying no state corporate income taxes at all. Yarbrough did not dispute that existing laws and what is in SB1416, approved by the Senate on a 21-6 vote, and the House by a vote of 32-21, will minimize what some companies pay not only to the state but also in local property taxes that support the city and school districts. The Senate president said that has to be weighed against the promise by Intel it will invest more than $7 billion to refurbish and finally occupy a now-vacant chip-manufacturing facility it built years ago in Chandler, Yarbrough’s hometown. That, he said, will create new revenue streams. “You’re missing all of those people who have jobs at Intel who make six-figure salaries, who pay income tax, who pay property taxes on their home, who pay sales taxes at all the places they buy stuff,” Yarbrough said. But House Minority Leader Rebecca Rios, D-Phoenix, said the record in Arizona disproves the theory that tax breaks for business will grow the economy. She cited a recent report that various tax exemptions and credits total $14 billion, more than the $9.8 billion state budget. But Rios pointed out that the current state budget is essentially equal to what it was a decade ago, “with more than half a million more people in Arizona.” “Where’s all this revenue that’s flooding into the state?” she asked.

Cesar Chavez, D-Phoenix. He said graduates from the state’s three universities are “fleeing” because there are not enough jobs available. House Speaker J.D.

That potentially reduces the liability to manufacturers whose products are made here and shipped elsewhere. That break is even more significant for firms like Intel, whose computer chips are sold to other firms nationally and worldwide, and Raytheon which has little Arizona audience for its missiles. SB1416 makes three major changes in existing laws. It would extend and expand tax credits manufacturers already get for creating new jobs. That credit is currently set to expire at the end of June. Another provision extends the tax credits available for expenses on research and development. And it would create an accelerated depreciation schedule for any equipment purchased by manufacturers. That break relates to the fact that Arizona law imposes property taxes not only on land and buildings but also any business equipment, from major presses to computers and desks. The value of that equipment is based on the purchase price, a figure that is adjusted annually for depreciation. SB1416 allows businesses to write off half the value in the first year alone, a move that provides an immediate break on what already is a reduced property tax rate. That will particularly help companies that are currently in the market for major new equipment, like Intel. Ducey has generally been favorable to new business tax breaks. But he’s also getting something in the legislation he did not want. Rep. Jill Norgaard, R-Phoenix, slipped in language which says that the sale of partial ownership shares of corporate jets is not subject to the state sales tax. Ducey vetoed a bill with only that language earlier this year because of the revenue implications. But he will have to accept it if he wants the rest of what’s in SB 1416 because he lacks the constitutional power to excise provisions of new laws he does not like. There was no immediate response from his office to what Norgaard had done.

May 10, 2017 — 9:33pm Flynn Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint WASHINGTON – The Senate Intelligence Committee issued a subpoena Wednesday to force former national security adviser Michael Flynn to turn over documents related to the panel's probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, including possible ties between the Kremlin and the presidential campaigns. It is the first subpoena the committee has announced in the course of its Russia investigation — a step Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., was long reticent to take. But the chairman began signaling this week that if Trump surrogates did not turn over requested materials to the committee by Tuesday — a deadline that some missed — he and Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., might begin issuing subpoenas. "Everything has been voluntary up to this point, and we've interviewed a lot of people and I want to continue to do it in a voluntary fashion," Burr said Wednesday morning. "But if in fact the production of things that we need are not provided, then we have a host of tools," Burr added, indicating that a subpoena was one of them. Flynn has come under committee scrutiny over communications he had with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak while a representative of then-President-elect Donald Trump's transition team. Undisclosed payments that Flynn received from Russian-backed entities, such as Kremlin-sponsored television network RT, have also inspired questions from lawmakers looking into allegations of coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Burr and Warner originally requested the documents addressed in the Wednesday subpoena in a letter dated April 28. In announcing the subpoena, the Senate Intelligence Committee said that Flynn "declined, through counsel, to cooperate with the Committee's request." The announcement comes one day after the Trump administration fired James Comey from his post as FBI director, citing his handling of a probe into Hillary Clinton's e-mails as the reason for his termination. Many Democrats and a few Republicans found the timing of the firing suspect, since it comes as the FBI is investigating Trump's campaign and transition team for alleged collusion with Russia. "The timing of this and the reasoning for it doesn't make any sense to me," Burr said Wednesday morning, noting that Comey's firing would make the committee's investigation "a little bit more difficult." "But it didn't make it impossible, so we'll continue," Burr added. The Flynn subpoena also comes one day before the committee is scheduled to hold an annual hearing with the heads of the various government intelligence agencies to discuss worldwide threats. The committee announced Wednesday afternoon that the FBI's acting director Andrew McCabe would attend the briefing in Comey's place.

The Good The Dell Latitude 5285 is a powerful performer that runs smoothly when multitasking. It has buttons on its bottom edge that auto-deploy the kickstand. Durable build and good battery life. The Bad Base price doesn't include the keyboard or stylus. Security features will mostly appeal to business users. The Bottom Line The Dell Latitude 5285 is a Surface-style tablet in business attire. Its IT-ready security features may not appeal to consumers, but the clever pop-out kickstand will. Visit manufacturer site for details. 8.2 Overall Design 8.0 Features 8.0 Performance 8.0 Battery 8.0 Review Sections Review User Reviews CNET Computers Laptops Dell Latitude 5285 Since its release, the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 has been the no-brainer recommendation for anyone interested in a powerful and portable 2-in-1 laptop/tablet hybrid. But as of late, a number of worthy competitors have cropped up, including the Dell Latitude 5285, one of the latest and greatest to take on the Microsoft tablet's crown. The business-geared Dell tablet has a strong emphasis on the security features corporate IT departments insist on. But on the outside, it has a similar design to the Surface Pro 4, right down to the built-in kickstand. Also like the Surface Pro line, it works with a keyboard accessory and stylus that are both sold separately. (The Surface Pro 4 comes with a stylus, but not the keyboard.) While the main pitch is to business users, there's consumer crossover appeal as well, especially if you're looking for a 2-in-1 on the rugged side. Simply put, the Dell tablet is like a Microsoft Surface Pro 4 with more security features. Just be ready to pay a little more for those extras. Starting at $899 (£725 or AU$1,239) without the keyboard or stylus, it's more expensive that the Surface Pro 4's entry-level model, which starts at $799 (£749 or AU$899) and includes a stylus. View full gallery A Surface-like tablet with business in mind. Josh Miller/CNET Safety first The Latitude 5285 is part of Dell's professional line and offers a family of Intel features important for security-minded IT departments. Dell's ControlVault, which stores and protects your passwords and security codes, and the Endpoint Security Suite Enterprise software can be pre-loaded onto the tablet at an extra cost. Additionally, Dell offers Intel's vPro remote-management technology, as well as the option to customize models with an infrared camera for Windows Hello facial recognition and fingerprint or smart card reader. These features are overkill for the Average Joe, but they could be important for business users who need a secure machine for work. View full gallery The kickstand rotates up to 150 degrees. Josh Miller/CNET A clever kickstand The Dell Latitude 5285 has two small buttons that slightly protrude from its bottom edge. Push that bottom edge downward onto a flat surface and the kickstand automatically opens. The auto-deploy kickstand reminds me of the flip phone featured in The Matrix -- you know, the one that would quickly slide open with the press of a button. But since the concept isn't anything new, it's not as impressive. It is a nifty feature that makes it easy to set up shop as soon as you sit at a table. View full gallery This little nub activates the kickstand. Josh Miller/CNET The sturdy kickstand, made of brushed-metal aluminum, can rotate up to 150 degrees for multiple viewing angles. It comes in handy when using it with the stylus. The back shell has a magnesium-alloy casing and, overall, the tablet feels very solid. Unsurprising, considering it passed MIL-SPEC 810G standards, the testing used to measure the durability of U.S. military equipment. This means it's built to survive an accidental drop or two. Successories The Dell Latitude 5285 has an optional keyboard and stylus. Both attach magnetically and are sold separately. View full gallery The accessories complete the package. Josh Miller/CNET I really liked the feel of the Dell tablet's keyboard ($129, £163, AU$219). The short travel of the keys made typing fast a joy, and the deck's rubbery material was comfortable for resting palms. The textured back of the keyboard gave it a nice grippy surface to hold onto. It's keys are also backlit, however there's only one brightness setting. The Dell Active Pen stylus accessory ($59, £60, AU$97) has a pressure-sensitive tip with minimal latency. I enjoyed using it to navigate (to avoid smudges on the touchscreen) and for note-taking. For convenient storage, it magnetically attaches to the tablet's right edge and it connects strongly enough for it to stay put when walking around with it in hand.

But Intel Chair Richard Burr (R-NC) still expressed concern about the circumstances of Comey’s firing. “The timing of this and the reasoning for it doesn’t make sense to me,” Burr told reporters at the Capitol, echoing a statement he put out Tuesday night after the news broke. “I think this made our task a little bit more difficult, but it didn’t make it impossible, so we’ll continue,” Burr said, of the committee’s investigation. He elaborated that Comey’s firing complicates the Intel probe from “a deconfliction standpoint.” “We would like to make sure that everything that we do does not disrupt any potential investigation,” Burr said. He confirmed that Comey would no longer be appearing at the Intel committee’s annual hearing on “Worldwide Threats” slated for Thursday. He also said the he spoke to the President Tuesday night, but would not elaborate on the content of the conversation beyond confirming that the Intel committee’s probe was not discussed.

But at the start of this week’s MS Build conference, Microsoft made a few more Cortana-related announcements. First up, HP and Intel are also planning to launch Cortana-enabled devices. Or rather, HP is… and Intel will likely develop reference designs that can be adopted by third-party companies. And Microsoft is launching a public preview of the Cortana Skills kit, which allows developers to bring third-party features to Microsoft’s virtual assistant. Microsoft is playing catch-up with Amazon and Google. There are already thousands of third-party “skills” available for Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant, and hundreds of “actions” for Google Assistant. But the fact that Cortana already has 141 million monthly users could make it an attractive target for developers. Right now there are only a handful of skills ready for testing, including Tunein, iHeartRadio, Opentable, Open table, Food Network, and Dark Sky. But I wouldn’t be surprised to see that list grow in the coming days.

Jensen Huang beamed out over a packed conference hall in San Jose, California, on Wednesday as he announced his company’s new chip aimed at accelerating artificial intelligence algorithms. But metaphorically speaking, the CEO of chip maker Nvidia was looking over his shoulder. Nvidia’s profits and stock have surged over the past few years because the graphics processors it invented to power gaming and graphics production have enabled many recent breakthroughs in machine learning (see “10 Breakthrough Technologies 2013: Deep Learning”). But as investment in artificial intelligence soars, Huang’s company now faces competition from Intel, Google, and others working on their own AI chips.

AI Is Making It Very Hard to Know The World’s Largest Electric Vehicle Maker Hits a Speed Bump At Nvidia’s annual developer conference on Wednesday, Huang carefully avoided mentioning any competitors by name as he introduced Nvidia’s latest chip, named the Tesla V100. He referred to Google only as “some people,” for example. But he made clear swipes at the technology of Nvidia’s challengers, particularly when talking about the big opportunity opening up to supply AI chips for use in cloud computing. Companies in many industries such as health care and finance are investing in machine-learning infrastructure. Leading cloud computing providers Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are all betting that many companies will want to pay them to run artificial intelligence software, and are going to spend heavily on new hardware to support that. Nvidia came to dominate the burgeoning AI chip market by smartly seizing on a lucky coincidence. The basic mathematical operations needed for computer graphics are the same as those underlying an approach to machine learning known as artificial neural networks. Starting in 2012, researchers showed that by putting new power behind that technique, graphics processors permitted software to become much, much smarter at tasks such as interpreting images or speech. Do you believe artificial intelligence will transform every industry? Tell us why. As the AI market has grown, Nvidia has tweaked its chip designs with features to support neural networks. The new V100 chip announced this week is the culmination of that effort, and features a new core specialized for accelerating deep-learning math. Huang said its power and energy efficiency would help companies or cloud providers to dramatically upgrade their capability to use AI. “You could increase the throughput of your data center by 15 times instead of having to build new data centers,” he said. Nvidia’s new competitors argue that they can make hardware faster and more efficient at running AI software by designing chips tuned for the purpose from scratch instead of adapting graphics chip technology. For example, Intel promises to release a chip for deep learning later this year built on top of technology acquired with startup Nervana in 2016 (see “Intel Outside as Other Companies Prosper from Graphics Chips”). The company is also preparing to release a product to speed up deep learning based on technology from its $16.7 billion acquisition of Altera, which made chips called FPGAs that can be reconfigured to power specific algorithms. Microsoft has invested heavily in using FPGAs to power its machine-learning software and made them a core piece of its cloud platform, Azure. Meanwhile, Google disclosed last summer that it was already using a chip customized for AI, developed in-house, called a Tensor Processing Unit, or TPU. The chips underpinned the software AlphaGo’s victory over a champion player of the board game Go last year. They aren’t for sale, but Google says companies that use its cloud computing services will get the benefits of their power and energy efficiency. Several engineers that built Google’s chip have since left the company to form a startup with $10 million in funding called Groq that is building a specialized machine-learning chip. Other startups working on similar projects include Wave Computing, which says it is already letting customers test its hardware. Huang claimed Wednesday that Nvidia’s technology hits a sweet spot other efforts don’t. Custom chips like Google’s TPU are too inflexible to work equally well with many different kinds of neural networks, he said—a significant downside given how quickly new ideas are being tested and adopted in AI. He claimed FPGAs, like those favored by Microsoft and being bet on by Intel, consume too much energy. “We are creating the most productive platform for deep learning,” he said. As Huang’s rivals reveal more about their products this year, that claim will come under close scrutiny. Become an MIT Technology Review Insider for in-depth analysis and unparalleled perspective.

Comey has been invited to testify instead next Tuesday, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner announced. Warner, the ranking member of the Intelligence panel, told reporters that he and Burr sent a joint letter to Comey early Wednesday asking him to testify on May 16. “We’ve not heard back, we just sent out the letter this morning,” Warner said. “My hope is that he’ll take advantage of this opportunity.” Comey was fired by President Trump on Tuesday after Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein submitted letters recommending the move. In a blistering memo, Rosenstein faulted Comey for his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation. Ironically given both Trump’s and Sessions’ anti-Clinton position in that probe, Rosenstein said that Comey was unfair to Clinton. He also faulted Comey for overstepping his bounds by making a public announcement that he would not be recommending charges against Clinton.

Trump critics allege that Comey was fired because he would not let up on the ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the presidential campaign. Reports emerged Wednesday that Comey requested additional resources for the investigation from Rosenstein just before being fired. The Justice Department has pushed back on the story, though NBC News reported that Comey briefed Congress about the request. Thursday’s session includes six intelligence community officials, including McCabe, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, and National Security Agency Director Adm. Michael Rogers. Warner did not say whether Tuesday’s hearing will be open or closed.

Image Credit: Khari Johnson Microsoft announced today that it is working with HP and Intel to bring more Cortana-powered devices to the world. HP will make a device with Cortana inside while Intel will work on a reference design. Microsoft Artificial Intelligence and Research Group executive VP Harry Shum announced the news onstage at Build, Microsoft’s annual developer conference, taking place May 10-12 in Seattle. No further details about the new partnerships were provided. Other partners working with Microsoft include Volvo, Nissan, and BMW, which committed earlier this year to using Microsoft’s in-car system with Cortana and Skype inside. Today Microsoft also launched its Cortana Skills Kit in public preview, and early partners launched roughly 25 Cortana skills like WebMD and Expedia. New additions were also made today to the Microsoft Bot Framework, a publishing system that can convert bots to Cortana skills. It’s been a uniquely busy week for intelligent assistants. On Monday, Harman Kardon announced that its Invoke smart speaker with Cortana inside will be able to make Skype calls; it’s due out this fall. On Tuesday, Amazon launched the Echo Show, a touchscreen Alexa-enabled device with the ability to make phone calls and send messages. Today’s agreement by Intel to work on a reference design marks the second major spark speaker design from Intel, which agreed late last year on a reference design to work with Amazon on a smart speaker with Alexa inside.

He said that the ministry had foiled a scheme against incumbent president and presidential candidate, Hassan Rouhani, ahead of the May 19 election.     According to Alavi, the ministry had identified and confiscated thousands of T-shirts bearing slogans against Rouhani, such as “Goodbye the administration of words,” “Four years of unemployment and stagnation,” and “I do not vote for Rouhani.” Alavi said that certain people planned to wear the T-shirts in uptown Tehran, engage in clashes with Rouhani’s pseudo-supporters and then post videos of the sham clashes on social media. “They intended to exploit this act of psywar for [winning more votes in] the election and [to ensure] their political gains,” he added. Alavi noted that some people had worn such T-shirts in the campaigning for certain presidential candidates, saying that the Intelligence Ministry was pursuing the issue. Iranians will go to the polls across the country on May 19 to elect the country’s 12th president. The six candidates vying in the race are Tehran's current mayor, Mohammad-Baqer Qalibaf, member of the Expediency Council, Mostafa Aqa-Mirsalim, former deputy judiciary chief, Seyyed Ebrahim Raeisi, former vice president, Seyyed Mostafa Hashemi-Taba, incumbent first vice president, Es’haq Jahangiri, and Rouhani.

The disagreement highlights inconsistencies in Flynn's accounts to the government about his work for foreign interests. Flynn Intel Group told the Justice Department in March the two $40,000 payments were consulting fees for unspecified work. Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin tells The Associated Press the payments were refunds for unperformed lobbying. The difference matters because Flynn's foreign relationships and the veracity of his disclosures are under scrutiny by government inquiries.

More Power Management Updates Head To The Linux 4.12 Kernel Written by Michael Larabel in Hardware on 10 May 2017 at 08:38 AM EDT. Add A Comment Last week was the main ACPI / power management updates for Linux 4.12 while Intel's Rafael Wysocki has now submitted a second set of feature updates for this next version of the Linux kernel. This secondary feature update for ACPI/PM is less exciting than the first, but does still contain new functionality. Changes in this latest pull request include adding Intel Geminilake support to the intel_idle and intel_rapl (Runtime Average Power Limiting) drivers. Geminilake enabling under Linux has been happening since 4.11 and with 4.12 will be further into shape for when these new Intel SoCs begin shipping in the near future. Aside from the Geminilake additions, there are some fixes, updates to the system suspend/resume infrastructure for improved handling, and other changes. These latest changes can be found here. There were also more ACPI updates of less notable feature work.

Blog Infineon Leads Pick-and-Shovel Market Colin Barnden, Semicast 5/10/2017 08:00 AM EDT  0 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet In an analysis produced for EE Times, Semicast Research has identified Infineon as the leading vendor overall for the combined automotive and industrial semiconductor market. Semicast’s combined automotive and industrial semiconductor vendor share analysis ranks Infineon as the largest supplier in 2016, with an estimated market share of 8.3 percent, ahead of NXP with 7.9 percent. Completing the top five, Texas Instruments had 7.5 percent; STMicroelectronics was at 6.1 percent; and Renesas had 5.0 percent. With sixth-placed Intel back on 3.1 percent, it can be seen that leadership for automotive and industrial semiconductors comes down to five vendors who are well ahead of the pack. This is a fragmented market with the top five vendors together taking about one-third of the total and the top ten collectively just under fifty percent. Semicast estimates the combined automotive & industrial semiconductor market to have been worth $72.2 billion in 2016 and forecasts average growth of about seven percent a year to more than $100 billion in 2021. Automotive and industrial are two quite different end markets, but from a semiconductor device perspective, they have much in common. This includes operation over an extended temperature range, operation in harsh environments, need for high product quality and reliability, guaranteed long life supply and compliance with tightly specified industry standards. So although the applications and customers in the automotive and industrial markets may be quite different, the expertise required to produce and supply semiconductors for these two markets is very similar. Taken together, the automotive and industrial sectors represented only about one-fifth of the total semiconductor TAM in 2016, and much less than the computer, consumer and communications sectors. Combined with long development cycles and fragmented customer bases, many semiconductor companies have historically avoided both markets altogether and pursued opportunities elsewhere. However there are clear signs of changing dynamics. Suppliers are lining up to expand into the automotive and industrial markets, in pursuit of the riches promised by new and exciting technologies such as autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and of course IoT. Intel’s $15 billion purchase of Mobileye for autonomous driving is the most potent example of this so far in 2017. Recently it has been pretty hard to find a major trade show or industry event without a keynote from Jen-Hsun Huang promoting Nvidia’s solutions for autonomous driving and AI. Semicast sees parallels forming with the semiconductor industry of twenty years ago when everyone went prospecting for a slice of the market for cellphone and subsequently smartphone baseband processors. The golden nuggets of victory eventually concentrated into the hands of a very few winners such as Qualcomm and Mediatek, and red ink splashed over the balance sheets of pretty much everyone else. The list of companies that started and then either divested or abandoned their baseband processor business includes Infineon, NXP, TI, STMicroelectronics and Renesas. These five semiconductor suppliers that each correctly identified cellphones as a way to lose them money, and automotive and industrial as a way to make it. I think it was Mark Twain who said “he gold rush it is a good time to be in the pick and shovel business.” As the semiconductor industry heads for maturity, many vendors’ strategies are noticeably starting to split into those prospecting for the moonshots of autonomous driving, AI and VR and those seeking the dull but reliable pick-and-shovel business. Companies such as Infineon that focus on automotive and industrial semiconductors may not be sexy, but history teaches us that dull and reliable can unearth the buried treasure too. Just ask Warren Buffett. --Colin Barnden is principal analyst at Semicast Research (@semicast_res) and has covered the semiconductor industry for almost twenty five years. His focus is on the automotive and industrial sectors and he is clearly not dull because he drives a Toyota Prius.

Scientists at the University of Warwick’s Tissue Image Analytics (TIA) Laboratory - led by Professor Nasir Rajpoot from the Department of Computer Science - are creating a large, digital repository of a variety of tumour and immune cells found in thousands of human tissue samples, and are developing algorithms to recognize these cells automatically. “We are very excited about working with Intel under the auspices of the strategic relationship between Intel and the Alan Turing Institute,” said Professor Rajpoot, who is also an Honorary Scientist at University Hospitals Coventry & Warwickshire NHS Trust (UHCW). “The collaboration will enable us to benefit from world-class computer science expertise at Intel with the aim of optimising our digital pathology image analysis software pipeline and deploying some of the latest cutting-edge technologies developed in our lab for computer-assisted diagnosis and grading of cancer.” The digital pathology imaging solution aims to enable pathologists to increase their accuracy and reliability in analysing cancerous tissue specimens over what can be achieved with existing methods. “We have long known that important aspects of cellular pathology can be done faster with computers than by humans,” said Professor David Snead, clinical lead for cellular pathology and director of the UHCW Centre of Excellence. “With this collaboration, we finally see a pathway toward bringing this science into practice. The successful adoption of these tools will stimulate better organisation of services, gains in efficiency, and above all, better care for patients, especially those with cancer.” The initial work focuses on lung cancer. The University of Warwick and Intel are collaborating to improve a model for computers to recognize cellular distinctions associated with various grades and types of lung cancer by using artificial intelligence frameworks such as TensorFlow running on Intel® Xeon® processors. UHCW is annotating the digital pathology images to help inform the model. The aim is to create a model that will eventually be useful in many types of cancer - creating more objective results, lowering the risk of human errors, and aiding oncologists and patients in their selection of treatments. The TIA lab at Warwick and the Pathology Department at the UHCW have established the UHCW Centre of Excellence for Digital Pathology and begun digitising their histopathology service. This digital pathology imaging solution will be the next step in revolutionising traditional healthcare with computerised systems and could be placed in any pathology department, in any hospital. The project has been launched in collaboration with Intel and the Alan Turing Institute - the latter being the UK’s national centre for data science, founded in 2015 in a joint venture between the University of Warwick and other top UK universities. “This project is an excellent example of data science's potential to underpin critical improvements in health and well-being, an area of great importance to the Alan Turing Institute," said Dr. Anthony Lee, the Strategic Programme Director at the Alan Turing Institute for the collaboration between the Institute and Intel. Rick Cnossen, general manager of HIT-Imaging Analytics in Intel’s Data Center Group, commented, “This project has massive potential benefit for cellular pathology, and Intel technologies are the foundation for enabling this transformation. "We’ve seen what has happened over recent years with the digitisation of X-rays (PACS). The opportunity to transform the way pathology images are handled and analysed, building on experience with PACS and combining data with other sources, could be truly ground-breaking. "This collaboration could not only improve service efficiency, but also open up new and exciting analytical techniques for more personalised precision care.”   Receive our free weekly EU innovation newsletter, sign up now Related subjects: Artificial intelligence, Cancer, University of Warwick, Warwick University Horizon 2020: Special Coverage Related News Scientists reveal how epigenetic changes in DNA are interpreted 10 May 2017 Senior EU research official to join Merck & Co. 04 May 2017 Genome editing of plants and livestock needs new approach to regulation 04 May 2017 Related Reports Research Strategies The next Framework Programme In October 2016, the Science|Network of universities, companies and innovation organisations gathered in Brussels to debate the future of EU R&D programmes.

Published Share Facebook Twitter Linkedin Google+ Permalink Share via e-mail TO ADD A MESSAGE 
 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE The Obama administration holdovers in the U.S. government rushed President Donald Trump to directly arm terrorist PKK's Syrian affiliate People's Protection Units (YPG), ahead of Turkish President Tayyip Erdoğan's planned visit next week, fearing that Erdoğan could personally convince Trump otherwise, multiple Turkish officials told Daily Sabah. Trump's decision to directly arm YPG on Monday came in the middle of a high level Turkish delegation's visit to Washington whose aim was to lay the groundwork for Erdoğan's trip, and discuss alternative military plans for already ongoing military operation to liberate Raqqa. U.S. National Security Adviser Gen. H.R. McMaster and others told Turkish officials, among them the top commander of Turkish military Gen. Hulusi Akar, Intel Chief Hakan Fidan and Chief Presidential Adviser Ibrahim Kalın that the administration had already taken the decision to arm YPG. "The Americans have been trying to convince us that there was no quicker option to take Raqqa but the truth is that they themselves have been divided all along," said one Turkish official familiar with the issue. The Turkish delegation repeatedly told senior U.S. officials that such decision would undermine President Erdoğan's first in-person meeting with President Trump, and both sides willingness to open a blank page following the Obama administration's disastrous relations with Ankara. "We came to the conclusion that Erdoğan's visit was the main reason for U.S. Central Command, and Obama appointees to rush such decision, they were concerned by the fact that Erdoğan could very well talk Trump out of this," another Turkish official said, speaking on condition of anonymity in accordance with the government protocol. Several U.S. media outlets previously reported that the Raqqa plan was initially designed by the Obama administration, and was put on hold after Trump transition officials warning them about the consequences. Washington insiders were quick to point out a similar attitude that occurred following the constitutional referendum in Turkey, where clashing views of Trump and other officials serving him were revealed. One day after the vote, the U.S. State Department released a lengthy statement to slam Turkish government's conduct during the referendum, and the White House Spokesman Sean Spicer followed suit. A couple of hours later, surprising many in Washington, Trump called President Erdoğan and congratulated him for his election victory, parting from the supposed official line. Several Obama holdovers in key positions that administer the fight against Daesh have not been fired. Brett McGurk, the Obama-appointed U.S. Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter Daesh, is a very well-known pro-YPG activist, and also among the architects of Syria policy in the administration. McGurk kept his position after intensely lobbying the Trump transition team about his past track record in the Bush administration. A news report also claimed Monday Gen. McMaster previously clashed with President Trump, and declined to fire a list of Obama holdovers at the National Security Council, who were suspected of leaking information to press. Bloomberg View, referencing unnamed White House officials, reported that Trump had complained in front of McMaster in intelligence briefings about 'the general undermining my policy,' and given McMaster less face time. On Monday, the Americans tried to break the bad news to the Turks with a gesture. American officials invited the Turkish delegation visiting the White House to meet Trump in the Oval Office. Trump and Turkish officials shook hands, pictures were taken, the positive and energetic manners even made Turkish officials to think whether to decision arm YPG was taken by the same person. One Turkish official said the invite echoed in Ankara as an effort to sweeten the bitter pill. A National Security Council spokesman refused to comment on Turkish officials' statement, and referred the query to the Pentagon, which officially announced the authorization Tuesday. U.S. State Department informed the senior officials in Ankara via a phone call by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Monday afternoon. "Secretary Tillerson subsequently spoke to his counterpart Turkish Foreign Minister Çavuşoğlu - and other appropriate partners were notified as well," said a U.S. diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.

By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: May 11, 2017 10:15 am Here’s what Microsoft announced on the day one of the Build conference (Image credit: Microsoft) Microsoft kicked off its annual Build developers conference on Wednesday with a jam-packed three-hour keynote. While the company is hardly announcing a new hardware at the Build conference, the focus will be entirely to solidify its position in the enterprise segment through various tools and services. A big theme of this year was Microsoft’s consistent efforts to push artificial intelligence (AI) into all its major portfolio, from Azure to Xbox and Office. Here’s what Microsoft announced on the day one of the Build conference, which is currently happening in Seattle. You can livestream the entire keynote from the Build 2017 site. Windows 10 hits a major milestone  Windows 10 is now running on over 500 million machines, which is a great start for a new operating system. Microsoft originally set the goal of reaching 1 billion devices by mid-2018, a goal that seems unlikely to hit. Windows 10 was released in 2015, and by the end of September it was at 100 million devices. HP’s Cortana speaker In an effort to beat Amazon and Google, Microsoft announced it has inked partnerships with HP and Intel to bring Cortana-powered voice-activated speakers to the market in the near future. Unfortunately, details aren’t available about the smart speaker. Earlier this week, Microsoft and Harman Kardon announced the ‘Invoke’ Cortana-powered speaker, which will hit the market later this year. Cortana skills  Announced at the Build conference was the new Cortana Skills set, which will allow third-party developers to create new skills  – or even port existing  Alexa skills for the Windows platform. This will definitely improve Cortana and make upcoming hardware much better. Microsoft’s presentation translator Powerpoint can now translate slideshows in real time. Essentially, the translator plugin will offer real-time translation of powerpoint presentations without removing the original formatting. A Microsoft Garage project, the plug-in uses Translation APIs to translate content from any Powerpoint presentation into 10 different languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish). The plugin can also provide translated subtitles in real-time. Visual studio for Mac Microsoft has announced its Visual Studio coding platform for the Mac. It basically allows developers to code apps using Microsoft’s development environment on Apple’s Mac OS. Previously it was available for preview. Azure app At its Build 2017, Microsoft announced an iOS and Android Azure app. With the new mobile app, users can maintain their Azure Cloud on the go. The mobile app will come with support for new Azure Cloud Shell. Plus, Microsoft is working on a UWP Azure app for Windows 10 devices. For all the latest Tech News, download Indian Express App now © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd Tags: Build 2017 microsoft G gvcdsdh May 11, 2017 at 11:02 am The Windows Monopoly wasn't just about developers only developing for Windows. The success was down to Kernel Watson, who's Graphical OS ran Twice as fast and cost half as much. Intelligent Programmers knew back then to use Model, View, Controller techniques and cross platform toolkits such as QT to develop portable Apps. It was only after the year 2000, that the German Goverment began using Linux, Calligra, LibreOffice. Most people only need to just a few tasks. The Mother of all Monopolies is Innovation. Secure Computers that work with Voice Commands and offer greater mechanisms for employees to colloborate will extend this monopoly a further 20 years. If Gates knew this, he would not have ruined the Worlds best Software Development Organisation. He knows very little, he just had a 13 year old Sister who had little Shame, and dropped her knickers for Dirty old Ba5tards.

At the Embedded Systems Expo & Conference (ESEC) in Japan this week (May 10-12), Congatec announced an “extended standardization initiative” called ComX. The proposed standard builds upon existing computer-on-module hardware standards such as COM Express, Qseven, and SMARC to standardize APIs and middleware, including its new Cloud API. The spec also includes some hardware standardization for COM integration with carrier boards. No other COM vendor has yet endorsed the ARM and x86 compatible standard, which Congatec plans to advance through the PICMG (COM Express) and SGET (SMARC, Qseven) standards organizations. Without third-party support or even a published spec or white paper, it appears the ComX standard will be at least initially be deployed as an API/middleware standard for Congatec’s own COMs. ComX architecture (click image to enlarge) ComX will establish “additional design-in and API standardization on top of the core standards to further simplify the development of customers’ dedicated applications based on standardized embedded computing building blocks,” says Congatec in its rather vague press release. ComX will standardize APIs IoT, cloud, and EAPI, with specific support for “IoT gateways or embedded features of COM Express Type 7 server-on-modules,” says the company. The ComX standard will also include “approved circuit diagrams and logic for demanded carrier board implementations.” These are said to include “FPGA integration, switching logic for USB-C, or for SMART battery logic.” The standard covers both ARM and x86 based COMs, and presumably it’s also cross platform in terms of operating systems. Conga-UMX6 At ESEC this week, Congatec is demonstrating several of its COMs that tap early components of the ComX spec. Principal among these is a quick boot demo running on its NXP i.MX6-based, µQseven form-factor Conga-UMX6 module. The demo taps an i.MX6 quick-boot function that boots systems “in less than a second from power off to full operation including running applications,” says Congatec. “ComX standardization includes the CPU technology independent implementation of a carrier board,” stated Christian Eder, director marketing at Congatec, in relation to the quick-boot demo. “A clever designed carrier board can utilize I2S for ARM and HDA for x86 sound implementation.” Conga-SA5 In another demo, the Intel Atom E3900 (“Apollo Lake”) based Conga-SA5 SMARC 2.0 module is used to demonstrate “fully featured USB Type C connectivity with USB 3.1 Gen1, power and graphics.” The demo appears to use a ComX API detailing a standard way to interface with Type-C connectors. “System engineers don’t need to think about the interface setup anymore,” stated Eder. Conga-B7XD Congatec is also demonstrating its Intel 5th Gen Core Xeon D based Conga-B7XD COM Express Type 7 “server-on-module” supporting dual 10 GbE and 32 PCIe lanes. “Now we need to extend the EAPI standardization for server type functionality”, stated Eder in reference to the Type 7 standard. Finally, Congatec is showing its Cloud API running on its Linux-ready Conga-IoT gateway, a commercial version of the OEM-focused Conga IoT Gateway System reference design that was announced last August. The gateway is powered by an Intel “Bay Trail” Conga-QA3 Qseven module. Conga-IoT gateway (left) and Conga-QA3 module (click images to enlarge) The Cloud API, which is “a proposed element of SGETs API standardization, is intended as a “universal hub between local sensor networks and the IoT clouds. The API is said to offer “secure bidirectional data exchange with any suitable clouds,” using “the TLS secured MQTT protocol,” says Congatec.   Other embedded API and middleware stacks Congatec is not the only hardware vendor attempting to unify a diverse set of embedded boards with similarly standardized APIs, middleware, and IoT cloud connectivity. So far, most are focusing on their own products and/or hardware from ecosystem partners designed to work with them. Eurotech was an early leader in this area with its Everyware Software Framework (ESF), an IoT framework based on the Java/OSGi Eclipse Kura project. Adlink has its Smart Embedded Management Agent (SEMA) device management and SEMA Cloud solutions for its embedded boards. Just this week, Portwell announced a line of RS4U industrial computers that all share a Portwell API stack for remote monitoring and control. Advantech’s ELAA architecutre (click image to enlarge) Advantech appears to be after something more universal with its recently announced Embedded Linux & Android Alliance (ELAA) consortium, which hopes to standardize board adoption of an “open and unified architecture for embedded Linux and Android OS for industrial embedded and IoT application.” No other major hardware vendors have joined, however, so it appears to be mostly about Advantech gear. Dell is the force behind a new Linux Foundation hosted EdgeX Foundry project for standardizing middleware on IoT gateways around its FUSE project. EdgeX Foundry will establish an ecosystem of companies that offer interoperable, open source plug-and-play components.   Further information Congatec’s ComX announcement may be found here.   Related posts: COM Express Type 7 module has dual 10GbE and 32 PCIe lanes Mini Apollo Lake module takes the heat — and the cold Tiny µQseven module runs Android and Linux on i.MX6 COM runs Linux on Kaby Lake, supports Intel Optane Congatec’s first Apollo Lake COMs include SMARC 2.0 model ﻿COM Express "server on module" taps Skylake… Qseven computer-on-module debuts 3W Atom Industrial thin Mini-ITX runs on 7th Gen Intel CPUs Three more Apollo Lake COMs support Qseven and COM Express Compact module runs Linux on quad-core Braswell (advertise here) PLEASE COMMENT BELOW Please comment here...

Robot overlords only. Will not be accurate. Yeah. Bruins in the NHL lead came later from that occurred in Callahan show time hockey. Like you east York. Rear axle from Mars you'll sports like your criminal we ought to be in jail that's always okay. EEye dot com Bruins right there tied an. Anderson former Bruin intelligent AF personality when did fired his nine year NHL veteran Brian we. Saturdays game it's Brock bond and AT&T and star mark indiscriminate got a lot of losses. So he's taught right. On Sports Radio WB yeah. Player of the pro except a couple of issues as they always do rear but Aaliyah album coming up from the closet you know he is outweigh even I don't his last few weeks all sunshine and ultimately that's. Let's get into some of the good stuff before we get to a few of the issues relate maybe the only good think about Thursday's game. Pretty much every game this year you can count on David postured scored five goals since we last spoke while five more calm. 34% of the league years gone 28 games in the Bruins and this guy as this five. Bodies tied for the league leading goals was Sidney Crosby right now eighteen. According game when a Monday that brought the house Belmont that you call you hate those Monday. Yahoo!'s actually. I shut me up it was a pretty at this and I guess they'll you know best game of the week for sure. One man show breakaway Wednesday they'll come back against the caps they at least got the lose your point in DC on Wednesday and more beauties Thursday. One otherwise was a dud performance against the ads the David pasta night. On a stretch here with fourteen goals in his last seventeen games played. Tai Anderson crunch the numbers not for the website and came up with 56 bowl pace right now that he is on just based on the games he's played this year. And Andy and goals per game numbers self. Mr. pastoral simple and what are we what are we seeing here is this a legit superstar are we gonna get a little bit ahead of ourselves based on a 45 games sample for possibly start the year. I think he's the real deal and I think guy I mean. I thought he was on a six eagle pace but that's why I'm an English major not a business page I'll take your word for yes dike it played over don't know ideology I differed on anybody on math. Yeah I think he's a real deal I mean we saw glimpses of it is his. His rookie year we said Wallace this kid is something else how to how to pronounce get him in the draft you know when they got him some in the twenties when he fifth when he fifth. And then you know lashing he was dirty struggle a little bit mainly some animated Tony's kids who delete has figured out yet the first year then. They did the second year but not as this gets special I mean he's. He's doing things all pale we haven't seen since I was sitting in a mail in. No not China had to twist the knife to state a fact. You know liberal ones have not had a game breaker since I was Sagan as good as Marchand is he's. Firefights sniper goals coral that I don't I would often common game breaker but but passed an arc. As we shot the out all the time came overtime goal Monday night that's a game break a typo that's a that's the type a ball out of super stop school is. I don't know that he's gonna be. You know I think he's gonna be more vocal score than SATA I mean you know take a look at his points right here he's got. It's seventeen goals. Poses a says he has tried to slow 224 sixers so yes six helpers it's exactly so he's he's deathly more more of a sniper. That a that a set up man but I mean yeah if you got a guy whose push fifty goals play in a season that's supersize ours up it's on the. And oh that's in year aside in this league any mortgage Crosby had 51 when you're tied for the for the rocket Rashard but. Big it's fifty got to be off the charts I don't think you'll get there personally with that injury history you bring up. But hell I was look at before the year if he gets 122 point five you gotta be happy he stays healthy enough to get to a consist 125. He's gonna get. Easy go back into thirty by accident at this point. I think I mean based on what we've seen I think he's going to be California consistent 35 to four Google score I mean I I think that. And a skill on display if he's got a a pretty nice boy do you work and you know only. Geez 212 plus season door to a third seasons right now and I'm sold I mean I I don't that this kid's gonna Rick regressed at all. And he put some size on he's he's got a lot of grip and he goes to those greasy areas that a lot of guys who hit with his talent I don't like to go to one. He doesn't shy away from it you know he's got the chipped teeth and you know placed he's kind of got that like rodeo like hockey player look to a home that. You know that he's he's at he's a pretty tough kid man I I think he's he's gonna be a dynamic player. It's the big blog is the big question what kind of money he is he is going to be looking fought I don't think the bronze award above Darren I didn't see how he does this season but yet. You know he is there he's got to be restricted free age why just hold on general I'll get up so I don't have missed a lot of what it duty but they're locked in a sign it now obviously this is the worst time so I don't know they would get this is no like I know I get ahead of his final run the other way if they use the his agent guys calling you know they got this. You know play this season LB obviously I mean MIS. You know oil and less who knows what the Bruins had been very secretive I mean unless they don't once I'm now on or less popular fears injury concerns himself yes not a bunch I guess I shouldn't say that I don't on the media as he had a bunch Izzy and you only get three different injuries last year he missed them. He missed. The first 44 games he played in thirteen games last year he had. Hand injury he actually played in the world juniors or treatment right hand injury which that was the some controversy. You had a back issue. This year he had another we missed three games to torture when laws right on the upper body in history. And when they drafted and you mention why he felt point five he had a back injury. In the Swedish league which kind of hurt his stock a little bit that's kind of why he felt when he fifth overall when you were so. That's five different issues in the last three years I would say that's injury prone. Now I don't buy it I think I think he's just a hockey play a hockey players get hurt I mean obviously some guys and oracle. Always is arc you play a leaves a little guy on me look at Germany's east east W small but I I don't see is always knew we better not sign him while we've got to be he's got an injury I mean. But I have to sign every player has no every player in the league has it's some sort of injury history I don't think there's any concern whatsoever mean. You know he I think he fell on the draft not just for the injured big TV's final Lola TSB Swedish I think he wasn't third tier it yet and I know guys you know if but I can like him as a bad playoffs. Scouts kind of forget about no fault that and mean it it's kind of weird because the gas got behind a guy and he has about three months and all of a sudden. He's a forgotten man you know I mean I think that might have been a little bit of a case to the pots that I would will certainly a couple teams is everybody passed on a lot of teams passed on. But no I haven't actually no concerns whatsoever I mean you know you look at it every every player and every team it's up like BI and the incitement. Now every guy's been heard it at some point and you know last year every that you are playing hockey I mean you know it's just I don't think that he's riddler injury prone and. Well but I you're gonna hand out seven and a half billion a year to them and that's the money that was our talk and seven and half terrorist cinco got that money. OK after three years now let's that was Canada. Skewed assist on the side of the yeah but he's got what terror so it was a thirteen you sit here and eighteen if you're David pops the next agent. Don't you look at what he's done so far and you start talking about 77 and a half per you know million per season. I would say the Bruins would come back and say what you're saying we will let this play out receive full year you gotta stay healthy prove it. And I'll think that hit as far as I know his side's not clamored for a good idea or anything right now on I learned attic yet another return I mean I'm the only. Not again not the what the brought to surprise me if they're in a month they really they don't make amounts it always sent to a six year. You know. 32 million dollar extension some like I wouldn't ship surprise me at all. But the same time you know this kid's ease basically in a contract the air albeit a restricted free agent but you know he he he can still take into the clean as what it wants the F. The Wednesday night game was the rivalry game on ABC ends they actually talked about possibly its contract and it Bob McKenzie said he thinks it's gonna be minimum six years six million per. That'll be the starting point if you wanna sign into that kind of contract but the weird thing in NHL free agency is always. East you go for a bridge here. We seen a couple of them were players have Superman had one of those right PK Yemeni state animal to cheap for a couple years and then he signed this blockbuster. Two years later because he's it was like short term gain for the Canadian stating that the pay him. On a second deal but the third deal came up quicker and they had the blow the doors off and make the highest paid guy in the league self. As the Ottawa the Bruins finances will be in two years compared to now maybe he'll try to push data on just missed a short bridge year. And the player to know much room for. You know for debate except I guess you bring up Sagan and some of the other young players that the brewers about the last two years Doug Hamilton. And they did manage to get their way out of town. Yeah different circumstances different situations but would cost an apple Doug Hamilton a Seattle a play here rich because trade me right now sort of. We now I I think he's happy here I don't think he wants to go anywhere and I mean I I I would think he'd. Wanna stay I I would think he'd want a long term deal. I'm whether he signs it and you know an extension now or log waste of India. And what Bob McKenzie saying I mean a bomb public release candidate is from rewrite re pretty much why Clark yet. And 66 times six sounds about right I mean I would you know I mean I would love it like to go I mean. I think eight aids the most they can go I believe that's correct so I mean typically I mean he's he's had good I'd say you don't. Given meet in if you get him under six per year but yes six times six. I I do it now I wouldn't even mess sort of bridge abridged deal I'd I mean. You know he is young he's still the only twenty years old but in the last time the Bruins gave finally give big basic voluntarily gave to core contract he would add that that. Contract they gave no one year deal any any amongst the Iranian that a that's that's why he's making the money's Megan up is the Bruins allowed him. You know liberals go locked him up a lot cheaper and they kind of idol I think big for some reason weren't completely sold on but the time. And he made them pay fart not I think they should remember that you know when it comes. Pasternak. Mean it away don't you think the the losing of Sagan. Castle I mean at the Milosevic and these cases they. Mean potentially move them and probably did there are a lot of factors but because they let young talent go for the second contract. In the last ten years and number at times. Management is sort pressure here they they can't let this capital boss he can't let this player now. SER I don't think they even think that way I think that's just think the fans social meat out of the I us you know they the roles like. While we trade jolt the one we trader Phil Kessel trade tire we can't do this again I I it's it's history it's like. That was you know lists under different regimes different GM's different I mean it's history is later has they'll Jacobson nearly they would hear it. Well they sit in the offseason jolting Audrey and Gaza killed Joseph Thornton's got nine to do it nearly Joseph thought was before kneeling dream. It's it's just they are right I mean I know it's it's and violated the if you try if you animate. Think to make the joke of the broader trip pop that up before. Pause in don't do it because it. Is that joke is a million times ever and it's what and adds if Wembley of people make in the same joke it's not a good joke. But by a by all means this this kid at all clock c'mon man I give give them don't get in the filed but. I think he wants to be here if you can if you consigned him in keep him here I don't think that. To trade stuff it's all individual every play is individual idol. It's not just the fine it is explain you know they they weren't sold on jolt the one as a as a guy who's gonna get into the Stanley Cup. India we are at that point it help they were a point as a team more help them rock bottom and you know high draft pick and flipped for assets which they turned into cup ride I'm Natalie that was their plan from the get go I think it was state they'd. They were about to commit. Kind of similar so I guess you don't peak case to win in Montreal they're about to commit. This all kinds of money to a guy an ending and they got cold feet at the last minute and a and that's the liberal exhibit with the Latin and but he dressed Kessel after trading or is it right is they don't hesitate identity they bottomed out made and they locked out they've been noted that lucked out and get castle. I mean at no one like the bond trade the time the return was was terrible I mean it's still a bad trade. But I am I call Brad Stuart Marcus terminally pre reproduce exactly I was them but it will wooded and the Debian was. The most you know in the best most inadvertent salaried company history yet because that ended up allow them to you know bring in gyrate and survived of course you know that changed the whole complexion or future of the franchise shall. Yet data is that the return of the trade was on the end result if you really can't argue it in you know ten years later joked on he has been with Stanley Cup but he has a one yet itself. But that it traded Kessel they got the pick they got a Sagan and they treated say in and kick the can down the road for so many years at some point I wanna invest in young guys that you are going to be around. I guess my question to the throw an audio Saturday skate at six or seven sevenths and 97937. Stellar would be. The are you sold on pasta not that he's a superstar. As as much of a goal scoring stars we've seen the Bruins haven't. Why are somebody throw out David had a league leader in ending goals since in what 41 years says the zero. The supplement your eye on the nearly nearly didn't legally panel excelling as an art when you are Neil and guy he's gotten it may may have been as brazile down so. At this I don't expect him to win the Rashard this year again Ike he's gonna cool lot some especially with this team but what's most remarkable is. The Bruins are 25 in the league in scoring. He Stifel beat Italy think tied with Crosby now an eighteen goals he's got a 37%. Of their goals or something ridiculous right now. They scored six. 66 goals this year he is eighteen and a spot court when he ma forty sevens pretty crazy hours at. That's a pretty could job but I just can't keep up that pace eventually teams are gonna take you now. Right is also indicative of the lack of scorn from the rest of the line up to which which has been an issue to. You know we go we got a good game out of spoon you know look like all meant he could do this than big big elegant to viable lines but any doors album has a dubbed the next gaming. He just you know kind of that inconsistency would get mad at himself and he's in the similar postured I vote and that they came up together about the same time a few years ago they're both restricted free agents and they couldn't be anymore. Any further from one another terms stock right now Spooner prospect guys just exploding. Got law meets Boras she's 24 years old he's you know he's CA Dutch older you know he's. Cannot I don't would if the Bruins are frustrated with them a lot of law. What we know what that I with the plans I don't think he's going anywhere right now I mean in the ACC game against Florida he was great it was the best skater updating you on clos bump up the the the first Lionel while the try to creature you ride The Who and the third Peary the ends up you know set up the wall that the ten and the almost looked like the game winning goal until Florida tied it again and then Colorado I mean. I guess everybody look bad verse Colorado the other night shall mean to single sport or probable probably isn't fear because nobody really played good from who'd who build and on out. Shall I I just you know I like to see him. In be more consistent make as I can say it if you got Backus preachy in sport to play a while that's no that's a viable wind that's that's a good number two line play and then. You know you got a couple guys like you know Schaub has been scorn more than probably we expected. Don Moore what map last year gets back from injury you know those guys in your bottom six you know pretty good guys they have done them. Well when there's a roster changes for tonight's game as well on day at the kind in the young. Recent draft pick of the Bruins were receipt taking as the fourth round pick actually. Not like he was Los in the first round guy but. Mining came in as a 434014. We summer Linear for seven games yet back up tonight he's gonna be on the second line the quote unquote. The county line what do you call it. Great she Backus and hi it's nice that tells you need to know about explode thinks its borders game and your right it I actually wrote this down after the Monday game. Because originally it was on a post game and he was asked about Hillary said quote. Better when he wants the play he's a good player looking for more of that from them and quote I mean. Like Belichick would never say that about a player that Julien will call guys out and it's pretty clear what they think Spiller leads. Some nights they just feel like he's not printed and Thursday was a mess on the first goal is turned all over the place yet. He it's a he had at that doesn't think he's one of these draft picks that. You know has been considered inconsistent fought them I mean he eats he's look great to me he's looked like up you know law. At times of a pretty good number to Sandra I mean look okay got this could could could be a long term senator in this league and then. You know he goes on and on a slide Leahy he's he's not really get that done I mean of course. He is a natural Senna he's he's not playing his natural position right now shall. You know in part we take that into account but. At the same time I mean that's hockey at its. No real mystery to it if you if you get stuck in the when you play the winging AM in new do we need the one that and and I imagine they feel like he failed at center last year that's why he's a wing right now. Down we haven't really seen them much much right now and try and thorough Miami haven't seen a much this year and it ought alters are reluctant swell with close to use them there because it's you know kind of morbid to pass a role of and the third. But there when your third mine senate typically is a defense of died in Ryan's boredom you know defense hasn't been his Forte in his time in Boston so. Yeah I'd say it's up to keep and I ought to I am I guess I don't I don't mode that willing to trade him I know has been some scuttlebutt out there that you know his name is all about. I don't I mean GM's stock every every mean if if that was a criteria than every game everyone's available as you know guys get asked about. And I you know if if GMs aren't taken calls them not on the job. Just like it's a bad time to sign prospects pretty bad time to traits border until he starts putting it together consistently you know it's not gonna get much for Saturday skate here on Sports Radio WB Ike Hillard and rear admiral Lyndon byers and join us in the 4 o'clock hour we think we got out and mistrust they'll be last out to be telling it and what would stop lamp black Betty Graham jam they'll they'll remain out of that'll be like as a has beat a beacon also up. We're gonna do just quick five minute check in with mark giver of the Providence journal it is Intel on the united he's been watched him last the couple weeks and also just a quick. Little recap the some of the prospects and how did Dylan in the HL it's a 345 marks could be joining us. Presented by AT&T mobilizing your world and star markets he would makes a shine. Validate the producer today Al wanted to fire up the sound bite for you because speaking Thursday and closed its. Analysts say he's who he blasted after the game but who he blamed for Thursday night this as we said here they've lost to a row it's been an interesting week they had a pretty good when Monday although they blew a couple one goal leads Wednesday huge come out of that game feeling pretty good about. Yes the contest the minute battle back for point yet it's fellas. Dell is a good sign I mean obviously pulling down freed up that wasn't by. To be down three nothing for minutes up in the second period against a team might Washington on the road in the come out of to a point. I'll take it any any any time. There are a lot of problematic things like no doubt that. Power play could help us in the first period and failed to do that so they got to be better we need is some things tonight we can get them. He's got to be better a lot of things here that we can we can get better at and take responsibility. It allows Claudette to Thursday after the loss would fall on two not that are lead and 30 they come back Austin like it's yet Google's and eventually lose four to. So the two things Julian blames after the game he arc. The power play. And it could open. What do you make of that. Could open was not the guy that I that he was good nobody was really good in that game. Did he wasn't he he lets dump the other night I had no problem that you know you thought east mean I was at that last that long range goalie gave up. The Mitchell goal was was not that guy in the third and honestly got. Sometimes sights set a goal like that can beat a back breaker and you know like maybe woods is he's got to make some sage maybe might mean now a particular but. Close doesn't do it often he doesn't do it my time to. In all out but he gets pissed off Vinnie you know he I think what brutal little handle it I I have no problem at all. And also too I mean we don't know what else cloud said before at the natural I don't know that we do it rained who who'd been on the problem that was his only answer and he blamed the power play antidote. And that he actually did later blame we weren't Smart and early parts of the game we were little tired from playing the right to back nights we gotta be smarter. Let me just it's that's an eyebrow raiser when you gonna blame you're gonna point out two things you're gonna signal to things the coach one of the power polluting everybody's. You know your bros tenure in unhappy with it was a backup goaltender. Well that's it that's stretching is the it was a little barrel and it's an old enemies back at least out of that night so look if you can blame him for the first two Colorado Eagles there's. I for honesty I forget which one was built two goals he should act and you when you give up two goals like that the I have no problem the coach gone on I've known that's. Yeah I did Tuesday means that the one from what I've practicable and terrible goal that's it's terrible bowl and then a little windows on a breakaway. Now that you thought honest I mean off first who goes unto Sheen scored unassisted after a Spiller was all turnaround use on his back in front that. I'm that was the first goal Macinnis scored after crew died they don't the Blue Line and our players the short hander I I Nazi I'd have to look at the video. Two counts it's a couple days I don't remitted I suppose from Butler and it was a garbage goal I mean it's a save that any NHL goal he has the make. And you know that's that that can be the difference in the game it's got to be a backbreaking bullion and team battling back you might tied up. Well you know you get within a goal and an eagle is about arc arc crackle like I don't it won crystal what elephant that's all it takes men and in if that's it. Swings the momentum and ends up being the difference in the game in the coach calls a mild good needle. Approach stick your week it's like 125 nail the roster wise but it's not he's the goalie and he's out of it came it's not always the back up goalie he spoke earlier coaches all the finally joined that night when you get back have been. We got arise our level little bit it's he's obviously not as tilted his Tuukka. We know that so if he's if he gives a one bad goal tonight. You're gonna hang on to the podium at the site is exhibit B of why we lost the right but I like caller I just didn't think that was very good. There I got out I mean feats he says goalie play like crap any any said he said sowed the media again he doesn't torn off and he's got a lift clean all the players he does he's usually pretty good call I mean as far as not name and image hit in name names you obviously the goal he's got to make the save that obvious who started all but. I have no problem it's elaborate folic. He's like the utility guy and a baseball team who you know. You know went all for three or something and it's not he'd stay out of the game he was the goalie and he was the guy in net. Any was daddy when he did he was he could have been better in the and they could impossibly on the game. You know if if in the senate name and you know one of awful it are one of a defensemen I mean yeah who would double wasn't good and the goalie has the make saves I don't like that's fine I can hope rob what. Tell us would you think Sports Radio Debbie guys Bruins coverage here on Saturday skate three a five every Saturday Keller rear admiral from barge the sports Lyndon byers will be up and in it for we'll get a couple minutes with more giver of the Providence journal nature calls 6177797937. Is pasta not a superstar one about Steelers game of late couple polyps today. And Julian blaming the backup goaltender in part for Thursday night's loss more your calls and a reaction coming up a Sports Radio Debbie yet. You were listening to us Saturday skeet with a rear admiral and canned Laird. On Sports Radio WEEI. No I don't have. Senate differences in my. Go Vista to make the playoffs you know and have to experience them. I would test two in defending cup you know and and so so I'm I'm still focusing. It Abbas and like after the Yankee Thursday when he picked up the dome over eighteen type Sidney Crosby the league lead Saturday skater a portrait you to be I percent of my AT&T it's our market. Laird in the admiral. He's not your prototypical superstar he's going to be that weighs the benefit of the language barriers cities get the F nice sport chicklet there in the front month. Tom little guy not he's not physically imposing like former goal scoring stars the Bruins of that although he's beefed up a bit I think up. 68 was so the pal did she came into the league with. Yeah a few years ago that small and so I mean he's listed at six feet 182 compounds and many still 22 on the night. You know lot of guys EC still you know he's still grown back I think you know I mean he's still pretty you point. Why have him as a lead blowing you know it'll just still fill out at least 11 point two years old so even Sagan is well built it please. And it started remember when he was here he was he was actually nor did do probably similarities in size Sagan got a lot big a lot he was here but he doesn't he doesn't like Jack when he got here. When he lemmings aliens did pretty big idol operative and when he broke into the league. But you know he's like some pasta still 28 big east you know still finish of puberty disarm in some degree. What's also impressive as a possible like those of four power play goals the he's not played on the first power play as good eighteen and mostly it's on the strike he ultimately lead Geneva sprinkles. So Lisa the question. When does he get more power play time for a power play you that is. 25 in the league admiral 14%. Event at two power play goals the last eight games it's just not clicking. Julian blamed in part Thursday they give it up for short he's one of them in the first period did you know bundle to Ole hole. I don't exactly know where you would put him I think that's the problem in essence on that first unit but it's some political they have to keep him in there just for a couple reps I mean. All crew to the point if you have to I. Yeah I wanna great mysteries of that cover in the drones the last few years assembly is as you know what's close what's the method to close power play bad news because. You know he he refused to use my show on their fears you know Brad marsh on the one you know will be fought past the team's best schools score. And he couldn't you know he could buy his way into the popularly known in. Adult if Claudette some sort of communal meritocracy Durham practice talks all all what it is but it it makes no sense a lot of times you know to have. You best goal scored not on your number one unit when you know when you. You trying to trying to score against trying to win games I I don't know why I don't know why he doesn't have their. Again I don't know if it's some sort of an unknown meritocracy system that we don't know ball put. Could be it I think people brought up affected Bergeron because he's a right shot in the law of him in the middle there between the circles. It's going to be tough to put pasta knock on the left wing. He needs a guy that can feed them off the right sports. Gala warts and all are also could be like you just said there's such an oval load. A lot of tell there's a lot of talent on the first unit will put a guy like past that now you have to dangers units Jones that a in only eight by keeping him on the second unit Jimmy he's obviously. The most dangerous goals scored night you have him on on the second power play unit in you still vote PP one that's pretty potent itself and saw a case of the accident it takes fifty staffed eight minus the pot of the whole pot and it not working at all. But you know and in theory you know if you if you first unit is doing good. You know it nice second unit's debt that the best you know the best score in the legal saw that on May be maybe it's about balance and things off. With quote. But he added they opened its doors been on their fur a good stretch yeah he's a meritocracy you know yeah ideas that are exactly again like I said it's it's it's been a mystery since since closed been here as. Exactly which way how he handles Powell play I mean I. I know that would mean it was terrible for years and and I think when they brought Joseph Sakhalin. As an assistant aid aid it got better I mean it was one of the best power plays in the league you know last company has an industrialist it's like will will what happened I mean I don't think Louis Erickson was the key to the pros I'll play last year alike. So you know easily ideas are strong immense anger exploded gab but it's you know that you gotta stay ahead of fear you know if your coach in this eagle you're just make the proper adjustment I mean. And that's all usually uses is it just cat sometimes. Personal matter one take one guy out maybe put on the guy and I just you know just a small adjustment what did Dolan but you know I cannot think that the they cover pop label will come around at some point. You know this is too much skill analyst what skill when they Allen have a final four mean it is as much cannot soiree and others still. Ohio high among the skill to have one on you know it's just feel like they're goals ought to come at some point the those ago. On again listening in on your Saturday skate with only to rear admiral idol but there I don't but I don't blob. Are not like I say that you haven't. Show. It's great when you get a chance to talk art. It are you hit twenty or seven dollar odds for all baseball but there's always roll or hockey. He mimics a lot. I would drop a little disappointed in a lot the other night especially after I knocked it in it's it was spot on a little bit of an identity. Washington. Game. You know. As far as we're talking about sport out. I think you know the word I know we share instead. He wants a place on and he's not happy that he planned way so he's kinda. I used a chart outing in some way. And right now like for. It's like Canseco wrote its own and get something damn site too hot heat I know everybody moms who is our ability bought. He's just brutal on defense other and it gave the other night where spellbound I mean the mistake you're. Oh the skating ability. Orbit are not outweigh that the parents distinct. Mob like eight other approved. Fan but EDU beyond just though gold earlier in that period he had a brutal turnover in the neutral zone to crew meet like throne behind his back into the Red Line. And even even I was taken like you bad curbs got to step his game up at times here. Well that's what I'm talking about it's far too dull bit ticked I lucked out on the ankles. I mean he would have made a couple of stage. In that game sort of allow colts. When which which what did you blame for rear I disagreed and I I think in all I. Really. I was a pretty. It was held resentment on Ari. That Erik Cole a third wheel for sure yet the on the left wing restock it shorts and and then after up. They came back to make it to read so and to allow that goal that happened up. And take away the momentum that they act Colin Ellis Cilic but I don't think we do all I am totally out now. You know and everybody know what kind of ball you which like C. It sacred make you know not gonna happen right now. But when the real hot spots app and app and new years which he's not getting ready you know make it will serve up. Playoffs. What would you like this dot. Well that's the call Bob. Really get too obvious needs right now at a meeting it'll only for a veteran Winger deploy again they're the creature back slide or deceit and kinda tonight the analysts he or Frankfurt trying to come out of nowhere this team needs a top six Winger that that's an obvious ya have in San that did you know they they need to bring someone in a on the top six to score some goals is that it's not happening right now that to the degree needed to. They also have a continual rotation they try out a little for the you know the bottom paired defensemen kill morals going to be in their tonight for Colin Miller who had a nice goal. People he had the one power play goal the week break the tie it up in the third in DC as the capitals that was indelible moment yeah that's what you wanna see Colin Miller be doing on a regular basis but. IBC's much Cilic he's benched kneipher Jill moral soul. You know clearly they can use any veteran defenseman. Puck mover or otherwise chat Kirk's names thrown out forever but those would be to lobby of that at this yeah I don't know what's borders boaters not to negate to anybody that caliber. Now not cardinal now I I don't all of them really look at the money committed data I'd I don't hold that the gonna dump crew I know people keep mentioning his name I mean five it would be nice to get five million off the books that. Maybe spent somewhere else I think depriving enemy book and more just in to get some goals scored I don't think they have. You know I don't think they think that the a yield of the main issue right now is is goals go on this team and you know I'll take a look at the you know would tended freeagent side. You know this is tennis it's tie in with which teams. In you know global poverty is so aware of the announced platelets what did Dallas for example. The other anyone point out I know he's this. No brutal no hardly hear you have a hard time trading for anybody this year for juries nobody's out of it's you gotta wait a long time it would teams finally do fall out of that. The draft crop apparently is not very good this year so teams aren't really that psyched about tank. It's going to be hard to convince owners that they were gold the next Austin Matthews isn't dealt tonight with the leafs has apparently this draft crop not that good so. Not only is gonna be a he has gonna be very exciting. Here's a million finally got it. After only get life. Back again why I mean evacuate who he's he's unrestricted this year a sign that he got that. Monster deal I mean if for his agent. You know how I mean forty outlet that tank that was a lot of money Colorado gave him while Scott a ball to eight mile your obviously he got so it can still I mean he's you know he actually can still help ya. Just what don't Colorado man I mean because like you say everybody still alive but I mean Al west. You know I would say Colorado and Arizona I mean it I I know it's Eric early every pronounce and team but. I don't see them Yemeni eight points back already and it not they would have to LeapFrog vehicle would Dallas LA in Nashville to gets that's it just to the eighth seed. I think you know I think it's almost an impossible task so. You know he audacity style cable who let would you sell look at what was going to be free agents and why on bad teams and I thought it in I'm you know first good ideas as we started. It you know right away Jerome again the pop Saito Colorado jumps right out you know now obviously the deadlines with this team we've seen before you know I mean he does come for on the go around the in another name of course you know this is all along waited elbow like. If you know if Dallas is doesn't fix it goaltender and it and they play themselves. Out of play opposition Patrick shops at in on unrestricted free agent. You know have gets old war horses their Jack in all of us saw you getting don't know those are gay you know what tough. Those are pretty damn good all of us to bring a bit of rent couples might has like got off a sniper of that level. Who cares all the you know like you know it's it's complementary piece in the it would it be ideal again I'm just drawn now I'm just bailed thrown dots as. Look at it look at it potential free agents but you know it it could be some decent names you know. When the deadline rolls around. I'd Saturday skating here on sports rated BI LB will be joining us we think about top of the hour the UCS finest and the former Bruins will be hopping in now also up. We have coming up next more devers gonna be on. Which added a deep lengthy boring interviews. Hero sports rated RBI that was you know so we're double and a pivotal fight it gives me a five reject him. Guy covers products rose because dateline is coming up tonight so how's he been doing of late. Just a quick hit on a couple prospects down their old Garrett grizzly. The brusque the first round pick from a few years ago smoky short week. Get back your calls excellent seven service at 97937. Laird the admiral here Saturday's game Saturday's game continues here on Sports Radio WEE I can't land along with rear admiral from Parcells sports joining us on the foes for little stand behind in the Intel what's called that. Now we got that mark giver who is an accurate for the Providence journal who's been covering the. No problem. I'm doing good how are you guys. We're great sounds like kind and is back in tonight we saw him for a seven games here to start the year though without producing a point they set him back down now you're way how much have you seen them since send a what's the scouting report. Was able budget science although I was not last night's game. He's been in and out as a lot of young guys are you know he's the first you're probably can useful thing three games in three nights in the whole. All grind of the pro game. Play against. You know bigger men than he faced in college so he's been inconsistent which got. Ellis to be expected he's got some good games and he's done all the games where you know knows so much. Has he been put in a role to be a score down there or how they use them. Yeah he's in the top six a top sexual. On the foul play you know first off like you know he's in is go to position two we're up quite so it's gonna get down here. And have they been critical when he's disappeared for stretches as as you've highlighted as a given demon tough on him. Are all talk as the word but certainly the ultimate comparable. That's the way they trying to do without hero that's how was under which fascinating and not. And it continues under under Kevin being nobody gets a free ride if they're not doing what what they want. Them to do so yeah he's been held accountable at all. This is what you need to do and if you don't do it you know it's though. I don't told me when that person about what the thinking what are useful once he needs to be harder on aux. You know they don't want to be knowledge Ari whose lives are on Fox's as any guy you're in the seat but he needed to compete a little more on the or check on the wall whatever. So he's been working on that and and like I said there's been some easy he's been successful some nights some nights. Maybe not but. They're not trying to turn it turn into a defensive or by any means they're they're given them freedom to look to make his plays. And there are bad nights when he's done it. It's is that a positive out there he's played he's played well almost without. From what she seemed to this point. If he plays with Backus and Cree chief for a little stretch in your opinion is that the best option the Bruins have right now when you compare it to show all or or Spooner silly guys they've rotated their of that left wing. I would think so I think that tried those guys and you know with. Some success but not all the success that we'll have more. I believe that you know almost can't benign and some that puts up some numbers here over the next week that it's kind of a place holder for. A wreck in the trial. You know who you know relatively close used backed down near Providence stadium practioner a couple of days of the public on the road. Frankie may be out here again to look to start we. And we'll see where that takes some. A few little surprise that he didn't play at least one game in the American League worry before it goes back to Boston just began feet under him after a long way off. Like I say I think Stanton. And let Stanton wants an up and you know now. He's old maps spot or ranking. And not. Its future. Good point mark Deborah maligned from the Providence journal hockey writer covering Providence Bruins and now also of course a College Hockey here in the region. He joins us here a sports rated RBI while much alike mark his real quick a couple of of the potter prospects can give us a cliff notes if you would do it may be thirty seconds on these guys. A ball left Winger Jake to Brusca the Bruins took the first rounds couple years ago as he did not play much. Yeah he has C east another guy who gets a lot of minutes get stoplight time is put into the position played it would strengths as a as little more offensive player than anything else is kind of slow start numbers wise. He's won a Little League leaders in shots on goal but the ought. He's got four goals now the puck really have been gold in form. Almost started to a little bit lately he had he had a goal last night you know he's naked progress. I can see him being financial split down low shore what it is he's a ways away yet. Anybody you would compare to to stop stop your head. Geez I don't know if that's that's coffee he's a playmaker more up I'll play making Winger he's got a sniper in makes plays he can finisher playing. What but he makes a lot blisters like it's any Eagles looked up areas. It also I think you know get his goals that way what so wildly. They haven't been going to have much while. How about on the back end we saw Robby oh guerra to start the year but that he was sent down pretty quickly also guerra progressed. These savagery is ups and doubts he's got that long stick in the long reach Canada any skates pretty well for a big guy like he's got a lot to learn. In handling you know bigger guys around that along the boards playing record progress the guy Israel c'mon I think from the start of the season. Is about the prospect that a culture are actors were. He's a really good at the last couple weekends you do this skating ability to look. He carried the puck up the ice and then and then making plays once he gets up there like the I could see him getting getting a call at some point. It also need to. That's he's been good lately. They can use it of its interest say you know it's not looks like Colin Miller scratch tonight and until morrow is in those guys have been rotating media and maybe Chris look won't push either one of those duke. You'd like to think that right that that he could get those light a fire on those guys you baby a little bit but. No group than good I think it's it's only a matter time before he gets a real chance will look back on this year. While I don't know I don't know illegally out a quarter way through they're Chelsea's and so. Or maybe structure. Lastly tablet just who is the top guy in Providence for lack of better term now is there is there a prospect it's really banged on the door that we don't know about other than the ones you mentioned. While Peter so are are already let banging on the door but he's been very pleasant surprise of it linger from the Czech Republic. Or maybe it's all lucky when he 41 years old he. He's got ten goals in seventeen games got a real good feel around the net. You know can make a play all so he he just came back from the injury and he got a couple goals last night younger people out where the light. Pine and and not go right I don't know that so mark's case is not to NHL standards at this point I think he needs more time. Now here. What's coming off the injury and I think that's a factor but he's an easy looks like a very good prospect that a guy that will Plame leak that someplace just. This needs more seasoning. That's more giver who would. Joined as heroes Sports Radio Debbie I just couple quick minutes on the prospects Gillard rear admiral and nine in that they're talking about the Peters a lark Greer who is it's and they need to hear from about I'd seen play at all but he has. More than this he says the big body physical power for some people wanted to see him instead of the united that I can get behind and who was more than goals scored. Out university Denver scored twenty goals back to back years and forty games though he thought he said Peter Scolari for America Soledad bosom buddies assumption that the that there. Now lie so you know anyway that there's a couple guys in the opera bug selling anybody's like. The door they got to be up here right. Right he's right there waiting for the tropic of it right exactly you know I was thinking about that get a nice to know what did. If they try to hold looks you know like similar to what we last from a mean I kid. You know he's like. 1920s gangster with a Tommy got his packaged under the did he shoots all the plays and that's great I mean. I think he I think it's fantastic is that you know that's I produced goals whether prop rebounds. He's going to beat goalie with a good shot but that kid has an NHL caliber shot by definitely now. Is the rest of his game any joke elbow or is it going to be. That's the question of a trial right now a secure enough to what century exactly exactly coming off an injury you know would. You know what would know how desperate as you can be skate as good as he was prior to mean ideally Vizio about these should be fine. You know these guys taken enough time yelled and the other use they use a 100% on the comeback but. You know it that's a Katie he's he's definitely is a modified NHL shot. Hopefully he. Everything else and his game piceance help because if there's a kid if if the draws a count on him you know he K he's certainly their top six potential mallet what that show idea as. If the rest of his game is NH already and he you might see him on the right now preaching. Saturday's date with rear admiral Marshall sports I can learn LB. Hang around we think will be joining us here in the 4 o'clock hour for the final are Saturday skate and now teaching update in the army navy game in the trending all that more calls the six or seven sevenths at night seven night through several presented by AT&T in my stock market Euro Sports Radio to be act.

SK Hynix Rises to World No.3 in Semiconductor Market Facebook 0 Twitter 0 E-mail More Google+ LinkedIn KakaoStory May 11, 2017 11:21 SK Hynix became the world's third largest semiconductor maker thanks to a very strong global memory chip market. According to market research firm IC Insights on Tuesday, SK Hynix recorded sales of US$5.5 billion in the first quarter of this year, third only to Intel's $14.2 billion and Samsung Electronics' $13.6 billion. Last year, SK Hynix was in fifth place behind Qualcomm and Broadcom. The global memory chip market has been very buoyant since the second half of last year due to surging demand for smartphone and server chips. SK came in second in the DRAM market and fifth in NAND flash. Japan's Toshiba, which SK hopes to acquire, came in eighth with $2.9 billion, and Broadcom of the U.S., which is also eyeing Toshiba, ranked fifth with $4.1 billion.  Copyright © Chosunilbo & Chosun.com Previous Next All Headlines Back to Top

Reports said Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Richard Burr, a Republican, and Democrat ranking member Mark Warner, said they had asked Mr Comey to appear before the committee next Tuesday. It was not immediately clear whether Mr Comey would accept the invitation, or if the testimony would be public or closed. Sen. Mark Warner says he and Chmn. Burr have invited James Comey to testify before the Senate Intel Committee on Tuesday. — via @MSNBC pic.twitter.com/4zmnh8vQWs — Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) May 10, 2017 "[We sent out the invitation. We've not heard back yet, we just sent out the invitation this morning," he said, according to CNBC. “He was due to appear tomorrow with all the other heads of the intelligence community. My hope is that he’ll take advantage of this opportunity.” Video not available for syndication Trump says Comey was fired for 'not doing a good job' News of the invitation came as Mr Trump defended his decision to get rid of Mr Comey, a move that was widely criticised by Democrats and at least a dozen Republicans. Mr Trump said that the FBI Director “was not doing a good job”. The president did not explain more about the manner and timing of Mr Comey’s ousting. Mr Warner, along with many of his Democratic colleagues, has called for a special counsel in the Russia probe. Mr Comey reportedly found out that he had been fired on Tuesday around the time the news broke on television. Mr Trump, who received recommendations to fire Comey from Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, wrote in a letter that he wanted to to “find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission”. “The president over the last several months lost confidence in Director Comey, the DOJ (Department of Justice) lost confidence in Director Comey, bipartisan members of Congress made it clear that they had lost confidence in Director Comey and most importantly the rank and file of the FBI had lost confidence in their director,” Deputy White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told a briefing.

Intel's Steven Meyer, Autodesk's Diego Tamburini and Microsoft's Michael Walton took the stage in a closing keynote panel discussion about IIoT best practices, moderated by our very own Karen Field, while Goodyear's Billy Ray Taylor set the morning tone with his talk on transformation and winning. Despite late evening activities the night before at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, attendees rose early to take a final stroll around the expo floor, where demos continued on the center stage and drone competition winners were announced. Don't miss our other conference coverage here.

LePage rules out Senate bid By Max Greenwood - 05/10/17 09:20 PM EDT 17   © Getty Images Maine Gov. Paul LePage is ruling out a 2018 Senate bid, according to a top adviser to the governor.  "Governor Paul LePage has helped the State of Maine achieve the largest number of private sector jobs in history, implement the largest tax cut in state history and implement reforms which have resulted in Maine showing a significant revenue surplus earlier this year, and, while these accomplishments are great, there is more to do," LePage's Senior Political Adviser Brent Littlefield said in a statement Wednesday night. "Therefore the Governor will remain focused on the job at hand and not enter the United States Senate race in 2018," he added.  ADVERTISEMENT LePage said last May that he would weigh a Senate bid against incumbent Sen.

LePage rules out Senate bid MORE did not tap him to serve in his administration.  The Maine governor said in a radio interview last month that he was still strongly considering a Senate run, but acknowledged in that same appearance that he "wouldn't make a very good legislator." LePage, a Republican who is in his second term as governor, is set to leave office next year due to state term limits. It's not yet clear what his next move will be.  LePage was an early backer of Trump's insurgent campaign, and has remained a steadfast defender of the president in his early months in the White House.  LePage's decision not to run for office opens up the GOP field, at least for now, to state Senator Eric Brakey, a libertarian-leaning Republican who has been endorsed by Sen.

Brakey applauded LePage's decision not to run for Senate. "As he focuses on fighting for the people of Maine as our Governor, I look forward to working with him to end the reign of Angus King and restore liberty for little guy – not only in Maine – but down in Washington, DC," Brakey said in a statement.

WebOS has plenty of features. Vibrant greens. Cons Poor contrast. Uneven, inaccurate colors. Bottom Line LG's UH6100 line of 4K TVs can process HDR content, but budget prices mean lower-quality panels with poor contrast and uneven color. By Will Greenwald The good news about 4K TVs is that just about every manufacturer is now jumping on the high dynamic range (HDR) bandwagon, which means a wider range of colors along with darker darks and brighter brights. The bad news is that even if it supports it, a budget TV can only do so much justice to HDR content. LG's ultra high-definition (UHD, or 4K) UH6100 series is very affordable, with the 49-inch 49UH6100 model we tested available for $549.99. It also is loaded with connected features thanks to LG's top-notch WebOS platform. It's a shame that contrast is poor, and color range is uneven. //Compare Similar Products Compare LeEco Super4 X55   %displayPrice%%seller% Sony XBR-49X800D   %displayPrice%%seller% Vizio M50-D1   %displayPrice%%seller% LG 55UH8500   %displayPrice%%seller% LG OLED65B6P   %displayPrice%%seller% Vizio P50-C1   %displayPrice%%seller% SunBriteTV Pro Series Direct-Sun Outdoor TV SB-4217HD   %displayPrice%%seller% Vizio D65u-D2   %displayPrice%%seller% Sony XBR-55X930D   %displayPrice%%seller% TCL 55UP130   %displayPrice%%seller% Editors' Note: This review is based on testing performed on the LG 49UH6100, the 49-inch model in the series. Besides the screen size difference, the 43-inch $449.99 43UH6100 is identical in features, and we expect similar performance from this model. Design Looking like your typical budget TV, the 49UH6100 is plain and unassuming. The screen is surrounded by a 0.6-inch flat, glossy black plastic bezel with no distinguishing features aside from a small LG logo and a power LED in the middle of the bottom edge. The TV sits on two long, curved plastic feet that are almost completely black, with silver-colored strips on their tops. An HDMI port and a USB port face left on the back panel. The other two HDMI ports, along with an Ethernet port, component video input, coaxial audio input, optical audio output, and an antenna/cable connector face directly back. Three HDMI ports are common for budget televisions, though four are preferable. While the 49UH6100 uses WebOS like LG's higher-end TVs, you won't find a motion-sensing Magic Remote in the box. Instead, it comes with a much more conventional 6.7-inch black wand with flat rubber buttons. The remote control has all of the necessary controls for navigating WebOS on the TV, including a direction pad, a number pad, playback controls, and four color buttons. However, the direction pad consists of rectangular buttons that feel indistinguishable from the rest of the remote, making them difficult to find under your thumb without looking. The remote buttons are not backlit. WebOS Even without a Magic Remote and air mouse-like cursor control, the 49UH6100 offers plenty of smart features thanks to LG's WebOS. Many common streaming media apps are available, including Amazon, Hulu, Netflix, Sling TV, and YouTube, along with support for live TV either over the air or with your cable or satellite box through the built-in TV guide. WebOS also supports screen mirroring with Miracast and Intel Wi-Di, though Miracast support has been phased out in most current Android devices in favor of Google Cast, which isn't available here. There's also a web browser on the TV, though using it with the physical buttons is much more awkward than on other LG TVs with the Magic Remote for smoother cursor control. Performance and HDR Just because a TV can accept a high dynamic range (HDR) signal doesn't necessarily mean it can do it justice, and like many budget televisions, that's the case with the 49UH6100. We test TVs using a DVDO AVLab 4K test pattern generator, a Klein K-10A colorimeter, and Portrait Displays' CalMAN 5 software on a Razer Blade Pro notebook. After a basic dark room calibration using the 49UH6100's ISF Calibrated (Dark) picture mode, the 49UH6100 displayed a modest peak brightness of 172.13cd/m2 and a poor black level of 0.15cd/m2 for a 1,147:1 contrast ratio. This means that, even if the TV can process HDR10 content, you don't get a very good range of brights and darks. This is typical performance for budget-minded 4K TVs from major manufacturers—the similarly priced Sony XBR-49X800D shows similar contrast. Vizio's M-series is a bit more expensive, but its panel can get much brighter and darker for a far greater 40,670:1 contrast ratio. Color doesn't fare much better. The chart above shows Rec.709 ideal color values as squares and measured color values as dots. While the TV shows an impressive reach for greens, its reds fall slightly short, and cyan and magenta are very skewed. LG provides a full suite of calibration tools to fix these problems, but out of the box the colors simply aren't very good. Curiously, we've seen the best performance in this price range from lesser-known manufacturers, like LeEco's Super 4x series displays remarkably wide and accurate colors out of the box, and it boasts four times the contrast at 4,938:1. Viewing Experience Despite measured issues with picture quality, HDR content still looks fairly vivid and eye-catching on the 49UH6100. The TV's strong range of greens makes the "Jungle" episode of BBC's Planet Earth II on Ultra HD Blu-ray appear natural and colorful. However, darker parts of scenes, like the fur of lemurs, suffer from the TV's poor black levels—though the hairs can be clearly discerned under sunlight, their fine texture becomes a muddy blob of darkness in shady shots. And while the greens are exceptionally rich and detailed, blues and reds don't exhibit quite as much vibrancy. See How We Test TVs The Great Gatsby demonstrates the 49UH6100's weakness in dark scenes much more prominently. In the film's several dark settings, the characters' black suits disappear against the shadows of the backgrounds, showing very little texture or contour of the fabric. The white shirts and garden lights get satisfyingly bright to prevent the picture from looking too washed out, but anything very dark tends to simply vanish from a lack of deep black levels to provide more room for details in the shadows. Input Lag and Power Consumption Input lag is the amount of time between when a TV receives a signal and the display updates. In the ISF Calibrated (Dark) picture mode, the 49UH6100 shows a poor 75.7ms input lag. However, the Game picture mode displays a far better 16.7ms input lag, at the expense of further skewing the TV's colors cool. This is good performance for any 4K TV. Under normal viewing conditions, the 49UH6100 consumes 76 watts in ISF Expert (Bright) and other modes that push the backlight to full. The ISF Expert (Dark) picture mode cuts that down to 67 watts, slightly under the TV's power-saving APS picture mode. This is a bit lower than the Sony XBR-49X800D, which uses 89 watts. Conclusions The LG 49UH6100 sounds like a fantastic TV on paper, but it makes some major trade-offs in picture quality to hit its low price. While it's packed full of features, including LG's WebOS connected interface and support for HDR content, its poor black levels significantly hold it back, and its wider color gamut seems to only extend to greens. If you want an HDR-capable 4K TV on a budget, the LeEco Super4 X series offers fantastic colors, while the Vizio M-series provides remarkable contrast for its price. If you want strong picture quality with both excellent contrast and a wide range of color, you should prepare to shell out significantly more on a high-end LED TV like LG's UH8500 series.

WebOS has plenty of features. Vibrant greens. Cons Poor contrast. Uneven, inaccurate colors. Bottom Line LG's UH6100 line of 4K TVs can process HDR content, but budget prices mean lower-quality panels with poor contrast and uneven color. By Will Greenwald The good news about 4K TVs is that just about every manufacturer is now jumping on the high dynamic range (HDR) bandwagon, which means a wider range of colors along with darker darks and brighter brights. The bad news is that even if it supports it, a budget TV can only do so much justice to HDR content. LG's ultra high-definition (UHD, or 4K) UH6100 series is very affordable, with the 49-inch 49UH6100 model we tested available for $549.99. It also is loaded with connected features thanks to LG's top-notch WebOS platform. It's a shame that contrast is poor, and color range is uneven. //Compare Similar Products Compare LeEco Super4 X55   %displayPrice%%seller% Sony XBR-49X800D   %displayPrice%%seller% Vizio M50-D1   %displayPrice%%seller% LG 55UH8500   %displayPrice%%seller% LG OLED55B6P   %displayPrice%%seller% Vizio P50-C1   %displayPrice%%seller% SunBriteTV Pro Series Direct-Sun Outdoor TV SB-4217HD   %displayPrice%%seller% Vizio D65u-D2   %displayPrice%%seller% Sony XBR-65X930D   %displayPrice%%seller% TCL 50UP130   %displayPrice%%seller% Design Looking like your typical budget TV, the 49UH6100 is plain and unassuming. The screen is surrounded by a 0.6-inch flat, glossy black plastic bezel with no distinguishing features aside from a small LG logo and a power LED in the middle of the bottom edge. The TV sits on two long, curved plastic feet that are almost completely black, with silver-colored strips on their tops. An HDMI port and a USB port face left on the back panel. The other two HDMI ports, along with an Ethernet port, component video input, coaxial audio input, optical audio output, and an antenna/cable connector face directly back. Three HDMI ports are common for budget televisions, though four are preferable. While the 49UH6100 uses WebOS like LG's higher-end TVs, you won't find a motion-sensing Magic Remote in the box. Instead, it comes with a much more conventional 6.7-inch black wand with flat rubber buttons. The remote control has all of the necessary controls for navigating WebOS on the TV, including a direction pad, a number pad, playback controls, and four color buttons. However, the direction pad consists of rectangular buttons that feel indistinguishable from the rest of the remote, making them difficult to find under your thumb without looking. The remote buttons are not backlit. WebOS Even without a Magic Remote and air mouse-like cursor control, the 49UH6100 offers plenty of smart features thanks to LG's WebOS. Many common streaming media apps are available, including Amazon, Hulu, Netflix, Sling TV, and YouTube, along with support for live TV either over the air or with your cable or satellite box through the built-in TV guide. WebOS also supports screen mirroring with Miracast and Intel Wi-Di, though Miracast support has been phased out in most current Android devices in favor of Google Cast, which isn't available here. There's also a web browser on the TV, though using it with the physical buttons is much more awkward than on other LG TVs with the Magic Remote for smoother cursor control. Performance and HDR Just because a TV can accept a high dynamic range (HDR) signal doesn't necessarily mean it can do it justice, and like many budget televisions, that's the case with the 49UH6100. We test TVs using a DVDO AVLab 4K test pattern generator, a Klein K-10A colorimeter, and Portrait Displays' CalMAN 5 software on a Razer Blade Pro notebook. After a basic dark room calibration using the 49UH6100's ISF Calibrated (Dark) picture mode, the 49UH6100 displayed a modest peak brightness of 172.13cd/m2 and a poor black level of 0.15cd/m2 for a 1,147:1 contrast ratio. This means that, even if the TV can process HDR10 content, you don't get a very good range of brights and darks. This is typical performance for budget-minded 4K TVs from major manufacturers—the similarly priced Sony XBR-49X800D shows similar contrast. Vizio's M-series is a bit more expensive, but its panel can get much brighter and darker for a far greater 40,670:1 contrast ratio. Color doesn't fare much better. The chart above shows Rec.709 ideal color values as squares and measured color values as dots. While the TV shows an impressive reach for greens, its reds fall slightly short, and cyan and magenta are very skewed. LG provides a full suite of calibration tools to fix these problems, but out of the box the colors simply aren't very good. Curiously, we've seen the best performance in this price range from lesser-known manufacturers, like LeEco's Super 4x series displays remarkably wide and accurate colors out of the box, and it boasts four times the contrast at 4,938:1. Viewing Experience Despite measured issues with picture quality, HDR content still looks fairly vivid and eye-catching on the 49UH6100. The TV's strong range of greens makes the "Jungle" episode of BBC's Planet Earth II on Ultra HD Blu-ray appear natural and colorful. However, darker parts of scenes, like the fur of lemurs, suffer from the TV's poor black levels—though the hairs can be clearly discerned under sunlight, their fine texture becomes a muddy blob of darkness in shady shots. And while the greens are exceptionally rich and detailed, blues and reds don't exhibit quite as much vibrancy. See How We Test TVs The Great Gatsby demonstrates the 49UH6100's weakness in dark scenes much more prominently. In the film's several dark settings, the characters' black suits disappear against the shadows of the backgrounds, showing very little texture or contour of the fabric. The white shirts and garden lights get satisfyingly bright to prevent the picture from looking too washed out, but anything very dark tends to simply vanish from a lack of deep black levels to provide more room for details in the shadows. Input Lag and Power Consumption Input lag is the amount of time between when a TV receives a signal and the display updates. In the ISF Calibrated (Dark) picture mode, the 49UH6100 shows a poor 75.7ms input lag.

All rights reserved. jorik/Shutterstock.com Scientists Can Now Switch Between Electrons And Photons in a Single Transistor Welcome to the future. PETER DOCKRILL 11 MAY 2017   Researchers have developed a new kind of transistor laser that can switch between two stable energy states – electronic and photonic – which could one day enable data transfer 100 times faster than conventional digital devices. The transistor prototype features what's called bistability – the capability for a single switch to alternate between optical and electrical signal output – and could help lead to the development of light-based computer systems where data is shuttled in between semiconductors by photons instead of simply electrons.   "Building a transistor with electrical and optical bistability into a computer chip will significantly increase processing speeds," says microelectronics engineer Milton Feng from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, "because the devices can communicate without the interference that occurs when limited to electron-only transistors." In conventional electronic devices, microchips are made up of billions of tiny switches called transistors, which act as gateways to channel the flow of electrons across an integrated circuit. The problem with this model – which has worked pretty well for electronic devices for several decades up until now – is that as modern computer processors have become ever faster and more powerful, the number of transistors on them inevitably increases. This tendency is what's called Moore's Law – the famous prediction by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore that the transistor count on an integrated circuit will double every two years. Moore's Law has actually held up pretty well since it was first forecast back in the 1960s, but a range of technical issues are currently threatening to derail its continuation – which could put a stop to processors getting faster, if we can't think of new ways to build them. Chiefly, transistors have gotten so incredibly small now that it's getting harder to physically shrink them any further, and there are also concerns about how energy-efficient electron-based transistors will be if Moore's Law does continue in the future.   Besides those points, since light can travel significantly faster than electrons inside an integrated circuit, moving to photonics-based processors in place of solely electronic devices makes a lot of sense, which is why scientists are busy studying how we can develop light-based computers. To that end, Feng and fellow researcher Nick Holonyak Jr first developed the concept of the transistor laser back in 2004 – a semiconductor device that incorporates both electrical and optical outputs. "The fastest way for current to switch in a semiconductor material is for the electrons to jump between bands in the material in a process called tunnelling," Feng explained in 2016. "Light photons help shuttle the electrons across, a process called intra-cavity photon-assisted tunnelling, making the device much faster." In their latest research, the same team has now described how the transistor laser can switch between the two signals – a crucial distinction for optical computing, since despite the allure of photonics, the researchers say we will still need to accommodate electrons in future chip designs. "You cannot remove electronics entirely because you need to plug into a current and convert that into light," says Feng.   "That's the problem with the all-optical computer concept some people talk about. It just is not possible because there is no such thing as an all-optical system." In the new study, the researchers detail how they've got their bistable switch working at -50 degrees Celsius (-58 degrees Fahrenheit). The researchers further claim to have actually gotten the device working at room temperature – which is pretty important if we're ever going to use these transistors in actual devices – and will share details on how they accomplished that in an upcoming paper. As for when we'll see this kind of technology in our smartphones and notebooks, it's still not entirely clear. But it's a sure bet that when our microchips include billions of tiny lasers in them, a whole new kind of computing will become possible. "This is a single device that provides bistability for both electrical and optical functions with one switch," says Feng. "It is totally new, and we are working hard to find more new applications for the device." The findings are reported in the Journal of Applied Physics.

It will compete alongside the likes of Amazon's Alexa service, Google Home, and a possible Apple device using Siri. During today's Build 2017 Day One keynote it was revealed that Harman Kardon would not be the only company partnering with Microsoft to build a device to host the companies Cortana digital assistant. Under a new agreement, HP will also partner with Microsoft to build devices for accessing Cortana and then Intel, a partner with Microsoft to build Windows on Arm devices that are due later this year, will also build reference platforms that can be used to build Cortana-enabled devices. Since the Cortana Skills Kit was also announced today as being available in Public Preview (U.S. only for now), developers can already begin building skills that can not only be used with these upcoming devices from HP, Harman Kardon, and any other OEM who chooses to use the Intel reference platforms but they can also be accessed by every instance of Cortana across Windows 10, Android and iOS devices. So just counting the Windows 10 devices alone - that is over 500 million monthly active devices and that is a very good size audience to target with your Cortana Skills and other Windows Store apps. ---------- But, wait...there's probably more so be sure to follow me on Twitter and Google+.

Nvidia's rendering of the new silicon 10 May 2017 at 23:49, Katyanna Quach GTC Today at Nvidia’s GPU Technology Conference in San Jose, California, CEO Jensen Huang paraded a bunch of forthcoming gear – all aimed at expanding the graphics chip giant’s reach in AI. Or in other words, stealing a march on Intel's machine learning efforts: the x86 goliath is desperately bent on stopping Nvidia and others from expelling it from the artificial intelligence processing space. Huang announced the Tesla Volta V100, a new GPU that tries to marry machine learning with high performance computing. It is equipped with 5,120 CUDA cores, 640 Tensor Cores, delivers 120 teraflops using INT8 – that's 7.5 TFLOPS using 64-bit FP and 15 TFLOPS using 32-bit FP – and stocks a 16GB HBM2 memory bank with a bandwidth of 900GB per second. The V100 GPU is “at the limits of photolithography,” we're told, packing together 21.1 billion transistors on 815mm2 of silicon. The chip is manufactured by TSMC using its 12nm FinFET process. The Tesla V100 is a jump from Nvidia’s Pascal P100 GPU unveiled last year in terms of size and performance. Increasing computational power is needed as the demand to build bigger and more complex neural networks rises. The chip isn't out yet: it's due to arrive later this year. You can find more analysis on the V100 and its Volta architecture, here, on our high-performance computing sister website, The Next Platform. Nvidia’s deep learning computer, the DGX-1, has been updated to support the new Tesla V100 GPUs, and each box will cost a whopping $149,000 with the latest silicon when it becomes available. If that's a little much for your wallet, Nvidia is teasing a new GPU Cloud service that will enter public beta in the third quarter of this year. Part of this is a software stack that runs on PCs, workstations and servers, and assigns workloads to local GPUs, connected DGX-1 boxes, and processors hosted in Nvidia's forthcoming cloud, as needed. It supports Caffe, Caffe2, CNTK, MXNet, TensorFlow, Theano and Torch frameworks, Plus Nv's Digits, Deep Learning SDK, CUDA, and so on. This service is expected to rival GPU-in-the-cloud offerings from Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, and Google's compute cloud. Meanwhile, the GPU giant is taking a greater interest in robotics with Isaac, a simulator platform, which is hoped to make it easier for developers to design and build robots using Nv's GPU technology. Isaac is a virtual droid trained using reinforcement learning in an environment rendered by video game graphics technologies and integrated with OpenAI’s Universe. The idea is that several Isaacs can be trained at the same time, and the best agent can be chosen before it’s deployed for real-world testing. Nvidia also announced updates for its biggest project: self-driving cars. Toyota, Japan’s largest automotive manufacturer, is collaborating with Nvidia to develop its Drive PX software platform for its driverless cars. Drive PX comes with a LIDAR sensor that allows cars to process their surroundings in real time and plan and execute preventive actions such as stopping the driver from accelerating at a green light. The strangest project announced was Holodeck, a virtual reality environment that is, it is claimed, photo realistic and represents users as floating robot torsos. It uses a physics engine, and creators can import their virtual products into Holodeck to explore design options. In a demonstration, people could see into the interior of a virtual car. It's like the 1990s never ended. ® Tips and corrections 3 Comments MORE Nvidia Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Nvidia says Google's TPU benchmark compared wrong kit You're faster than the Kepler, but what about the newer and better Pascal? 8 Comments Nvidia's profits so far this year are GPU-ge The anti-AMD racks up 48 per cent revenue jump 5 Comments Google rents out Nvidia Tesla GPUs in its cloud.

Sens. John McCainJohn McCainTrump nominates former ambassador to head USAID Comey’s sudden ouster has Republicans divided GOP primary opponent knocks Flake for criticizing Comey firing MORE (Ariz.) and Ben Sasse (Neb.) told Lighthizer in a letter released Wednesday that they’d vote against him because “your confirmation process has failed to reassure us that you understand the North American Free Trade Agreement’s (NAFTA) positive economic benefits to our respective States and the nation as a whole.” “We fear that you do not have an appreciation for the millions of jobs created by this free trade deal, and that you would not champion agriculture during your time as USTR,” wrote McCain and Sasse. McCain and Sasse’s announcement comes a day before the Senate will take a procedural vote on Lighthizer’s nomination. Both President Trump and Lighthizer are staunch critics of NAFTA, and Trump reportedly considered pulling the U.S. out of the deal with Canada and Mexico. The senators said they wouldn't consider supporting Lighthizer until the administration releases details plans and timelines on how they'd approach renegotiating NAFTA and other trade agreements. “Beyond your vocal advocacy for protectionist shifts in our trade policies, the Administration’s ongoing, incoherent, and inconsistent trade message has compounded our concern,” wrote McCain and Sasse. Trump pledged to reopen NAFTA for changes, and Lighhizer’s confirmation as the administration’s chief trade negotiator is critical for that process. McCain and Sasse both sides Trump’s plans to renegotiate NAFTA in their opposition. “Granting the Trump Administration additional legal powers through your confirmation without understanding how you or the Administration intend to use those powers would be irresponsible.” Lighthizer is likely to be confirmed with enough bipartisan support to compensate for McCain and Sasse’s opposition. A confirmation vote could come as early as Friday. Tags John McCain   View the discussion thread. Most Popular Most Popular Discussed Past: 1 day 1 Reporter arrested after repeatedly...

Stacked Deck: This cutaway view of an Enovix 3D Silicon lithium-ion rechargeable battery prototype has three stacked 1-millimeter-thick cells. Hardly a month passes without shocking news of lithium-ion batteries catching fire: Laptops are torched, airlines are grounded, hoverboards go up in flames. The recent fires inside Samsung’s smartphone, the Galaxy Note 7, led to a $US 5 billion recall and then to a discontinuation of the model, moves that together cut Samsung’s market capitalization by many billions. In January, after months of speculation, Samsung announced that two separate design problems created the battery malfunctions that caused some of the devices to overheat. That different design flaws can produce the same catastrophic outcome underlines the inherently unstable nature of today’s Li-ion batteries. Any mobile product incorporating them is thus potentially unsafe. That danger is a result of design and production decisions made a quarter century ago when this type of battery was initially commercialized. Those decisions made sense at the time, but today we can do much better, above all by taking advantage of fabrication techniques honed by the chipmaking industry. Our company, Enovix Corp., in Fremont, Calif., has done just that, and we have demonstrated that we can produce Li-ion batteries that are smaller, less expensive, and fundamentally safer than anything now on the market. Two key challenges faced Sony Corp. when it decided to commercialize the Li-ion battery back in 1991. Its handheld camcorder—a harbinger of many power-hungry portable devices to come—needed a very high capacity battery in a compact package. And audio cassettes were quickly giving way to compact discs. The latter is relevant because magnetic recording tape for audio cassettes was made on manufacturing lines that coated a plastic film with a magnetic slurry, dried it, cut it into long strips, and rolled them up. Because the compact disc used a very different production process, Sony suddenly found itself with a surplus of equipment for manufacturing magnetic recording tape and of technicians to run these machines. Managers in Sony’s battery division realized they could solve the problem at a stroke by employing the same manufacturing equipment and personnel to coat chemical slurries onto metal foil, dry it, and cut it into electrode sheets. Then, to form the core of the battery, two sheets were interlayered with a polymer separator, which allows ions, but not electrons, to flow between the electrodes, and the whole stack is wound together like a jelly roll. This same production model—built around coated metal-foil current collectors—has been used by Li-ion battery manufacturers ever since. This design was clever, but it made it harder to improve these batteries over the long term. For one thing, it wastes space. Illustration: Jean-Luc Fortier Rolled Up: This internal cross-section view of a conventional Li-ion battery shows anode and cathode sheets wound with polymer separator sheets, flattened, and packaged in a metal case. Within the assembled battery, the only materials that store energy are the particles that make up the anode (negative electrode) and cathode (positive electrode). The metal-foil current collectors, separators, and packaging materials, as well as empty space, typically comprise at least 40 percent of total volume. Having so much space devoted to something other than storing energy lowers the battery’s energy density, a quantity typically measured in watt-hours per liter (Wh/L). For example, conventional Li-ion cell construction for mobile devices usually involves winding the electrode sheets and separator together and then flattening the resulting spiral to fit into a slim metal case or plastic pouch. This process requires a certain length of blank—that is, uncoated—current collector and separator at the beginning and end, which takes up volume but doesn’t store energy. Empty space may also be left in the center of the cell and along the two sides of the cell, where it is rounded due to the wound construction. The polymer separator is an inactive material and has to be physically longer and wider than the electrodes to make sure that the electrode edges do not touch each other. One way to increase the energy density is by slimming down the separator. If it gets too thin, however, the battery becomes prone to shorting out. Another problem is the presence of microscopic metal particles—introduced unavoidably during assembly—which can accumulate on an electrically active spot, creating a major short circuit that shunts enough current between the electrodes to sharply raise the temperature. That heat, in turn, may affect neighboring areas, setting off what’s known as thermal runaway, which can produce an explosion and fire. It’s practically impossible to eliminate metal particles, because they are generated by the cutting, rolling and winding machinery during the production and assembly processes. Additional problems can occur during charging, when lithium ions flow from the lithium metal oxide cathode to the graphite anode (the standard anode material in virtually every Li-ion battery used in mobile devices). Normally, the lithium ions fit into the gaps in the crystal lattice structure of the graphite—a process known as intercalation. But a high charge current, a local lack of active anode material, or a low ambient temperature can cause lithium ions to instead plate on the surface of the anode. Lithium metal may then accumulate as threadlike structures known as dendrites, which grow as the cell is charged and discharged, eventually puncturing the separator and creating a short, which can lead to thermal runaway. Finally, conventional Li-ion batteries can become unstable if they get too warm, which also can lead to thermal runaway. Thermal Runaway in a Lithium-Ion Battery llustration: Erik Vrielink Thermal Runaway: The construction of a conventional Li-ion cell, adapted from magnetic-audio-recording tape production techniques, makes it susceptible to thermal runaway, which can result in catastrophic damage from explosions or fires. These problems were offset by the great edge in energy density Li-ion has over nickel cadmium—the previous standard for rechargeable batteries in consumer electronics. But since the Li-ion battery was introduced, its energy density has improved at only about 5 percent a year. That’s because of production constraints and the slow pace of development of new materials for the electrodes and electrolyte. Meanwhile, the power demands of mobile devices—particularly smartphones, tablets, and wearables—are increasing at many times that rate. Fortunately, another set of techniques, ones borrowed from the semiconductor industry, can do much better. Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), fabricated in three dimensions with photolithography, provided the model for the research that one of us (Lahiri) and two other cofounders of our company began in 2007. We already had experience in developing such MEMS designs—initially for use in high-density disk-drive read-write heads, then for testing semiconductor wafers. That collaboration resulted in the founding of Enovix Corp. (originally called microAzure Corp.) and the initial funding of the company by several Silicon Valley venture capital firms. The company’s first goal was to conduct proof-of-concept research on a lithium-ion rechargeable battery that used silicon in place of the usual graphite for the anode. By 2012, the company was producing cells that had a much higher energy density than conventional Li-ion cells of comparable size. Enovix then began to develop a low-cost high-volume production system, with the help of strategic investors Cypress Semiconductor, Intel Capital, and Qualcomm Ventures. Cypress Semiconductor had previously helped its SunPower subsidiary produce high-performance solar cells at a much lower cost and at a higher volume than could be done by other companies with their complex, multistep processes. Since 2014, Enovix has been developing and refining methods to construct its battery, based on SunPower’s production techniques. We expect to begin scaling up production for commercialization later this year. The Enovix battery uses a three-dimensional cell architecture in which the electrodes are etched into a silicon wafer and the plated metal current collectors that are much thinner than the foil used in conventional cells. By interlacing a cathode, an anode and a separator on the 1-millimeter-thick wafer, it significantly reduces wasted space. In our battery, a full 75 percent of the volume is dedicated to storing energy. This alone increases capacity by about 25 percent over conventional cells. Similarly, the weight goes down proportionally for a battery of a given capacity, although typically volume is the more critical constraint in mobile devices. Illustration: Jean-Luc Fortier Densely Packed: The 3D cell architecture orients and interlaces a cathode, 100 percent silicon anode, and ceramic separator in a thin (1 millimeter) flat plane, which significantly improves energy density and safety. Our flat-cell architecture can take full advantage of a number of advances in electrode chemistry. To understand why that’s so, you need to know a little more about how a conventional Li-ion battery works, in particular about how the graphite anode absorbs lithium ions when the battery is charging and emits them back into the electrolyte when the battery is discharging. At the anode, one atom of lithium combines with six atoms of carbon in the graphite to form LiC6. This gives graphite a theoretical specific capacity of about 372 milliampere-hours per gram. Because the ratio of lithium to carbon atoms is 1:6, only modest swelling occurs. Instead of graphite, we use silicon for the anode material. Silicon is attractive because it forms a Li22Si5 alloy. That very high ratio of lithium-to-silicon bonding allows silicon to store about 4,200 mAh/g, an extraordinary amount. But silicon’s increased absorption of lithium ions can cause it to swell by up to 400 percent. Of course, any design that exploits the increased capacity of a silicon anode would have to match it on the other end by adding to the thickness of the cathode or using a better material. Commonly used cathodes such as lithium cobalt oxide (LCO), lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC), and lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (NCA) have usable capacities of 140 mAh/g, 170 mAh/g, and 185 mAh/g, respectively. Right now, we are using an NCA cathode, sized to match the capacity of the silicon anode. However, we can use any of the conventional Li-ion cathode materials, and that flexibility should allow us to meet the requirements of specific applications. Although it’s possible to add silicon to the anodes of conventionally produced batteries, you can’t add too much. That’s because as silicon absorbs lithium and expands, it eventually pulls the anode apart from the metal-foil current collector. This explains why commercial Li-ion batteries have so far been limited to about a 5 to 10 percent silicon-to-graphite blend. Enovix gets around this problem by making its silicon porous so that expansion pushes its tiny internal cavities together rather than swelling the entire anode. This feature maintains the structural integrity of the connection between the anode and its current collector during repeated charge-discharge cycles. This ability to control anode expansion is one of the key advantages of our system over the conventional Li-ion battery architecture that Sony pioneered. Depending on size and thickness, our cells pack into a given volume from 1.5 to 3 times as much energy as conventional Li-ion cells do. Because our battery architecture makes it possible to exploit a wider variety of electrode materials, we expect to take advantage of ongoing research in materials, which so far has improved the performance of conventional batteries by roughly 5 percent per year. But because we can also exploit future efficiency gains within our structural design, we expect the energy density of our batteries to improve two to three times as fast as that of conventional batteries. The other great advantage of our design is improved safety. How do we achieve that? For one thing, we use a better separator. In a conventional Li-ion cell, the separator is typically made of a plastic or polymer material because it must be flexible enough to roll up. As a result, conventional separators are more likely to fail under high temperatures. Our flat design can accommodate a ceramic separator, which is far more tolerant of heat. Also, our silicon anode’s ample capacity to absorb lithium without swelling makes it much less susceptible to lithium plating, even with a high charge current. Should an electrical short occur anyway, our use of many distributed electrodes—as opposed to long sheets—will limit the current that can flow between any individual anode/cathode pair, which greatly reduces the risk of thermal runaway. Photo: Enovix Corporation Fab production: Standard solar-cell fabrication equipment produces 3D silicon wafers at the Enovix pilot-production facility in Fremont, Calif. Our cathode design is safer, too. Typically, when cathode material hits a critical temperature (as can happen near a short), it spontaneously breaks down, releasing oxygen that can fuel a fire. This breakdown can proceed from cathode particle to cathode particle as the next particle hits the critical temperature, fueling a thermal runaway. Our architecture breaks the cathode up into hundreds or thousands of tiny segments separated by silicon, which conducts heat nearly as well as aluminum, making it hard for a runaway reaction to get started. By contrast, a conventional wound battery’s cathode is one long sheet, allowing runaway reactions to quickly spread through the device. All these features, taken together, essentially eliminate the danger of explosion and fire. We recently compared our prototype cell for a wearable device with a comparable commercial Li-ion cell by deliberately creating a precarious scenario. We overcharged a conventional 130-mAh Li-ion cell and our 100-mAh silicon Li-ion cell to 250 percent of capacity and simultaneously punctured the package of each (through the standard nail-penetration test). The conventional Li-ion cell burst into flames, but our silicon Li-ion cell did not. To fabricate the Enovix battery, we begin with a wafer of silicon that’s 1 millimeter thick. This doesn’t have to be the chip-grade stuff—it can be the same low-cost material that is used to produce solar cells. To the wafer we apply a photolithographic mask and etch the required pattern with typical silicon etchants borrowed from the solar industry. Because the pattern can vary in shape­—square, rectangular, round, oval, hexagonal—as well as in length and width, we have the ability to form a wide variety of cell designs. The silicon that’s left behind where the mask was placed forms the anodes and “backbones” of the interlaced cell structure. Next, we selectively deposit a thin coat of metal film onto the anodes and backbones to form current collectors and then deposit a ceramic separator around the collector on the anodes. Because the anodes and backbones are not electrically connected on the wafer, we can selectively electroplate different coatings on each. To create the cathodes, we inject a conventional cathode slurry, filling the remaining voids in the wafer. Then a laser slices off individual 1-mm thick die from the wafer, with the lateral dimensions of the die approximating the dimensions of the final battery. Positive and negative tabs are then attached to each die, which are baked to remove moisture, and stacked to form the desired height of the battery. The tabs are all connected to form a single positive and negative tab for the cell, and the resulting stacked cell is then pouched or inserted into a metal can, which is filled with electrolyte, sealed and tested. Our architecture, silicon wafer photolithography, and etching process are comparable to what is used in three-dimensional MEMS. Hence we dubbed our device the 3D Silicon Lithium-ion battery. We compared a prototype with a conventional Li-ion battery having the same form factor, one designed to fit in a smart watch (that battery was 18 by 27 by 4 mm). Our internal tests showed our battery to have much higher capacity and a corresponding increase in energy density—695 Wh/L as opposed to about 460 for the conventional cell. Much of this manufacturing technology comes, of course, from the solar cell business. The progress in that field—fueled by immense R&D investment worldwide—at once explains the low cost of our manufacturing approach and the likelihood that it will continue to improve in efficiency and scale. Consumers yearn for better and more powerful batteries for their mobile devices, as survey after survey attests. Most demanding of all are the wearable devices and microsensors that are being created for the Internet of Things. Such IoT devices have even less room in them for batteries than do tablets and smartphones. This wouldn’t be the first time that photolithography and wafer production have suddenly revamped whole industries. It happened first when computers began to use integrated circuits. These fabrication techniques were also applied to lighting, which moved from fluorescent tubes to light-emitting diodes and to video displays, which went from cathode ray tubes to liquid crystal displays. We believe that the approach we’re pioneering will bring about a similar transformation in the market for lithium-ion batteries. The change will first appear in wearables, next in IoT and phones, and ultimately in electric vehicles and grid storage, as volumes scale up and manufacturing costs come down, as it already has in the solar industry. With safer, thinner, and higher-energy batteries, designers will have more flexibility to create breakthrough products. Expect mobile devices to get smaller, to last longer between charges, and to continue to deliver amazing new capabilities to enhance our lives.

Previews to superiors of congressional testimony are generally considered a courtesy. “It gave the impression that he was no longer capable of carrying out his duties,” one official said of Comey. Comey testified last week that he stands by his controversial decision to announce last October that the FBI was reopening its investigation into Clinton. “I sat there that morning and I could not see a door labeled 'no action here,'” he said. “I saw two doors. One was labeled ‘speak’ and one was labeled 'conceal.' It makes me mildly nauseous to think we had an impact on the election."  Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, has repeatedly said Comey bears some responsibility for her loss to Trump in November. The White House announced Tuesday that Trump fired Comey on the recommendation of Sessions and Rosenstein. Trump’s decision stunned Washington, with many questioning the timing of the dismissal. Comey announced in March that the FBI is probing Russia’s interference in the 2016 race, including possible ties between Trump’s campaign and Moscow.

The disagreement points to inconsistencies in Flynn’s accounts to the U.S. government about his work for foreign interests. Flynn’s company, Flynn Intel Group, told the Justice Department in March that the two $40,000 payments were consulting fees for unspecified work. But Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin said the payments from Flynn’s firm were refunds for unperformed lobbying. Latest news videos The difference matters because Flynn’s foreign business relationships and the veracity of his disclosures are under scrutiny by congressional, military and intelligence inquiries. Congressional committees and the Pentagon’s inspector general are separately examining whether Flynn was fully forthcoming about his foreign contacts and earnings from organizations linked to the governments of Russia and Turkey. His firm’s Turkish work occurred while he was a top Trump campaign adviser. On Monday, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates told senators that Flynn’s misstatements about his contacts with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. raised concerns that he could be targeted for blackmail. Yates also cited the possibility that Flynn could have broken federal law by operating as a paid foreign agent for the Turkish client without U.S. government permission. The retired Army lieutenant general and former chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency formally told the Justice Department in March that his now-defunct Flynn Intel Group was paid $530,000 for operating as a foreign agent for Alptekin’s firm, Inovo BV, and performing work that could have benefited the Turkish government. That filing — prompted by Justice Department pressure — came just weeks after Trump fired Flynn from his national security post. The president has said he made the decision after it became clear Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. Stephen Braun and Chad Day are Associated Press writers.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement HP’s new Elite x2 2-in-1 tablet has faster CPU, higher-res display, and business-class features 05/10/2017 at 6:00 AM by Brad Linder 3 Comments HP is updating its Elite x2 line of Windows tablets for business users, with a new model that has the same screen resolution as a Microsoft Surface Pro 4, support for Core i Kaby Lake-U processor options, up to 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of solid state storage. The HP Elite x2 1012 G2 is a 2-in-1 tablet with a 12.3 inch display, a built-in kickstand, and a detachable keyboard. Prices start at $1099, and the tablet should be available starting in July. The new model looks a lot like its predecessor, but it has a higher-resolution, 2736 x 1824 pixel display, optional Intel vPro support, and USB 3.1 Type-C and USB 3.0 Type-A ports. HP says the notebook supports up to 10 hours of battery life from its 47 Wh battery, and features fast charging technology that should let you get a 50 percent charge from about 30 minutes of charge time. The tablet measures about 8.05mm thick and weighs 1.75 pounds, and comes with an HP Collaboration Keyboard with 1.5mm of key travel, backlit keys, and dedicated buttons for Skype calls, among other things. The tablet and keyboard together have a combined weight of 2.6 pounds. It has a Wacom digitizer and pen and there’s a loop in the keyboard for storing the pen when it’s not in use (that pen holder was optional on earlier models, but it’s on all models for the new version). There’s a fingerprint sensor on the back of the tablet, a Windows Hello-compatible IR camera on the front. And HP says the speakers on the new model are front-facing, compared with the side speakers on the G1 version. While the Elite x2 is available for anyone to purchase, it’s designed for business and it’s been MIL-SPEC tested, features an aluminum unibody case and Gorilla Glass 4 display, and HP has tested the tablet to ensure the kickstand, keyboard, and other components should last for multiple years of use. One thing the HP Elite x2 1012 G2 doesn’t have? A fanless design. The company says that if you’re looking for a model that uses passive cooling, you should opt for the recently-announced HP Pro x2 612 G2, which is a similar size, shape, and price… but which has a lower-power Intel Kaby Lake-Y (Core M) processor.

And please don't worry, your report will be anonymous. Wow… a serviceable battery that is attached with screws other than glue. What a novel concept! I wonder if the screen is also attached with screws rather than glue. There’s two small holes in the bottom left. I don’t know if those are screw holes or a lanyard loop. It’s really nice to see an OEM considering repairability when they design a tablet. I really like the Surface line, but the heinous repairability has kept me from getting one. I have a bad habit of forgetting that I left a device in the car, and the heat from the sun damages the battery. I’ve sun-baked more than a few batteries to death, so I wouldn’t buy a device unless the battery can be replaced. Microsoft’s cost for a replacing a battery is ridiculous and they have no one but their selves to blame for engineering a device that is so… Read more » Vote Up0Vote Down  Reply 15 hours 19 minutes ago Guest Michaeld Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

When I go to upgrade my HP Spectre x2 12, I’ll be looking at the 612(I’d like to see more reviews of this model and its accessories). I like how the back pops off. Nice and clean. The lineup of competition is heating up against the Surface Pro. Asus, Lenovo, Dell, Acer, HP….all have pretty nice units available. The Acer liquid cooling loop(fanless) design is quite cool. Pun intended. Although…I won’t be upgrading my Spectre anytime soon. Absolutely in love with this device. First time in a long time that I’ve purchased something from HP and felt I got my money’s worth. In fact, I feel like I robbed them for a change. Smile.

People use Windows 10 on more than 500 million devices every month. With its Cortana Skills Kit, Microsoft is making it possible for outside developers to bring their services to Windows 10 as well as the company's Skype for Business app and Bing search engine. Microsoft also unveiled new tools to help people more easily incorporate artificial intelligence into their applications. Jordan Novet | @jordannovet 10 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Amit Madheshiya | Bloomberg | Getty Images Satya Nadella, chief executive officer of Microsoft Microsoft's Cortana isn't the trendiest voice-activated personal assistant — that title goes to Amazon's Alexa — and its Azure public cloud plays second fiddle to Amazon Web Services. On Tuesday at the company's annual Build conference in Seattle, Microsoft executives spent hours showing how they plan to change that. CEO Satya Nadella also pointed out one edge that Microsoft still has over Amazon: its massive reach in enterprises. People who use Windows machines and Cortana are "the most valuable set of users in the core of the enterprise," Nadella said. People are using Windows 10 on more than 500 million devices every month, while Cortana now has 140 million monthly active users. With the introduction of its Cortana Skills Kit, Microsoft is making it possible for outside developers to bring their services to Windows 10 as well as the company's Skype for Business video conferencing app and Bing search engine. In doing so, Microsoft is trying to make it more worthwhile for developers to build for Cortana, and open up its services for more third-party features. Also, longtime Microsoft partners HP and Intel will be working to build Cortana-enabled devices. show chapters Microsoft unveils new products, Surface laptop    Tuesday, 2 May 2017 | 11:31 AM ET | 03:15 Microsoft also unveiled new tools to help people more easily incorporate artificial intelligence into their applications. This is an area where Amazon has been busy lately — last week it announced plans for a U.K. development center that will house A.I. researchers — but Microsoft has long performed academic research. Nadella also used the opportunity to make some philosophical statements about AI, saying it's up to Microsoft "to ensure that some of the more dystopian scenarios don't come true." If anything, he said, the company should "empower people with technology." Toward that end, Harry Shum, the company's executive vice president for A.I. and research, showed off a new add-in for the PowerPoint presentation app that will give audience members real-time translations of presenters' spoken comments through smartphones. When it comes to the cloud, Nadella and other executives are less bold and more interested in meeting current market demands — which means matching Amazon when it comes to available features. That's important because an increasing number of companies are choosing which big public cloud they should use when they want to build new applications and more efficiently run existing ones. For instance, Microsoft introduced services for migrating Oracle databases to its Azure cloud and launched Android and iOS apps for managing cloud resources. AWS already provides all of those things.

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — The US Senate Homeland Security Committee may launch another probe into President Donald Trump’s alleged ties to Russia after the controversial firing of former FBI Director James Comey, committee chairman Ron Johnson said in a statement on Wednesday. “I don’t like doing duplication of effort, I think the Intel Panel was the best place to begin this investigation, but we may have to go beyond that,” Johnson stated. Earlier on Wednesday, the White House said US Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein would likely replace Comey to lead the Trump-Russia probe. In addition, the White House does not believe a special prosecutor is needed to assist the investigation. © AFP 2017/ PAUL J. RICHARDS White House Encourages US Justice Dept. to Complete Russia-Trump Probe - SpokespersonCongressional Democrats have criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ role in Comey’s termination, citing his decision to recuse himself from having any part in the ongoing investigation. Tuesday’s termination of Comey comes during an investigation by the House of Representatives into Russia's alleged meddling in US elections and a Senate probe of allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia. Russia has repeatedly refuted the US allegations of meddling, characteriigin them as absurd, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying Moscow did not have official contacts with the Trump's team during the presidential campaign. ...

Roston - May 10, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Editors' Rating: 8/10 Pros Slim and attractive Thunderbolt / USB-C Thin bezels Traditional keyboard layout JBL stereo speakers Cons Fan whirred frequently Lack of ports Lenovo has updated its Yoga 700 product line with a new model, the Lenovo Yoga 720. This model is best described as sleek, silver and slim, if you’ll forgive the alliteration, and it comes with a sub-$1,000 price. There’s a lot to like about this laptop, and you can spot some of them upon first glance — the ultra-slim bezels are a great start, as is the ultra-flexible hinge. Is the latest Yoga model worth the upgrade, though? Read our full review to find out! Hardware & Design If you’ve ever used a Yoga laptop, you’ll have an idea of what to expect: namely a very flexible hinge that enables the display to rotate back to various degrees including into a tablet mode. This facilitates a handful of possible arrangements, including placing the keyboard down and the display up for unfettered access to the touchscreen. The display itself is shrouded with very slim bezels and coated with a glossy surface. Turning attention from the display to the keyboard, users will find a comfortable and attractive design that is easy to type on. The keyboard layout is fairly traditional and I didn’t have any issues using it — no adjustment period necessary. The keys also have a nice amount of resistance without unnecessarily loud clicking or clacking. The surrounding surface is metallic and clean with a very slightly abrasive texture; this leads to polished metal edges cut at a slight angle, as well as polished chrome edges surrounding the smooth trackpad. It would be fair to describe the Yoga 720’s design as both premium and minimalist, the combination of which is very aesthetically pleasing. The laptop’s left edge features two slim USB-C ports and an audio jack; the right edge has a USB-A port and the power button. The underside, meanwhile, contains two speaker grilles and four rubber feet. The design ultimately complements the display, which is the Yoga 720’s true attention-grabber. The high level of gloss can make it difficult to see the screen if you have it angled upward in a bright room, but that issue aside I found it very pleasing. Colors are well-saturated — but not excessively so — and the brightness can be set very high. TECH SPECS Processor: Up to 7th Gen Intel® Core™ i7 Operating System: Windows 10 Home Display: 13.3″ FHD (1920 x 1080) Graphics: Up to Intel® HD Graphics 620 Camera: HD 720p Memory: Up to 16 GB DDR4 Storage: Up to 512 GB PCIe SSD Battery: Up to 8 hours with FHD display Audio: – 2 x JBL speakers – Dolby® Audio Premium Security: Fingerprint reader Ports: – 2 x USB Type-C with Thunderbolt – USB 3.0 – Audio jack Connectivity: – 802.11 a/c WiFi – Bluetooth® 4.1 Dimensions: 12.2 x 8.4 x 0.6″ Weight: 2.9 lbs Colors: Platinum Silver Software & Performance The Yoga 720’s performance was great during general usage — Internet browsing, streaming, mild photo editing, downloading and uploading, etc. The laptop is available in multiple configurations and your own experience will depend on the hardware your particular laptop possesses. Our particular review unit features an Intel Core i5 processor, though buyers can choose up to a Core i7. As far as battery goes, the laptop managed to get me through a full workday, but not much beyond it. Lenovo says you can expect up to 8 hours on a charge, and that proved true. Software, meanwhile, includes some Lenovo applications like Companion and App Explorer. There are also some preinstalled things like Candy Crush and March of Empires, but overall it isn’t too bad. The Yoga 720 runs Windows 10. What we like There’s a lot to like about the Yoga 720 and pinpointing any particular feature as best is difficult. The overall design is quite attractive; the keyboard is comfortable and quiet; the touchscreen is very sensitive and accurate; the audio quality is good as far as laptops are concerned; the inclusion of a fingerprint sensor helps make a good laptop great. Two USB-C ports help eliminate some of the adapter-centric issues, in that users can charge and use one other device at the same time without an adapter. This does lead into a potential issue, though, which is covered in the next section. Issues Overall, I really enjoyed using the Yoga 720. The only thing I didn’t like was the fan which activated shortly after turning the laptop on despite not yet opening any applications. Though it may not be noticeable in a regular work office, it was loud in the quiet library and would likely also be heard by others in a classroom setting. The only other potential issue for some users is the relative lack of ports. This reality is no doubt due to the inclusion of USB-C, which is capable of handling many tasks. As with certain MacBook users, though, anyone who frequently uses dongles and peripherals will have to carry around an adapter to utilize certain connector types like HDMI. Wrap-up The Lenovo Yoga 720 is a sleek laptop with a premium feel and an attractive design, and that’s just the start of things to like about it. Features like a fingerprint sensor, touchscreen, and a 360-degree hinge help set the latest Yoga model apart. Whether this laptop will ultimately suit your own needs is for you to determine, but anyone in need of an ultrabook would be well advised to give this model a chance. Price starts at $780 USD on Lenovo’s website.

(ALGN) Stock Braces for More Upside View All Posts Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is aggressively climbing higher on Wednesday, continuing to push the ceiling higher as it trades at new peaks. The run in NVDA stock is being prompted by an excellent first-quarter report that somehow stunned a Wall Street crowd that knows exactly how well-oiled this graphics hardware maker is. Source: Shutterstock Yes, Nvidia shares trade at a current price-to-earnings ratio around 50. For a stock with a market cap north of $70 billion, that is a high bar for continued growth. And yes, as NVDA stock continues its huge climb — up 233% in the past 12 months — there have been as many detractors as fans. Other big chip companies like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) sport lower P/Es at the moment. They’re considered commodity plays in a low-margin business, and their key to success is finding the next market to sell a lot of chips into. But Nvidia has taken a different approach. The Nvidia Way NVDA sells high-end graphics chipsets and processing units. And it doesn’t bother competing on the low end with the big chip makers. It has carved out a niche and then expanded as that niche has become one of the most dynamic industry sectors in all tech — visual computing. Basically, that means instead of looking at a bunch of numbers, you can see a visual image of what the numbers mean. That is the evolution computing is going through in major sectors like big data, cloud storage and biotechnology. NVDA also timed the automation for next-generation cars perfectly. Most of the major car companies are starting to incorporate much more of a graphical interface in their cabins. Some car cockpits are starting to look more like the cockpits of fighter aircraft than cars. But this is all part of the massive movement into the Internet of Things (IoT) that is sweeping through every industry that puts computer chips in its products. Market research firm Research Nester estimates that by 2023 the global IoT market will be close to a $700 billion industry. Nvidia is in the center of that market. And all this doesn’t even include virtual reality and augmented reality systems that are coming to market.

It is with those users in mind that BIOSTAR has now expanded their lineup of specialized cryptocurrency mining motherboards to include two new AMD AM4 models. Referred to as the TA320-BTC and TB350-BTC, these are the first AM4-based crypto mining motherboards announced, and as such make BIOSTAR the only manufacturer to offer mining motherboards for both mainstream platforms. This following the recent launch of Biostar's Intel LGA1151-based TB250-BTC model. Gallery: BIOSTAR TB350-BTC As you might have surmised, the TA320-BTC is based on the lower-end AMD A320 chipset, while the TB350-BTC is based on the mid-range AMD B350 chipset. After carefully scrutinizing the specifications list of both models, the only difference that we could find – chipset aside – is that the A320-based model is limited to memory speeds of DDR4-2666, while the B350 model supports up to DDR4-3200. These models only have two DDR4 memory slots each, so they are limited to 32GB of system memory. Both motherboards support AMD's latest Ryzen processors (up to 95W TDP) and the upcoming 7th Generation A-Series APUs, which should be no problem for the 7-phase power design. Given their specialized purpose, these motherboards only have four SATA 6Gb/s ports and no M.2 slots. USB connectivity is quite decent with six USB 3.1 Gen1 ports (four rear, one header) and six USB 2.0 ports (four rear, one header). Two of the USB 2.0 ports are high amperage capable, so they can handle water pumps and/or fans that require up to 1.5 amps. Networking duties are handled by one gigabit LAN port that is powered by a Realtek RTL8111H controller. In terms of rear I/O connectivity, aside from the aforementioned ports, there are two legacy PS/2 connectors, a single DVI-D video output, and three audio jacks courtesy of a low-end Realtek ALC887 codec. The key selling point of these two models is obviously their six PCIe slots. They each have one PCIe 3.0 x16 slot, two PCIe 3.0 x1 slots, and three PCIe 2.0 x1 slots. The PCIe x16 slot will operate at x8 if an APU is installed, due to AM4 APU limitations. Now you may be asking how PCIe x1 slots are useful when it comes to handling multiple graphics cards, and the answer is that miners use PCIe 1x to x16 riser cards with flexible extender cables (not included) and special cases that hold the graphics cards well above the motherboard. Crucially, there are also two 4-pin Molex power connectors intended to bolster power delivery to the PCIe slots, and they must be used when mining due to the increased power demands. While full-size ATX motherboards generally measure 305mm × 244mm, these two models are both slightly shorter and narrower than the ATX standard at 295mm x 210mm. That may cause issues with certain cases, but BIOSTAR is likely betting on the fact that those who purchase these motherboards will be installing them on purpose-built open test benches. We have no information with regard to pricing or availability, but both models will have a 3-year warranty in applicable regions. We expect the pricing to be quite low, given the margins that miners typically work with. Mining aside, any non-PCIe bandwidth limited task for compute, using OpenCL / CUDA and such could also be used.

POST A COMMENT 12 Comments View All Comments fanofanand - Wednesday, May 10, 2017 - link Do people still try to mine bitcoins? This product seems about 5 years too late. Reply DanNeely - Wednesday, May 10, 2017 - link AFAIK serious GPU mining is limited to various me-too coins that don't have ASIC miners available. (Yet!) Reply JoeyJoJo123 - Wednesday, May 10, 2017 - link Yeah, a dedicated ASIC designs are much more impactful than general purpose GPU or CPU mining. Also, kind of feel that that the whole crypto-currency thing has been a get-rich-quick meme that needs to die off already. Yeah, I understand that there are plenty of people that do make a quick buck on it, but the reality of the situation is that cryto-currency mining is such a saturated field that to get any crypto-currency at profitable rates (to not only pay off the capital or dedicated machine(s) designated to mining, but also the electricity costs incurred with the machine(s) and A/C costs) you need a pretty massive investment to "get rich quick" and you're still subject to the awfully variable values of the crypto-currency day-to-day. Using crypto-currency as a pseudo-stock market is a bit better, because at least you're not dealing with the baggage of mining it yourself (where any crypto-currency worth its salt has such a high complexity for resolving chains that you'd need weeks to get 1 bitcoin, for example, or join a mining team where the bitcoin is shared amongst miners, but always in favor of the organizer of the mining team). But at the end of the day it's still such an absurd fluctuation where for every 1 person that "got rich quick" 5 others probably got real poor, real quick. A sane and rational person wouldn't suggest crypto-currency mining to replace your day-to-day job. Might be OK as a side-hobby if you like doing this sort of stuff, but long gone are the days of "Hey you got a PC with a graphics card? Run this while you're not using your PC to get free money!" Reply npz - Thursday, May 11, 2017 - link You don't understand the fundamentals of crypto-currencies. They are there to support their own blockchain--the distributed ledger to keep the information. The money aspect is only there as an incentive to support their blockchain. There are cyprto-currencies which are work by various proofs other than proof of work, that is you don't need to do large hash computations. Some work just by holding--the longer you hold, the more value your share is. Others work by proof of storage--by sharing storage which provides the fundamental units of the blockchain. The storage portions themselves then is monetized, rather than hash computations. Ethereum works by proof of work, so traditional hash computation on cpu/gpu (no ASICs), but the main purpose is NOT the money. It's to support the decentralized, automated, programmable contracts that can be "set in stone" between two parties in the ether (the ethereum blockchain). Zcash (formerly zerocoin) is a medium of exchange designed to be provably anonymous. The technology itself provides a good compliment to ethereum. You're thinking of value in dollars, and that's the wrong way to think about it. It's value is in what it's traded at, so various other currencies, cryptocurrencies and direct goods. Reply boozed - Wednesday, May 10, 2017 - link Also electricity thieves Reply npz - Thursday, May 11, 2017 - link Sigh. Well, I guess I better ignore the significantly increased utilities bill every month because you're supposed to be paying for me. After all, I am "stealing" from you, right? So how come I still have to pay for the increased amount I use? Reply Ian Cutress - Wednesday, May 10, 2017 - link There's still a few *coins that work on CPUs. I know Patrick at ServeTheHome does some articles on Monero mining with CPUs as one of his burn-in tests for servers. Reply Venya - Wednesday, May 10, 2017 - link Ethereum (ETH) is the currently most profitable crypto-currency which can ONLY be mined using GPUs, because algorithm developed in such way that creating ASIC is not possible (or feasible) Reply Skinandbones - Wednesday, May 10, 2017 - link Z-cash, which was released October 28, 2016, is specifically designed against ASICS chips and favors AMD GPU cards. I don't understand how it all works, but the RX480 GPU was in hot demand by the farming community and has probably switched to the newer RX580. A quick search to get any one who is interested: http://cryptomining-blog.com/8349-claymores-zcash-... Reply npz - Thursday, May 11, 2017 - link Also, Ryzen itself provides an excellent value for crypto computations, so you can definitely make use of the cpu as well. https://www.nicehash.com/?p=news&id=148 Our primary focus was the CryptoNight algorithm since this is the most mature CPU mineable algorithm with optimized CPU mining software. The results are very good. AMD Ryzen 1700X can do 510+ H/s on default stock clocks and as much as 610+ H/s while being over-clocked to very stable 4.0 GHz. This is almost twice the speed of Intel Core i7 7700K. Reply 1 2 ▶ PIPELINE STORIES + Submit News AT20 Giveaway Day 11.5: Corsair Has the Power (And Memory Too!)

Fairly similar to the recently unveiled Pro x2 612 G2 in concept, and virtually identical to its Skylake-based predecessor from a design standpoint, the HP Elite x2 1012 G2 obviously packs seventh-generation Intel Kaby Lake processing power, ranging from Core i3 to i7. The list of performance improvements goes on however, with up to 16GB RAM and 512GB solid state storage in tow, not to mention a larger and sharper 12.3-inch WQXGA+ (2736 x 1824 pixels resolution) touchscreen. The Elite x2’s new display is actually on par with the PixelSense panel on the OG Surface Pro 4, which further proves Panay’s point, but business professionals will be happy to find Windows Hello authentication works with a fingerprint scanner in addition to IR facial recognition here. Comparisons (and convoluted names) notwithstanding, the HP Elite x2 1012 G2 looks decidedly impressive on paper, optional physical keyboard support, Active Pen functionality, USB 3.0, 3.1 Type-C, microSD, SIM card slot, front-firing stereo speakers, headphone jack, Intel HD 620 graphics and all. It even sports respectable 8 and 5MP cameras… for some reason, starting at 1.77 pounds (no accessories included), with a slender 0.36 inches profile. Let’s just hope it won’t be priced much higher than a Surface Pro 4, at least in an entry-level i3 configuration. Advertisement likethis What's your reaction?

The court orders were sent by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Alexandria, Virginia, to businesses that worked on contracts with Flynn after 2014 when he was forced out as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, sources familiar with the investigation told CNN. The subpoenas are connected to FBI and U.S. Justice Department probes of Russian interference in the U.S. election. Subscribe to Newsweek from $1 per week After being forced into retirement Flynn established the Flynn Intel Group Inc. consultancy in 2014 to handle “current and emerging client risks.” In March Flynn registered as a foreign agent revealing that his firm received $530,000 to lobby the U.S. government on behalf of the authoritarian Turkish government during the later months of the American election. Former White House National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's business associates have been subpoenaed in an investigation of his ties to Russia. Jim Bourg/Reuters For months Flynn didn’t report this payment to the U.S. government or another $45,000 he received to speak at a 2015 gala held by RT, a Russian government news network the U.S. Intelligence Community has accused of working to sway the 2016 election. Read more: Trump became enraged by probes into Russian interference before firing Comey, aides say “As a former military officer, you simply cannot take money from Russia, Turkey or anybody else,” said Utah Republican Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House oversight committee, in late April. "I see no data,” Chaffetz added, “to support the notion that General Flynn complied with the law." The Pentagon’s inspector-general has also launched an investigation into the payments. "As has previously been reported, General Flynn briefed the Defense Intelligence Agency, a component agency of DoD, extensively regarding the RT speaking event trip both before and after the trip,” Flynn’s attorney Robert Kelner has said in a statement about the payment. Flynn, who was Trump’s national security adviser for the first 24 days of his presidency, was fired on February 13 after it was revealed he misled Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with Sergey Kislyak, Russia’s ambassador to the U.S.. In February intelligence leaks revealed that during their phone calls Flynn indicated to Kislyak that Russia could expect Trump to lift sanctions that his predecessor President Barack Obama had imposed on the Russian government after America’s intelligence community concluded that Moscow had interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He concealed this from Pence, but subsequent FBI interviews concluded Flynn didn’t conspire to deceive the vice president. Earlier this week former acting U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates testified in the Senate that she warned the White House that Flynn was vulnerable to blackmail over his false statements about his talks with the Russian ambassador. The subpoenas were made on behalf of a grand jury investigating potential criminal conduct related to alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election. The group is looking specifically at Flynn’s business dealings before he was appointed to the Trump administration.

Join For Free Download Microservices for Java Developers: A hands-on introduction to frameworks and containers. Brought to you in partnership with Red Hat. In a 13-10 vote that concluded on May 8, the Public Review Ballot for JSR #376 (formally known as the Java Platform Module System) failed to pass the JCP executive committee's muster. Perhaps the central component of Project Jigsaw, it is now delayed for up to 30 days, an extension afforded by the "No" vote. The Ayes Most of the "Yes" votes were made without comment. Those voters included Oracle, Intel, NXP Semiconductors, Goldman Sachs, Azul Systems, Gemalto M2M GmbH, and MicroDoc. The three remaining ayes — V2COM, SouJava, and Fujitsu Limited — touched on the chaotic past few weeks that Jigsaw has had under public review. Fujitsu and V2COM "There are a lot of concerns, but we hope EG members will resolve them by the next ballot," according to Fujitsu. V2COM agreed, saying, "V2COM shares other EC members' concerns, but we believe that all major concerns can be addressed between this ballot and the next ballot." SouJava Meanwhile, SouJava went into more detail about its yes vote, intimating that they were, in fact, nearly against the measure. "As others have said, we agree there has been a tremendous achievement in this effort by the team, in something many believed would never succeed," they said. "But the uneasiness of a specification that was not agreed by the EG it was ready for public review led the discussions inside SouJava towards a NO vote." So, what changed their minds? "The movement of the Spec Lead in the last few weeks changed the general sentiment, and we are thankful for the effort of solving the issues. We agree with the London Java Community and others that the specification AS WAS SUBMITTED for public review is lacking. We understand that the Spec Lead should focus on an initial release that will be improved later, and we were even willing to accept some compromising on the tooling issues." But they're keeping their eyes on the situation, particularly regarding independent implementations. They also stated that without satisfaction for those concerns, SouJava will flip from a yes to a no. "But if the specification does not support independent implementations, it's a bigger problem. Independent implementations are the primary objective of the JCP, and we do not intend to keep the yes vote if the situation persists. The Nays In all, 13 EC members voted against Jigsaw as it stands now. As per the chart above, Credit Suisse, the Eclipse Foundation, Ivar Grimstad, Hazelcast, HPE, IBM, Werner Keil, the London Java Community, Red Hat, SAP, Software AG, Tomitribe, and Twitter all voted against the JSR. Their reasons and rationales were nearly as countless as the stars, but we'll summarize some of the highlights here. Red Hat We'll start with Red Hat. In April, the Red Hat Middleware Team compiled a 34-page document citing a variety of concerns and problems they had with Jigsaw. These ranged from the eminently practical ("The patterns introduced within Jigsaw are (in some cases) going to be extremely difficult to fix even in a later release, and will create backwards- and forwards-compatibility problems that will be very difficult to unwind") to wider concerns over its effect on the ecosystem and the community at large ("Due to lack of one to one mapping of use cases (or sufficient interoperability capabilities) and other restrictions, we are concerned that there will likely be two worlds of Java software development: the Jigsaw world, and the “everything else” world (Java SE Classloaders, OSGi, JBoss Modules, Java EE, etc)"). Here's a visual breakdown from their findings of the problems facing Jigaw and its modularity. While acknowledging that the original goals were changed to focus on modularizing the JVM, Red Hat stated that throughout the process, the focus seemed to switch back and forth between modularizing the JVM and creating a module system for developers. "In previous votes and comments on the EG list, we have articulated the view that from a middleware/SE developer perspective, we believe that Jigsaw does not fulfill its original goals of being a module system which can be used by the likes of Java EE," according to Red Hat. Regardless, Red Hat said they were still hopeful about the future. In conclusion, they stated, "We believe that a more considered evaluation of all input and consensus gathering should not take too much time and would result in something which would be better received by the entire Java ecosystem." IBM IBM also detailed why they voted against Jigsaw. "The JSR 376 Expert Group and the public have raised a number of reasonable issues and concerns with the current public review draft of the specification that warrant further discussion and resolution," according to the voting log. "We advocate work continuing amongst all members of the Expert Group to address the issues documented on the mailing lists. IBM would like to see closer consensus amongst the entire Expert Group before this specification proceeds to the next step." Werner Keil Werner Keil also lent his support against the measure in its current form. "I understand IBM's and others reason for their 'No' vote and heard many similar concerns by e.g. the OSGi community or contributors behind major build systems like Maven, Gradle, or Ant." He added that most of their concerns have yet to be answered by the expert group or Spec Lead, and he questioned whether the JSR was ready yet. SAP SE SAP joined many other voters, yes and no alike, in celebrating the progress that has been made to the JPMS so far. "We absolutely recognize the tremendous achievements and the great work that has been carried out until now — by the expert group members as well as (and especially) by the spec lead himself." But that being said, "While the JPMS is in pretty good shape for the modularization of the Java platform itself, we think that there are still some rough edges for libraries and frameworks outside the Java platform which should be addressed and agreed upon before the final approval of the specification." And finally, they ended their voting summary with an admonishment of how various parties have behaved in the past few weeks and hoped to see more cooperation in the future. "Finally, we adjure all members and the spec lead to come back to the table and communicate directly to each other instead of blaming each other through blogs and open letters!" they said. What Happens Next? Most of the rest of the no votes echoed similar sentiments to those stated above, but you can read the vote log here for the full details. In any event, Project Jigsaw is on hold for the time being. The ballot, which was not approved by the EC due to the failed vote, will remain where it is for up to 30 days while the expert group works on tackling the issues. And that probably isn't too far off-track. Several voters explained that they were close to voting "Yes," but that there are simply too many unresolved issues to go forward at this point. In fact, a few of the "No" votes were counting on this extra time to hammer out the problems, especially considering the risk of failing at the next level of balloting. "The risk of passing this JSR through to the next stage is that should it fail the Final Approval Ballot, the spec lead and EG have only 30 days to resolve all issues or the specification fails permanently per JCP rules," according to Tomitribe's vote explanation. And regardless of the problems facing Jigsaw, no one on the committee seemed to want that to happen. Java 9's release date is still, officially, July 27.

IGEL Upgrades Universal Desktop UD5 and UD6 Thin Clients; Adds Support for Windows 10 IoT Enterprise NEW! IGEL Upgrades Universal Desktop UD5 and UD6 Thin Clients; Adds Support for Windows 10 IoT Enterprise May 10, 2017 IGEL Technology 0 0 The high-performance endpoints combined with IGEL’s industry-leading software enable IT organizations to leverage Windows 10 IoT Enterprise to simplify the management of IoT-connected devices IGEL, a world leader in endpoint management software for the secure enterprise, today announced that it has upgraded the IGEL Universal Desktop™-series UD5 and UD6 thin clients, adding support for Windows 10 IoT Enterprise. IGEL UD5 and IGEL UD6 endpoints featuring Windows 10 IoT Enterprise will be on display at Citrix Synergy 2017, Booth #207, taking place May 22-25, 2017 in Orlando, Fla. “Researchers are predicting that more than 20 billion IoT devices will be connected to the Internet by 2020, and as a result an increasing number of businesses are starting to identify ways in which to harness the power of these edge devices in order to drive digital transformation initiatives,” said Matthias Haas, Chief Technology Officer, IGEL. “The combination of our high-performance IGEL UD5 and UD6 thin clients featuring Windows 10 IoT Enterprise with our industry-leading endpoint management software is making it possible for IT organizations operating in a wide-range of industries to simplify the management of their IoT-connected devices.” High-Performance Endpoint Solutions Offer Flexibility, Security and Manageability The IGEL Universal Desktop UD5 and UD6 thin clients feature Intel® Celeron® dual-core and quad-core processors, respectively, and support high-performance graphics capabilities for a rich multimedia experience, while enabling users to run multiple software applications simultaneously. In addition to Windows 10 IoT Enterprise, the IGEL UD5 and UD6 thin clients also support the IGEL OS™, IGEL’s Linux-based operating system. To enable users to securely communicate between their Windows 10 IoT Enterprise-powered IGEL desktops and IoT devices, the IGEL UD5 and UD6 thing clients support a variety of networking protocols including the genuine Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client. With the IGEL Universal Management Suite™ (UMS), a single endpoint management solution that provides IT with automated backend control while delivering a familiar, trouble-free environment for users, organizations are able to manage all of their IGEL endpoints. “No other manufacturer can simplify the management of complex enterprise environments the way IGEL can,” said Haas. “Our ability to support a diverse array of devices and operating systems through the IGEL UMS, including Windows 10 IoT Enterprise, has truly revolutionized endpoint management.” For usage with Windows 10 IoT Enterprise, IGEL UD5 and UD6 thin clients also come standard with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of flash memory, providing much-needed space for IT organizations to install their own software applications, as well as drivers or tools needed to support peripherals including dictation devices. Additionally, the IGEL UD5 and UD6 clients include a software license that provides access to regular and frequent firmware updates, enabling IT organizations to preserve their hardware investment while taking advantage of new features and functionality that become available. “The increasing risk of outside threats and ransomware attacks has made it imperative that businesses secure their endpoints and users,” said Mark Bowker, Senior Analyst, ESG. “With industries such as healthcare and manufacturing space, looking to integrate IoT devices within for improved business insight, concerns have become intensified around cybersecurity risk. IGEL, with its secure endpoint management solutions and support for Window 10 IoT Enterprise is making it easier for enterprises to provide their employees with a robust end-user computing experience, while at the same time protecting access to their corporate assets.” IGEL UMS Eases Transition Between Virtualization Protocols All IGEL UD-series thin clients also come pre-configured to support industry-leading virtualization protocols. Customers can choose from Citrix HDX, Microsoft RDP/Remote FX or VMware Horizon. Organizations can add or re-configure supported virtualization protocols, leveraging the IGEL UMS to quickly transition between protocols, and make changes for their entire network of thin clients or a specific endpoint. The UMS also enables IT organizations to add and remove endpoint devices, and perform software upgrades as needed or required, to provide the latest available protocol features. Availability and Support IGEL UD5 and UD6 thin clients featuring Windows 10 IoT Enterprise will be available starting on May 15, 2017 and can be purchased through IGEL’s network of Platinum Partners, Authorized IGEL Partners (AIPs) and resellers. Each IGEL UD5 and UD6 thin client comes standard with a free three-year hardware warranty.

But first, you need to manage the flood of data. by Justin Bachman @justinbachman More stories by Justin Bachman May 10, 2017, 10:00 AM EDT At some point in the not-too-distant future, fleets of commercial drones are expected to swarm across American skies. Companies in a wide range of industries will employ unmanned vehicles for tactical advantage—inspecting infrastructure, surveying crops, maybe even estimating how much your new roof will cost.  And when these drones fly, a torrent of data will follow them like an invisible contrail. “Data is the new oil,” Intel Corp. Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich said this week at the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International’s annual Xponential conference in Dallas, the industry’s top trade show. He cited a growing competitive “separation” between companies that collect and understand their data and those that don’t. A single autonomous car can generate the same data trove as 3,000 people surfing the internet, while a small drone fleet could easily create 150 terabytes of data per day, he said (1,000 gigabytes equals 1 terabyte). “The data rate is going to explode on us in the next few years,” Krzanich said. But how to handle that wide open fire hose of information? “Operation of an unmanned system is no longer a stand-alone activity,” Lockheed Martin Corp. proclaims in its promotional materials for its Hydra Fusion Tools software. “There [is] an assortment of maps, images, video, and intelligence which are being broadcast to the operators and this needs to be fused into a common operational picture.” This proposition, unsurprisingly, is leading to an array of new business models aimed at helping companies sift through and exploit the mountains of information headed their way.  Into this universe comes Airbus SE, the European aerospace conglomerate. Airbus is starting a new data company, called Airbus Aerial, to provide an array of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) services, a field the company estimates could increase to more than $120 billion annually as the use of these fleets expands, said Dirk Hoke, CEO of Airbus’s defence and space group. Hoke introduced the new company Wednesday at Xponential. Power companies across the U.S. are testing whether drones can spot trouble on transmission lines. Photographer: John Bazemore/AP Photo The proliferation of commercial drones won’t be so much about getting your pizza or new shirt faster—although there is that consideration—but a broader change in how companies employ aerial surveillance and data to inform their businesses, spurred by efficiency and new U.S. rules allowing commercial unmanned systems to operate at farther distances, autonomously. A diverse array of companies, ranging from insurers and utilities to real estate and energy, are likely to shift some of their operations to UAV. Some of the work now done by helicopters could be replaced at lower cost. Insurers, for example, are finding aerial surveillance to be a good method for assessing claims after tornadoes and hurricanes and to help understand risks in their underwriting activities. Airbus Aerial aims to compile high-altitude data from a fleet of eight Airbus satellites and drones, blending it into an intelligence service for agriculture, insurance, oil and gas, utilities, and state and local governments. Aerial will be based in Germany, near Munich, with U.S. offices in Atlanta. The company sees 2017 as a way to explore the market, testing the business with “a small, select group of customers” to determine how clients will value Aerial’s services, said Jana Rosenmann, Airbus senior vice president of unmanned aerial systems. Airbus will fly third-party drones for its clients but will also explore building its own hardware, she said. “The initial business is not relying on Airbus having its own drone today,” Rosenmann said in a telephone interview. Airbus Zephyr. Source: Airbus Defence and Space The company already operates high-altitude solar-powered UAVs, dubbed Zephyr, which has stayed aloft for as long as 14 days. Airbus calls Zephyr “a high-altitude pseudo satellite” due to its high cruising level of up to 70,000 feet.  Most customers will have a specific need for the services of companies like Aerial and won’t care how the information is acquired, be it by drone, satellite, or other means, said Jesse Kallman, who will lead the Airbus unit’s U.S. operations. “A drone is really just a truck that you stick a sensor on,” he said. “We will use whatever hardware makes the most sense.” Aerial pricing is likely to be tailored to a specific market or customer, Kallman said, ranging from recurring subscriptions to one-off jobs.  To date, one of the major impediments to commercial drone flying has been the lack of federal rules, which are now pending at the Federal Aviation Administration. The regulations sort out operational guidelines to integrate UAVs safely into existing air traffic. Although slow to get these rules squared away, the American UAV service market may mature more quickly than in Europe, owing to the U.S. having only a single regulatory body, Hoke said.

Source: Airbus Defence and Space The field of drone services has already begun seeing consolidation among smaller players, with much of the business focused on courting large companies and recurring revenue streams, said Jon Damush, vice president of commercial at Insitu, a Boeing Co. subsidiary that builds and flies drones. Over time, given the cost of contracting with a drone service, some of the larger drone data users—such as miners and pipeline operators—might decide to buy their own drones and software. “When you become a certain size on the expense line, somebody’s going to notice,” Damush said. But Kanji counters that there’s room “for a lot of different vendors,” from companies that offer just data storage to others that may sell analysis, data collection, or a combination. Some of these data wranglers focus on software, offering drone users the ability to create detailed interfaces for the data that UAVs emit. Others, such as Insitu, focus on drone reconnaissance and data analysis for railroads, large mining companies in Australia, and pipeline operators. That’s the larger-scale end of the business, leaving many smaller players eager to exploit common drone necessities among many industries. “One thing we’ve found is that with agriculture, utilities, railroads, and construction, a lot of them have very similar needs,” Kanji said, citing one example: “All of them worry about vegetation.”  Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Hopes of new Surface hardware were dashed at day one of the annual conference, with the software behemoth instead focusing on Cortana, Artificial Intelligence, the IoT, and how best to organize the cloud when the levels of data being generated are growing exponentially. The day one keynote kicked off with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announcing that there are now 500 million active Windows 10 devices being seen every month. The milestone comes as Office 365 sees 100m monthly active commercial users; 90-percent of the Fortune 500, Microsoft says, now runs on the company’s cloud. Today, though, that cloud starts evolving. The traditional paradigm of cloud computing, Nadella points out, has been data getting shuttled from wherever it’s created – be that a factory floor, your car or home, or a hospital or farm – up into a centralized server somewhere. Microsoft’s next phase, though, is a more intelligent cloud, recognizing that often the data wants to stay where it’s created. Instead, the processing gets pushed to the edge. Edge computing is, as the name hints, where the heavy crunching gets done only one or two steps away from the point of data collection. It’s something we’ve seen Intel talk about already, in its work on connected cities as distributed processing would lend resilience from downtime to autonomous transportation and more. Microsoft, though, wants to expand even further than that. It’ll do that with Azure Cosmos DB, a brand new cloud computing platform dubbed “the industry’s first globally distributed, multimodal database service.” With new types of data, a new type of database is required, Microsoft argues. This one will allow for a single instance to be run globally, with single-digit latency at the 99th percentile. In short: the power of a traditional data center but the ubiquity of access of the cloud. At the same time, Microsoft is pushing out a bevy of new tools for developers. There are new Microsoft Graph APIs, bringing SharePoint and Planner into the fold, while now any developer can publish for Microsoft Teams. That means third-part notifications piped right into the Teams activity feed, among other things. Visual Studio 2017 for Mac has reached general availability, and there’s now Threat Detection for Azure SQL databases. Meanwhile, Microsoft is hoping to snag some former Oracle and SQL Server customers, with new database migration tools. Developers will be able to develop a single Azure function in the cloud, and have that distributed down to Internet of Thing connected devices in edge cases, including support for machine learning, AI, and cognitive services. NOW READ: This is the Surface Laptop What does all this mean? Better utilization of the growing processing power we’re surrounded by, for one. By 2020, Microsoft points out, the research suggests that four billion people will have an average of six devices they use regularly. “We’ve always believed in taking advantage of an abundance where you have it,” Microsoft’s Frank Shaw points out; making better use of that condensed compute potential could mean fewer monolithic data centers and more distributed processing.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars DEV Microsoft launches Cortana Skills Kit in public preview Khari Johnson@kharijohnson May 10, 2017 8:00 AM Image Credit: Microsoft Microsoft today announced a public preview of its Cortana Skills Kit that allows developers to create voice apps for the intelligent assistant. The announcement was made at Build 2017, Microsoft’s annual developer conference taking place May 10-12 in Seattle. Third-party developers have already made hundreds of Google Assistant actions and more than 10,000 Alexa skills using Actions on Google and the Alexa Skills Kit. The Harman Kardon Invoke speaker with Cortana inside is due in Microsoft stores this fall. Microsoft also announced today that it will work with HP and Intel on ways to put Cortana into more devices. Cortana was first made available for personal computers with the release of Windows 10 in July 2015. The digital assistant is used by 145 million monthly active users, a figure first shared in March 2017. Early skills-making partners include Expedia, Capital One, and home repair company TalkLocal. Additional early makers of skills for Cortana are likely to make announcements today. Developers will be able to create Cortana skills with both the Cortana Skills Kit and by using a Microsoft Bot Framework conversion in the same simple one-click way you convert a Kik or Facebook Messenger bot with the framework. No word yet on when a software development kit (SDK) for Cortana, which was teased alongside the skills kit last December, will become available. An SDK would bring Cortana to a range of devices beyond smart speakers or those made by Microsoft. The Cortana SDK is still in private preview. With the exception of Apple, virtually every tech giant is currently inviting developers to make third-party voice apps for their intelligent assistant or smart speaker, from Samsung to Google to Amazon, and now Microsoft.

Microsoft is revealing today that HP is partnering with the software maker to create its own hardware that will run Cortana. Microsoft is also working with Intel to provide a reference platform for Cortana-enabled devices, allowing Microsoft's digital assistant to appear on a range of hardware. Harman Kardon will still be one of the first to deliver a Cortana-powered speaker. Announced earlier this week, the Invoke speaker is designed to take on Amazon's Echo devices with 360-degree speakers, Skype calling, and smart home control all through voice commands. HP is the latest PC maker to partner with Microsoft on these types of devices, and we're expecting to hear more manufacturers create their own devices later this year. Microsoft has bold ambitions for Cortana, including bringing it to fridges, toasters, and thermostats. Microsoft has enabled far-field speech communications and wake on voice in the Creators Update to Windows 10, allowing Cortana to be used in new ways. Microsoft is also expected to launch a new Home Hub feature in Windows 10 later this year that will turn Cortana into an assistant that manages shared family PCs.

The next generation of talents, AI abilities, and conversational computing for Cortana is being detailed today at BUILD 2017, Microsoft’s annual developer event. That includes a significant push into AI across every aspect of the software behemoth’s portfolio. Though it may have started out on Windows Phone, Cortana has spread broadly throughout Microsoft’s line-up. At BUILD this week, the company announced the voice-controlled agent now sees 141m monthly active users, across voice and typed interactions. Now, Microsoft is setting developers up for the next step in that journey, with the Cortana Skills Kit entering public preview. Available across windows 10, Android, iOS, and Harman Kardon’s recently-announced Invoke speaker, it’ll allow developers to create skills for the agent by generating a bot. That can be deployed to the new Cortana Channel in the Bot Framework, and while she may not have many standalone devices to speak through so far, Microsoft has plans there too. The company announced partnerships with HP and Intel today, to create Cortana-powered devices and reference platforms respectively. There’s more to Microsoft’s artificial intelligence play than just Cortana, mind. The company is also launching a new bevy of cognitive services to its AI platform, bringing the total to 29. There’s now Bing Custom Search, Custom Vision Service, Custom Decision Service, and Video Indexer, which developers can tap into with easy, off-the-shelf plugins. For PowerPoint, there’s a new Presentation Translator that – thanks to the Translation APIs – can convert presentations into different languages in real-time. For bots, meanwhile, there’s now new adaptive cards support. With the Bot Framework, a single set of answer cards that work across multiple services and platforms can be created. New channels for Bing, Cortana, and Skype for Business open up fresh avenues for bot interaction to take place. Looking ahead, there’s the new Cognitive Services Labs. That’s designed as a catch-all for Microsoft’s more experimental services, kicking off with the new Gesture API. Although still early in its development, eventually Microsoft hopes it’ll allow interaction by gesture alone. Speech is undoubtedly where the company sees the main traction being. “We really still believe that, in a couple of of years, if you build software everything will want to understand human language and speech,” Microsoft’s Lili Cheng, general manager of FUSE Labs, says. Nonetheless, the ways in which tomorrow’s AIs act among us may be more discreet. In one keynote demonstration, Microsoft showed a near-future implementation of AI for workplace safety. By fusing AI, sensors, mobile devices, and cognitive services, the system could recognize both people and objects, such as industrial equipment. After tagging the latter with their individual properties, how they ought to be safely used, and who is cleared to operate each, the AI could trigger alerts for whoever was nearest if it observed the equipment being used incorrectly. It’s unclear just how “near” that specific vision of the future might be. Still, Microsoft is pushing ahead with real-world implementations of its AI. As well as consumer devices like the Invoke smart speaker, there’s also deployments such as predictive analysis in the cloud to monitor heavy machinery for potential breakdown incidents. That’s being moved from a centralized cloud computing platform, out to edge computing, with the upshot being a dramatic reduction in the amount of time it takes to spot a flaw and shut the whole system down before something expensive breaks.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Comey’s legacy on cyber By Tim Starks 05/10/17 10:00 AM EDT With help from Cory Bennett, Eric Geller and Martin Matishak COMEY LEAVES MARK ON CYBER POLICY — And just when you thought you couldn’t be surprised anymore, the Trump administration went and fired FBI Director James Comey Tuesday night. Comey’s tenure — which began in the fall of 2013 — coincided with a dramatic shift in how the country viewed cyber crime and cybersecurity. He started a few months after NSA contractor Edward Snowden exposed the expansive underbelly of the government’s surveillance apparatus, and just months before a spate of massive data breaches at companies like Target, Home Depot and JPMorgan Chase brought digital crime into the national spotlight for the first time. Story Continued Below Comey’s response to the changing times earned him many fans, but no shortage of critics. Backers, which included many law enforcement colleagues and a number of lawmakers, “praised the FBI chief for his dogged focus on tackling the rapid proliferation of digital crime,” the Pro Cyber team reported. “Comey’s tenure included investigations that led to the first charges ever brought against alleged government-backed hackers in China, Russia and Iran, as well as the capture of numerous elusive foreign hackers that some assumed were forever out of the reach of U.S. authorities.” “Comey's leadership and advocacy on any topic about which he is passionate have been unmatched,” Anthony J. Ferrante, a former chief of staff in the FBI’s cyber division and later a cyber official at the White House, told MC. “He has worked tirelessly on behalf of the ideals of justice for nearly 20 years,” added Ferrante, now head of cybersecurity at FTI Consulting. But the tech and privacy community have a much different take on Comey’s cyber legacy. “Comey’s insistence that investigators needed guaranteed access to encrypted communications — and his defense of certain government surveillance programs — left a bitter taste in the mouths of many in the tech and privacy community,” the cyber team reported. Pros can get the full rundown on Comey’s cyber legacy here. Over at POLITICO Magazine, Garrett Graff also has some good insight on Comey’s broader legacy. POLITICO's Josh Dawsey also had a look at how the firing went down. — COMEY’S CAPITOL HILL FALLOUT: Comey’s dismissal is sure to dominate discussions on Capitol Hill this week, and the fallout has already begun. Despite misgivings about Comey’s tenure from both the left and the right, he had earned the trust of Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr and top panel Democrat Mark Warner, both of whom said Comey was forthcoming with them and helpful to their own Russia probe. Both said they were troubled by Comey’s unceremonious axing. One Intel panel member, though, Sen. Joe Manchin, said he expected the firing wouldn’t have a big impact and that Comey could testify before the committee just as other former officials have. But some Democrats, foremost among them Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have now revived calls for a special prosecutor or independent investigation to look into the issue, an idea Republicans again dismissed.

Send your thoughts, feedback and especially tips to tstarks@politico.com, and be sure to follow @timstarks, @POLITICOPro and @MorningCybersec. Full team info is below. LAMAR SMITH Q&A — House Science Chairman Lamar Smith has transformed his panel into an “unexpected hub of cybersecurity activity,” Eric and Tim write for Pros in a story out this morning based on an interview with the Texas Republican last week. Smith talked about some of his panel’s legislative efforts, like a pair of bills giving new directives to technical standards agency NIST to audit federal agencies and aid small businesses. Below are a couple more highlights. Pros can get the full interview here. On whether he’ll investigate Trump’s oft-criticized personal device security: “No. I haven’t seen any evidence that anybody has taken advantage of that, or that there were any leaks or anything like that.” On his overall perspective on cybersecurity: “Cybersecurity is a subject that is growing in importance by the hour. Cybersecurity — or, I should say, cyber insecurity — cyberattacks are a threat to our country, our economy and to the privacy of individuals. And that’s why everybody needs to appreciate that Congress is trying to prevent cyberattacks, trying to come up with ways to make our agencies more secure and come up with ways to help small businesses as far as that goes.” TODAY: HSGAC PREPS CYBER FOUNDATION — The Senate Homeland Security Committee is holding its first major cybersecurity hearing of the year, with Chairman Ron Johnson saying in his prepared opening remarks that the session is meant to lay the groundwork for the panel’s work this Congress. “Before we can begin to discuss solutions, we must first understand the threats and trends associated with these threats,” Johnson is expected to say. He’ll offer a hint of his focus, too: “Emerging trends include the rise of ransomware and botnets as easy-to-use tactics that offer big rewards for cybercriminals.” Johnson’s committee will hear from a number of cybersecurity experts. One of them, former top FBI cyber official Steve Chabinsky, will argue that the United States needs to get more proactive. “The U.S. should lead international efforts that find higher-level solutions that solve problems before they get to everyone,” Chabinsky, a partner at White & Case, told MC via email in advance of his testimony. “This would include going after the hackers, having more secure products and protocols, and cleaning things up at the Internet ecosystem level before the problems reach millions of victims.” An official from Symantec will revisit some of the conclusions in the company’s recent annual threat report. But Jeff Greene, Symantec’s senior director for global government affairs and policy, will also recommend a range of protective measures, according to his written testimony, many of them technological, like using encryption and multiple factors to verify users’ identities. KASPERSKY KASPER-SPY? — Long-simmering tensions over Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab burst into the open this week, as current and former U.S. officials voiced concerns that Kaspersky’s security software could let the Kremlin hack into government networks. ABC News reported Tuesday that the FBI was investigating the company, that the Department of Homeland Security had issued a secret report about its products and that the Senate Intelligence Committee had asked senior Trump administration officials to address what it called this “important national security issue.” Federal, state and local government agencies across the country use Kaspersky products, as do some American embassies. But officials are worried about a Russian security law that lets the Kremlin “monitor and record all data that traverses Russia’s networks” — in the words of a State Department memo — which could include Kaspersky customer data sent to the company’s headquarters. In its response to the concerns — which first resurfaced in a BuzzFeed story on Monday — Kaspersky said it “has no ties to any government” and “has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts.” The company also noted that customers can disable the transmission of sensitive data back to Moscow. “In addition, business and government users may choose to install a local and private Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) center on their premises to make sure the data never leaves their facility,” the company added. Eugene Kaspersky, the company’s founder, on Twitter accused a U.S. journalist of trying to “cook [up] a new BIG conspiracy story.” He also announced that he’d answer Reddit questions on Thursday as part of the site’s “Ask Me Anything” series. In its statement, Kaspersky said it was “available to assist all concerned government organizations with any ongoing investigations” and that it “ardently believes a deeper examination of Kaspersky Lab will confirm that these allegations are unfounded.” LOOKING OUT FOR THE LITTLE GUY — The FTC on Tuesday launched a new resource for small businesses seeking information about cyber threats. The FTC’s new small-business portal collects existing material, including “plain language guidance” on responding to data breaches and protecting customer information, as well as commission blog posts on cyber topics like the NIST framework. “Small businesses are critical to our economic strength, building America's future, and helping the United States compete in today's global marketplace,” said acting FTC Chairman Maureen Ohlhausen in a statement. “This innovative new website is a one-stop shop where small businesses can find information to protect themselves from scammers and hackers, as well as resources they can use if they are hit with a cyberattack.” THE CYBER GORDIAN KNOT — U.S. Cyber Command last year successfully hacked the Islamic State’s propaganda machine and promptly set off a debate about the authorities the military enjoys in cyberspace and what role, if any, allies should play in such digital operations, The Washington Post reports. The article comes as the Trump administration continues to review, and potentially revise, how the entire federal government, not just the Pentagon, handles cyber. The new structure was supposed to be spelled out in a plan the administration vowed to release within its first 90 days in office, but that self-imposed deadline came and went without any explanation from the White House — a fact not lost on Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain. In a Tuesday hearing with Cyber Command chief Adm. Mike Rogers, McCain called the lack of action “disheartening.” Rogers admitted the plan hasn’t been rolled out yet “but the new team is working on that. … I want to make sure we all understand that.” McCain replied: “And the check's in the mail?” LOGGING CYBER VISITS — POLITICO’s cyber watchers will find visits and calls of interest in POLITICO’s unofficial White House visitor logs, from world leaders (Chinese President Xi Jinping warrants several mentions) to top Cabinet officials (Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stops by plenty). It doesn’t feature very many visitors explicitly focused on the cybersecurity business, other than perhaps Keith Alexander, the former NSA chief who now runs IronNet Cybersecurity. But the logs show a good many leaders of companies with at least some cyber biz: Accenture, Boeing, Dell, Deloitte, General Dynamics, IBM, Infor, Intel and Lockheed Martin. See the whole list here. TWEET OF THE DAY — [awkward grimace emoji] RECENTLY ON PRO CYBERSECURITY — The White House maintains that it fired former national security adviser Michael Flynn at the right time. … “Sens. Brian Schatz and Ron Wyden wrote to the FCC today asking for more information on what the agency said was a distributed denial-of-service attack on its website where the public can comment on the commission's net neutrality proceeding.” … Activist group Fight for the Future said the FCC’s servers struggled again after HBO re-aired John Oliver’s calls to comment on net neutrality. … Sen. Dick Durbin wants the Trump administration to say whether it believes Russia is behind the cyberattacks on French President-elect Emmanuel Macron, and condemn Moscow if so. … Sen. Angus King suggested to appropriators that they allocate $160 million for election result audits to counter hackers. REPORT WATCH — Pandalabs, a division of Panda Security, says it detected more than 350,000 new cyberattacks daily in the first quarter 2017. Digital criminals also raked in more than $1 billion through ransomware last year, the firm concludes in a new study out today. QUICK BYTES — Grand jury subpoenas issued in FBI's Russia investigation. CNN. — Russia has its own hacker problem. The Wall Street Journal. — GoT digs 2FA. The Verge. — Some Russian hacker antics via ESET and FireEye. That’s all for today. John Wall, baby.

In a wider sense, semiconductor and tech stocks are considered to be leading indicators for the markets in general. A strong rally in the tech sector has pushed many of these companies to new highs, and both the Dow and S&P have recently pushed back near all-time highs on the back of a series of strong earnings reports. The April 28 short interest data have been compared with the previous report. Short interest moves were mixed in these selected semiconductor stocks. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) saw its short interest decrease to 90.88 million shares. The previous level was 92.29 million. Shares were last seen at $36.37, in a 52-week trading range of $29.50 to $38.45. The number of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) shares short increased to 120.91 million from the previous level of 119.42 million. Shares recently traded at $10.18, in a 52-week range of $3.55 to $15.55. Note that, like Intel, AMD is one of the most shorted Nasdaq stocks. Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) saw the number of its shares short jump to 20.88 million, compared to the 15.98 million reported in the previous period. Shares were changing hands at $55.15, in a 52-week range of $50.84 to $71.62. Short interest in Applied Materials Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT) increased slightly to 13.40 million shares. The previous reading was 13.35 million. Shares were trading at $42.04, in a 52-week range of $19.46 to $42.25. Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MU) saw its short interest fall to 41.62 million shares from the previous reading of 43.60 million. Shares were trading at $28.81, in a 52-week range of $9.35 to $29.87. And the short interest in Broadcom Ltd. (NASDAQ: AVGO) decreased to 3.39 million shares in the period, from the previous 3.70 million. Shares were last seen at $228.46, in a 52-week range of $139.52 to $229.40.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman 450Mm/Copper/Low-K Convergence Report 2017: Timing, Trends, Issues, Market Analysis – Research and Markets DUBLIN–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Research and Markets has announced the addition of the „450Mm/Copper/Low-K Convergence: Timing, Trends, Issues, Market Analysis” report to their offering. A semiconductor foundry capable of processing 450mm wafers offers a tremendous economy of scale versus facilities working with smaller-diameter wafers, albeit with large startup costs required for the needed wafer-handling equipment. The larger wafers yield more semiconductor die, assuming that good material quality can be maintained across the surface of the larger wafers. As a rough approximation, only about one-half the wafer starts are required for a 450mm wafer facility compared to a 300mm wafer facility to produce the same number of die. ASML, one of the major equipment suppliers to chip factories, recently decided to stop trying to develop a new generation of machines that could handle 450mm wafers. No one is definitively ruling out 450mm, but even Intel agrees that it is on hold until the end of the decade. TSMC is not as vocal as Intel, but the Taiwan foundry giant is still interested in 450mm, as well. Still others believe 450mm fabs could get pushed out to the 2020 to 2025 timeframe. Now that work is on hold, along with the Intel investment in ASML’s 450mm program. Equipment makers need a timely decision in order to move forward with their 450mm tool R&D efforts. This report addresses the timeline of 450mm acceptance based on the different requirements of logic versus memory chips. It also focused on the markets for copper interconnect and low-k dielectric deposition equipment and forecasts.

Anlayst Mark Lipacis maintained a Buy rating on Nvidia's stock with an unchanged $140 price target as the company is showing signs of being "the primary beneficiary" of an ongoing shift in the computer business model. Lipacis highlighted the fact that Nvidia's data center business nearly tripled on a year-over-year basis for the third consecutive quarter. In the most recent quarter, sales rose to $1.6 billion on an annualized basis. Perhaps more important, this is happening at the same time Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC)'s data center business is decelerating. "This supports our thesis that the center of gravity of computing is drifting toward a parallel model from a serial one," Lipacis wrote. "We think the Street is underestimating the secular nature of this shift and how it will benefit Nvidia." Consistent Message From AI Players Lipacis noted that his firm recently hosted three artificial intelligence themed conferences and the main takeaway from each is the same. Specifically, startups and cloud players all say the only reason they're able to operate is because of Nvidia's GPU and software. The analyst also argued Nvidia's multi-year investments in CUDA and its APIs has resulted in the company sitting in a position where it is "years ahead" of the competition. "Said another way, Nvidia + CUDA appears to be emerging as the 'Wintel of AI.," the analyst added.

The contract to provide a complete visual system was awarded by a Turkish global software and systems provider Havelsan. Quantum3D will supply its Independence IDX 8000 Series image generator that is built on the latest visual computing technology, including Intel's latest Xeon CPUs and NVIDIA's Quadro P-series GPUs. The image generator also features the company's MANTIS scene generation software on a PC-based hardware platform for real-time visual simulation. When used together with Quantum3D's GeoScapeSE World-Wide Database, IDX 8000 is said to provide a solution with an ability to fly to thousands of airports, cities, and other destinations around the globe. "Being a part of this programme with TAI only adds to the momentum of success we've been seeing recently as the emerging visual platform of choice in the rotary-wing segment." Quantum3D Business Development and Sales vice-president Brian Overy said: "Helicopter simulation is one of the most demanding applications from a visual system perspective. "Being a part of this programme with TAI only adds to the momentum of success we've been seeing recently as the emerging visual platform of choice in the rotary-wing segment." The T-625, which was initially named 'Ozgun', is being built as part of a programme initiated in 2014 to replace the Turkish Armed Forces' ageing fleet of Bell Helicopter UH-1H Hueys. The simulator will support the first prototype airframe, which is currently under development, with volume production anticipated to begin in late 2018.

Does the idea of an open-source set-top box with customizable third-party add-ons interest you? If you answered Yes to either of these questions it sounds like you’re in the market for a Kodi box. We’ve already established that Kodi boxes are legal What Are Kodi Boxes and Is It Legal to Own One? What Are Kodi Boxes and Is It Legal to Own One? With Kodi boxes becoming increasingly popular, we set out to explain what Kodi boxes are and offer you a definitive answer on their legality. Read More . If you’re interested in buying one, the next step is determining which one is right for your own personal needs — because everyone is different. When it comes to Kodi boxes, there are a lot of options on the market. Different boxes suit different usage situations. Unfortunately, it’s not always easy to make sense of the vast array of choices. But don’t worry, as MakeUseOf is here to help you make sense of it all. To make this article easier to digest, we have split it into several different categories. Therefore, we suggest skimming through the article and finding the headline that best describes you before delving deeper into the recommendations. If You’re New to Kodi… Are you new to the world of Kodi boxes and keen to see what all the fuss is about? At this point, you probably neither need or want all of the bells and whistles some of the more extravagant boxes come equipped with. If HD audio isn’t a concern and you haven’t got an AV receiver as part of your home theater setup, you have two main options to choose from. Xiaomi Mi Box The Xiaomi Mi Box does a great job of handling Android TV apps. It ships with Marshmallow (meaning it can handle 4K Netflix videos You Can Now Stream 4K Netflix on Windows 10 You Can Now Stream 4K Netflix on Windows 10 Netflix is finally offering 4K streaming on Windows 10. Unfortunately the list of requirements is so long that probably only a handful of people qualify. Read More ) and an AMLogic S905X System-on-Chip (SoC), a necessary component if you’re planning to watch 4K YouTube videos. It also comes with a Bluetooth voice-powered remote control (so you can use Google Voice to search your Kodi library), and it excels at benchmarking tests. WeTek Hub While the Android features are nice, as a pure Kodi player, WeTek does a great job. It offers Kodi’s dynamic refresh switching and HD deinterlacing. The WeTek device also comes out on top when assessing connectivity. It features 5 GHz band Wi-Fi support, GigaE video transfer, a serial cable port, and an IR extender cable. If You Want Pure Kodi… If you’re a seasoned desktop Kodi user, you might want to replicate the experience as closely as possible on your television. By choosing one of the following two devices, it’s feasible to have a set-top box that boots directly into the Kodi platform. It’ll feel exactly like using a cable or satellite box so you won’t have any menus or app screens to wade through. ODROID C2 Experts consider the ODROID-C2 to be the most powerful low-cost single board computer on the market. It has a quad-core AmLogic processor and Mali GPU so it can function in many ways. For example, you could set it up as a home automation hub Which Smart Hub for Home Automation Is Best for You? Which Smart Hub for Home Automation Is Best for You? For a while, people thought of the idea as nothing more than a gimmick, but recent product releases have shown that smart home automation is starting to live up to its promises. Read More , portable computer, or, in Kodi’s case, as a home theater. If you take this route, you need to install LibreELEC Kodi on the ODROID’s eMMC flash storage. Vero 4K The Vero can handle 4K playback, has HD audio, can connect to your other peripherals via both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and is one of the only ARM devices to provide 64-bit architecture What Is 64-bit Computing? What Is 64-bit Computing? The packaging of a computer or computer hardware is crowded with technical terms and badges. One of the more prominent ones is 64-bit. Read More . It also has 2 GB of RAM. If you buy a Vero, you need to run OSMC Kodi. If You Want Versatility… If you want a box that’s easy to set up and can do almost everything to a high standard, you need an Nvidia Shield. Nvidia Shield The Kodi community has considered the Nvidia Shield to be the king of Kodi boxes for a long time now. It can run both Android apps and the Kodi platform in a stable environment. Because it’s almost plug-and-play (you just need to install the SPMC fork from the Google Play Store), it’s perfect for people who don’t have high levels of tech literacy but still want to enjoy the benefits of Kodi. It also supports 4K videos on Netflix and Amazon Prime and offers video deinterlacing streaming from a PVR server. If Money Is No Object… Have you been a dedicated cord cutter for a number of years? If you’re supremely confident with using Kodi and know exactly how to get the most out of the app, you might want to spend more money on something with more power. If that’s the case you can’t go wrong with an Intel NUC. Intel I Series NUCs As the name suggests, Intel I Series NUCs are not a single product, but a whole range of products. The cost of units varies dramatically, as does each device’s capabilities. If you want to experience Kodi in all its glory, aim to buy a sixth-generation device with the Apollo Lake SoC processor or a seventh-gen Kaby Lake processor. The top-end seventh-gen model, the NUC7I7BNH, comes with an i7 processor, an Iris Plus 650 GPU, 32 GB of RAM, HDMI 2.0, and USB-C. Unfortunately, it will set you back over $400. If that’s too much money, check out the NUC6I3SYH. It’s only sixth-gen, but at $250 it’s almost half the price of its big brother. It’s got 8 GB of RAM, four USB 3.0 ports, and an HD Graphics 500 GPU. If You Want Kodi on Your Smart TV… If you own a smart TV running the Android TV operating system, you’re in luck, because Kodi is available from the Google Play Store (unlike on iOS store, which requires a workaround How to Install Kodi for iOS Without Jailbreaking Your iPad or iPhone How to Install Kodi for iOS Without Jailbreaking Your iPad or iPhone Kodi is one of the best ways to access live TV, and you don't need to jailbreak your device to enjoy free streaming content on your iPhone or iPad. Read More ). This means you can have it up and running in seconds. There are some caveats, however. Smart TVs are not as powerful as some of the dedicated boxes we have discussed elsewhere in this article, which means they fall short. Here’s where smart TVs come up short from a Kodi standpoint: Decoding — Most smart TVs have ARM cores. They’re weak and seriously limit what you can decode within the Kodi app. As such, you’ll be relying on formats Kodi can decode using the Android MediaCodec (AMC). The most common AMC formats are MPEG-2, MPEG-4 Part 2 ASP, H.264/AVC, and H.265/HEVC. Audio — TVs normally only have HDMI inputs and no outputs, therefore you will have to use HDMI-ARC audio formats. There will be no HD, Dolby Atmos, or DTS:X audio output. 4K Resolution — You can get Kodi to play 4K resolution videos 8 Eye-Popping Ultra HD Videos To Watch On Your New 4K TV [Stuff to Watch] 8 Eye-Popping Ultra HD Videos To Watch On Your New 4K TV [Stuff to Watch] We've trawled high and low and found some eye-popping 4K videos that take full advantage of the ridiculous number of pixels at your disposal, for free. Read More on your smart TV, but you’ll need to enable the MediaCodec Surface Video Acceleration Mode within the Kodi app. It’ll force the TV to render the video output rather than the Kodi software. This setting should also allow for HDR playback. Bottom Line — Will Kodi work on your Android-based smart TV? Yes. Will the user experience be as good as using a dedicated box? No. Which Kodi Box Are You Buying? There you have it: six boxes from six different manufacturers which excel in different areas. Of course, there are lots of other boxes you can choose from, so don’t feel limited by our recommendations. We’d love to hear your opinions about the ones we’ve covered, but also about the devices we haven’t mentioned. For example, are you a big fan of the MINIX U9 or the HiMedia Q5? Are you using a Chromebox or Chromebit Chromebook vs. Chromebox vs. Chromebit: Which Is Right For You? Chromebook vs. Chromebox vs. Chromebit: Which Is Right For You?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Augmented and Virtual Reality Tracking Technology from uSens Now Needs Only One Stereo Camera Module SAN JOSE, Calif., May 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — uSens, Inc., a pioneer in hand-and-head tracking technologies for Augmented and Virtual Reality, has developed the next-generation of technology for its uSens Fingo module that provides advanced 3D human-computer interaction capability on PC-based VR systems as well as mobile AR and VR platforms. At the Augmented World Expo (AWE) in Silicon Valley May 31-June 2, uSens will demonstrate its new combined inside-out 6DOF (degrees of freedom) head tracking and 26DOF hand-tracking technology. This is an industry-first achievement in that it uses only a single camera module with an embedded dual-lens (stereo) camera. Until now, making both inside-out 6DOF head tracking and 3D hand tracking a reality has required three or even four cameras: one depth-sensing camera or two IR cameras for hand tracking, and one or two mono cameras for head tracking. With uSens’ new technology (see video), only one stereo camera module is needed, reducing the system size, complexity, power consumption and, as a result, overall cost. The uSens Fingo module provides advanced 3D human-computer interaction capability on PC-based VR systems as well as mobile AR and VR platforms. „While VR and AR has exploded in the popular conscious in the last year, realistic tracking technology is still in its early stages of development. The proprietary algorithms in the next generation of our Fingo tracking module will enable this new, combined 6DOF head tracking plus 26DOF hand tracking technology,” said Dr. Yue Fei, chief technology officer and co-founder of uSens, „With only a single stereo camera module, our solution is far more compact and cost-effective for developers seeking to generate more realistic content with lifelike mobility.” With many fixed and mobile VR and AR platforms, a marker-based tracking system is used that requires markers be placed around a room in advance so the embedded system cameras can track 6DOF head positioning. Marker-less, inside-out head tracking is the opposite, allowing the system to track the user’s location within the space naturally, without requiring any advance setup. While there are currently Head Mounted Displays (HMDs) with built-in mobile 6DOF head tracking and hand tracking capability, such as Microsoft® HoloLens™ or Intel® Alloy™, these do not provide the accuracy or the flexibility of the uSens add-on module, which can be affixed to any headset, regardless of vendor. Controller-Free Tracking in AR and VR The debut uSens Fingo module currently available to developers is the first mobile ARVR 3D-stereo vision, hand-tracking device. With its mixture of revolutionary software and hardware, Fingo offers low latency, 26DOF and the tracking of 22 finger joints. The combination of these features allows users to interact with digital objects in augmented and virtual reality the same way they would in the real world. Simply by attaching a Fingo module to the front of a HMD device holder, end users can experience their favorite apps controller-free. Fingo supports mobile ARVR platforms including Samsung Gear VR™, Google Daydream™, and Google Cardboard™, in addition to any Android OS-powered glasses for augmented reality. Fingo also supports PC-tethered virtual reality systems such as Oculus Rift™ and HTC Vive™. Thanks to recent enhancements, Fingo even enables inside-out 6DOF head tracking with just a single stereo camera. uSens recently launched the uDev network portal to help the developer community integrate inside-out 26DOF hand tracking technology into their ARVR projects. Request a developer kit or order a Fingo, shipping now within the U.S. and China for only $99.

Banking off of the idea that in 2025 nearly 75 per cent of the workforce will be millennials, HP is adding another mobile notebook to its arsenal. The idea is that the younger generations are leaning more towards a tablet-feeling notebook in detachables than the more traditional-feeling of a convertible notebook. Falling in line with the Microsoft Surface Pros and Apple iPad Pros of the world, the HP Elite x2 1012 G2 isn’t too big of a change from the first generation G1. It is slightly thinner, with HP indicating that the G2 is now 40 millimeters thinner than the Surface Pro 4, and it weighs in at just under 2 pounds. Ultimately, what makes this device an upgrade is the power packed into it. The G2 starts with a 7th generation Intel i3 processor but can be upgraded to the i5 or i7 options. It can have up to 16 GB of RAM and up to 1 TB of SSD storage. Battery life wise, HP is claiming a little over 10 hours with fast charging capabilities that can charge half the battery in half an hour. The 12.3 inch display is, of course, detachable, and supported with Corning Gorilla Glass 4, similar to what you’d see in smartphones. I still wouldn’t recommend dropping the device however. It seems that HP isn’t ready to completely embrace the port-less future that Apple has in mind. The G2 has USB 3.0, USB-C 3.1, and microSD support. And the Palo Alto-based company is keeping the desktop experience in mind with numerous docking options that can be purchased alongside the device – the Elite 90W Thunderbolt 3 Docking Station, Elite USB-C Dock, and the USB-C Travel Hub. Additionally, the G2 has a 5 MP front-facing camera and 8 MP rear-facing camera, a significant jump from the G1’s 2 MP front and 5 MP rear cameras. According to HP, it is the first commercial detachable to pass Skype for Business certification with HP noise cancellation and audio boost for voice clarity in noisy environments. Like the recently announced fourth generation of ZBook mobile workstations, the G2 also comes equipped with numerous security features. This includes HP Sure Start Gen3, the company’s self-healing BIOS with encryption, authentication, malware protection, data protection, identity assurance, and threat detection and response. The HP x2 1012 G2 will be available this July in the U.S. for a starting price of $1,099 USD. A Canadian release date and price has yet to be announced.

Skip to content comics cosplay tv/film games Submit tip Contact CGC Insider Search for: Mafia III Is Coming To Mac Tomorrow, But There Are Some Serious Oversights On Those System Requirements Posted by Madeline Ricchiuto May 9, 2017 One Comment 2K Games and Aspyr are bringing Mafia III to Mac tomorrow. The announcement was made over on MacGamerHQ as an exclusive reveal. Mafia III will be available on Steam and the Mac App Store for $39.99. The Mafia III Digital Deluxe will be available on Steam for $59.99 and will contain additional, post-release downloadable content, including the Season Pass at additional savings. Also, the Family Kick Back Pack and the Faster, Baby! DLCs are included with the Digital Deluxe or Season Pass. They cost $4.99 and $14.99, respectively. The Judge, Jury and Executioner Weapon Pack will be available as a free purchase. No news was given on whether the Stones Unturned DLC will be included. The minimum system requirements are the following: Operating System: macOS 10.12.4 (Sierra) Processor: Intel Core i5 (4 cores) Processor Speed: 3.2 GHz Memory: 8 GB Hard Drive Space: 50 GB Video Card (AMD): Radeon R9 M290X VRAM: 2 GB Mafia III requires an AMD video card with at least 2GB of VRAM. Intel Graphics Cards are not supported, nor are NVIDIA Graphics Cards. This an example of a supported Mac:   You can find instructions on how to locate your system profile in this video from Aspyr. Also, if you’re wondering what can be expected when trying to play Mafia 3 on an unsupported Mac, Aspyr’s advice is the following: We do not recommend that you attempt to play Mafia III on any chipset other than AMD with at least 2GB of VRAM. Without meeting these requirements, users can expect sub-par framerates or severe game instability. Theses are the ONLY qualified Mac models: AMD Radeon Pro 450, 455, or 460 (late 2016 MBP) AMD Radeon R9 M370X (mid 2015 and 2016 MBP) AMD Radeon R9 M380, M390, M395, or M395X (late 2015 iMac) AMD Radeon R9 M290X or Radeon R9 M295X (late 2014 iMac) AMD FirePro D300, dual AMD FirePro D500, or dual AMD FirePro D700 (late 2013 MacPro) Thats… a number of specifications for a Mac port. The lack of NVIDIA support is also a shocker. NVIDIA is one of the leading graphics card manufacturers. That Mafia III only supports AMD models will absolutely frustrate the hell out of a lot of prospective Mac players. But if you do have one of the AMD models specified above, well, this is fantastic news. The Mac reveal trailer is below.   About the Author Latest Posts Contact About Madeline Ricchiuto Madeline Ricchiuto is a gamer, comics enthusiast, bad horror movie connoisseur, writer and generally sarcastic human.

Posted 09 May 2017 Jason Baker (Red Hat)Feed 7up Image by :  opensource.com In the early days of OpenStack, much of the media coverage seemed fixated on whether or not the project would be able to "win" the cloud computing marketplace, and which company would "win" OpenStack, as if the future of technology is a zero-sum game. The keynotes at this week's OpenStack Summit highlight just how narrow view this is. What has emerged isn't a need for a one-size-fits-all generic cloud, but instead, many competing needs across nearly every industry you can think of, for which cloud helps provide part of the answer. And OpenStack seems uniquely positioned to answer this call. OpenStack itself isn't a single solution, it's a collection of many related projects and tools that can be mixed and matched to build a cloud computing environment that can be tailored to just about any need. On Monday and Tuesday of this week, the keynotes from various OpenStack and industry leaders covered a variety of subjects, but the common theme that ran throughout is that OpenStack is doing things that perhaps we never imagined it would a few years ago, and working together better than ever. Reaching for new horizons One of the more exciting parts of the OpenStack Summit for me is hearing from the user community and learning how OpenStack is being used in new ways; one area is edge computing. Processing is going to have to take place at the network edge, with a new kind of cloud. The idea behind edge computing is simple: We are producing more data than ever before and we need the cloud to be sitting as close as possible to where that data originates. One slide from an Intel presentation highlighted just how much this might be: A smart hospital, 3 TB/day; a self-driving car, 4 TB/day; a connected plane, 5 TB/day. And all of these numbers are rising. A connected factory might produce a whole PB per day, and by 2020, there may be 1.5 GB of data trafficked per person, per day. Networks and central clouds simply can't scale to handle all of this data, so the processing is going to have to take place at the network edge, with a new kind of cloud. OpenStack and telecoms The classic users of this approach to cloud computing are telecoms. Both AT&T and Verizon spoke on Monday about how they are using OpenStack to build out their networks. AT&T showed off how they are using OpenStack to power their live TV services across multiple devices. Verizon showed off an OpenStack-in-a-box, not much bigger than a shoebox that can put compute, networking, and storage resources at the edge of their network to help power tomorrow's 5G services. OpenStack and robotics Daniela Rus of MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), which has been using OpenStack in production since 2012, presented on some of her research into several robotics topics. MIT researchers are considering ways to make the design, creation, and testing of robots easier and faster than ever. One example is the use of self-folding printed robots and how they might be applied to save lives as an alternative to surgery in some situations. A rapid proliferation of robots and sensors will require cloud nearby to process and perform analysis on the huge amount of data they will be collecting, simply because there will be too much data to move around. But not every workload in an organization's cloud needs to be limited to computing on the edge, or even that organization's own data center. One of the advantages that come with standardizing on an open source cloud platform with many different vendors providing services is that it's easy to scale out to other clouds as capacity, price, or other needs change. OpenStack and Kubernetes Following up on the interoperability demo at the last summit, we watched a database deployment using OpenStack and Kubernetes quickly scale from a single cloud demo to 15 clouds around the world, each run by a different provider, in a matter of minutes as operators added the application to their clouds in real-time on stage. A healthy ecosystem The other takeaway that was clear from this summit is that other cloud computing projects aren't so much competitors as they are parts of a larger, healthy ecosystem that exists to help OpenStack and related projects reach the broadest possible audience. What's perhaps the most fascinating is how well each part of the stack seems to work together now. The future is not going to be Kubernetes or OpenStack, containers or virtual machines, public cloud or private cloud. For most organizations operating computing infrastructure, the answer is going to be and, and, and. What may vary from company to company are the precise needs of their different cloud components, whether optimized for storage or compute power or graphics processing power; how each of these components will talk to one another; and for each area in their cloud, determining when it makes sense to keep the applications in-house and when it makes sense to move them to a public cloud. What's old is new again. The march towards cloud computing has certainly solved many problems of modern computing infrastructure, particularly around scale, but it doesn't absolve the need for IT teams to manage different parts of their infrastructure in ways that best meet the needs of their individual clients. This multi-cloud future is going to take some smart minds and great interoperability tools, but if what we've seen at the summit this week holds true, the OpenStack community is producing a lot of both.
