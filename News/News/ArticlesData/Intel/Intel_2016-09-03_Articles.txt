This is thanks to a growing number of micro PCs launching that are small enough to bolt onto the back of a PC display. Intel have long been strong proponents of the micro form factor PC with their Next Unit of Computing (NUC) micro PCs.  Uncluttered desks are always a good thing. If there is a downside, it is this. Most mini PCs lack the raw grunt to do anything beyond basic office productivity chores. Heavy duty tasks like multimedia editing or gaming were well out of bounds - At least until now. Now Intel are back. They’ve gone all out and beefed up the power of their latest NUC, the NUC6i7KYK (Kind of rolls off the tongue doesn’t it?). Question is, does it deliver? Look and Feel The NUC6i7KYK hasn’t inherited the looks of its earlier siblings. Where previous NUCs resembled an Apple TV with a steroid habit, the NUC6i7KYK is flatter and more squarish. These changes aren’t just skin deep. The NUC6i7KYK  comes apart, allowing you to add in your own RAM and storage. It isn’t much of a looker, but then it is designed to be hidden away.   Under the Hood Under its hood the hardware includes Intel’s latest quad-core i7 CPU. The usually anemic Intel integrated graphics got a serious dose of steroids. The result is a pint-sized widget that can handle compute and graphics intensive tasks.  Throwing a crucial 750GB SSD and DDR4/2133MHz memory helped the Nuc along. Boot up was almost instantaneous. With the addition of Steam, plus a few wireless game controllers, I had the makings of an invisible PC games console once it was plugged into my telly.  Performance doesn’t come cheap. This is reflected in the NUC6i7KYK’s steep RRP ($1,089). Add to that the cost of RAM, storage and an OS (unless of course you choose LINUX) and things soon add up. That said, you do get a surprising amount of compute in the NUC6i7KYK’s tiny footprint. Powering things is a 2.6GHz Core i7-6770HQ quad-core Skylake CPU. With turbo boost, it clocks in at a pleasing 3.5GHz, giving the NUC6i7KYK  more grunt than a bacon farm.  Also included is Intel’s Iris Pro Graphics 580 which has 128MB of eDRAM. It ran photoshop and even better still, a bunch of games with passable frame-rates. The NUC support SATA 6Gbps and can run two drives in RAID 0 or RAID 1. Tucked away in the NUCs Swiss watch-like interior is a Wireless card which supports 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2, and Wireless Display 6.0. Two RAM slots sockets take up to 32GB RAM.  The connectivity options are surprisingly plentiful for such a small box. There’s several USB 3.0 sockets plus a USB C port which also supports Thunderbolt 3 and 10Gbps USB 3.1. For extra storage Intel have added an SD card slot.  Networking options are also flexible thanks to the addition of a gigabit Ethernet port. Multimedia gets covered by a 3.5mm audio jack, SPDIF, mini DisplayPort, and 4k friendly HDMI 2.0 port.  In keeping with previous NUCs. Intel included an infrared receiver on the NUC6i7KYK's front. Pairing this with Kodi and a spare windows media centre remote worked, making my invisible PC games console into a solid yet invisible media centre too. Thunderbolt support allows the NUC to connect to an external and more powerful GPU. Trouble is there aren’t all that many thunderbolt external GPUs kicking around yet. So how good is the NUC6i7KYK’s integrated graphics for gaming? Compared to a dedicated system with a high end graphics card, the NUC6i7KYK was always going to under whelm. For those wanting a compact home theatre PC that’ll do a passable job playing games, the NUC6i7KYK didn’t perform too bad at all. Older, less demanding games such as Serious Sam, delivered a playable experience. More complex titles required graphics settings were dropped down a few notches. Tomb raider managed just a still playable 40fps with graphics set to high. This soared to just over 60fps when graphics were set to low. With previous NUCs gaming just wasn’t doable. There wasn’t enough CPU juice, nor was there enough GPU grunt. It is pretty impressive to see how far Intel’s integrated graphics have come. So if that’s the good, what’s the not-so-good? There isn’t a lot to fault with the NUC6i7KYK. As a media box its performance and compact form factor make it hard to beat.  While it works for gaming, detail settings often need to be tweaked downwards. For not much more money, some may find a bigger PC with a dedicated graphics card delivers more.  That said, as a photoshop or video editing machine, it is impressive. Being able to drop the NUC6i7KYK into a laptop bag without worrying about a hernia is pretty cool. The only real negative with the NUC6i7KYK is that its fan can get noisy when it operates under load. Verdict The NUC6i7KYK is Intel’s first stab at a performance NUC and showcases just how far they've come. Here's hoping that the NUC6i7KYK isn't a one-off. Either way, it’ll give competitors a wake up call to kick their own Micro PCs up a notch. Either way, it’s a definite win for end users.

The Burning Basis Vector Uncivilized Computer Graphics Musings GPU Ray Tracing The Wrong Way September 4, 2016 by Joshua Barczak If you’re familiar with my blog, you know I’ve lately taken a fancy to doing abominable things to my Intel GPU’s OpenGL driver. In my last post, I emphasized thread-level GPU programming, and showed that significant gains are possible. In this post, I’m going to look at what happens if I pretend that my Haswell GT2 GPU is really a 20-core CPU with 7-way hyperthreading, a big register file, and a really awesome SIMD instruction set, and then write ray-tracers with it. We will see that the “wrong” way is sometimes better than the obvious way. Experimental Setup The benchmark for this post will be constructing a photon map with 10M photons in a variation of the BART Kitchen scene. For simplicity’s sake, I use only diffuse surfaces. This generates a large number of extremely incoherent rays, and is a pretty nice worst-case scenario. The acceleration structure used for all experiments is a simple binary BVH. This is the same experiment I used a while back when did my AVX Optimized CPU tracer, so I’ll borrow that benchmark for the GPU tracer. The CPU version of this test can be found here. My test code can be found in my HAXWell github repo. All graphs show ray rates in KRays/s on an Intel Core i3-4010U, averaged over three runs. I only use one of my 2 cores for these tests but I’ve also included the extrapolated two-core results to give an idea of what the CPUs limits are. Disclaimer: I Can’t Feed The Beast I opted to implement this by treating the GPU as a raytracing co-processor. I have a CPU thread which generates a queue of rays and dispatches a compute job for every 4096 rays that are pushed onto the queue. After “priming” the queue with a large number of photon rays, the CPU thread starts reading rays back, and either generating secondary rays or starting new photon paths and pushing the new rays onto the queue. The idea is that we can hopefully pipeline this thing deep enough that the GPU and CPU can run in tandem. GPU does the raytracing, and CPU does shader evaluation and such like. This is an ideal design if we want to design a renderer that can support a plugin architecture, where arbitrary user code can feed rays to the raytracing core. Unfortunately, try though I might, I wasn’t able to achieve complete GPU utilization with this setup. No matter what method I use for the GPU trace, the GPU is finishing rays faster than I can launch new ones. The best I can do is roughly 60% GPU utilization. A GPUView run makes the situation quite obvious. I have little chunks of GPU work landing in the queue at regular intervals with bubbles in between. This is largely the result of using OpenGL as my backdoor API. Profiling shows that the bulk of my time is being spent in OpenGL calls. There are ways around this problem, and it probably wouldn’t be an issue if I could do this with OpenCL or Vulkan, but it’s too much hassle for me to figure out how to feed custom ISA to an entirely different API. As much as I’d like to be able to demonstrate a complete, scalable implementation, it’s going to have to wait. It’s a solvable problem but one I can’t solve at the moment. Instead, I’m simply going to measure the GPU duration of my ray tracing jobs and report which Kernel structure uses the GPU most efficiently, and what the theoretical ray rates are. Baseline To start with, we’ll look at doing this in GLSL, the way you might expect to. We’ll take a straightforward stack-based raytracer and shoot one ray per thread. We’ll use a thread-group size of 16 because allegedly what Intel’s ideal SIMD width is. The results are not great. Actually worse than what our CPU could do if I bothered to utilize the other cores. Here it is, compared to two different streaming CPU raytracers. Purple bars show what the blue bars would be if they scaled perfectly to both of my cores. As a quick test, let’s see what happens when we drop the thread group size in our GLSL shader from 16 down to 8. When we do this, we find that things go a little faster. According to my instruction issue tests, SIMD8 has roughly 50% less compute throughput than SIMD16, at least for the common dual-issuable floating point instructions. Yet we get a sizable performance gain. Why? There are two main factors. First, less rays per threadgroup means less rays in flight, which means there is more cache available to each ray. Second, SIMD8 instructions have lower latency, which means there is less of a relative performance loss when coherence goes to pot near the bottom of the BVH. In situations where lots of thread masking is expected, wider SIMD is a liability. Going Beyond SPMD Now lets look at other ways of doing this. In CPU raytracing, one of the classic techniques is “packet tracing” whereby a group of rays (4 or 8) is traversed through the scene along the same path. At each node, intersection tests are performed on the entire group simultaneously using vector instructions (SSE or AVX), and if any of the rays in the group wants to proceed further, the entire group is dragged along with it. The goal is to amortize the cost of stack manipulation and node access across multiple rays. The results are generally very good when rays are coherent, and terrible when they are not. So let’s start by implementing a simple 8-wide packet tracer using GEN assembly. It turns out that there are some really interesting tricks we can play here: The packet tracer differs from the GLSL tracer in a significant way. In the GLSL tracer, the SIMD lanes can take divergent paths through the tree. In the packet tracer, this does not happen. Because all the SIMD lanes in the packet tracer always take the same path, and because Intel gives each thread a full register set, we can afford to store our traversal stack entirely in registers and access it using register indirect addressing. This is considerably cheaper than using memory. But we can do something even more interesting than that: Normally the traversal stack contains pointers to the nodes that we need to visit. Each traversal step pushes the next two nodes onto a stack and the next loop iteration reads the top one. We have enough register space that instead of storing node addresses, we can just store whole nodes. So, instead of doing our loads at the start of traversal, we can do them at the end, which allows us to hide a bit more latency. Here is the skeleton of our raytracer, glossing over the details. The important instructions are written out in my HAXWell assembly syntax. All of my hand-written kernels follow this structure, differing only in the way the traversal and intersection tests are written. 
// load first node into working reg
send DwordLoad8(Nodes), node.u, node_address.u  
    
// begin traversal loop
traversal:

   // intersection test against node in working reg

   // if ray missed, goto pop_stack
    
   // if this is a leaf, goto visit_leaf
    
    // start reading near node into working register for next traversal step
    send DwordLoad8(Nodes), node.u, node_address.u 
    
    // start reading far node into stack head for some future traversal step
    // and increment stack pointer (stored in address register a0)
    send DwordLoad8(Nodes), Stack[a0.0].u, node_address.u 
    add(1) a0.us0, a0.us0, 32
    
    jmp traversal

visit_leaf:
   // intersection tests here.

pop_stack:

    // check if we've reached the bottom of the stack
    cmpeq(1) (f0.0) tmp0.u, a0.us0, 0

    // decrement stack ptr before the jump, 
    // if jump is taken we don't care about underflow
    add(1) a0.us0, a0.us0, -32      
    
    jmpif(f0.0) finished

    // copy next node from stack into working reg for traversal test
    mov(8) node.u, Stack[a0.0].u
    
    jmp traversal


finished:

    // Store hit info
end

 Each of our traversal steps, if it finds a hit, will read the next two nodes. The next node to be visited is fetched directly into the register that our intersection test reads it from. The other, we fetch into the next register on the traversal stack, using indirect addressing on the send instruction. Since the messages are asynchronous, the issuing of the second fetch is able to hide some of the latency of the first fetch. Because we adopt the standard trick of storing sibling nodes in the same cache line, there is (hopefully) no bandwidth penalty from the second fetch. In fact, it’s likely that we come out ahead in bandwidth since we don’t need to worry about the sibling node being evicted and re-fetched later. Let’s see how an 8-wide packet tracer does: Compared to GLSL, the results aren’t stellar. Part of the reason is that I couldn’t figure out a nice, cheap way to do ordered traversal for the packet tracer. Another reason is that, as I’ve said before, my GEN assembly code sucks, because I’m not as good at this as the compiler is. The raytracer is very heavy on flow control, and all of my ‘jmp’ macros expand into adds on the program counter, and this is probably the wrong way to do uniform control flow on GEN. Still, the fact that we’re at parity means that there’s probably more performance to be gained from thread-level programming if we had an actual compiler generating this code for us. And Now For Something Completely Different Now lets do something that everyone tells us not to. Instead of trying to use data-parallelism, let’s use instruction-level parallelism. We’ll trace one ray per hardware thread, and vectorize our intersection tests as best we can. We use the same stack and traversal strategy as before, but our ray-box test turns from this: 
    sub(8)  tmp0.f, node.f0<0,1,0>, ray_Ox.f
    sub(8)  tmp1.f, node.f4<0,1,0>, ray_Ox.f
    sub(8)  tmp2.f, node.f1<0,1,0>, ray_Oy.f
    sub(8)  tmp3.f, node.f5<0,1,0>, ray_Oy.f
    sub(8)  tmp4.f, node.f2<0,1,0>, ray_Oz.f
    sub(8)  tmp5.f, node.f6<0,1,0>, ray_Oz.f
    mul(16) tmp0.f, tmp0.f, ray_inv_Dx.f
    mul(16) tmp2.f, tmp2.f, ray_inv_Dy.f
    mul(16) tmp4.f, tmp4.f, ray_inv_Dz.f

    min(8) tmin_x.f, tmp0.f, tmp1.f
    max(8) tmax_x.f, tmp0.f, tmp1.f
    min(8) tmin_y.f, tmp2.f, tmp3.f
    max(8) tmax_y.f, tmp2.f, tmp3.f
    min(8) tmin_z.f, tmp4.f, tmp5.f
    max(8) tmax_z.f, tmp4.f, tmp5.f

    min(8) tmax.f, tmax_x.f, tmax_y.f
    max(8) tmin.f, tmin_x.f, tmin_y.f
    min(8) tmax.f, tmax.f, tmax_z.f
    max(8) tmin.f, tmin.f, tmin_z.f
    min(8) tmax.f, tmax.f, ray_tmax.f

    cmple(8) (f0.0) tmp0.f, tmin.f, tmax.f
    cmpge(8) (f0.1) tmp1.f, tmax.f, 0.0f
    and(8) tmp0.u, tmp0.u, tmp1.u
    cmpgt(8) (f0.0) null.u, tmp0.u, 0
    jmpif(!f0.0) pop_stack
 into this: 
    sub(8) tmp0.f, node.f,  ray_O.f 
    mul(8) tmp1.f, tmp0.f,  ray_invD.f 
    min(1) tmax.f, tmp1.f4, tmp1.f5
    max(1) tmin.f, tmp1.f0, tmp1.f1    
    min(1) tmax.f, tmax.f,  tmp1.f6
    max(1) tmin.f, tmin.f,  tmp1.f2
    min(1) tmax.f, tmax.f,  ray_data_rcp.f3
    cmpgt(1) (f0.0) tmp0.f, tmin.f, tmax.f
    cmplt(1) (f0.1) tmp1.f, tmax.f, 0
    jmpif(f0.0) pop_stack     
    jmpif(f0.1) pop_stack // if ray missed, goto pop_stack
 Our triangle intersection test also gets quite interesting, utilizing dot-product instructions and SIMD4x2 instructions with lane swizzling. On the face of it, this code sucks. Its ALU utilization is abysmal, and the number of instructions per ray is considerably higher. However, in return for poor utilization, we get lower latency, and it’s not going to lose anything near the bottom of the tree when ray divergence kicks in, because this simply doesn’t apply anymore. Let’s see how it does: Here is a strange result. Tracing one ray per Warp/Wave/Thread on a GPU is not sucking nearly as much as it’s supposed to. We can really start pulling ahead if we do the same thing, but vectorize 8 ray/triangle intersection tests instead of looping over individual ones. If we also tweak our SAH parameter a bit to bias towards a shallower tree, we end up with a marked improvement. We’re at 25% more perf than the GLSL tracer, and starting to show significant gains over a threaded CPU implementation. I gave up trying to do a 16x vectorization, because I’ve finally started running out of registers and I don’t feel like hand-allocating them. I also started to work on a qbvh version of this thing, but it’s getting to be a real pain in the neck to write all of this complicated code directly in assembly. Maybe I’ll pick this back up when I’m less burnt out, or maybe we’ll just have to wait until somebody builds me a compiler to see how much better we can get, but we are now ahead of the throughput we could expect from the CPU, and this with terrible hand-written assembly code. Remember, this is running on a low-end, low-voltage laptop chip. Our rays per watt number is probably looking really good. Closing Thoughts Warp level programming has the potential to be a useful GPU programming model. It warrants serious consideration. We can potentially do some very powerful things with it but we need better tools before we can make the attempt. As a thought experiment, consider the same kind of implementation on GCN. A small (~32 entry) traversal stack could fit into SGPRs, and be manipulated using the S_MOVREL instructions. 32 extra sGPRs might hurt occupancy a little bit but should be affordable. Single-ray intersection tests could be implemented on the vector units, albeit very inefficiently, but the utilization matters less here than the latency, and the node access is probably going to swamp everything anyways. Once a leaf is reached, intersection testing could be unrolled 64 times instead of 8 or 16. An unroll factor of 64 means shallower trees, meaning less performance lost on the inefficient traversal code. The idea is sound, and interesting, in light of the results I’m getting, might be worth trying. You cannot possibly get a GPU language compiler to generate this code for you, but the required hardware is all there. We just need the software to catch up. Maybe this will help. Posted in: Uncategorized 3 Comments Allan S MacKinnon September 6, 2016 at 5:10 pm Another great post on the idiosyncratic GEN architecture! Warp-centric programming is a great fit for GEN given its 7 isolated threads and register files per EU. But don’t forget that there are a couple architectural gotchas working against writing purely warp-centric code: 1. A shared memory allocation for a subslice work group must be at least 4KB and is increased in 1KB steps. You can still perform very warp-centric programming but you have to be a little creative in your workgroup sizing if you want to use all 64KB of local/shared memory across all 56 (Gen8+) subslice hardware threads. 2. There are only 16 hardware synchronization barriers per subslice. If your 8-lane warps are truly isolated then this won’t matter but if your SIMD8 warps are coordinating then this is something to be aware of. Semi-related: note that Intel just released an OpenCL extension that will force a kernel to be compiled to a desired warp “width” (8/16/32). This makes it possible to reason about how a CTA will map onto a subslice. Knowing the kernel’s SIMD with also makes it easier to reason about the shuffle extensions. Bram September 4, 2016 at 6:37 pm I always thought that single-ray-multiple triangles would be the way to go. Thus 1 ray vs 8 triangles on AVX2. And if you have a low-poly world, heck, just blast all triangles, so you have no spatial indexing that is a drag to build an update all the time. No problem with diverging paths. I’ve done some experiments with single-ray-vs-8-voxels too, to photon map a voxel world. I tried GLSL, OpenCL and AVX2 with this: http://thelittleengineerthatcould.blogspot.ca/2015/01/rocket-engine-illumination.html Rob Wentworth (geekmaster) September 4, 2016 at 4:23 pm This is really thought-provoking. I love bending hardware in ways its designers never envisioned, so this fascinates me. I am curious how I can apply these methods to AI algorithms, and though I have countless hours of ASM programming experience, a C compiler would be appreciated to help postpone the burnout you mentioned. Thanks for sharing, and now I must check out your other posts as well for more thought-gems like this. Comments are closed.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 2, 2016 at 9:23PM Image source: Intel.  Last year, I spotted an interesting job listing on microprocessor giant Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) job boards. The listing talked about how the company was looking for a processor designer to work in the company's relatively new Microarchitecture Research Lab located in Bangalore, India. This processor designer's job would be to join a team of engineers to "spearhead the research and advanced development" of both processor cores and graphics processors intended to arrive in the "2020 and beyond timeframe." These designs, per the listing, were intended to be manufactured in Intel's "futuristic" 7-nanometer manufacturing technology, signaling that Intel planned a significant advancement with this technology. Interestingly enough, Intel has posted an updated version of this job listing that might offer some clues into the company's future technology introduction plans. 2020 becomes 2022? Here's the relevant quote from the updated job listing (emphasis mine): The India Lab specifically, in collaboration with MRL-US and Intel product architecture teams worldwide, will spearhead the research and advanced development of Microprocessor Cores in the 2022 and beyond timeframe. By conceiving of and prototyping radical approaches, the Lab will aim to deliver much greater CPU power and area efficiency while still delivering industry-leading performance. The microarchitecture and design of these advanced CPUs will be aggressively co-optimized with Intel's sub-10nm technology nodes deep into the next decade. It would appear that Intel's new launch time frame for these new processor cores has been pushed out by a couple of years, from 2020 to 2022. Although it may be the case that Intel is now targeting, perhaps, the 5-nanometer manufacturing technology with these cores, rather than the 7-nanometer technology as explicitly mentioned in the original version of this listing, I don't think Intel would have said "sub-10nm technology nodes" if that's what it meant; it would have said "sub-7nm technology nodes." Expect the first 7-nanometer products in 2021 I suspect what's going on here is that Intel had originally planned to release products manufactured on its 7-nanometer technology in the 2020 time frame, but for whatever reason the company has delayed that until 2022. If we consider what Intel has publicly said about its manufacturing plans, this actually makes a lot of sense. Intel is expected to go into manufacturing on its first 10-nanometer products during the second half of 2017. For simplicity, let's assume that volume availability of 10-nanometer product doesn't happen until January 2018. Intel has said that it plans three waves of 10-nanometer technology: 10-nanometer, 10-nanometer+, and 10-nanometer++. If Intel keeps to an annual product launch cadence, then we should see volume availability of the first 10-nanometer+ products in January 2019, and the first 10-nanometer++ products in January 2020. Based on this cadence, which is admittedly probably on the pessimistic side, the first products based on 7-nanometer would be expected to launch in January 2021 -- a bit earlier than the 2022 time frame given in the job listing. What Intel could be planning, then, is to introduce substantially enhanced chip designs a year after the first 7-nanometer products, which could very well be modest updates to the final 10-nanometer++ products. In fact, Intel's product cadence is now referred to as "Process, Architecture, Optimization," so fundamentally new architecture products on 7-nanometer could, indeed, arrive in January 2022.  What does this mean for Intel? It's unfortunate that Intel seems unable to get back to releasing significantly new manufacturing technologies every two years. However, because the company now plans to make annual performance improvements to each new technology over a period of three years, Intel should still be able to deliver improved and competitive products to the marketplace -- which is what ultimately matters.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Sep 3, 2016 at 11:29AM Image source: Getty Images. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) built their businesses around the PC. Intel, the dominant supplier of x86 CPUs, has felt the sluggish demand for PCs. It produced a lower net income in 2015 than it did in 2010, driven by slumping PC sales and the failed attempts to break into the mobile market. NVIDIA, on the other hand, has benefited from a resilient gaming PC market. Sales of its graphics processors, particularly high-end models, have surged in recent years, driving the company's revenue to record levels. Both have been diversifying away from PCs, with Intel putting a heavy focus on data center products and NVIDIA growing its enterprise and automotive businesses. The two companies are clashing in the accelerator market, where NVIDIA's dominant Tesla GPUs are being challenged by Intel's 72-core Knights Landing chips. Intel is aiming to increase the quantity and variety of chips it sells into the enterprise, putting NVIDIA in its crosshairs. With the heyday of the PC long gone, Intel and NVIDIA will likely look very different 10 years from now. With that in mind, one question remains: Which stock is the better buy? The case for Intel Image source: Intel. Despite a weak PC market, Intel remains a wildly profitable company. Its growth engine in recent years has been in its data center segment, where its server CPUs enjoy a near-monopoly. That may not be the case forever: Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), International Business Machines, and ARM Holdings are all attempting to chip away at Intel's server dominance. But for the time being, Intel remains the king. The data center segment now generates almost as much operating income as the client computing segment, which includes chips that go into PCs and mobile devices. The company's recently updated five-part strategy reflects this shift. The first priority for Intel is the cloud and the data center, with connected devices coming second. Intel still enjoys a major advantage in the PC CPU market, as one of just two companies that sell x86 PC CPUs. AMD, which hopes to win back market share from Intel next year with its upcoming Zen CPUs, is the other. Historically, AMD has never been able to remain competitive for all that long. The last time AMD was a major force in the PC CPU market was about a decade ago. Analysts are expecting Intel to produce $2.50 per share in adjusted earnings this year, putting the P/E ratio at about 14. The company will face many challenges over the next few years as it deals with more competition in its core markets and that could derail earnings growth. But for those who believe Intel can successfully navigate through this post-PC era, the stock trades at a fair price. The case for NVIDIA Image source: NVIDIA. Shares of NVIDIA have exploded over the past year, soaring 170%. Over the past five years, the stock is up more than 360%. There have been multiple factors driving these impressive gains. The company's core PC graphics card business has been booming, with sales of its higher-end cards driving record revenue. NVIDIA's unit share of the discrete graphics card market increased from around 60% in 2014 to 80% in 2015, leaving AMD with the scraps. Beyond PC graphics cards, NVIDIA has been growing two other businesses. In the enterprise, the company's Tesla GPUs are increasingly being used for machine learning and artificial intelligence tasks, with the largest cloud computing companies buying the cards by the thousands. In the automotive market, NVIDIA's DRIVE platforms are being adopted to both power in-vehicle displays and aid with the development of autonomous vehicles. NVIDIA's chips are already in a variety of models, including the Tesla Model S. In all of these markets, NVIDIA will be facing plenty of competition. In the graphics card market, AMD recently launched the first of its Polaris graphics cards in an effort to win back market share from NVIDIA. In the enterprise, Intel is gunning for NVIDIA with its Knights Landing chip. And in the automotive market, there's no shortage of companies aiming to stake a claim in the self-driving car of the future. Its stock has surged because investors expect NVIDIA to be able to grow swiftly in the coming years. But with shares now trading for 40 times trailing-12-month earnings, the company's falling short of expectations could send shares tumbling. The verdict While NVIDIA appears to have superior growth prospects, in part because it's so much smaller than Intel, the lofty valuation makes it difficult to recommend. For that reason, Intel looks like the better buy. A lot of things will need to go right for NVIDIA in the coming years for the stock to grow into its valuation, and I suspect that the market has gotten a little too optimistic. Intel also has the benefit of a far superior dividend, with the stock yielding nearly 3% compared to just 0.75% for NVIDIA. Intel is facing many challenges, and its extraordinary dominance of the server CPU market may not last. But despite these issues, the stock looks more attractive than NVIDIA's.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Analyst suggests Wintel will energize the VR market 0 by Surur  @mspoweruser Sep 3, 2016 at 21:33 GMT4 months ago Writing on Venturebeat, analyst Jack Gold of  IT analyst company J.Gold Associates predicted that the marriage of Microsoft and Intel’s mixed reality efforts will bring VR to mainstream acceptance and lead to the creating of a large VR ecosystem as early as next year. Gold was referring to Intel’s recent announcement of Project Alloy, their reference design for a VR headset which uses their RealSense 3D sensors and Intel Core  processors to create a high performance VR system, and Microsoft’s support for the venture with the folding in of Windows Holographic, the platform for the HoloLens, into all versions of Windows 10. Announced by Intel’s CEO Brian Krzanich  at Intel Developer’s Forum in San Francisco, Gold expected the reference design will see 10-15 designs of Project Alloy derived VR devices in market within the next year and competing platforms ultimately being sidelined. He noted the advantages of the Microsoft/Intel platform was that standards bring increased investment and deployment which will ultimately make products available to users at lower cost and with better features/functions while creating a critical mass around which a full ecosystem can ultimately explode. He also expected it will expand the market beyond gaming to include a myriad of business-oriented and consumer-friendly solutions. He writes: I expect this announcement will energize the world of VR over the next 2-3 years and create a burgeoning marketplace. This will force early device makers (e.g., Oculus, Epson) to pivot over the next 1-2 years, as proprietary designs will capture a limited market relegated to specialty solutions. If the platform achieved the adoption he predicts he expects an aggressive growth spurt building out a hardware/software ecosystem that will make VR affordable and achieve mass market penetrations, both for consumer and business users. 25 years ago Microsoft and Intel together tamed the wild PC market, but while Gold’s analysis is compelling, and Microsoft and Intel are both well resourced, the two companies have never faced competitors as rich and persistent as Google and Facebook, who both already have their own VR platforms, and Apple, who is believed to be working on one. It is not clear if merely having a free, open and stable ecosystem will be enough to succeed. Do our readers think Wintel can do it again? Let us know below.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Sony Ultra 4K streaming service comes to Intel 7th Gen Core PCs Adam Westlake - Sep 3, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit While 4K televisions are finally starting to come down in price, the availability of 4K video content to watch on them is still slim. To help push the sales of its own 4K TVs, earlier this year Sony announced its own 4K streaming video service dubbed Ultra. Now the company wants to make the Ultra service available on PCs, and has teamed up with Intel to launch it in January. The only catch? Users must be running Intel’s new 7th Gen Core processor. Announced earlier this week, the 7th Gen Core processor, also known as “Kaby Lake,” was designed by Intel to handle the latest high-def gaming and media content available now and in the near future, including VR, 360-degree video, and 4K streaming. The 7th Gen Core processor is expected to be available in over 100 different devices before the end of the year. When Sony’s Ultra service launches on PCs in January, it will offer the existing option of buying new releases for $30 (older films are $26), but also new options like 48-hour rentals for $8 and free 10-minute previews. The reason for Sony teaming up with Intel is likely because of the 7th Gen Core’s support for the latest forms of DRM, the main concern film studios have when allowing their movies to be streamed to PCs. While 4K content is available now, copy protection technology means it’s a crapshoot if users can get it to play on their PC.

News and Press Release Distribution, Since 1995 Deliver Your News to the World Sign In Create a Free Account Home News How We Work Compare Services FAQ All WebPost WebPost PPC WebRelease Targeted Media Wire Service Intel Receives Drone Waiver from the FAA WEBWIRE – Saturday, September 3, 2016   Intel received from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAPP) the Part 107 Certificate of Waiver, which posted today on the FAAs website. The waiver is from regulations regarding daylight operation and the operation of multiple small unmanned aircraft. Intel is authorized to operate multiple small unmanned aircraft systems at night within Special Security Notice Flight Restriction Areas in the United States. This waiver is in addition  to the Section 333 Exemption that Intel received to fly multiple aircraft in the United States earlier this year for its Drone 100 light show. This FAA waiver allows  Intel in the U.S. to innovate beyond Drone 100 to 100s and even 1000s of drones in the future. Drone 100 is a light show that demonstrates how Intel pushes the boundaries of what is possible and shows people an exciting new way to experience the wonders of drone technology. Intel has showcased Drone 100 globally  receiving the Guinness World Record for this innovative breakthrough. Intel has performed private shows with 100 drones flying at night in Germany and at twilight in Palm Springs, California. Intel debuted the first public showcase of Drone 100 in Sydney on five consecutive nights where the drones took off from two barges in Farm Cove, witnessed by more than 100,000 spectators. Intel looks forward to showcasing this technology and related light shows in the United States  expanding the technology and the number of drones in the light show. In addition to showcasing creative expression, Drone 100 highlights the exciting future of UAVs, including the different ways to integrate them into different industries.

Chipzilla has obtained a waiver from the US aviation regulator that will let it fly the massive drone show on American soil without the need for further clearance or special permission. That waiver, based on the FAA's Rule 107, allows Intel to perform the demonstration of 100 drones, each controlled by the same operator, lining up with light boards to display its iconic logo. The Drone 100 shows have been conducted by Intel on several occasions around the world, including a show earlier this year over Sydney Harbour depicted in the video below. Though the Rule 107 process has been seen as a more efficient way for smaller companies to make use of drones in their business activities, in Intel's case the rule is also allowing the multi-billion dollar company to expand its large-scale drone operations. Youtube Video Natalie Cheung, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) product manager for Intel's perceptual computing group, told The Register that the Rule 107 waiver replaces an old process that Intel (and other businesses) had to undergo in order to get Section 333 exemptions signed off by the FAA before flying drones commercially. On August 29, the FAA sought to largely eliminate the need for those exemptions when it implemented Rule 107, a set of guidelines that allows companies to obtain a one-time license to fly small drones commercially. Intel's waiver goes a step further and allows the company to also fly its drones after dark and pair multiple craft with a single operator, things not normally allowed under Rule 107. This, in turn, allows the Drone 100 shows to take place in the US at special events without having to go through as many hoops. Granted, Intel had a significant leg-up on getting the waiver; it had previously worked with the FAA under the old Section 333 process, and Intel CEO Brian Krzanich personally chaired an FAA small drone advisory committee. "It was easy to work with the FAA, we used a lot of what we had with our Section 333 waiver," Cheung said. "There were not any questions about the use case, because this was something they had seen before." While letting Chipzilla run light shows with a hundred drones is all well and good, the Section 107 waiver could also help to push the development of technologies that would have a more immediate real-world impact. In the long term, Cheung said that the hardware and software Intel is developing to control 100 drones at once, and the work it did with the FAA to get the process green-lighted, could be used by companies to operate "fleets" of drones to perform tasks such as surveying an area through a single point of control. "I see there is a huge potential for this technology," she said. "Having a fleet versus just one drone can make operations more efficient and faster." ® Sponsored: DevOps and continuous delivery Tips and corrections 18 Comments More from The Register Microsoft, IBM, Intel refuse to hand over family jewels to China US giants balk at demands to reveal source code, schematics 52 Comments FAA powers up an invisible hand, groping the skies for rule-busting biz drones Top tip: Keep flying cams away from Robert Duvall's house 20 Comments FAA doubles Section 333-exemption drone ceiling to 400 feet Commercial operators also get shiny new registration Website 13 Comments FAA rules out fast-tracking drone regulations No Jeff, Amazon won't get its own drone airspace just yet 6 Comments Heathrow airport and stock exchange throw mystery BSODs BSOD WATCH Bonus: even more Acorn on show 25 Comments FAA to test Brit drone-busting kit Jamming tech will 'detect, track, disrupt and defeat' flying menaces 31 Comments Whitepapers Overcoming the Obstacles to the All Flash Datacenter The top 6 challenges that can slow your adoption of all flash technology, and show you how to overcome them.

Microsoft Unveils the World’s First Windows 10 and Intel Joule Powered Robot GO Intel Joule support is being added in Windows 10 IoT Core AU Sep 3, 2016 08:05 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Microsoft is working hard to improve Windows 10 IoT Core, and the Anniversary Edition is bringing support for Intel Joule, the development board that’s often described as the most powerful and innovative to date. And because Microsoft just couldn’t stay away from the Intel Joule, the Windows Insider Program will be updated in September with a new Windows 10 IoT Core build that will include support for this computer platform. The software giant is super excited to see Intel Joule being added to Windows 10 IoT Core’s supported platforms list, and to better emphasize the opportunity that developers are getting with this update, the company is unveiling Bamboo, the world’s first robot powered by Windows 10 and Intel Joule. World, meet Bamboo! Bamboo runs on the Intel Joule and uses Microsoft Azure and Cognitive Services to provide sentiment analysis and translation, which makes it possible to speak to the robot in absolutely any language on Twitter and then have it translate the text into native English. And what’s more, the robot can understand your mood, Microsoft says, and react accordingly. And it doesn’t stop here. The robot can “move around and build and understanding of the environment” with an interconnected system made of Intel Joule and Intel RealSense cameras, while all the movements are possible thanks to the EZ-Robot EZ-B control system. “Using the EZ-Builder software for Windows and a newly released EZ-Robot UWP library, you can design and animate your robots on a Windows PC, as well as auto-generate and export UWP control code to run on the EZ-B V5. We used this functionality to animate Bamboo. The bring up and integration of the EZ-B v5 took just under 6 weeks,” Microsoft explains. Microsoft demonstrated the new robot at the Intel Developer Forum 2016 in San Francisco, and the company says that anyone can bring their ideas to reality with the Intel Joule and the future update to Windows 10 IoT Core coming in September. #Microsoft#Windows 10#Windows 10 IoT Core#Intel Joule subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Next Windows 10 RS2 Build with Wi-Fi Bug Fix to Launch “In the Next Few Days” Microsoft Makes Subtle Changes to Windows 10 Mobile Hardware Requirements Windows 10 Wins Gamers, Gets Closer to 50 Percent Share on Steam New Browser with Ad Blocking Launches on Windows Phones New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"    This is Bamboo, Microsoft's first Windows 10 IoT Core and Intel Joule robot New Apps Babylon: Get one-click translation in any desktop application and term search results within an extensive collection of dictionaries and glossaries Chameleon Startup Manager Lite: Software utility which enables you to edit and manage the processes running on your computer, with support for multiple languages Chameleon Startup Manager Pro: A startup management tool that enables you to quickly remove unneeded startup items and monitors the system for new apps set to launch with Windows Portable CDBurnerXP: CD/DVD and Blu-ray burning software solution that can be launched directly from a removable drive, without requiring prior installation Collectorz.com Movie Collector: A fully-featured application that helps users create a movie database, group movies into folders, perform searches, and catalogue DVDs by their barcode ReaConverter Lite: Batch convert image files, add watermarks, edit photos and save them to a selected output format with this intuitive application GPU-Z Portable: A reliable and useful software solution that comes in handy to all those who want to keep an eye on the data regarding their video and graphics cards Reader comments Lynda.com Hacked, 55,000 Passwords Reset more on: Lynda.com i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 2, 2016 at 9:23PM Image source: Intel.  Last year, I spotted an interesting job listing on microprocessor giant Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) job boards. The listing talked about how the company was looking for a processor designer to work in the company's relatively new Microarchitecture Research Lab located in Bangalore, India. This processor designer's job would be to join a team of engineers to "spearhead the research and advanced development" of both processor cores and graphics processors intended to arrive in the "2020 and beyond timeframe." These designs, per the listing, were intended to be manufactured in Intel's "futuristic" 7-nanometer manufacturing technology, signaling that Intel planned a significant advancement with this technology. Interestingly enough, Intel has posted an updated version of this job listing that might offer some clues into the company's future technology introduction plans. 2020 becomes 2022? Here's the relevant quote from the updated job listing (emphasis mine): The India Lab specifically, in collaboration with MRL-US and Intel product architecture teams worldwide, will spearhead the research and advanced development of Microprocessor Cores in the 2022 and beyond timeframe. By conceiving of and prototyping radical approaches, the Lab will aim to deliver much greater CPU power and area efficiency while still delivering industry-leading performance. The microarchitecture and design of these advanced CPUs will be aggressively co-optimized with Intel's sub-10nm technology nodes deep into the next decade. It would appear that Intel's new launch time frame for these new processor cores has been pushed out by a couple of years, from 2020 to 2022. Although it may be the case that Intel is now targeting, perhaps, the 5-nanometer manufacturing technology with these cores, rather than the 7-nanometer technology as explicitly mentioned in the original version of this listing, I don't think Intel would have said "sub-10nm technology nodes" if that's what it meant; it would have said "sub-7nm technology nodes." Expect the first 7-nanometer products in 2021 I suspect what's going on here is that Intel had originally planned to release products manufactured on its 7-nanometer technology in the 2020 time frame, but for whatever reason the company has delayed that until 2022. If we consider what Intel has publicly said about its manufacturing plans, this actually makes a lot of sense. Intel is expected to go into manufacturing on its first 10-nanometer products during the second half of 2017. For simplicity, let's assume that volume availability of 10-nanometer product doesn't happen until January 2018. Intel has said that it plans three waves of 10-nanometer technology: 10-nanometer, 10-nanometer+, and 10-nanometer++. If Intel keeps to an annual product launch cadence, then we should see volume availability of the first 10-nanometer+ products in January 2019, and the first 10-nanometer++ products in January 2020. Based on this cadence, which is admittedly probably on the pessimistic side, the first products based on 7-nanometer would be expected to launch in January 2021 -- a bit earlier than the 2022 time frame given in the job listing. What Intel could be planning, then, is to introduce substantially enhanced chip designs a year after the first 7-nanometer products, which could very well be modest updates to the final 10-nanometer++ products. In fact, Intel's product cadence is now referred to as "Process, Architecture, Optimization," so fundamentally new architecture products on 7-nanometer could, indeed, arrive in January 2022.  What does this mean for Intel? It's unfortunate that Intel seems unable to get back to releasing significantly new manufacturing technologies every two years. However, because the company now plans to make annual performance improvements to each new technology over a period of three years, Intel should still be able to deliver improved and competitive products to the marketplace -- which is what ultimately matters.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

By Eileen Yu for By The Way | September 3, 2016 -- 01:18 GMT (18:18 PDT) | Topic: Cloud SHANGHAI, CHINA--Networks will need to keep pace with increasingly connected societies and the need for deeper insights to improve service delivery and support digital transformation. With the Internet of Things (IoT) era beckoning, everything soon would be connected and data-driven and customers would no longer look to simply buy a platform or individual parts, said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, during his keynote at Huawei Connect 2016 held here this week. They would be looking for an experience and no activity would occur in isolation, he said. Latest news on Asia Singapore to record iris scans of citizens Qualcomm fined $865m by South Korean antitrust regulator Robotics itching for disruption in APAC startup scene next year Singapore firms still resisting need for transformation SK Telecom, Ericsson, Qualcomm to conduct joint 5G NR trial Intel describes the phenomenon as a virtuous cycle, in which all things that are connected including wearable devices, autonomous vehicles, and M2M systems will require connectivity to send data through to the cloud to be analysed and push back down the analytics so experiences can be changed. Supporting this continuous feedback loop also would require collaboration between multiple companies, since no one organisation would be capable of producing all the ingredients needed, Krzanich said. He further stressed the need for infrastructures that were able to cope with the large volumes of data and network traffic generated today. The average person currently produced between 600MB and 700MB of personal data a day, he noted, and this was expected to climb to 1.5GB by 2020. By then, autonomous cars were projected to generate as much data as 3,000 people combined. "That's a lot of data and a huge network load, but also represents huge opportunities to optimise [network performance] and create value," he said. It underscored the importance of 5G networks, which Intel believed would be critical to support this emerging environment. These networks would need to be flexible and able to deliver the highest possible throughput, he noted, pointing to the reason the chipmaker was working with Huawei on 5G initiatives. Cloud infrastructure also would need to be flexible so they could adapt to data flow between various workloads, he added. Krzanich said: "In our increasingly smart and connected world, we need fast, intelligent, and efficient wireless networks, cloud technologies, and analytics capabilities to create amazing new experiences in our everyday lives." During a media briefing, ZDNet asked about the potential of building more intelligence into device chipsets so smartphones, for instance, would be able to handle data analytics and relieve some workload from the core network. In response, Huawei's rotating CEO Guo Ping said it was essential to build up computing capabilities not only in the device, but also in the network and cloud. He added that the Chinese company's main strategy also revolved around these three components, which it believed were critical in supporting intelligent societies. In his keynote, Guo also highlighted the importance of industry collaboration--a point that was frequently touted by other Huawei executives during the conference. He said the company believed that, in the cloud era, building a bigger pie was more important than fighting for a bigger piece of a shrinking pie. It also adhered to the philosophy that managing cooperation was more important than managing the competition, he added, noting that the former proved more challenging since it meant all parties involved would need to work together to deliver better services for customers. In addition, Huawei believed sharing benefits with others would be important to drive the evolution of the cloud ecosystem, he said. According to the company's president of products and solutions, Ryan Ding, Huawei also had been boosting its support for developers to encourage more to build applications and services on its platforms. Last year, it announced plans to invest US$1 billion over five years to galvanise 1 million developers on its platform by 2020. Since then, US$200 million had gone towards developing an "open enablement platform" and improving developer experience, while US$100 million was used to create a global marketing platform to help developers tap new business opportunities, Ding said. There are currently more than 25,000 developers registered to build on Huawei platforms, he said, adding that this community has developed more than 800 applications, to date. Based in Singapore, Eileen Yu reported for ZDNet from Huawei Connect 2016 in Shanghai, China, on the invitation of Huawei.

Intel bought McAfee in 2010 and eventually renamed it “Intel Security.” McAfee has since joined digital gaming company MGT Capital Investments Inc as chairman and chief executive, with plans to rename the company “John McAfee Global Technologies Inc” McAfee says Intel warned him that any use of his name will infringe on the company’s trademarks that it acquired with the McAfee deal in 2010, according to his complaint filed yesterday in Manhattan federal court. An Intel spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a message seeking comment on the suit. Private equity firm TPG is among potential bidders for Intel’s McAfee unit and has held preliminary discussions with Intel about a deal that could value McAfee at as much as US$3 billion (RM12.2 billion), according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named because the process is private. Intel is also talking to other potential bidders, including buyout firms and corporate suitors, they said. Intel is considering offloading the antivirus software unit as part of a strategy to focus on its more profitable data-centre business. The Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker acquired McAfee in 2011 for US$7.7 billion to build security features directly into its silicon products. McAfee, 70, announced a run late last year as a presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party, campaigning on a privacy-focused platform that includes pushing for the government to create a cybersecurity defence strategy. The party’s nomination was won by former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson. McAfee is also a founder of Future Tense Secure Systems Inc, a security and privacy company that provides apps including D-Vasive, according to its website. MGT Capital has a consulting agreement with the company, also known as Future Tense Central, according to a May statement. In 2012, while living in Belize, McAfee had run-ins with local police for alleged unlicenced drug manufacturing and weapons possession but was released without charge. Later, Belize police started a search for him as a person of interest in connection with the murder of his neighbour. McAfee moved to Guatemala, where he was detained and released before eventually returning to the US McAfee said he was innocent. The case is McAfee v.

With IFA 2016 in full swing, you’d think that Razer wouldn’t have much new to showcase but that’s not the case. The gaming accessory specialist somehow found time to inject its notebooks with Kaby Lake and Pascal hardware, introduce a new ManO’War headset and open pre-orders for its Stargazer webcam. For its next act, Razer has partnered with boutique PC builder Maingear to create a new line of desktop PCs with a focus on both performance and aesthetics. The Maingear R1 Razer Edition, which starts at $999, includes an Asus H110M-A motherboard, Intel’s Core i5-6500 CPU with a retail cooler, 8GB of HyperX Fury DDR4 RAM (2x4GB), an Nvidia GTX 1060 GPU, a 500W EVGA PSU and a 1TB Seagate hard drive running Windows 10 Home, all stuffed in an NZXT H440 chassis with Razer’s own design aesthetics. It’s on the high-end that things really take shape. At a base price of $4,099, you’ll get the same NZXT chassis loaded with a MSI X99A Raider board, Intel’s Core i7-6800K cooled by Maingear’s Epic 640 custom liquid cooler with clear coolant, 16GB of HyperX Fury DDR4 memory, an Nvidia GTX 1070 graphics card, a 750W PSU from EVGA and a 1TB Seagate hard drive running Windows 10 Home. If money is no object, you can craft a beast of a system with the looks to back it up. Using Maingear’s system configuration tool, I put together a monster consisting of an Asus Strix X99 motherboard, Intel’s Core i7-6950X processor, the Epic 640 liquid cooling kit with UV-colored coolant, metal hardline tubing with chrome fittings, phase change TIM, the company’s Redline overclocking service, 64GB of HyperX Savage DDR4 RAM, dual liquid-cooled Nvidia Titan X graphics cards, a 1,200W Corsair Processional Digital Series AX1200i power supply with custom sleeving, a Samsung 512GB 950 Pro SSD as the primary drive and two Samsung 850 EVO 2TB drives in RAID 0, an Asus Blu-ray drive and Asus’ Xonar Essence audio card, all running Windows 10 Professional. The total cost? A wallet-shattering $12,890. The cost could be driven up even higher if you opt for Razer input accessories, a gaming-ready display and an extended warranty but I left those out and focused strictly on the system itself. At nearly $13K, a top-end Maingear R1 Razer Edition is well beyond the realm of reason for all but the elite one percent but if you do have the money to spare, you’ll get a drool-worthy system that’ll annihilate anything you throw at it for years to come. The Maingear R1 Razer Edition is available to order as of writing. Ship dates will vary depending on what options you select although the longest wait I saw when tinkering around was just under a month.

Computers with 7G chips should be in the stores in September with availability increasing towards the end of the year. He added, "When we started out on the project, we were only thinking about basic improvements from the previous generation. But we began looking at things differently with a lot of innovation and determination and we achieved major improvements. We are talking about amazing technologies, technologies of 14 nanometers, which is like taking a hair and dividing it by 8,000.”The Israeli team has done it again and accomplished achievements that we did not see in the Olympics - a year-on-year improvement of above 10%.

Is it faster than a Titan X desktop? By Richard Leadbetter Published 04/09/2016 Asus reckons that the ROG GX800VH could well be the most powerful consumer-level laptop in the world - and I it may well be right. The spec on this gaming laptop monster borders on the insane. An overclockable mobile Intel i7 K chip is paired with twin GTX 1080s in SLI, which works in combination with an 18.4-inch 60Hz 4K display. As long as the game in question is reasonably optimised for SLI, the bottom line is this - the GX800VH offers even more gaming power than a desktop i7 system paired with an overclocked Titan X Pascal. Other dual 1080 gaming laptops are available to challenge the Asus's crown - but to the best of my knowledge, none of them come with a liquid cooling dock to guarantee performance and stability. And yes, you can overclock it too. The GX800VH has a premium finish virtually everywhere you care to look. Our review sample came with a ludicrous 64GB of 2400MHz DDR4 system RAM, capable of overclocking up to 2800MHz. There's 1TB of NVMe solid state storage in RAID-0, split into two drives (a straight copy of game directories from one to the other yields a 1GB/s write-speed - that'll do nicely). The matte finish 18-inch 4K IPS screen offers crystal clear clarity and a preposterously small pixel patch, and audio is taken care of with a top of the line ESS Sabre DAC capable of 32-bit/384kHz output. Oh, and while the Core i7 6820HK is a 2.7GHz quad-core part with specs suggesting a single core turbo boost to 3.6GHz, our review sample happily locked all cores at 3.8GHz out of the box with headroom to spare. The unit itself is large, bulky and very heavy but has a premium finish from top to bottom - though we're looking at a mixture of plastics and metal as opposed to a full aluminium finish. It's also rich in functionality - traditional USB 3.0 is joined by a brace of new Type-C ports, the latest Thunderbolt technology offering cutting-edge expansion while also serving as a DisplayPort output - a nice complement to the HDMI 2.0 port also present. Gigabit Ethernet is joined by an SD card reader and even an antenna input for boosting WiFi reception. The keyboard uses what Asus describes as its MechTAG technology, which it describes as a mechanical keyboard. It feels great, but don't expect the travel and 'click' of a standard mechanical keyboard - it feels somewhat different. Of course, programmable RGB lighting is standard via the ROG Aura app. Asus ROG GX800VH specs It's a laptop so exclusive, Nvidia couldn't even show it as its own Pascal notebook press event. Powered by an overclockable mobile Skylake i7 and paired with two GTX 1080s, it's almost stupidly fast. Anything less than a 4K screen would seem like a waste... CPU: Core i7 6820HK (2.7GHz stock/3.8GHz+ OC) GPU: 2x Nvidia GTX 1080 in SLI RAM: 64GB 2400MHz DDR4 (2800MHz OC) Storage: Hyper RAID PCI Express NVMe 1TB Display: 18.4-inch 4K (3840x2160) Cooling: Liquid-cooling dock Power: 2x 330W Power Supplies (laptop, dock) Display Output: Mini DisplayPort, HDMI 2.0 Expansion: Thunderbolt, USB 3.0, USB 3.0 Type-C, SD Card, WiFi Antenna Slot, gigabit Ethernet, Kensington lock, headphone/mic jack Adding to the insanity, the GX800VH is powered by two 330W power supplies - one apiece for the laptop and the cooling dock. However, the laptop is detachable and can be powered by one PSU. SLI still works here, but the frequencies drop substantially - our recommendation here is to disable SLI: with power attached, boost clocks hit around 1750MHz on a single GPU, while frequencies drop to around 1150MHz running on battery power. Interestingly, running from battery still offers around 70 per cent of performance, with no stutter - just don't expect much in the way of battery life (something you can say about the machine in general no matter what it's doing). Curiously, running a single GTX 1080 with the dock attached sees boost clocks rise to 1866MHz in demanding titles - identical to our Founders Edition desktop model. Rich presents a video overview of the ROG GX800VH - if you want to see its 4K performance in action, start here. The question really isn't what features the GX800VH has - the spec is insanely comprehensive - but rather what it doesn't have. Stacked up against a top-end desktop system, all you're really missing is a six/eight-core CPU (the effectiveness of which is limited in gaming) and perhaps something like a mass storage RAID array - something you can easily add via USB or Thunderbolt, and not something that's likely to cut into your gaming experience. After a moment of chin-stroking, the best we could come up with is the omission of an adaptive sync display. G-Sync at 4K is obviously available, but we suspect that the 18.4-inch form factor limits Asus's options here - just as it did the MSI's similarly nuts GT80 Titan SLI we looked at a while back. Of course, the need for an adaptive sync solution presumes that the GX800VH isn't capable of sustaining 4K gameplay locked to the screen's 60Hz refresh. We're going to tackle performance in two distinct manners here - first of all we're rolling out our benchmarks in order to judge relative performance - we've already benchmarked the machine running with a single GTX 1080 in our Pascal Notebook overview, but now we can factor in the SLI results and toss in some higher-end desktop comparisons. Titan X Pascal, any one? And secondly we're going to be playing some games. Benchmarks are great for grading performance between various piece of hardware, but nothing beats the real life experience of sitting down and enjoying actual gameplay, dipping into the settings in order to optimise for the most silky smooth, fluid experience. OK, so here are the numbers then - we've included running the GX800VH with a single PSU attached in order to get an idea of SLI scalability too. SLI at its best can indeed double performance, as we're seeing with Assassin's Creed Unity, which easily powers past our Titan X Pascal desktop set-up. However, 40-60 per cent boosts at 4K resolution are more commonplace. 3840x2160 (4K) Core i7 6700K 4.6GHz/ GTX 1080 Desktop Core i7 6700K 4.6GHz/ Titan X Desktop Core i7 6820HK 3.8GHz/ GTX 1080 Core i7 6820HK 3.8GHz/ GTX 1080 SLI Assassin's Creed Unity, Ultra High, FXAA 32.9 43.1 31.1 62.0 Ashes of the Singularity, Extreme, 0x MSAA, DX12 53.6 63.7 52.7 60.4 Crysis 3, Very High, SMAA T2x 39.6 50.0 37.3 61.1 The Division, Ultra, SMAA 38.5 49.6 38.5 58.6 Far Cry Primal, Ultra, SMAA 42.4 49.6 40.1 56.9 Rise of the Tomb Raider, Very High, High Textures, SMAA, DX12 49.0 62.1 42.5 71.2 The Witcher 3, Ultra, Post-AA, No HairWorks 47.5 63.2 44.4 72.2 To cut a long story short - SLI works, most of the time. It's the extent to which it works that varies from title to title. In an absolute best case scenario we have Assassin's Creed Unity, handing in virtually double the overall performance level and out-pacing Titan X Pascal by 44 per cent (!). At the other end of the spectrum, Ashes of the Singularity's DX12 non-SLI multi-GPU mode offers paltry returns - just a 15 per cent uplift. It's notable that the end result sees the Titan X desktop set-up power ahead here - the only case where this happens in our benchmarks. Other SLI benefits see scalability in the region of 42 per cent on Far Cry Primal - not especially brilliant, but often par for the course, along with a more creditable 63 per cent boost in Crysis 3. This gives the game a 22 point advantage over our Titan X desktop set-up and reaps rewards in actual gameplay too, something we'll touch on shortly. And there are also significant gains in Rise of the Tomb Raider too - anything up to 67 per cent according to the in-game benchmark. We also tested The Witcher 3 - a title renowned for its wobbly multi-GPU support. We actually got decent enough scaling here - a 62 per cent performance boost and the micro-stutter we've previously seen in SLI testing is gone. However, inconsistent frame-times blighted The Division and seemed to wreck Hitman running on DX12 completely, to the point where we couldn't get any kind of consistent benchmark from it (hence its omission from the table above). The liquid cooling dock is what sets the GX800VH apart - it provides extra power for the system as well as managing thermals. GPU temperatures even when overclocking are in the 70-75 degrees Celsius range. In terms of actual gameplay, the GX800VH does an excellent job of matching and then building upon the experience we enjoyed with our desktop system running the new Titan X Pascal GPU - as you would hope when stacking up the combined 5120 CUDA cores we have running two GTX 1080s against the 3584 found in the new Titan's GP102 core. Often, the difference is just a case of additional refinement - simply because a Titan X system is already capable of excellent 4K performance. Take The Witcher 3, for example. We enjoyed a 4K60 lock with silky smooth gameplay. The dips under 60fps we saw on our Titan X system with lush alpha transparencies in play are not a problem at all on this system. Crysis 3 still exhibits some frame-rate dips, possibly down to the CPU in the intensive jungle scenes - but generally speaking, SLI is offering more GPU power here - we achieved a fairly consistent 60fps simply by dropping shader and shadows from very high to high, leaving everything else maxed. We achieved similar performance levels on the Titan X system though we were a little more aggressive with settings management. Asus ROG GX800VH - the Digital Foundry verdict If you have to ask how much the GX800VH is, the chances are you won't be able to afford it. Prices aren't clear yet, but in a world where the previous model featured a single GTX 980 and sets you back anything up to 5000 Euros, we can't imagine it will be any cheaper. It's hard to imagine that these systems find an audience when a dual Titan X Pascal desktop system would probably be cheaper, but all the major manufacturers have their own massively expensive flagships too. Clearly there is an audience. YouTube stars revealed as owners of gambling site they promoted Our legal expert weighs in. So is this the most powerful laptop in the world? Other GTX 1080 SLI/Core i7 gaming notebooks are available, but the liquid cooling dock ensures stable thermals and thus optimal performance, and it adds overclocking headroom too. Asus reckon the 1080s will hit 1960MHz or thereabouts (we found intense gaming workloads to top out at around 100MHz lower) and promises a meagre 200MHz OC on the G5X RAM (we hit 600-700MHz without too much effort). The cooling system works but when the GPUs are really under load, the dock can be rather loud. But the fact is that the performance is there - and it's monstrous. The GX800VH hands in performance that exceeds the high-end 4K set-up I championed at the beginning of the week and the UHD experience can be epic - Rise of the Tomb Raider is simply breathtaking, for example. Condensing that experience down onto an 18.4-inch screen seems ludicrous, but products like this aren't about practicality or reason. It's all about creating something that's the absolute best it can possibly be, no matter what the cost. It's not a product for me, but I love the fact it's out there, that it exists, that someone dares to make it. Sometimes we include links to online retail stores.

TRENDING NOW: New Call of Duty Vietnam game teased by Sledgehammer Home News Laptops Razer's new Blade gaming laptop rock Kaby Lake, GTX 1060 The new Razer Blade rocks next-gen Kaby Lake CPU, NVIDIA's new GeForce GTX 1060 By: Anthony Garreffa | Laptops News | Posted: Sep 4, 2016 2:44 am Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Razer has just announced its new Blade and Blade Stealth gaming notebooks, with the new laptops being outfitted with Intel's next-gen Kaby Lake CPU, as well as NVIDIA's new Pascal-based GeForce GTX 1060 graphics card.     The new 14-inch Blade notebook doesn't look any different to the current (or is that now last-gen) Blade, which rocks a Core i7-6700HQ and 16GB of DDR4 RAM. Inside of the new Blade, Razer has opted for the GeForce GTX 1060, which is VR-ready.   Razer provides two display options for the Blade, with the original IGZO-based 3200x1800 display on offer, but we also have a IPS-based 1920x1080 offer, too. You can option some higher-end hardware for the Blade, with up to 256/512/1TB PCIe-based M.2 storage on offer.     It's the new Razer Blade Stealth that has me impressed, with some more CPU options on offer in the Kaby Lake-based Core i7-7500U, replacing the older Core i7-6500U. Intel's new Core i7-7500U is a dual-core CPU with Hyper-Threading, so we have 4 threads at 2.7GHz base, or 3.5GHz Turbo clock. The same Intel HD Graphics 620 are included.   Razer's Blade Stealth also includes two display options for its 12.5-inch panel, with IGZO Touch display options in both 3840x2160 (4K) with 100% of the Adobe RGB color space, while the 2560x1440 option offers 70% of the Adobe RGB color space.     The new Blade Stealth is capable of taking 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage for the 4K model, while the 1440p model can handle 128/256/512GB storage options.   Razer has also provided a bigger and better battery for the new Blade Stealth, raising it from 45kWh to a much bigger 53.6kWh battery.     Both of the new gaming laptops rock Thunderbolt 3 connectivity, using USB Type-C to connect through to Razer's external graphics card solution: Razer Core. The new Blade is equipped with a GTX 1060, so you should be fine for most things there, but if you wanted to power an external LCD or TV, then you'll want the additional GPU power. If you're using the Blade Stealth, the external GPU could come in handy very quickly, as it only rocks integrated graphics.   Now, pricing... Razer has it's new Blade Stealth starting at $999, while the higher-end Blade starts at $1799. Both models are available right now.

You get the choice of the dual-core M3, M5, or M7. It breaks down like this - the Core M3 is a 1.1GHz chip that Turbo Boosts to 2.7GHz. The M5 is 1.2GHz with Turbo Boost up to 2.7GHz. Finally, the Core M7, which is a built to order option, is 1.3GHz with Turbo Boost up to 3.1GHz. Each model rocks the Intel HD Graphics 515 chipset, which is 25% faster than last years graphics chip. What’s interesting is that these models seem to be in Turbo Boost mode at almost all times. In fact, the M7 model is just about 4% slower than the previous-generation MacBook Pro in terms of processor speed, and that’s quite the surprise. FASTER FLASH STORAGE, RAM, AND GRAPHICS The second big change to the 2016 lineup is the inclusion of faster flash storage. This is the chips used to store your data on the MacBook. The new chips can do sequential reads of up to 1 GBps, which is 20% faster than the previous model. While a 20% read speed gain in great, even more impressive is that write speeds are 90% faster on the 2016 MacBook when compared to its predecessor. That’s a big deal, and means that when you are using the MacBook to get things done, you won’t feel the squeeze. The 2016 MacBook is definitely greater than the sum of its parts. The faster flash storage is paired with faster RAM as well - you get 8GB or 1867MHz DDR3 RAM, which is an increase from last years 1600MHz RAM. On top of that, there’s also the new Intel HD Graphics 515 chip, which Apple says increases graphics performance by 25%/ My main complaint with the 2015 MacBook is that it always felt like it was one step behind me, always trying to catch up to what I was doing, whether it was launching apps, or even the simple act of typing. With the new model, that issue has all but disappeared. ROSE GOLD Apple introduced the Rose Gold hue on the Apple Watch Edition - that was real Rose Gold. Then it brought Rose Gold colored aluminum to the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus smartphone line. Shortly after, it brought Rose Gold to the Apple Watch Sport. A couple of weeks ago, the 9.7-inch iPad brought Rose Gold to Apple’s tablet line, and now with the 2016 MacBook, Apple brings the hue to its computers. From the outside, the 2016 MacBook looks exactly the same as the 2015 version, with the Rose Gold color being the only external choice that sets it apart visually. In some light the color looks more pink, in others it looks damn near close to the standard gold. It can even take on a copper color. Of course, if Rose Gold isn’t your thing, you can also pick up the MacBook in Silver, Gold, and Space Gray as well. CONCLUSION So, should you buy it? Ultimately, the 2016 MacBook feels like a much more capable computer than its predecessor. There’s always the waiting game you can play, which in this case would be waiting to see what Apple has up its sleeve for WWDC before pulling the trigger, just in case there’s a thinner, more powerful MacBook Pro around the corner. However, with the faster internal specs, the MacBook is capable of accomplishing those everyday tasks that you’ll want to throw at it, and this year it does it without complaining back at you by way of a multi-colored beachball.

TechRadar pro IT insights for business Search RSS News Reviews Insights TechRadar Business Laptop/PC Printers Hardware Software Mobile working Security Networks Management Data centre & Cloud Reviews Jide Remix Mini review Hands on: Jide Remix Mini review Not yet rated By Desire Athow PC & Mac desktops  A smart little PC, just don't expect too much from it Shares What is a hands on review? Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Early Verdict Should you buy the Remix Mini, be aware of its limitations – this is a £40 PC and no one should expect it to perform on par with one costing triple the price. For Wired Ethernet Value for money True desktop-like experience Against Capacitive touch button One USB 3.0 port would have helped The history of alternative operating systems is littered with dead bodies from big and small companies – from the mighty IBM and the mightier Intel to smaller corpses (Lindows anyone?), there have been dozens of companies trying to break the stranglehold of Microsoft back in the day, then Google's Android later on. Failure to do so could vaporise tens of billions of pounds off a company's value; Nokia and Motorola know a thing or two about that. Now, a small company called Jide is trying to challenge both Microsoft and Google with a little operating system called Remix OS. In reality, the latter is not an entirely new venture but is, in fact, based on Google's Android which is itself an open source project. We came across Jide and Remix OS a few weeks ago when reviewing the Onda OBook 10 SE (check the review for a bit more background) and this time around, Gearbest sent us a sample of Jide's very own take on the modern computer, the Remix Mini PC which is the product of a successful Kickstarter campaign. At just over £40 including delivery (around $52, AU$70), it is one of the cheapest mini PCs on the market, regardless of the OS, to offer 2GB of RAM. Note that if you're thinking of a purchase, we strongly advise you to read our article on the pros and cons of buying from Chinese retailers (and generally speaking, outside of the UK). The Remix Mini looks like a pebble from afar, with a curved body devoid of any edges as such. Black in colour, it comes with a 10W (5V2A) power supply unit and an HDMI cable as well as a couple of leaflets. There's a green status LED at the front, a pair of USB 2.0 ports on the back together with a full-size HDMI connector, an audio port, a microSD card slot and a 10/100Mbps Ethernet port. Our model came with 2GB of RAM and 16GB on-board storage. A cheaper variant with half the memory and half the storage is also available although we'd strongly advise you to avoid it. Both models come with a quad-core Allwinner system-on-chip based on ARM's Cortex-A53 technology and clocked at 1.2GHz. Because the device doesn't have an active fan, it ran a tad warm in operation; although not to any worrying extent. As expected, you get 802.11n Wi-Fi as well as Bluetooth 4.0. The Remix Mini supports 4K decoding but since it can only output at full HD, this won't matter much. Using the device was very intuitive – just plug in everything and switch it on by tapping on the Remix logo on top. Jide opted for a capacitive button which we disliked thoroughly as merely touching the logo would send the device to sleep. We updated the Remix OS to version 2.0.604 (based on Android 5.1) and there is an option to enrol in a scheme similar to Microsoft's Windows Insider program, allowing you to beta test the operating system. The update process took minutes rather than hours as some reported online, with a fairly straightforward setup. Compared to stock Android, Remix OS offers useful features such as native multi-tasking, a file manager, a taskbar, an option bar on the right, right click menu, shortcuts and a start menu that make it look more like Windows than anything produced by Google. Windows can be resized, minimised and maximised – snap to borders and Windows-based resizing shortcuts didn't work, though. Applications bundled included the usual suspects from Google (Play Store, Movies, Docs, Sheets, Gmail and Chrome) as well as a flurry of others from partners, one of which is Kodi. Performance was acceptable and, in a thin client configuration, would be more than adequate. Even on a full HD display, light web browsing or playing YouTube videos proved to be as intuitive as on an Android tablet, except you do it with a keyboard and a mouse rather than a touchscreen display. Early verdict Devices like the Remix Mini could transform Google's Android into a very cheap, almost free alternative to Windows for very small businesses that require internet access or operate mostly in the cloud. The fact that it can be plugged into most recent displays with an HDMI connector paves the way for some interesting configurations like powering a digital signage solution or a standalone kiosk. Having a wired connectivity option (hello Ethernet port) and no fans or vents does help as well. It's hard to fault the Remix Mini at this price – especially with the desktop experience – and the productivity aspect is particularly enticing if you are already using Google Apps, Microsoft Office Mobile or OfficeSuite. That said, Chrome OS is fairly similar to Remix OS – both are designed as 'desktopified' Android – and while devices running the former might not be as affordable as the Remix Mini, the fact is that you can go in a high street store and buy one like the Lenovo N22 Chromebook. For small businesses, there's also the appeal of having a company like Google providing support for Chrome OS rather than a much smaller company in a far, far away country.

pagetable.com Some Assembly Required Menu Skip to content Home About Emu8080: an HTML5 App to Emulate a Complete CP/M Machine 31 Replies by Stefan Tramm There are a lot of web-based computer emulators out there for ancient machines – the Commodore 64 and MSX home computers or the more exotic Space Invaders arcade machines. Such emulators are nice to play with but they are incomplete – they lack an Input/Output subsystem. Emu8080 is the first known Javascript-based emulator which adds a floppy disk system, a fast paper tape reader/writer, a line printer and a VT100 terminal emulator to the mix. Modern web browsers offer a local WebSQL database, which is used to implement block storage devices. Drag-and-Drop is used to mount a desktop file onto the virtual tape device. Together with CPU and RAM emulation, you have a complete machine inside your web browser… Want to try out? Use Chrome6+ (or Safari5) and visit http://www.tramm.li/i8080 Now you are working inside a classical machine monitor for an 8080 microcomputer from the 70′s. Available commands are: m to modify memory d to dump memory on the screen l to disassemble a program (in Z80 Syntax) g to start execution <Enter> to perform a single step x to show and modify CPU registers h for help So far this is pretty normal machine emulation. The first important command is “r”. Without any parameters, it lists the available files on the tramm.li server. “r file” reads an Intel HEX file into memory, for example “r basic” will load the well-known Microsoft 8K BASIC interpreter for the Intel 8080. But as already mentioned, a disk subsystem is also available. The first step in using it is to either insert a pre-formatted disk or to format an empty disk. To insert a pre-formatted CP/M disk, issue a “r 0 cpma” command. This command expects the image of an 8-inch IBM formatted SS/SD diskette and writes it sector-wise into the browser-local WebSQL database. This needs to be done only once, causing the disk to now be loaded into your browser as Emu8080 drive 0. With the “b” command, the boot sector is loaded into “main memory”, starting at address 0. Now issue a “g” command to start execution. Ta da!, CP/M 2.2 has been loaded and started! To go back to the monitor, you have two choices: Ctrl-. or via the “bye” executable. Emu8080 supports four drives, so you can either format the other drives (“F” command) or search for other images on the internet and load them yourself. But how do we mount these drives? The “dsk” commands comes to rescue. It opens a new window, showing the current status of each drive. Every disk is also a drop-area, so you can mount disk images per drag-and-drop from your desktop into the emulator. Technically the FileReader API of Javascript is used, and this API is currently (November 2010) implemented only by Chrome (or Opera). Yes, you do not need the server anymore to transport data into a Javascript application. Now you can mount disks and boot CP/M. You can edit files with ED.COM or Wordmaster, or write programs in 8080 assembler. But how to get the modified disk images out of the emulator again? The “dsk [n]” commands opens a new window, which allows to post the binary disk image to an arbitrary web server, e.g. localhost. (btw: there is no FileWriter API in HTML5). Just change the target URL and the form will post it where ever you want. Sometimes mounting and posting whole images is overkill, transmitting a single file into the CP/M machine or getting it out may be all you want to do. And here comes the emulated paper tape device to rescue. Just drag a file onto the terminal’s main window and it will be mounted. Inside CP/M, just use the PIP command: “pip file.txt=rdr:” and you will have the tape’s content in FILE.TXT. Please keep in mind that CP/M is not 8-bit clean. To get a single file out of the emulator, the paper tape puncher is used. Inside CP/M just use PIP again: “pip ptp:=rew.asm” to punch the file out. Then enter the monitor again (Ctrl-. or “bye”) and use the “ptp” command, which opens a window, where you either post the tape content to an arbitrary web server or simply copy-paste the content. The final device is a line printer. It just opens a separate window where every character is shown. No escape sequences are implemented – therefore no bold or underlined characters. In the unlikely case that the user has no clue about CP/M and its commands, the emulator includes a PDF of the original documentation by Digital Research. Now, lets take a short look into the technical details: WebSQL: The emulator uses the browser local SQL DB as block storage for the four disk drives. The storage is persistent and writable. Drag-and-Drop / FileReader API: The emulator uses drag-and-drop and the FileReader API to read paper tape or disc images from your local machine. HTML5 manifest: The emulator supports the browser local database and browser local file reading. To make it also runnable without an active internet connection, it is built as a HTML 5 App by providing an emu8080.manifest file. This file tells the browser which resources (HTML, JS, CSS, PNG, HEX, CPM, PDF files) must be cached. This means that if you bookmark http://www.tramm.li/i8080/emu8080.html, you can start the emulator and access the disk drives even without an internet connection — just like a local application. ShellInABox: Without the fabulous VT100 emulation of ShellInABox, this emulator would not have been possible. The provided example of a BASIC interpreter was the starting point for the 8080 emulator. z80pack: The C based implementation of a Z80 machine was the basis for the IO-subsystem implementation, the custom BIOS, and the boot disk image. The trick for reducing host CPU cycles in tight IO-Loops (eg. when CP/M is waiting for a key press) was taken from this package. js8080: The Space Invaders emulator js8080 gifted the core CPU emulation. One last word on performance. On a usual x86 processor the emulator performs like a 2 MHz 8080. With the monitor command “instr” you can tune the performance, by increasing the number of executed 8080 instructions per Javascript timeslice. With today’s hardware, you can expect the performance of a 8 MHz CPU (which was never available as real silicon). And for Microsoft BASIC fans, try “r basic” and “g” afterwards instead of booting CP/M – welcome to 8K BASIC. Use “SAVE” to save your programs on the paper tape and “LOAD” to read saved programs.

And now — happy hacking. http://www.tramm.li/i8080/ http://www.tramm.li/i8080/emu8080.html Other links: Neozeed blogged about the emulator, he also provides a very clear Howto, please take a look at: http://virtuallyfun.blogspot.com/2010/10/cpm-zork-in-java-script.html Emu8080 is also mentioned on the Z80 Info Pages (many thanks to Gaby from gaby.de for the reference!): http://www.z80.info/z80emu.htm#EMU_CPU_VAR This entry was posted in archeology, hacks on November 14, 2010 by Michael Steil.

Parity indicates if the number of set bits is even or odd. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_flag). The js8080 implementation indicates if the number itself is even or odd. Counting bits in JavaScript can be a bit slow. However, since the 8080 parity test operates on an 8-bit value, it’s pretty easy to just create a 256 entry table of true/false values and use the value you’re testing as an index into the table: var parityTable = [ true,false,false,true,false,true,true,false,false,true,true,false,true,false,false,true, false,true,true,false,true,false,false,true,true,false,false,true,false,true,true,false, false,true,true,false,true,false,false,true,true,false,false,true,false,true,true,false, true,false,false,true,false,true,true,false,false,true,true,false,true,false,false,true, false,true,true,false,true,false,false,true,true,false,false,true,false,true,true,false, true,false,false,true,false,true,true,false,false,true,true,false,true,false,false,true, true,false,false,true,false,true,true,false,false,true,true,false,true,false,false,true, false,true,true,false,true,false,false,true,true,false,false,true,false,true,true,false, false,true,true,false,true,false,false,true,true,false,false,true,false,true,true,false, true,false,false,true,false,true,true,false,false,true,true,false,true,false,false,true, true,false,false,true,false,true,true,false,false,true,true,false,true,false,false,true, false,true,true,false,true,false,false,true,true,false,false,true,false,true,true,false, true,false,false,true,false,true,true,false,false,true,true,false,true,false,false,true, false,true,true,false,true,false,false,true,true,false,false,true,false,true,true,false, false,true,true,false,true,false,false,true,true,false,false,true,false,true,true,false, true,false,false,true,false,true,true,false,false,true,true,false,true,false,false,true, ]; // set the Parity flag function PF(v) { if( parityTable[ (v & 0xFF) ] ) r8[iF] |= iPF; else r8[iF] &= ~(iPF); } Reply ↓ no down payment auto insurance in Ayden NC March 4, 2016 at 08:59 Unlike an annual fee for dividing the annual tax aton the %; Number of Additional Auto Insurance offers can be made use of it as a customer reaction.

Intel Kaby Lake & AMD Zen - Beschränkung auf Windows 10 wegen neuer Features Die neue CPU-Generationen Kaby Lake und Zen werden von Intel und AMD unter Windows 7 und Windows 8.1 nicht mehr durch neue Treiber unterstützt. Von Georg Wieselsberger | Datum: 03.09.2016 ; 08:40 Uhr Kommentare (91) AMD Zen und Intels Kaby Lake werden von den Prozessorherstellern keine Treiber für Windows 7 und Windows 8 erhalten. Update: Laut Hothardware sind spezielle Energiespar-Funktionen in Intels Kaby Lake und die Verarbeitung von zwei Threads pro Kern bei AMDs Zen die Gründe dafür, dass die neuen Prozessoren wohl nur unter Windows 10 offiziell unterstützt werden. Die Speed-Shift-Funktion von Intel ist bereits in den aktuellen Skylake-CPUs wie dem Core i7 6700K enthalten und funktioniert ebenfalls nur unter Windows 10. Kaby Lake wird eine verbesserte Version dieser Energiespar-Funktion bieten. AMDs Zen-Prozessoren können pro Kern zwei Threads verarbeiten, doch laut dem Bericht ist diese Funktion nicht identisch mit dem ähnlichen Hyper-Threading von Intel, die auch in älteren Windows-Versionen funktioniert. Um die neuen Funktionen von Kaby Lake und Zen verwenden zu können, müssen diese aber auch durch den Betriebssystem-Kernel unterstützt werden. Bei Windows 7 hatte Microsoft für die AMD Bulldozer-Prozessoren noch ein Update bereitgestellt, um den Windows-Kernel für dessen neue Funktionen zu optimieren. Da Microsoft aber aktuell nur noch Windows 10 mit neuen Funktionen ausstattet, wird auch nur noch diese Windows-Version für die neuen CPU-Generationen optimiert. Allerdings sollten laut dem Bericht keine Probleme auftreten, wenn die neuen Prozessoren beispielsweise mit Windows 7 genutzt werden. Windows XP funktioniert auch heute noch mit einer Skylake-CPU, auch wenn viele Features des Prozessors dann ungenutzt bleiben. Quelle: Hothardware Originalmeldung: Vor einigen Monaten hatte Microsoft angekündigt, dass die älteren Betriebssysteme Windows 7 und Windows 8.1 keine Unterstützung mehr für neue, zu diesem Zeitpunkt nicht veröffentlichte CPU-Generationen erhalten werden. Damit waren von dieser Ankündigung sowohl die kommenden Zen-Prozessoren von AMD als auch Kaby Lake von Intel betroffen. Als Grund hatte Microsoft unter anderem angegeben, dass Features der neuen CPUs tiefer in das Betriebssystem integriert werden sollen und das bei älteren Versionen aufgrund des unterschiedlichen Aufbaus nicht möglich sei. Microsoft war für diese Entscheidung stark kritisiert worden, doch nun sieht es so aus, als seien die Prozessor-Hersteller zumindest daran beteiligt. Wie Intel gegenüber PC World bestätigt, wird es für Kaby Lake aufgrund der Entscheidung von Microsoft keine neuen Treiber für Windows 7 und Windows 8 geben. Auch der Technik-Chef von AMD, Mark Papermaster. hat auf Anfrage bestätigt, dass die Roadmap des Unternehmens komplett mit der Software-Strategie von Microsoft abgestimmt ist. Damit scheint nun sicher, dass die neuen Prozessoren beider Hersteller keine Windows-7/8-Treiber mehr erhalten, allerdings ist nicht klar, was das für Nutzer der älteren Betriebssysteme bedeutet. Im besten Fall funktionieren auch die neuen Prozessoren wegen des x86-Standards an sich problemlos, können aber einige neue Features unter Windows 7 und Windows 8 nicht nutzen. Allerdings könnten auch dann noch Probleme mit neuerer Software auftreten, die mit der nicht unterstützen Kombination aus altem Windows und neuer CPU nicht zurechtkommt. Intels Skylake-CPUs wie der Core i7 6700K sind damit die letzte voll unterstützte CPU-Generation unter Windows 7 und Windows 8. Laut AMD bezieht sich die Aussage von Mark Papermaster übrigens nur auf Windows und nicht auf Linux oder macOS.

Sep 2016, 09:14 Da bin ich jetzt echt gespannt, welche "neuen Killer-Features" es sein werden, die Intel und AMD in die neuen Prozessoren einbauen und ob diese für das tägliche Arbeiten und Spielen am PC wirklich wichtig und von Software-Entwicklern dann auch unterstützt werden ;-)  (11)  |   (9) Tidaltree #3 | 03. Sep 2016, 09:18 Dann heißt es wohl abwarten, welche neuen Features das sind, die nicht funktionieren werden, und ob man auf diese auch verzichten kann. Zudem kann die Behauptung, daß diese Funktionen bei älteren Betriebssystemen nicht integriert werden könne, eine reine PR-Behauptung darstellen, um die Verbreitung von Win1['m]0[ut] zu befördern. Kreativen Codern mag es ja durchaus noch gelingen, Selber einen Treiber für Win7/8 zu programmieren, der diese Funktionen lauffähig integriert.  (13)  |   (12) TheSam #4 | 03. Sep 2016, 09:28 Naja, wenn man bedenkt wie wenig sich die CPUs in den letzten Jahren seit dem 2500k weiterentwickelt haben, dann kann man damit gut leben und kauft sich zur Not eben nochmal einen Skylake und kann den noch vollumfänglich ein paar Jahre nutzen, bis man irgendwann selbst auf ein neues OS wechseln will.  (26)  |   (9) EvilKenivel1976 #5 | 03. Sep 2016, 09:31 Das werden bestimmt irgendwelche neuen Energiesparoptionen sein. Da ich eh immer alles auf Leistung stelle würde mich das nicht interessieren. Naja und außerdem gehöre ich zu den 22% die Windows 10 benutzen ^^  (19)  |   (14) Agent.Smith #6 | 03. Sep 2016, 09:45 Zitat von : Auch der Technik-Chef von AMD, Mark Papermaster. hat auf Anfrage bestätigt, dass die Roadmap des Unternehmens komplett mit der Software-Strategie von Microsoft abgestimmt ist. Und wer ist denn nun auf wen zugegangen und hat um diese Abstimmung gebeten? Ich mein, gerade AMD kann doch gerade echt jeden noch so kleinen Wetbewerbsvorteil gebrauchen. Und Treiber für eins der (noch) verbreitetsten Betriebssysteme überhaupt ist nun sicher kein kleiner Wettbewerbsvorteil. Ich kann nicht so recht glauben, dass gerade AMD so völlig freiwillig und ohne "Motivation von außen" darauf verzichtet hat.  (27)  |   (6) Tigerchen85 #7 | 03.

AMD hat im Prozessor Markt einfach nichts mehr zu melden. So einfach ist das. Die Big Player sind nunmal INTEL und Microsoft (im Software Bereich). AMD kann sich fügen oder es lassen, aber es wird sicher nichts ändern.  (7)  |   (33) Agent.Smith #8 | 03.

Ich glaube es war eher Letzteres.  (6)  |   (7) Eris #9 | 03. Sep 2016, 10:05 Ich kann euch jetzt schon sagen, dass da vielleicht ein sinnvolles Feature dabei sein wird und der Rest nur zur Verdongelung (was für ein Wort :)) des PC´s dient. Natürlich läuft das Ganze dann wieder unter dem Aspekt "Sicherheit für den Endkunden".  (5)  |   (6) Tidaltree #10 | 03.

Ist ja vielleicht auch eine Sache für das Bundeskartellamt. Wäre gespannt darauf, was Die von dieser Abstimmung zwischen Hard- und Softareunternehmen halten würden.

Unfortunately, the chipset believed to be included in the upcoming MacBook Pro isn’t noted. What gives? There are three new Kaby Lake processors: the ‘U’ series, ‘Y’ series and ’S’ series. The U is best suited for the MacBook Air, which is believed to be seeing a refresh soon. 30,000 tech-heads descend on Amsterdam Join us and 30,000 others at the 12th edition of TNW Conference. Explore our speakers and attendees now. TELL ME MORE! The ‘Y’ is a bit tighter, and a good fit (pun intended) for the Macbook. Intel’s ’S’ series processor — the one many believe will be included in the Macbook Pro — hasn’t been detailed. But Intel’s new chipsets are beastly. It says Kaby Lake architecture provides 19 percent better performance for Web browsing compared to Skylake, and 12 percent gains overall. Intel also says you’ll get nearly 10 hours of 4K video playback, and processing a 4K video is up to six times faster than with existing chipsets. This doesn’t mean the Pro won’t have Kaby Lake, or that it’s delayed beyond the original timeline. Really, we don’t know when the Pro is actually coming, though it’s widely believed Apple will announce it in October. 7th Gen Intel Core on Intel Read next: Skip iTunes entirely and browse Apple's mobile App Store from the browser IntelMacBookMacBook Pro Share on Facebook (27) Share on Twitter (142) Nate Swanner is a reporter from Portland, OR, US.

Intel Hits 52-Week High on Strong Growth Prospects Zacks Equity Research 9/2/2016 Zacks Equity Research © Justin Sullivan/Getty Images The Intel logo is displayed outside of the Intel headquarters on January in Santa Clara, California. Shares of Intel Corp. INTC touched a new 52-week high of $36.04 on Sep 1, eventually closing at $36.02. The company returned 23.9% in the past one year and has added roughly 4.6% year to date. Average volume of shares traded over the last three months was approximately 21,619K. Quotes in the article Intel Corp INTC ▼ 36.27 -0.39 -1.06% What's Driving Intel? Intel is one of the world’s leading producers of semiconductor components and digital platforms. Its focus was earlier on making the best computing chips and generating industry-leading margins from them. Now, Intel’s focus has shifted to a product range targeting different segments of the market, namely data center business, cloud and IoT. In particular, Intel’s data center business and cloud have been registering significant growth. In this regard, the company recently said that it is acquiring Nervana Systems, an artificial intelligence startup based in San Diego. This deal will help Intel to enhance its prowess in data center as well as machine learning, which is gradually gaining prominence. Another growth driver is the company’s recently launched 7th generation CPU –14nm Kaby Lakechip. Kaby’s biggest feature is improved support for 4K, which is likely to be a big positive going forward. Just like both Broadwell and Skylake, Kaby Lakechip comes with improved graphics performance, better CPU performance and longer battery life. Also, the price appreciation may be attributed to Intel’s strong fundamentals, solid growth of its cloud business and better-than-expected second-quarter 2016 results reported on Jul 20. In the second quarter, Intel reported earnings of 59 cents per share that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 53 cents. The increase was driven by better operational efficiency and cost cutting measures. However, Intel’s revenue of $13.53 billion was within the guided range of $13.5 billion (+/-$500 million) but below the Zacks Consensus of $14.80 billion. Also, management provided a solid guidance for the third quarter of 2016. Revenues are expected at around $14.9 billion (+/-$500 million), up 10.1% sequentially and 3.0% from the June quarter of 2015. In the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of nearly 7.95%. Intel’s strong revenue growth, solid financial conditions, growth in areas like cloud computing, mobile, data center as well as strong long-term growth potential position it favorably. Intel’s strong revenue growth, solid financial conditions, growth in areas like cloud computing, mobile, data center as well as strong long-term growth potential position it favorably. Intel currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Stocks that Warrant a Look Some well-placed stocks in the technology space are NVIDIA Corporation NVDA sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Texas Instruments Inc.

Using a special camera technology from Intel called RealSense, Windows Hello can scan and then recognize your face using three cameras (Color, 3D and Infrared) to provide you a secure means of access not only to your Windows 10 machine but also apps and websites. No further proof is needed about the popularity of a feature like this then our video last year that demoed Windows Hello and its facial recognition for the first time outside of Microsoft. That video has been viewed over 143,000 times and is still the number result when you search YouTube for a "windows hello facial recognition demo". You would think with that kind of desire for this cool and secure feature that third party camera peripheral manufacturers such as Logitech and even Microsoft would have jumped on this early and fast. Well it did not happen. Instead, Intel was selling so many of their RealSense DevKit cameras that they were regularly running out of stock and having to build more. Still, no third party manufacturers noticed. However, new devices such as laptops, tablets and phones started to trickle into the market and slowly put the Windows Hello facial recognition feature at more users disposal but that meant buying a new device to get the capability. What about everyone who already owned a desktop or laptop computer and just wanted to add facial recognition with Windows Hello? Well, in the last nine months only two manufacturers have announced their intentions to finally bring third party cameras to market that support Windows Hello. One was Razer's Stargazer (announced at CES 2016) and the other one was from MouseComputer (revealed at COMPUTEX 2016). While nothing has been heard about the MouseComputer camera since early June, this week at IFA 2016 in Berlin Razer announced that their Stargazer is now available for pre-order and according to the product page at the Razer online store it begins shipping on 21 September 2016. The USB 3.0 camera fully supports Windows Hello as expected but is also a full HD 1080p webcam with several other features: Ultra-high 60 frames per second capture optimized for streaming (720p max) Max 1080p HD video capture Automatic noise cancelling dual array mic Dynamic Background Removal 3D scanning Facial/gesture recognition Flexible clip for laptops and desktop monitors The product specifications, in other words what your PC needs to have to support this device, looks like this: 6th generation Intel® Core™ processor PC with a free USB 3.0 port 8GB of free hard disk space DirectX 9.0 Intel® HD graphics Windows® 10 4GB memory Internet connection One note. The specs list that an Intel 6th generation processor is needed, this is the same requirement listed for the Intel RealSense DevKit camera however, I have been using the Intel developer kit camera on my AMD based system without any issues at all. The only time it has not worked was when I attempted to use it with a USB 2.0 port - it really does need the USB 3.0 for the higher speed and bandwidth. I have already pre-ordered one of these Stargazer's from Razer and will share more about the device with you once it has arrived.   Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Related Media Unboxing and Setup of Amazon Echo Dot Lenovo Updates Its ThinkPad Lineup Just Prior to CES 2017 AUKEY 20000mAh 3.4A Dual USB Lightning and Micro AiPower Portable… Inateck In-Ear Sport Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds Inateck Phone Car Mount and Holder Unboxing & Hands On : Nuvision TM800W610L 8-Inch Windows 10… Review: WaterField Designs Syde Surface Book Case Inateck Wireless Bluetooth Receiver and Hands-Free Car Kit Review: Masione USB Wired Gaming Keyboard Inateck Wireless Presenter, 2.4GHz PowerPoint Remote Control Please Log In or Register to post comments.

I’m gonna leave a link to this, as well as everything in the bag, in the description below, but if you’re wanting to look this up on your own, it’s spelled N-R-G. Here’s what’s special about it. This is a bag built for gadgets. It’s ridiculously spacious, water resistant, and can charge  your gadgets when you’re on the go. More on that in a bit. You might be wondering why I called this the What’s in my Bag: Overkill edition, and you’re about to find out. As most of you know, I work from home, and creating tech content like this video is what I do for a living. What that means is, when I am on the go, it’s because I am leaving town - and that means I need everything necessary to keep the content flowing for you guys. Let’s start in the front pocket. Oh, and remember how I said this bag can charge up your gadgets? There’s a 7000mAh removable battery built in to this bag. It can be removed to be charged, or you can just open up the power port on the side of the bag and plug the AC adapter into there. The battery powers the USB port on the side of the backpack, which can charge up any smartphone or tablet. Even cooler, on the inside you’ll find built-in Lightning, microUSB, and Apple 30-pin charging cables, all of which are directly connected to the power in the bag as well. So, you are covered regardless of the device you have on you, and that’s pretty cool. MACBOOK Of course, when I’m on the go, I need my mobile workstation, and in this instance, that’s the 2016 MacBook. I’ve got the Rose Gold model with the upgraded 1.3GHz Intel Core M7 processor and 512GB of storage. I’ll be bringing you my review of Apple’s latest MacBook soon, but in my early tests it beats last years model easily. IPAD PRO In addition to the MacBook, I also keep a 12.9-inch LTE iPad Pro in my bag as well. Sometimes I just wanna use iOS apps to connect to my TiVo to watch shows, or stream Netflix, Hulu, or just play a game. Of course I’ve got the smart keyboard connected in case I also wanna get some work done... But yes, sometimes I don’t need the larger form factor, and therefore I ALSO have the 9.7-inch LTE iPad Pro with me as well. The larger model pretty much needs to be on a table or desk to be useable, and this smaller version is fine in the hands, and has that fresh True Tone display as well, which is great for reading. KINDLE OASIS That said, if I really wanna get some reading done without distractions or the temptation of other apps, I also have a Kindle e-reader in my bag at all times. RIght now, it’s the brand new Kindle Oasis, which Amazon just released last week. I’m a fan of this because it includes a leather charging cover, and a fully charged Kindle Oasis and Oasis case provides a ridiculous multi-month battery life. APPLE PENCIL Since I’ve got two iPad Pro units in my bag, it only makes sense that I’d also bring along the accessories that make the iPad Pro an iPad Pro. The Apple Pencil is definitely part of that equation, coming in handy when I’m making those sick YouTube thumbnails on the go. PowerAdd Slim2 CHARGER This small charger by PowerAdd sports 5000mAh of power, enough to recharge a current smartphone almost twice, and it’s not too big to fit into a pocket if you need to charge up while using your device. It’s also not too expensive at all at just $10. ANKER CHARGER But when I need more power, or to charge more than one device, this Anker charger is my go to. It’s sleek and slim, looks great, has 3 USB ports, a built-in flashlight, and has an incredible 20100mAh battery on the inside. You can even use this to charge the MacBook over USB-C. NINTENDO 3DS I’ve got the New Nintendo 3DS to take care of boredom on flights, as well as to give me an opportunity to get some gaming in since I’m so busy as home making videos nonstop. Specifically, this is the limited edition Legend of Zelda Majora’s Mask console. CABLES Of course, I need to have every cable that I may possibly need, because, you never know, right? Ethernet, Lightning, microUSB, mini USB, USB-C, etc. I’ve also got some USB-C dongles for the MacBook, in case I need to plug in a standard USB device or HDMI cable. IPHONE SE - VRS Design Case In the back pocket found on the rear of the NRG bag, I usually store a couple of extra smartphones. I’m usually reviewing and testing multiple models, and this is a great place to keep them protected. Here I have the iPhone SE, although you probably wouldn’t know it due to the unique case. This is actually another case from VRS Design, which can also hold some card or cash. Just like the LG G5, VRS design makes some sweet cases for iPhones as well. I’ll have more on these iPhone SE cases in a future video, so look out for that one. LG G5 - VRS Design Case Here I’ve got the LG G5, the latest flagship from LG. I keep that on me  in order to compare smartphones when I am doing reviews on the go. If you’re thinking about picking up the LG G5, I’ll leave a link to my full review video for you to check out. Oh, and to keep it protected, I’ve got it in a case from VRS Design. This one is called the High Pro Shield, and it’s two pieces - one soft piece that protects the phone from shock, and a hard bumper that goes around it. I’ve been trying out a bunch of different cases from VRS Design lately, and I’m a big fan of both the look and the quality of their designs. In fact, I’ll show you another one a little later on. If you need a case for your LG G5, VRS Design cases start at about $11. HTC 10 This is the HTC 10, and if you’ve been following my channel, you know that I picked my review unit up from the launch party that took place in New York City a couple of weeks ago. I’m just about done with my full review of the HTC 10, and while you wait for that, feel free to check out my coverage from the launch party, as well as my picks for the top 5 features on this device. NECTAR GLASSES: Dank Depending on where I’m going, sunglasses could be a necessity. I like to keep a pair of stylish but inexpensive shades with me at all times, just in case. I keep my more expensive sunglasses in my car, so when I’m on the go, I’m all about Nectar Sunglasses. Here you see the Dank edition Sunnies, which cost just $30. Moment Case and Lenses Moment Lenses and the accompanying Moment Case are invaluable tools for getting fantastic photos and videos using my iPhone 6S Plus (which isn’t in my bag because it’s home is my back pocket.) You insert the iPhone into the Moment Case, which is communicates with over Bluetooth, and provides a nice camera grip and shutter button. I have three lenses, all of which are premium glass. One is a wide angle, one is telephoto, and the last is a macro. Earin headphones I’m testing these Earin headphones. They are completely wireless Bluetooth earbuds. No wire to plug into your device, and no wire connected the two ear pieces. They’re decent so far, but audio drop outs on one ear or the other can get annoying. Still, many think wireless earbuds are the future, so I’m keeping my eye on this space. LSTN Wembley bamboo earbuds These LSTN Wembley earbuds are some of the best in-ears I have ever had the pleasure of listening to, which is why I’m not totally sold on the idea of completely wireless buds just yet. I’m usually more a fan of over-ear headphones, but I agreed to try out the LSTN buds and was immediately blown away by how great they sound - and the bamboo wood construction is beautiful. They’re noise-isolating and electro-acoustically tuned to produce high-end sounds quality at any volume, and the real wood housing provides a rich, full sound. Even better, your purchase helps support LSTN and Starkey Hearing Foundation’s mission to help restore hearing worldwide. Belkin SurgePlus USB Swivel Charger The Belkin SurgePlus has been a lifesaver, and it has had a spot in my travel bag for about 8 years. It plugs into a standard outlet, and provides you with three surge-protected AC outlets, as well as two USB charging ports. WHen you’re in a hotel room and outlets are scarce, the SurgePlus quickly becomes your best friend. Mophie Juice Pack When I’m on the go and don’t need to carry my bag with me, I look to the Mophie Juice Pack to keep my iPhone 6S running all day. It does double as a protective case, but that’s not why I use it - I just wanna be able to go from morning til late at night when I’m at these influencer events, and the Juice Pack means I don’t need to find an outlet. Audeze EL-8 Titanium This might be my favorite thing in my bag - the Audeze EL-8 headphones. World’s First Headphones With Fully Integrated Apple Lightning Cable. The EL-8 Titanium headphones come with an exclusive lightning cable that streams a complete 24-bit digital signal through a high quality DSP and DAC to offer better sound quality. The built in microphone can be used for phone calls and is SIRI compatible. An accompanying Audeze app can be used to apply EQ and sound presets. For non- Apple device compatibility, the headphones also include a standard analog cable. PlugBug PlugBug piggybacks onto your MacBook Power Adapter, creating a one-of-a-kind, dual charger for MacBook + USB devices like an iPhone or iPad, or really any USB-powered device. A newer model includes five international snap-on plugs and doubles as an international, stand-alone USB charger for iPhone and iPad. SanDisk USB-C Dual Flash Drive It has 32GB of storage, and the cool thing is that it can be plugged into both standard USB ports, as well as newer USB-C ports like the one found on the MacBook. That makes it easy to get files from one system to another, regardless of which USB type it supports. There you have it guys, that was your look inside my tech bag. I’m curious what you thought - I know I said it was overkill, but do you agree? Do you keep your bag nice and light, or are you hauling around even more stuff than I am? Hit me in the comments and let me know. Also, big shout out to Ghostek and VRS Designs for making this video happen, you’ll find links to the their products, as well as everything else I showed in this video, in the description below.

But it seems that a much colder island far to the north might also wish to be called New Ireland – the island formerly known as Great Britain. In the wake of the European commission’s ruling that Ireland must reclaim €13bn plus interest in taxes from Apple, there is a good deal of excitement at the prospect of a post-Brexit Britain replacing its smaller neighbour in the affections of tax-shy global corporations. As the Daily Telegraph put it in an editorial: “If Ireland and the EU do not want a huge, wealth-creating firm doing business in their territory, Apple will be very welcome in the UK.” Welcome, that is, to use the UK as it has previously used Ireland – as a compliant state that will look the other way while vast profits pass through, untaxed. It is, on the surface, an appealing prospect. You only have to walk around Dublin or Cork to see that Ireland’s tax regime has been a honeypot for all the hottest digital corporations – not just the long-established ones like Apple, Microsoft and Intel but the entire new wave of internet behemoths: Google, Facebook, Twitter and so on. And the same is broadly true in other areas such as pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Little Ireland has a stock of US direct investment much larger than France and Germany combined. Ireland is the number one location worldwide for investment by US chemical and pharmaceutical companies and number two for IT companies. And no one thinks those corporations are attracted by the scenery. For the more excitable elements among the Brexiters, the EU’s ruling on Apple’s tax bill thus opens up a delirious prospect. The Brussels bureaucrats are moving against Ireland’s vigorously pro-business taxation policies, but Britain, when it throws off the shackles of the EU, will be free to swoop in and grab the golden eggs from the Irish nest. Apple and Pfizer, Facebook and Google, driven by EU persecution from the emerald isle, will seek asylum in the New Ireland next door, where the writ of the Eurocrats does not run and the government knows how to treat a corporation with the respect it deserves. Could there be any more dramatic illustration of both the evils of the EU and the thrilling possibilities of Brexit? There are, however, two small questions about this strategy. Is it possible? And is it desirable? The answers might perhaps curb the enthusiasm of the true believers. There is, for a start, the small matter of whether, even after the EU tax ruling, Apple wants to leave Ireland for the UK or anywhere else. The answer could hardly be clearer – it doesn’t. In an interview with Ireland’s national broadcaster RTE, chief executive Tim Cook was full of indignation at the very idea that Apple might have benefited from illegal state aid in the form of a sweetheart tax deal. “When you are accused of doing something that’s so foreign to your values, it brings out an outrage in you, that’s how we feel,” he said. He made clear that Apple will appeal against the €13bn ruling and that it expected the Irish government to do the same. Those listening out for signs of a dismay that might be exploited by post-Brexit Britain will have been encouraged – up to a point. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple, has said that the company will keep investing in Ireland. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty And the point at which the encouragement stopped was when Cook discussed Apple’s intentions. What will Apple do in benighted EU-ridden Ireland? Keep investing. He reaffirmed without qualification that Apple was going ahead with a major expansion of its campus in Cork: “We’re very committed to Ireland, have been for 37 years. We have a long-term romance together.” So why on earth would Apple remain in Ireland instead of taking refuge in the brave new post-Brexit world of low-tax Britain? Partly because tax, even for greedy corporations, isn’t everything. And partly because Apple is smart enough to know that the kind of outrageous dodge that resulted in a tax rate in 2014 for its Irish-based subsidiary of 0.005% is not sustainable – in Ireland, Britain or any other democratic society. Though market fundamentalists find it hard to believe, even global corporations need social relationships. Will they exploit every possible loophole to maximise their profits? Yes – ruthlessly and without conscience. But is the ability to dodge tax the sole criterion they apply to their decisions to invest? No. As Cook acknowledged: “We went into Ireland in 1980. We didn’t go there to seek advantages on taxes – we had only 60 employees and very little revenue.” This reassurance explains why public and political opinion in Ireland has been more ambivalent about the Apple ruling than the establishment consensus would suggest. The big right-of-centre parties, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, have backed Apple to the hilt and tried to rally the public by warning that accepting the unpaid taxes would drive multinational investors away. But most people seem to understand that it’s not so simple. The choice between colluding in morally obnoxious tax avoidance on the one hand and facing economic chaos on the other does not ring true. The Brexiters’ fantasy of stealing Ireland’s corporate investors relies on a deeply patronising attitude to Ireland. Underlying it is the notion that no foreign company would possibly invest in Ireland for any other reason than its lax attitude to taxation. But there are a lot of other reasons – a highly skilled and productive workforce, cultural vitality, political stability and (oddly enough) membership of the European Union with full access to the world’s biggest single market. The obsession of giant corporations with avoiding tax does not blind them to their need for the social, political and cultural resources on which they draw. This is not just a matter of theory. A crucial point easily lost in the noise of the EU’s Apple ruling is that the regime under which it could avoid so much tax has already changed. The notorious “double Irish” strategy used by Apple and other corporations to make themselves stateless for taxation purposes is being dismantled. Market fundamentalists would tell us that corporations will respond to this tightening of the tax regime by fleeing Ireland. Actually, they’ve responded by paying more tax: Ireland took in €6.9bn in corporation tax last year compared with €4.6bn in 2014 when the abolition of the “double Irish” was announced. And why was the Irish corporate tax regime made tougher? Not because of the EU but because of an organisation the Brexiters seem not to have heard of: the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). It is the OECD, not the EU, that has driven attempts to clean up the worst excesses of corporate tax avoidance. (One way of seeing the severity of the Apple ruling is as an attempt by the EU to regain the initiative on an issue of such global consequence.) The UK is a member of the OECD and has signed up to these anti-tax avoidance strategies. Unless Britain wants to go completely rogue and leave the OECD as well as the EU, the fantasy of luring companies such as Apple with the virtual impunity from taxation they used to enjoy in Ireland could not be fulfilled. So much for the possibility of becoming the New Ireland – what about the desirability? Would it be good for Britain if it were to try to emulate Ireland’s strategy of relying on foreign investment and attracting it by becoming, in effect, a tax haven for the largest corporations? The key point about Ireland’s Faustian pact with global corporations is that it was a strategy of desperation. The country sold its soul in the 1960s because it had a stagnant agricultural economy. Indigenous industrial development was slow and weak, Ireland was an economic vassal of the UK and mass emigration was bleeding the country dry. Giving global corporations massive tax breaks wasn’t an ideological principle – it was a last resort when pretty much everything else had failed. This matters in the British context because it explains why very low corporation taxes could operate in Ireland without creating social conflict. The corporate devil gave the Irish Faust a pretty good price for his soul: a way of moving from backwardness to modernity. But Britain has a radically different economic, social and political history. Transplanting a policy that worked for very specific reasons in Ireland into post-Brexit Britain would show scant regard for the nature of either country. Ireland has had to live with the consequences of its particular choice. One of them is what US economist Paul Krugman recently called “leprechaun economics”. Krugman coined the phrase in response to the news that the Irish economy grew by an incredible 26.3% in 2015. Literally incredible – the figures are massively inflated by the fiscal juggling of the giant corporations. Irish GDP is meaningless. There is a vast gulf between the real economy and the kind of hyped-up faux-economy you get when you turn your state into a conduit for torrents of funny money. And that hype is not harmless – the Celtic Tiger bubble was one of its more catastrophic products. It is not accidental that Ireland has the most unequal distribution of market income (before tax and welfare) in the developed world. In effect, there are two Irish economies: the foreign corporate economy that is highly skilled, ultra-globalised and very favourably treated by the state; and a weaker indigenous economy that exists in its shadow. One of the consequences of this extreme inequality of market income is that the state has to do an enormous amount of heavy lifting through the income tax and welfare systems to keep these divisions in check. This activist state is hardly what the British right expects it will get if it follows the Irish model.

Apple has had operations in Ireland for 37 years. Photograph: Irish Examiner And here, surely, is the fatal contradiction in the notion of a post-Brexit Britain that will combine huge tax benefits for the corporate few with Theresa May’s promise of social justice for the many. The more honest voices urging Britain to replace Ireland as the new best buddy of the global corporations recognise that radical cuts to corporate taxes would have to be matched by drastic reductions in personal taxes because otherwise rage at grossly unequal treatment would destabilise society and politics.Hence the final paradox: giving the corporations what they want on tax means not giving them what they need in every other respect. The general low tax regime in this brave new Britain would be delightful for the likes of Apple – except when they want a terrific educational system to produce their smart workforce, a national health service to keep them healthy, a decline in social inequality to keep the political environment stable and lots of public investment in world-class infrastructure. And for those things they need big government funded by high taxes – on somebody else. It is pure delusion to think that the smartest corporations will be drawn to a Britain not only outside the single European market but no longer raising enough tax to invest in its society, services and infrastructure. Ireland is discovering that the game of beggar-my-neighbour tax policies is pretty much up. Inside or outside the EU, Britain will have to join Ireland and the rest of Europe in telling the corporations that, if they want to operate in civilised societies, they have to help pay for them. Fintan O’Toole is a columnist with the Irish Times FIAT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: AFP/Getty Images In 2015 the European commission ruled that the Italian carmaker’s financing company had paid taxes on profits that had been underestimated. The commission found that Fiat Finance and Trade, which is based in Luxembourg and provides financial services, such as intra-group loans, to other Fiat group car companies, engaged in “many different transactions with Fiat group companies in Europe”. Its investigation showed that a tax ruling by the Luxembourg authorities gave a selective advantage to Fiat Finance and Trade, which had allowed it to reduce its tax burden by between €20m and €30m since 2012. Fiat insisted its dealings merely amounted to a clarification of pricing rules and did not constitute state aid, but it was ordered to repay £25.5m. MCDONALD’S Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: AFP/Getty Images In May, the French headquarters of the global fast-food chain was raided by tax officials who seized financial documents as part of an ongoing investigation. The company’s finances have been in the spotlight since last year, following claims that it struck a deal with the Luxembourg authorities to significantly reduce its tax bill on European sales. Following the raid, a spokesperson for McDonald’s said: “From 2010 to 2014, the McDonald’s companies paid more than €2bn just in corporate taxes in the European Union, with an average tax rate of almost 27%.” AMAZON Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Reuters In 2013 it was revealed the online giant had paid only £10m in UK corporation tax, despite sales in Britain reaching £4.3bn. The commission is scrutinising Amazon’s 2003 tax deal with Luxembourg: Brussels believes it may have allowed Amazon’s European headquarters to lock in a preferentially low tax rate. However, Amazon says it does not receive preferential treatment from Luxembourg. It also insists that it is not based in the duchy – where it has more than 1,000 employees – primarily for tax reasons. STARBUCKS Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images The US coffee chain has said that it has not made a profit in the UK over 15 years despite cumulative sales of £2bn. Up to 2012, it had paid corporation tax of only £8.6m. In 2015, the commission ruled Starbucks had to repay £22.8m of what were described as “illegal” tax breaks. An investigation by the commission showed that a tax ruling issued by the Dutch authorities in 2008 gave a selective advantage to Starbucks Manufacturing in the Netherlands – the company’s European coffee roasting operation – which enabled it to reduce its tax burden. BELGIUM-LINKED MULTINATIONALS In January, the commission concluded that selective tax advantages granted by Belgium under its “excess profit” tax scheme were illegal. The scheme was found to have benefited at least 35 multinationals, which were ordered to return unpaid taxes – estimated to be worth around €700m – to Belgium. Among those required to comply with the order were brewing giant Anheuser-Busch InBev, German chemicals giant BASF, and BP.

Reuters/Brendan McDermid The two most-anticipated laptops of 2016, Microsoft Surface Pro 5 and Apple Macbook Pro 2016, have been subjects of intense speculation by tech enthusiasts. If one is planning to buy any one of the two in near future, making a decision might be difficult as both are amazing devices to possess. Both Microsoft Surface Pro 5 and Apple Macbook Pro 2016 are capable of fulfilling all computing needs. Hence, one cannot go wrong with either of the two. Microsoft Surface Pro 5 It’s hard to outdo this laptop as the upcoming 2-in-1 device from Microsoft is expected to feature the Intel Kaby Lake processors as well as the latest Windows 10 update. It will have a much better battery capacity compared to its predecessor Microsoft Surface Pro 4 and also a better stylus. Fans are expecting an Ultra HD Display of 4K quality and 3,840 × 2,160 pixels screen resolution. The Surface Pro 5 is believed to be a gaming-oriented laptop with AMD graphics processor “Polaris” or NVIDIA’s Pascal. Rumours suggest the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will replace the current AAAA battery-powered stylus with a Surface Pen. Up to now there has been little information as to its release date though an early 2017 release is possible. Some also believe the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will get an October release. For more details, click here. Apple Macbook Pro 2016 Also believed to be released later this year, the Macbook Pro 2016 is expected to receive a massive makeover from its earlier generations. The company has teased “radical changes” such as an ultra-fast second gen USB 3.1. If Apple Macbook Pro 2016 does come with a USB 3.1 support, it would have transfer speeds of up to 10GB/sec, writes GameNGuide. Moreover, the highly-publicised OLED touch bar may replace its function keys. Thunderbolt 3 for the Apple Macbook Pro 2016 is also a possibility. It supports both 10GB/sec USB 3.1 ports as well as DisplayPort 1.2. Intel's new Skylake platform may also be included, which will provide higher CPU powers and better battery life. Experts believe the Apple Macbook Pro 2016 will have the Intel Kaby Lake processor. Apple's Touch ID fingerprint recognition technology is also expected.

 How 'Uber for truckers' Cargomatic burned through $15 million as it quietly pivoted away from being a tech company at all Lara O'Reilly Sep. 4, 2016, 7:25 AM 20,213 facebook linkedin twitter email print Facebook/Cargomatic Cargomatic has had a rough ride in 2016 so far. The Venice, California-based "Uber for truckers" has seen several key members of its staff — including its CEO, CFO, and COO — all head for the exit. It has laid off half of its staff, more than 50 people. Multiple sources inside the company tell Business Insider the company is running out of cash, having struggled to raise funding. They also revealed the company's huge, unpublicized pivot away from the strategy that made it sexy. Now the so-called tech platform relies on data being manually inputted by its staff. The company is currently dependent on just one customer to stay afloat. This is the story of how a once promising tech startup went drastically off course, burning through nearly $15 million in investor money and bank loans while deliberately running the business at a loss. As the company continues to spiral down, one of its cofounders is jetting around the world on vacation and employees use a private Slack channel to look for new jobs. The dream: A tech platform to connect truckers with space in their vehicles with people who want to ship freight quickly In theory, Cargomatic is a really good idea. Trucking is a human-run business, controlled by people calling one another on the phone and sending emails and paperwork manually to confirm that trucks have made their deliveries. Automating that system with software could earn someone a fortune. Cargomatic's core product is an Uber-like service for truckers. It matches companies that need goods moved with truck drivers who are able to move them. Like Uber, it solves the "excess capacity" problem beloved by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. Truckers, like car drivers, often travel from A to B with spare room in their vehicles. Both Uber and Cargomatic simply let those drivers know whether anyone is willing to pay them to occupy the free space. A shipper logs on to Cargomatic.com or one of its apps, enters details about what is in need of shipping, where it is going, and when it needs to get there. Cargomatic pre-verifies its drivers to ensure they have the correct paperwork. Qualified drivers see the job pop up on their app, and the first to click "book it" gets the work. The short-haul "less-than-truckload" business has revenue of about $77 billion a year, on journeys of 200 miles or less. The wider US trucking industry is huge. It is how most freight is transported in the US. In many states, driving accounts for the most workers of any occupation. Venture capitalists have been interested in the space because of the sheer size and fragmentation of the companies within it — there are probably about 500,000 trucking firms, ranging from companies with just two trucks and a phone to huge fleet haulage businesses. About 27 tech startups that match truckers with loads — both full load and less than truckload — have raised more than $180 million in venture backing since 2011, according to the research firm Armstrong & Associates. Some of the biggest trucker/shipping tech startups are Otto, which Uber acquired in August; Convoy; Transfix; Cargo Chief; and Trucker Path. The Los Angeles-based Cargomatic was founded in 2013 by friends Brett Parker and Jonathan Kessler. The two were introduced by Parker's wife. Parker comes from a trucking and logistics family. His father, Allan, owns The Triangle Group, a 44-year-old company that delivers apparel to retailers' distribution centers. The younger Parker grew up working in the family business, and he was the managing partner at the firm from 2009 to 2013. Around 2012, Parker shared an idea with Kessler. As the Los Angeles Times reported in 2014, Parker lamented the time-consuming chore of finding and vetting drivers. He wanted a service that could more quickly connect him to verified drivers. Cargomatic cofounder Jonathan Kessler. LinkedIn Kessler, a perma-tanned marathon runner whom the Los Angeles Times has described as "an adventurer and technology tinkerer who's gone from being an Alaskan fisherman to building button-making machines in Ecuador," was on board with the idea. Kessler was a popular, messianic figure inside the company. One former employee described him as an "electrifying," "first-in, last-out kind of guy." "He was a nice guy to have a beer and a chat with — how could you not like him?" said another, who was more cynical about Kessler but nevertheless appreciated his impact on the company. Cargomatic became the eighth startup in which Kessler had been involved. His most recent startup was a technology company that aimed to connect smartphones with TV sets before the idea of "second screening" had become the norm. According to Kessler's LinkedIn, Hand Eye Technologies raised money, built a proof-of-concept model, and filed provisional patents but pivoted to become a mobile-app development consultancy, working with customers including Nokia, Intel, and Sephora. Before founding Hand Eye in 2006, he was part of the founding team at the audio and video codecs company Camino Networks. Just eight months after Camino was founded, in 2006, Skype bought its parent company, Sonorit, for $27 million in stock (Skype was then owned by eBay). From 2002 to 2005 he was director of client services at the web search and visualization company Groxis, which shut down in 2009. Having spent years trying to make his mark in Silicon Valley, Kessler believed a move south to "Silicon Beach" to create a disruptive shipping logistics company would be the way he could finally hit the big time. Facebook/Cargomatic Cargomatic begins raising money and expanding outside Venice Kessler and Parker raised an undisclosed seed round from Acequia Capital in April 2013, followed by an official $2.6 million seed round in June 2014. The round included participation from the investors including Canaan Partners, SV Angel, Acequia Capital, Structure Capital, Sherpa Capital, and Winklevoss Capital. That year, with about 20 office employees, Cargomatic claimed to run more than 100 deliveries a day, with the average driver hauling more than 1,000 pounds of freight each time, while the average shipper would pay about $120. Cargomatic made money by charging a fee to both sides — the trucker and the shipper — usually about 20% of the transaction. As the business began picking up customers, at the turn of 2015, Cargomatic announced its series A investment, an $8 million round led by Canaan Partners with involvement from 13 other investors. It brought the company's total funding to $12.1 million, though it never publicly revealed a valuation. Cargomatic would go on to use that investment to expand east, launching its first New York office in the summer of 2015. The company hired Dan Harman from the 3D printing company MakerBot, where he was director of international sales, to lead the New York business. In addition to its California roots, Cargomatic now also handled shipments in Greater New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania. In an interview with Crain's magazine announcing the office opening, Harman and Kessler noted the challenges of trucking in New York versus Los Angeles. "'It's logistically quite complex,' Mr. Harman noted. "Trucking lingo also varies by coast. Some terms have entirely different meanings, he said. "Another difference: tolls, which don't exist in Los Angeles. "'We have to deal with water crossings — bridges, tunnels — and massive amounts of traffic,' Mr. Harman said of New York. "'And let’s not forget snow,' Mr. Kessler chimed in. 'We did not have to worry about snow in L.A.' "'Or even rain,' said Mr. Harman." As it turned out, Harman would leave Cargomatic just a year after joining, when the New York office was shut down. Kessler: We are 'a couple of years ahead of rivals' But in 2015, Cargomatic was scaling rapidly. In December the company went on to launch in San Francisco. Asked at the end of 2015 where he saw Cargomatic in five years, Kessler said: "We plan to continue to improve and expand our service in the markets we currently serve, while seeking out opportunities for expansion in other markets in the US and internationally." Kessler became increasingly bombastic in interviews. In an article published this past March with Trucks.com, he dismissed Cargomatic's rivals. First, he was asked about Convoy, a Seattle-based startup that uses tech to connect shippers with truckers. At the time, Convoy had raised $2.5 million in funding from investors including Marc Benioff, Drew Houston, and Bezos Expeditions. Its total equity funding is now at $18.5 million. Of Convoy, Kessler said: "We have more coverage than they do. We're in more places and we've been doing it longer. We know more about the business. We're a couple years ahead of where they are." Kessler added that the rival app Trucker Path was "really just an app for truckers to use to help find truck stops." He called Cargo Chief a "technology-enabled long-haul broker" — Cargomatic didn't compete there because it focused on short-haul shipments. Layoffs hit — half its workers are shown the door A month later, Cargomatic fired half of its staff — about 50 to 60 employees across two rounds of layoffs. Some employees had sensed that something was up when a big recruitment spree — the company was moving so fast on hires that its recruiters could barely keep up — came to a "dead stop" in about February of this year. One former employee told us: "I think everyone had a sense that something was amiss when management implemented a sudden hiring freeze with no explanation. But no one could have expected something of this magnitude. Everyone that was laid off was given no warning whatsoever. They were completely blindsided." When asked for explanations, managers were simply told the company was looking to "do more with less," the source added. In an emailed statement at the time, Kessler told Business Insider: "The Cargomatic marketplace continues to expand and has enjoyed year-over-year growth since our founding in 2013. Key to growing a successful company is knowing where to staff appropriately at different growth phases. Sometimes that means making difficult decisions, and to that end, we recently reduced the size of our marketplace operations and inside sales teams." He added that the reduction in workers had allowed the company to build out its enterprise sales department, pointing to recent hires, and that the company had made additions to its engineering team to "automate tasks that previously had been handled manually." "Cargomatic remains laser-focused on developing world-class technology that provides increased efficiency, transparency, and affordability to the trucking industry," Kessler said. Cargomatic had quietly pivoted away from being an Uber-like app to being a traditional brokerage business Pointing out that Cargomatic had hired enterprise sales staff was telling. Uber doesn't need a sales team. Why would the so-called Uber for truckers? As it turned out, there had been weak demand for Cargomatic's core product. Adoption of the app had been slow, and the challenge of working in the less-than-truckload space is that you need to have density to succeed. Cargomatic instead became a traditional brokerage business, relying on enterprise accounts and calling and taking meetings the old-fashioned way. As DC Velocity pointed out, this saw it enter a crowded segment, and the move "alienated" brokers who had expected to be partners, not competitors, with Cargomatic. In particular, Cargomatic shifted into the "drayage" business — picking up containers from the port. For outside investors, the pivot looked like a success. The average container price was about $550, compared with an average sale of just $40 to $45 on the app. Revenue was growing at a clip. Despite the company's Uber-for-truckers name tag, the majority (sources estimated about 90%) of Cargomatic's business had nothing to do with the app, which now pretty much just functioned as a facade for the underlying brokerage business. It wasn't looking like a tech startup anymore. What's more, while Cargomatic was demonstrating top-line growth, the bottom line was looking seriously unhealthy. One of Cargomatic's clearest flaws was its lack of concern for margins. The sales team could sign up customers at a negative margin yet still receive a bonus, as they were rewarded on billings rather than the actual money brought in for the business, according to former employees. The goal was to take a margin of about 10% from each transaction, but in the desperation to gain and retain customers, those margins were often reduced to the low single digits or fulfilled above cost. One former employee said: "The margins were always negative. You hire me to move freight for you, you pay me $100, but then I need to pay costs that could be $150 to $200. We were actually paying to move freight. That was crazy, in my opinion." At the same time, the sales team was taking bonuses — pushing the negative margins down even further. This kind of behavior — paying for growth to get better penetration and visibility with customers — is reasonable for a large, well-funded startup (like Uber). But there has to be a clear path in which customers can be gradually moved up the price scale, or costs moved down, so that in the long run the extra volume of business the company acquires becomes profitable. There's a clear problem with this strategy in trucking: What if the new business doesn't lead to repeat customers? Lots of Cargomatic's customers were simply businesses that needed to move excess freight. It's a random, rather than cyclical, need that would not guarantee repeat sales. Selling is fun here, Monday inside sales day. #mondayfunday #teamcargomatic A photo posted by Cargomatic (@cargomatic) on May 4, 2015 at 4:41pm PDT on May 4, 2015 at 4:41pm PDT Cargomatic struggles to raise a series B, and Kessler is ousted as CEO Investors took notice. In 2016, Kessler was charged with pitching the company around Silicon Valley with the hope of raising a series B round. "Investors would look at the top line, but they would also look at the profitability of our accounts and saw we were super top-heavy — savvy investors saw that," one former employee said. Kessler was ousted from the CEO role in May, about a month after the layoffs, by the Cargomatic board. The company said he had moved to the position of chief product officer while remaining on the board. Parker, the cofounder and president, sent Business Insider this statement at the time: "It is common in the maturation of a fast-growth technology company to have the visionary founder move to a new role. The change does not affect our continued expansion and our prospects have never been more positive. With the backing of Canaan Partners, the recent addition of seasoned logistics executives and an increased focus on enterprise sales, we are poised for growth in 2016 and beyond." But in reality, the "adventurer" Kessler booked out and traveled the world, as chronicled on his Instagram account. Another amazing part of the world. The S. Tyrol, Merano, Italy. More German than Italian. Great people ridiculously good food and amazing hot spring. Basically a mountain paradise. #whatawonderfulworld A photo posted by Jonathan Kessler (@jkessler178) on Jul 28, 2016 at 7:54am PDT on Jul 28, 2016 at 7:54am PDT Kessler's exit hit many employees hard. When Kessler left, a part of the culture disappeared from the young startup too. Board member Richard Gerstein becomes the de facto CEO In his absence, new leadership came in from the outside. Richard Gerstein, a board member, whose title was executive chairman, became the de facto CEO (though he's not listed on the company's website). Gerstein — who was barely seen in the office and would instead conduct team meetings over video call, as he was often abroad dealing with his other businesses — was not as popular among the majority of staff members, and neither was Parker, whose position now seemed elevated. A former employee described Gerstein as an "old-school guy." He is a president at the venture-capital firm Finca LLC. Before that he had worked at the international rail logistics firm IntelliTrans for 22 years. Sources said he was not particularly interested in the tech side of the business — the part that drew many employees to work there — whether it was the type of product Cargomatic was trying to sell or the kind of tools the company was using. He wasn't happy Cargomatic was using the human-resources software Zenefits, for example, telling employees in one meeting that he would prefer that all employee information be kept in a filing cabinet. One former employee said: "If you watch a movie about the cliché American boss, who just wants to fire everyone, he's that cliché American boss. He's not a leader or an entrepreneur — he's a boss." Brett Parker, Cargomatic cofounder. LinkedIn Former employees described Parker, who at least was in the office every day, unless he was at meetings, and who did have a small group of allies within the company, as an internally competitive salesman whose bonus structure was "legendary." Like the rest of the sales team, he was rewarded based on gross sales rather than profitability. Parker attached himself to some of the largest accounts Cargomatic had on its books. But some former employees criticized his sales technique. One said: "In these meetings he would say: 'This is what we do and how we are trying to change the industry,' but they were more infomercials. Sales don't come from those meetings. We got no sales — we just got business cards." Another said of his style: "He has the tendency of saying a lot and letting everyone get confused and not relaying anything ... he is disorganized, barely understands the tech world. He can't sell to tech-oriented people nor explain it to nontechies." 'We were throwing out everything that made Cargomatic sexy' and 'real-time' data was inputted manually One of Gerstein's first major moves was to fire the company's popular chief operating officer, Sean Whiteley, a tech executive the company had hired in June 2015 from the secure healthcare messaging startup TigerText. It was another decision from the board that didn't go down well with employees. One former employee described Whiteley as "a very good person, a solid guy: honest and trustworthy." Another said: "Sean is really popular around LA. He's really well-known around here and he is an awesome dude, very energetic." Senior workers began leaving in droves. Notable departures included the vice president of operations and the vice president of engineering. Staff members were increasingly unhappy that Cargomatic was moving away from being a tech company and that the senior management, most of whom now had experience only in the old-school logistics industry, were trying to turn it into a traditional logistics setup. "We [were] throwing out everything that made Cargomatic sexy and replacing it into a simple logistics company," one former employee told Business Insider. Catered lunch days be the best days, made better today buy a surprise 🍕 delivery by one of our hardest working drivers! A photo posted by Cargomatic (@cargomatic) on Mar 24, 2016 at 11:57am PDT on Mar 24, 2016 at 11:57am PDT Most freight companies don't use any kind of tech platform — they know when something arrives at the warehouse because the warehouse manager calls them to let them know the delivery has arrived. The dream of Cargomatic would be to offer customers real-time data so they knew exactly where their shipments were. Customers fell in love with the idea that they could see their shipment on the way to its location in real-time. It wasn't the reality. Cargomatic workers would manually input the data each day. Rather than being integrated, shipping data from the Los Angeles port, for example, was grabbed manually and put into the shell of the product. When the warehouse manager made the call, a Cargomatic employee would update the system manually. "Yes. Everything was manual," a source told us. "Our mobile applications were constantly sending the wrong type of data, and the operations team need to fix them all the time inside the system. Our containers system was just a glorified spreadsheet where nothing is automated." Another said: "It was a show-game. Customers thought this process was automated, but we were asking people behind-the-scenes to make it look automated." Rather than develop its own trucker management system, or TMS, for example, which the engineering team had been working on, Cargomatic began licensing a software package called MercuryGate instead. Before he was forced out of the company, Whiteley had advocated that if Cargomatic wasn't going to create its own software, it could at least opt for a better-known platform that more of its customers used instead. But he was overruled by the rest of the board. Gerstein also happens to sit on the board of MercuryGate. There were other operational issues. Customers kept disputing their bills. Cargomatic threw temporary accountants at the issue. Workers even nicknamed them "temporary accountant one," "temporary accountant two," as so many temps flew in and out of the building asking questions. "It was an absolute clusterf---," one former employee said. As Cargomatic's situation became increasingly messy, sources within the company told us customers were left in the dark about the changes. One former employee said: "It's not being communicated at all. Richard told everyone ... that we should never ever talk to the media and never talk to customers about what's happening inside the company." This reporter's name was mentioned specifically as a member of the media whom staff members shouldn't speak with. A source told us that Parker mentioned this so often that employees were increasingly suspicious he had been the source of the leak for Business Insider's initial layoffs story earlier this year. 'You'd sit in a meeting and the lights were out in the room' With the company's popular leader on vacation and other employees heading for the exit of their own volition, the mood within the company was bleak. "Morale is so low that people are coming in mostly to collect their paychecks and wait for the inevitable," an employee told us in July. "We have a private Slack channel in which we circulate possible job positions, ask for referrals, and vent about the lack of management inside the company." A former employee said: "You'd sit in a meeting and the lights were out around the room. They were disengaged — everyone was in their own battle. Some of these people I felt sorry for. They'd take on a job, sign a one-year lease on an apartment in an expensive area, then find out later they were out of a job. It was a tough place to be. It was very difficult on staff to be in an expensive area and at a company that was floundering." At the same time, one customer was kept incredibly well-informed of Cargomatic's operations. CEVA Logistics, a transportation and logistics company with offices in more than 160 countries, became Cargomatic's biggest customer. CEVA operations personnel were often seen inside the Cargomatic offices. Routes for truckers were planned within CEVA's office. The rumor among the staff was that Cargomatic was actively trying to be bought by CEVA — a huge company, but another account that was also being run at a negative margin. "I'm pretty sure Richard will make Cargomatic worth something, even if that means killing the business and getting acquired by CEVA," a former employee told us. A CEVA representative said the company does not comment on its suppliers or speculation. Just 2 months of cash left Cargomatic secured a bridge round of a couple of million dollars at the beginning of the year, plus a $3 million bank loan, according to a source. The company's runway was supposed to last through November. But in August, The Wall Street Journal reported that Seth Klein, the company's interim chief financial officer, had resigned and that Cargomatic had just two months' worth of cash left. Hrach Simonian, general partner at Canaan Partners. Canaan Partners Hrach Simonian, who sits on the Cargomatic board and is a general partner at its biggest investor, Canaan, brushed the matter off. He told The Journal: "The fact that there's two months of cash left is irrelevant. They have [an] indefinite runway … There will absolutely be a new cash infusion in the company in short order." Simonian's other deals at Canaan include the grocery delivery service Instacart, the crowdsourced real-estate data startup Compstak, the real-estate crowdfunding company RealtyMogul.com, and Washio, the Los Angeles-based on-demand laundry service that went out of business earlier this week. Gerstein told The Journal, with an attitude somewhat indicative of his opinion on tech: "There's a perception in Silicon Valley that you can just start with a blank piece of paper and you don't need to know the rules. That might work in some industries, but not in freight transportation. To scale this company, we need people who have knowledge of the traditional technology in manufacturing and distribution." The day the article was published, Gerstein held an all-hands meeting, dialing in from abroad. According to sources, Gerstein berated staff about the Journal article and told them they shouldn't be talking to the media about the company. Gerstein named random people in the room and demanded they repeat back to him what he had just said. "He treated them like children," a source with knowledge of the call told Business Insider. Right now, it's unclear what will happen to Cargomatic. It has no CEO, no CFO, and no COO. Gerstein is only in the office about once a month. Many current employees are planning their exits, and the mood inside the office is increasingly sour, according to sources. There is no sign of a series B. A source estimated that "99%" of Cargomatic's business now comes from CEVA and only CEVA. Parker, Kessler, Gerstein, and Simonian did not respond to Business Insider's repeated requests for comment. Ricardo Salgado, the CEO of the on-demand truckload shipping startup Loadsmart, said he hoped the issues at Cargomatic did not cast a shadow over other companies claiming to be the "Uber for X." He outlined some of the challenges in the area. "The industry is changing rapidly because of new technology, but the adoption curve is slow," Salgado said. "This is not an industry where you have a Snapchat, where you give the app access to your contacts, and have 150 million active users. It's B2B and adoption is lower." "Lots of people describe themselves as the 'Uber for trucking,' but I disagree with that completely because moving people is much easier. With Uber, you just have the rider and the driver — two parties. And one in every 200 times there's an operational issue — the rider left their cell phone in the car and he just writes to support@uber.com and they figure it out. "When you're moving freight, you have six different players touching the cargo. The cargo is worth X, there's insurance, the driver, the dispatcher, pickup at the warehouse, drop-off with the warehouse manager, sometimes there's a broker, a shipper. Things happen all the time — the cargo is not ready, the truck broke down, the driver needs to rest because he drove 12 hours — all that type of stuff makes it more complex than on the consumer side." So what does the future look like for Cargomatic? One former employee predicted: "Cargomatic will shrink a lot. It will focus a lot more on being a logistics brand, using third-party software, or just using whatever they had before, then eventually get sold or fold."

It may sound true theoretically, but somehow, there is a wide gap between the two. Successful teams, enterprises, global networks and organizations that innovate routinely are able to do it only when they snub conventional notions of innovating. Unfortunately, leaders focus more on building innovative cultures to amplify creative agility than pay attention to how people in a group think. While they understand that innovation comes from the diversity of thought and conflict, they fail to leverage on the two. So, how do leaders reconfigure to animate a community where people innovative together? Innovation When Done Right Innovation requires inclusive decision-making that allows all kinds of solutions to be embraced. It comes in many forms for all kinds of purposes. In some organizations, take for example Intel Corp., innovation can become a necessity to survive and thrive. In some cases, it can become a way of organizing, take for example Apple’s recent move of dropping the ‘store’ from ‘Apple’ stores. But, what enables people to withstand conflict and tension in order to reach to inclusive decision-making for the sole purpose of innovation? Leadership, in many ways, is a paradox. On one side, it requires talents and passions, while on the other, it requires harnessing the power of collective effort. It requires leading innovation, encouraging team members to support one another, and at the same time challenge each other through creative abrasion. As a matter of fact, leading innovation requires re-organizing a team’s priorities, values, and collective action. Leaders must understand that at the heart of leading innovation lies three most essential principles: Collaborative Organizations Studies report that innovation is a group effort. It requires more than just an interplay of ideas that occur during group discussions of people from varied backgrounds and experiences and POVs. Creative collaboration is the backbone of every effort focused on driving innovation. Drive Decision-Making Decision-making requires that leaders actively explore every option laid out on the table. This means that sometimes, leaders have to do more than just opposing those options. It is only through collaborative interaction where every leader shares their version of the option, that a team can integrate proper decision-making. Learning-Driven Organizations Innovation requires problem-solving. In order to instill a learning-driven culture into the organization, leaders must not punish people for trying out new things. Rather, a process of trial and error, learning and adapting should be embraced. Now you know why some teams fail and some teams succeed. In the end, everything boils down to great leadership. In order to thrive in today’s competitive environment, leaders must seek followers who’re more than willing to foster experimentation and provoke challenges through continuous learning. But, first of all, leaders must create the kind of an innovative work culture where people want to belong. After all, leaders are the social architect of today’s workplace.

Richard Brian/Las Vegas Review-Journal Follow @vegasphotograph By NICOLE RAZ LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL About 4,000 people and close to 160 exhibitors are expected to attend InterDrone, a conference dedicated to commercial drones. Representatives from Nevada’s drone industry will be there keeping a close eye on the next industry disruptors and potential business opportunities. “The whole field is advancing so fast, everybody keeps leapfrogging each other,” said InterDrone Chairman Ted Bahr. InterDrone, which will run Wednesday through Friday at Paris Las Vegas, is going to be a cascade of new technology announcements in the commercial drone space. It is open to the public for a fee. Leading drone manufacturer Yuneec, will be introducing “the breeze,” a drone made for taking video and images that can be shared via social media through an accompanying app. Intel will be showing the first public demonstration of Aero, Bahr said, which is a ready-to-fly drone sold with a development kit targeting software developers. Drone design company Skye Intelligence will unveil Orbit, marketed as “the world’s first social sharing, autonomous drone that follows you on demand.” Drone-servicing companies will also be unveiling new technologies, including Intelligent Energy, which will be exhibiting a fuel cell hydrogen powered drone prototype. While people are checking out exhibitors there will also be a variety of classes or panels happening at the same time. “We have over 120 classes and panels,” Bahr said. “It’s really a full place of different options that people can choose from. There are eight classes or panels in every time slot.” Thomas Wilczek, the defense aerospace industry representative at the governor’s economic development office will moderate a panel Friday about opportunities for minorities in the commercial drone industry. “We’re very excited that Nevada is going to be there with a booth and moderating a panel,” said Wilczek. “Nevada, Las Vegas, Reno — we’re getting noticed, and we will continue to push the envelope in every way possible to continue to spread that message (that Nevada is a great place for the unmanned aerial system, or UAS, industry).” Wilczek said he is most looking forward to “the opportunity to find more opportunity” in speaking with the shakers and movers in the commercial UAS industry who will be at InterDrone. One of the next big business opportunities for the state is in the emerging field of counter-UAS, which is the commercial drone development of defense systems against UAS threats. “Drones are getting smaller and smaller, and as they get smaller companies have to look at what is the technology to prevent them from moving into spaces that are high security, or critical infrastructure,” said Chris Walach, director of the FAA-designated Nevada Unmanned Aviation Test Site and the director of technical operations for the Nevada Institute of Autonomous Systems. NIAS works with the governor’s economic development office and acts as a clearinghouse for drone-related business opportunities. “We already have cyberattacks on our computers and cyberinfrastructure, and now you’re going to see a higher cybersecurity involvement in drones,” Walach said. “All of the IT (information technology) companies in Nevada — when they hear ‘counter-UAS’ their eyes light up because they know this is the next frontier for their company.” Technology is being developed that will allow drones to disable other drones that pose a threat out of the sky by taking control of their radio frequency signal, Walach said. “Or, there’s certain technology that, when this little drone is flying, they (the defense drone) can shoot it out of the sky, and then it’s toast as well,” he said. Walach said he is also looking forward to seeing new developments in data processing technology from drones. Right now, he said there’s not a great way to transfer data from drones to the cloud, a server, or brick-and-mortar facility in a timely and organized way. “Where the Nevada test site, and where NIAS, is going we feel we will be very much part of disrupting that future technology,” he said. This week’s InterDrone conference is the second-ever. Last year there were 2,797 attendees with nearly 100 exhibiting companies. Contact Nicole Raz at nraz@reviewjournal.com or 702-380-4512.

New IOWait Boosting Patches For Intel P-State, Schedutil Written by Michael Larabel in Hardware on 3 September 2016 at 03:16 PM EDT. 2 Comments Linux power management and ACPI maintainer Rafael Wysocki has published a set of new "iowait boost" patches for P-State and Schedutil that he's looking to see benchmarked by interested parties. If you didn't read the article about the IOWait Boost patches from a few weeks ago, see P-State Algorithm Change, Schedutil IOWait Boosting. With the four patches published on Friday, there is iowait boost support for the Intel P-State scaling driver and CPUFreq's Schedutil governor. The four patches can be found on the kernel mailing list. I'll try to find the time this weekend to patch a test kernel and see how these patches are doing and if they affect the performance for any of our workloads of interest. The algorithm change for P-State should be particularly interesting. 2 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience. Michael has written more than 10,000 articles covering the state of Linux hardware support, Linux performance, graphics drivers, and other topics.

CES kicks off the year in January, Mobile World Congress sets the pace for spring, Computex sets the agenda in the summer, and IFA has become the big show to watch each Labor Day weekend. And this year it’s bigger than ever. To cover IFA 2016, Digital Trends sent its biggest crew to date. Nine of our best editors, video producers, and writers have been scouring the show floor in Berlin this week to bring you the latest major tech from companies like Samsung, Lenovo, Huawei, LG, Sharp, Philips, ZTE, and many more. We’ve seen it all and had a blast writing, tweeting, and covering the show live on Facebook for you all. It took us a few days, and some intense deliberation, but we’ve put our heads together and finally picked our favorites from the show. Without further ado, here’s our Top Tech picks of IFA 2016 in each major tech category. Best of Show: Lenovo Yoga Book For years, we’ve seen sci-fi movies, designers, and futurists dream of a device with a massive touch surface that doubles as a keyboard. Now it’s reality. The Yoga Book is that device. Actually, it’s more. The touch surface is not only a keyboard but also, well, a touch surface, usable with finger and stylus. That makes it easy to jot down notes, something that’s now possible without touching the display itself – though, you can still do that, too. You might expect such forward-thinking tech to cost a fortune. It doesn’t. The Yoga Book with Android is $500, and with Windows 10, it’s $550. It’s even light, thin, well built, and features a beautiful 1,920 x 1,200 pixel display. It’s not just a solid 2-in-1. It’s a visionary concept that hints at how smartphones, tablets, and notebooks could coverage. – Matt Smith Audio: Audeze iSine 10 Audeze is on a roll right now. So far, every Planar Magnetic headphone has been a hit with reviewers and headphone lovers alike. That trend will likely continue with the new iSine 10 announced at IFA 2016, the first single-driver planar magnetic in-ear headphones ever made. We had a chance to give the iSine 10 a listen on the show floor, and although their open-backed design let a lot of the surrounding noise through we could very clearly hear how wonderful they sounded. Bass is immense and deep, the mid range is lush and transparent, and treble is crystal clear with not so much as a hint of harshness. Top to bottom, the iSine 10 are a luscious sounding headphone. Toss in the conventional 3.5 mm headphone cable and Apple Lightning cable with built-in DAC and amplifier, along with the price tag of $400, and you have an easy winner for our audio category. – Caleb Denison Computing: Lenovo Yoga 910 The Lenovo Yoga 910 isn’t an innovative notebook. Lenovo came up with the Yoga concept about four years ago, and even the watchband hinge has been around for years. Yet the 910 is a strong contender, and noteworthy 2-in-1, because it brings many innovations together in one, complete package. It has everything, including: 7th-generation Intel Core processor, thin-bezel display, 4K resolution, PCI Express solid state drive, and USB-Type C. All of that’s wrapped into a system that’s less than 15 millimeters thick, and available for $1,300. It’s a powerhouse, yet it’s also a system you can take anywhere. And that makes it a winner. – Matt Smith Cool Tech: Yuneec Breeze There were a lot of drones at IFA this year, but even among a sea of incredible UAVs, Yuneec’s Breeze drone stood out. Why? Well for starters, it’s the first 4K camera drone from a major manufacturer that you can get your hands on for under 500 bucks. But that’s not the only reason we picked it. This little whippersnapper also boasts a range of automated flight modes (follow me, orbit, selfie, and more) that are normally only available in much more expensive hardware. Basically, it’s a highly capable camera drone designed for casual pilots instead of hobbyists. It gives average Joes an easy way to snag eye-popping aerial video, and for a reasonable price, too. – Drew Prindle Cool Tech: Botscan Botspot’s giant 3D scanner, the Botscan, is absolutely ridiculous. The company claims that it’s one of the most advanced 3D scanners in the world — and after stepping inside it and seeing what it can do, we definitely believe them. Botscan is essentially a cylindrical room with walls made of light and a series of high-resolution DSLR cameras. With this setup, and a technique called photogrammetry, Botscan can capture insanely detailed scans of practically anything — people, products, or even cars. These scans can then be used for 3D modeling, developing prosthetics, virtual shopping, or even architecture. – Drew Prindle Home: LG InstaView Signature Fridge It was pretty cool when LG let you knock on a fridge’s opaque surface to turn it transparent, letting you scout for snacks without letting a ton of air inside the appliance. But soon, there will be a third face to the InstaView Signature fridge: Windows 10. Late next year, LG will roll out a smart version, and essentially the entire right top door will be a computer. Stream Pandora, tag food with expiration dates, and leave notes from your family, or just leave it on the opaque setting to give the illusion that this is any old refrigerator. LG plans to open the platform to developers, so hopefully by the time the fridge is available, it will have even more tricks hidden behind its black surface. – Jenny McGrath Home: Netatmo Smart Valve Sure, smart thermostats are neat, but apartment dwellers often can’t make use of them — especially if their heat comes out of radiators. Netatmo debuted its Smart Valve at IFA, and a lot of renters might see the value in it (as in, it should save them some bucks on their heating bill). It replaces your standard radiator knob with an attractive piece of hardware that works in concert with the Netatmo thermostat. But even if you don’t have access to your building’s thermostat, the valve will still work with your phone via a bridge. Best of all? It’s pretty easy to install and uninstall, so you can take it with you when you move. – Jenny McGrath Latin Innovation: Solidmation Solidmation is an Argentinean company that locally designs, develops, and produces IoT solutions for the home automation industry. And the company is at IFA to introduce a new portfolio of connected-home devices focused on comfort and energy saving. The platform lets you control almost any electrical appliance at home with a smartphone app. To use it, you need only a Wi-Fi connection and a Solidmation device connected to the appliance (your current light bulb, a curtain, the air conditioner or thermostat, a coffeemaker, etc.). By adding Solidmation devices, you add intelligence to your current appliances. The company just introduced its Wi-Fi solutions to the Argentinean retail market and looks forward to finding suitable partners to enter other markets. This is clearly a company to watch. – Juan Garcia Mobile: ZTE Axon 7 Mini When ZTE released the Axon 7 earlier this year, it impressed us with a svelte, curved, metal body and a very reasonable price. The Axon 7 Mini boasts the same sexy design and snappy performance, but every element has been scaled down, including the price. The 5.2-inch, 1080p screen looks crisp and vivid, and the octa-core Snapdragon is backed by 3GB of RAM offering plenty of power, but the real star of the show is the Axon’s audio quality. The dual front-facing speakers are impressively loud, and through headphones the sound really sings, with punchy bass that never gets boomy, and clean, crisp highs. – Malarie Gokey Video: Philips 901F 4K UHD OLED TV At IFA 2015, Panasonic emerged as the first tier-one TV maker to take on LG with an OLED TV — and this year Dutch electronics outfit Philips joined the party. The 55-inch 901F offers 4K Ultra HD resolution, high dynamic range (HDR), a 6.1-speaker system developed with Dolby, and the Android TV platform powered by a quad-core processor. The 901F’s black levels are exactly what you’d expect from an OLED TV, and its colors looked vibrant and well-saturated in the short demo reel Philips had running. What really makes this OLED TV stand out, however, doesn’t have anything to do with its picture quality: the Philips Ambilight system. The 901F is also priced pretty well for an OLED TV at $4,500. We’re glad to see LG getting some more competition, as competition has a way of driving down prices – we’ll gladly take more affordable OLED TVs, thanks very much. Also, Philips was the only major TV manufacturer to unveil a new TV at IFA 2016, making it a shoe-in for our Best of IFA award in the video category. – Caleb Denison Wearables: Samsung Gear S3 Frontier We were impressed by the Gear S2’s debut last year, but Samsung has not rested on its laurels. The Gear S3 Frontier joined the smartwatch family at this year’s IFA and offers significant improvements over its predecessor. Samsung consulted Swiss watchmakers to create a design that feels and looks like classic wristwear. Coupled with the always-on display and a veritable feast of watch faces, the Gear S3 is easily mistaken for an analog watch, but it’s actually one of the most powerful and versatile smartwatches we’ve ever seen. Everything that worked so well in the S2 has been retained, including the innovative rotating bezel and Tizen interface, but Samsung also worked in support for Samsung Pay, more apps, a bigger battery, and an LTE option that allows you to leave your phone at home. – Simon Hill Share

I’m gonna leave a link to this, as well as everything in the bag, in the description below, but if you’re wanting to look this up on your own, it’s spelled N-R-G. Here’s what’s special about it. This is a bag built for gadgets. It’s ridiculously spacious, water resistant, and can charge  your gadgets when you’re on the go. More on that in a bit. You might be wondering why I called this the What’s in my Bag: Overkill edition, and you’re about to find out. As most of you know, I work from home, and creating tech content like this video is what I do for a living. What that means is, when I am on the go, it’s because I am leaving town - and that means I need everything necessary to keep the content flowing for you guys. Let’s start in the front pocket. Oh, and remember how I said this bag can charge up your gadgets? There’s a 7000mAh removable battery built in to this bag. It can be removed to be charged, or you can just open up the power port on the side of the bag and plug the AC adapter into there. The battery powers the USB port on the side of the backpack, which can charge up any smartphone or tablet. Even cooler, on the inside you’ll find built-in Lightning, microUSB, and Apple 30-pin charging cables, all of which are directly connected to the power in the bag as well. So, you are covered regardless of the device you have on you, and that’s pretty cool. MACBOOK Of course, when I’m on the go, I need my mobile workstation, and in this instance, that’s the 2016 MacBook. I’ve got the Rose Gold model with the upgraded 1.3GHz Intel Core M7 processor and 512GB of storage. I’ll be bringing you my review of Apple’s latest MacBook soon, but in my early tests it beats last years model easily. IPAD PRO In addition to the MacBook, I also keep a 12.9-inch LTE iPad Pro in my bag as well. Sometimes I just wanna use iOS apps to connect to my TiVo to watch shows, or stream Netflix, Hulu, or just play a game. Of course I’ve got the smart keyboard connected in case I also wanna get some work done... But yes, sometimes I don’t need the larger form factor, and therefore I ALSO have the 9.7-inch LTE iPad Pro with me as well. The larger model pretty much needs to be on a table or desk to be useable, and this smaller version is fine in the hands, and has that fresh True Tone display as well, which is great for reading. KINDLE OASIS That said, if I really wanna get some reading done without distractions or the temptation of other apps, I also have a Kindle e-reader in my bag at all times. RIght now, it’s the brand new Kindle Oasis, which Amazon just released last week. I’m a fan of this because it includes a leather charging cover, and a fully charged Kindle Oasis and Oasis case provides a ridiculous multi-month battery life. APPLE PENCIL Since I’ve got two iPad Pro units in my bag, it only makes sense that I’d also bring along the accessories that make the iPad Pro an iPad Pro. The Apple Pencil is definitely part of that equation, coming in handy when I’m making those sick YouTube thumbnails on the go. PowerAdd Slim2 CHARGER This small charger by PowerAdd sports 5000mAh of power, enough to recharge a current smartphone almost twice, and it’s not too big to fit into a pocket if you need to charge up while using your device. It’s also not too expensive at all at just $10. ANKER CHARGER But when I need more power, or to charge more than one device, this Anker charger is my go to. It’s sleek and slim, looks great, has 3 USB ports, a built-in flashlight, and has an incredible 20100mAh battery on the inside. You can even use this to charge the MacBook over USB-C. NINTENDO 3DS I’ve got the New Nintendo 3DS to take care of boredom on flights, as well as to give me an opportunity to get some gaming in since I’m so busy as home making videos nonstop. Specifically, this is the limited edition Legend of Zelda Majora’s Mask console. CABLES Of course, I need to have every cable that I may possibly need, because, you never know, right? Ethernet, Lightning, microUSB, mini USB, USB-C, etc. I’ve also got some USB-C dongles for the MacBook, in case I need to plug in a standard USB device or HDMI cable. IPHONE SE - VRS Design Case In the back pocket found on the rear of the NRG bag, I usually store a couple of extra smartphones. I’m usually reviewing and testing multiple models, and this is a great place to keep them protected. Here I have the iPhone SE, although you probably wouldn’t know it due to the unique case. This is actually another case from VRS Design, which can also hold some card or cash. Just like the LG G5, VRS design makes some sweet cases for iPhones as well. I’ll have more on these iPhone SE cases in a future video, so look out for that one. LG G5 - VRS Design Case Here I’ve got the LG G5, the latest flagship from LG. I keep that on me  in order to compare smartphones when I am doing reviews on the go. If you’re thinking about picking up the LG G5, I’ll leave a link to my full review video for you to check out. Oh, and to keep it protected, I’ve got it in a case from VRS Design. This one is called the High Pro Shield, and it’s two pieces - one soft piece that protects the phone from shock, and a hard bumper that goes around it. I’ve been trying out a bunch of different cases from VRS Design lately, and I’m a big fan of both the look and the quality of their designs. In fact, I’ll show you another one a little later on. If you need a case for your LG G5, VRS Design cases start at about $11. HTC 10 This is the HTC 10, and if you’ve been following my channel, you know that I picked my review unit up from the launch party that took place in New York City a couple of weeks ago. I’m just about done with my full review of the HTC 10, and while you wait for that, feel free to check out my coverage from the launch party, as well as my picks for the top 5 features on this device. NECTAR GLASSES: Dank Depending on where I’m going, sunglasses could be a necessity. I like to keep a pair of stylish but inexpensive shades with me at all times, just in case. I keep my more expensive sunglasses in my car, so when I’m on the go, I’m all about Nectar Sunglasses. Here you see the Dank edition Sunnies, which cost just $30. Moment Case and Lenses Moment Lenses and the accompanying Moment Case are invaluable tools for getting fantastic photos and videos using my iPhone 6S Plus (which isn’t in my bag because it’s home is my back pocket.) You insert the iPhone into the Moment Case, which is communicates with over Bluetooth, and provides a nice camera grip and shutter button. I have three lenses, all of which are premium glass. One is a wide angle, one is telephoto, and the last is a macro. Earin headphones I’m testing these Earin headphones. They are completely wireless Bluetooth earbuds. No wire to plug into your device, and no wire connected the two ear pieces. They’re decent so far, but audio drop outs on one ear or the other can get annoying. Still, many think wireless earbuds are the future, so I’m keeping my eye on this space. LSTN Wembley bamboo earbuds These LSTN Wembley earbuds are some of the best in-ears I have ever had the pleasure of listening to, which is why I’m not totally sold on the idea of completely wireless buds just yet. I’m usually more a fan of over-ear headphones, but I agreed to try out the LSTN buds and was immediately blown away by how great they sound - and the bamboo wood construction is beautiful. They’re noise-isolating and electro-acoustically tuned to produce high-end sounds quality at any volume, and the real wood housing provides a rich, full sound. Even better, your purchase helps support LSTN and Starkey Hearing Foundation’s mission to help restore hearing worldwide. Belkin SurgePlus USB Swivel Charger The Belkin SurgePlus has been a lifesaver, and it has had a spot in my travel bag for about 8 years. It plugs into a standard outlet, and provides you with three surge-protected AC outlets, as well as two USB charging ports. WHen you’re in a hotel room and outlets are scarce, the SurgePlus quickly becomes your best friend. Mophie Juice Pack When I’m on the go and don’t need to carry my bag with me, I look to the Mophie Juice Pack to keep my iPhone 6S running all day. It does double as a protective case, but that’s not why I use it - I just wanna be able to go from morning til late at night when I’m at these influencer events, and the Juice Pack means I don’t need to find an outlet. Audeze EL-8 Titanium This might be my favorite thing in my bag - the Audeze EL-8 headphones. World’s First Headphones With Fully Integrated Apple Lightning Cable. The EL-8 Titanium headphones come with an exclusive lightning cable that streams a complete 24-bit digital signal through a high quality DSP and DAC to offer better sound quality. The built in microphone can be used for phone calls and is SIRI compatible. An accompanying Audeze app can be used to apply EQ and sound presets. For non- Apple device compatibility, the headphones also include a standard analog cable. PlugBug PlugBug piggybacks onto your MacBook Power Adapter, creating a one-of-a-kind, dual charger for MacBook + USB devices like an iPhone or iPad, or really any USB-powered device. A newer model includes five international snap-on plugs and doubles as an international, stand-alone USB charger for iPhone and iPad. SanDisk USB-C Dual Flash Drive It has 32GB of storage, and the cool thing is that it can be plugged into both standard USB ports, as well as newer USB-C ports like the one found on the MacBook. That makes it easy to get files from one system to another, regardless of which USB type it supports. There you have it guys, that was your look inside my tech bag. I’m curious what you thought - I know I said it was overkill, but do you agree? Do you keep your bag nice and light, or are you hauling around even more stuff than I am? Hit me in the comments and let me know.

Smart home solutions are an increasingly essential component for a growing number of households, with companies like Panasonic, Intel, Vivint and Google's Nest taking note. Just last month, U.S. water technology company Xylem said it would buy Sensus USA, a smart meter provider, for $1.7 billion in cash. CB Insights noted in a recent report that at least 67 private companies are operating in the smart home space, with a growing number of start-ups on track to pull in $526 million this year. As a result, owning the next "big" thing has made smart home products an easy purchase for many consumers. A 2015 survey by icontrol showed that 50 percent of consumers say they intend to purchase at least one smart home product within the year. And Gartner Research recently predicted that the typical home could consist of up to 500 smart home devices by the year 2022. CNBC recently took a look at the wide universe of smart home gadgets — which typically run the gamut from lawn maintenance systems to washing machines to solar panels — and found some cool compact versions. By Bryant McInerney and CNBC's Javier E. David Additional reporting by Tyler Eyre Posted 3 Sept. 2016 The universal remote that does everything but cook Source: Savant Universal device controllers have been around for years, but Massachusetts-based Savant takes it to another level with the Savant Remote. Sleek and futuristic, the $499 device operates by either touch or voice, and is compatible with some 380,000 different entertainment devices. With a few add-ons, the Savant wirelessly controls room lighting, television, disc/BluRay players as well as Wi-Fi speakers such as Sonos (whose ability to surround a room in sound is belied by its compact frame). One of the unit's catchiest hooks is its ability to preprogram — like a television set automatically tuning to the news in the morning, or dimming lighting and jazz playing in the evening — to create what the company calls "instant ambiance" in any room with just the tap of a button or a voice command. 'Both functional and fun' Source: Roobo In June, Chinese artificial intelligence start-up Roobo pulled back the curtain on an artificial intelligence-powered "pet robot" named Domgy. An affectionate anagram of the phrase "my dog," Domgy could be yanked from an episode of the classic "Jetsons" cartoon — even though its functions are more like robotic housekeeper Rosie than the family's pet dog Astro. Domgy won't require long walks, feedings or bathroom breaks. The artificial intelligence powered pet has "smart-home" accouterments that include weather forecasts, remote control and guard-dog capabilities. Domgy has face recognition tech that can identify strangers, and even warns owners if an intruder enters the home. The pet's rechargeable battery lasts four to six hours and will automatically find its way to the charging station. Anthony Chen, Roobo's marketing director, told CNBC recently that "Unlike a lot of consumer robots on the market, it's both functional and fun." Domgy is expected to be released this fall at a price to be determined. A $240 light bulb? Source: Sony Light bulbs have come a long way since the days of Thomas Edison, a fact Sony shows with its efficient new LED, which is smarter than the average bulb. This invention lights up a room as well as a user's ears: The bulb is a combination of a 2 watt Bluetooth controlled 3.0 speaker and an LED light bulb. It has the added bonus of connecting to smartphones and computers through a physical adapter, or controlled by a palm-sized controller to adjust brightness and volume. Along with playing music, the speaker bulb has a timer function that can set off a mini light show for a morning wake-up call. With a range of over 190 colors and 32 brightness levels, the LED can change the mood in the room with just a few touches. The LED bulb is being sold for $239.99. Energy Sense-ability MATTHEW GUILLORY | Sense In a world that has become completely dependent on electronics — and can put a strain on the average homeowner's energy bill — Sense has found a way to help your wallet and the environment. Its new Energy Monitor connects wirelessly, tracks the energy output of your biggest energy hogs and recommends ways to save energy. Sense's monitor is installed in a home's electric panel and is controlled by a mobile app. The system then creates a timeline of the user's appliances, which can all be viewed on a smartphone. The product retails for $299. Battling the bulge with high tech scales Source: Withings For those engaged in the never-ending battle against the bulge, Withings Body Cardio Scale has improved on the old bathroom scale. This upgraded version measures more than just weight — it gauges heart rate, body mass indexes, muscle mass, body fat percentages and cardiovascular health. Like most smart home products, the Withings scale is Wi-Fi enabled and can be operated via iOS or Android, but comes with a rechargeable battery with a very long life. The scale costs $179.95. Correction: An earlier version misstated the name of the company behind the Savant Remote. › SHARES Bryant McInerney and Javier E.

Massive grants aimed at high-tech scholarships for girls and students of color. Longer parental leave perks for new moms and dads. Even benefits that pay for women who want to delay childbearing to freeze their eggs. Now a growing number of both large and small tech companies are borrowing an idea from Wall Street banks: The "returnship," which brings in mid-career women (and men) who've taken time out of the workplace to care for family, offering them a path back to the office. On Tuesday, a nonprofit called Path Forward announced that six San Francisco-based tech companies, including domain registrar GoDaddy, customer service software maker Zendesk and grocery delivery outfit Instacart, will offer 18-week internships for about 20 mid-career professionals starting in October. While the program is open to men who have spent at least two years out of the workplace as a caregiver, it is expected to be filled largely by women. It is aimed at helping interns confront the stigma they face about time away. Also tech companies get a chance to improve their reputation as places that too many women leave. "If you're wanting more women at the senior level, this is a way to jump-start that," said Tami Forman, the executive director of Path Forward. Forman said there's been enough interest from other companies that she plans to start two to three more groups of these untraditional interns (who, yes, are paid) in several cities early next year, each with six to 10 tech companies. The nonprofit was spun out of the New York-based email software firm Return Path, which started its own mid-career internship program last year -- Forman is a former marketing vice president there -- and now helps bring that program, which includes training and networking opportunities for the group of interns to other tech companies. Path Forward's announcement follows another recent effort by seven technology and engineering companies -- including IBM, Intel and General Motors -- to run internships designed for women who've taken time away. The programs at these companies began this year and are part of an effort launched by the Society for Women Engineers and iRelaunch, a "career re-entry firm" that runs a conference on returning to work sponsored by finance companies that have similar programs, such as Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs. The latter firm kicked off the trend back in 2008 and even trademarked the phrase "returnship." Carol Fishman Cohen, iReLaunch's CEO, said her conference acts as something of a recruiting hub for those existing programs, and "it occurred to us we should take the concept to another sector." She approached the Society of Women Engineers to establish a task force last year that would try and "replicate what we saw in financial services." In tech, she says, "there's a lack of women at every level of the organization and they're looking for more ways to hire more of them and fill that pipeline." Cohen said men are eligible to apply, but most applicants for the established programs have tended to be women in their 40s or even 50s who've left the workforce to be a caregiver. Some tech companies have long offered flexible leave policies or extended sabbaticals that help their own employees return after a break. But these newer mid-career internships, says Laura Sherbin, director of research for the think tank Center for Talent Innovation (CTI), offer certain advantages. For one, it exposes employers to outside talent. And in an industry like tech, where the pace of change is faster and more disruptive than in others, the low-risk bet on hiring an intern for 12 or 18 weeks can help erase the bias many managers have about people whose resumes have glaring holes on them. "There's a huge stigma to time off in the tech industry," Sherbin said. "There's a perception that tech passes us by even on a maternity leave, and if you've had time out of the workforce you're hugely behind. Tie that in with the bias you do see about tech workers who have a little bit of gray hair," and it's an industry particularly primed for managers who might look past candidates -- even skilled ones -- who have been out of the workforce. Steven Aldrich, chief product officer of GoDaddy, said that's one thing that attracted his company to the idea. "The company has a chance to try the employee, in a way, and see their fit with the company, and it's a win for the working parent coming back into the workforce to come in and get experience," he said. "Those things are really challenging [when someone] comes straight back in." The tech industry is also trying to plug an especially leaky pipeline. According to 2008 data from the CTI, 52 percent of women with experience in the science, engineering or tech fields chose to leave their fields over time. Another 2013 study, meanwhile, compared women in multiple professions and found that after the first 12 years of their careers, 50 percent of women in science, engineering and tech were working in other occupations, while only about 20 percent of the other women switched industries over their entire careers. Running internships for returning parents could also help send a message to younger workers. With these programs, Cohen says, "what companies are signaling to their youngest employees and the people in their 20s is that they understand that employees may take a career break -- and we want to welcome you back." If hiring rates are any test, such "returnships" appear successful. At Goldman Sachs, almost half of the 150 people who have gone through its program since 2008 were hired for full-time jobs; Cohen says that hire rates tend to be between 50 and 90 percent in established programs, and at the high end of that range for the tech firms so far. A spokeswoman for PayPal, which ran a program for nine interns in the U.S. called "Recharge," with the help of Forman's group earlier this year, said that seven of the nine were offered jobs. And all six of the "Tech Re-Entry" interns working in analytics at IBM this spring, who had been out of the workforce for anywhere from two to 10 years, were recommended for full-time employment. Five have accepted jobs and the sixth is currently in final interviews at the technology giant. "We're increasingly looking for creative ways to bring women back to the workforce who we know are incredibly competitive," said Lindsay-Rae McIntyre, IBM's chief diversity officer. She said the company is looking to expand the program. Still, while success rates for participants tend to be high, the effect such programs will have on moving the needle -- either for the number of mid-career women in tech or the number of parents wanting to get back to work after child rearing -- could be limited. For one, the programs tend to be relatively small. Several of the pilot programs included internships for just a handful of people -- GoDaddy is hiring three interns, and there were nine in the first group at PayPal -- and iRelaunch's Cohen says existing programs tend to number 20 or 30 interns a year. Meanwhile, the programs are largely limited to fields where job demand is already strong, such as tech and finance, and do little to help those trying to get back to work in struggling industries or those with an abundant supply of workers looking for jobs. Forman said she's heard of an effort to do a "returnship"-style program in the advertising field, but it didn't take off. "The problem with that industry and industries like it is there's 10 people lined up for every job," she said. And in those industries where they could help bring in a few more women, warns CTI's Sherbin, hiring them only goes so far. Even programs that hire every mid-career intern they bring in won't make much progress on diversity if they don't also work to improve "bro" cultures that are hostile or toxic to anyone who's different. "You may get them in," she says, "but they're going to be very very short hires. Diversity for the sake of having butts in seats doesn't do us all that much good."

Home > News By Company > Market Reports Center Tweet   Electronic Design Automation Market Share and Size, Trends and Forecast To 2020 According to the report, high research and development investments will be a key driver for market growth. R&D forms an integral part of the semiconductor industry (EMAILWIRE.COM, September 03, 2016 ) Technavio Announces the Publication of its Research Report Global Electronic Design Automation (EDA) Market 2016-2020 Technavio recognizes the following companies as the key players in the global electronic design automation (EDA) market: Synopsys, Cadence Design Systems, and Mentor Graphics. Other Prominent Vendors in the market are: Agnisys, Aldec, Ansoft, ATopTech, JEDA Technologies, Sigrity, Tanner EDA, Xilinx, and Zuken. Browse full report with TOC@ https://marketreportscenter.com/reports/374129/global-electronic-design-automation-market-2016-2020 Commenting on the report, an analyst from Technavios team said: Rise in number of fabless semiconductor companies will be a key trend for market growth. Semiconductor companies are migrating to the fabless business structure. This is a strategic decision taken by vendors as they want to focus more on the designing and development of their solutions rather than on the maintenance of the foundries. These companies are outsourcing their fabrication- and other manufacturing-related activities to foundries that are specialized in the manufacturing, testing, and assembling of semiconductor ICs. The resultant ratio of foundries and fabless companies stands at 1:11 in the global semiconductor market. The rise in the number of fabless semiconductor companies will increase the need for EDA software tools in the market, as these fabless companies are just concerned with the design aspect of semiconductor devices. According to the report, high research and development investments will be a key driver for market growth. R&D forms an integral part of the semiconductor industry. The semiconductor industry recorded its highest R&D spending of $56.4 billion in 2015. This, however, is not in lieu of the industry standard for R&D spending since 2010, which grew at an average of 13% on a yearly basis. The industry spending toward R&D was up by only 0.5% from 2014, which is the lowest the industry has witnessed since the downturn of 2009. The spending was also below the CAGR of 4% between 2005 and 2015. Intel, one of the leading chip vendors in the market, accounted for 22% of total semiconductor spending in 2015. This was the highest among leading players such as Qualcomm, Samsung Electronics, and Avago Technologies and foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC). An important aspect to note is that the top five R&D spenders were unchanged from 2014. Further, the report states that uncertain economic conditions will be a challenge for the market. The semiconductor market is highly dependent on expenditure by vendors. This high expenditure is mostly funded by financial institutions and from retained earnings of companies. The global economy is plagued with uneven market prospects currently. The exit of Britain from the European Union has resulted in the decline of global markets sharply. In addition, the Chinese economy is facing a downturn, which has resulted in the dwindling of the Chinese yuan against the dollar, making the outlook unpredictable. This is expected to affect the market largely as China is a hub of semiconductor manufacturing. The slowdown of the global economy will tighten credit facilities for market vendors, thereby reducing their profit margins. This may force them to cut their R&D expenses, including those on emerging technologies. As a result, the market for EDA software tools is likely to suffer a serious challenge in the form of uncertain economic conditions. The study was conducted using an objective combination of primary and secondary information including inputs from key participants in the industry. The report contains a comprehensive market and vendor landscape in addition to a SWOT analysis of the key vendors.

The Ideapad 110 is aimed at first-time PC buyers. It comes with a 15.6-inch display of 1366x768 pixel resolution. Powered by Intel Pentium processor paired with 4GB of RAM, the laptop has standard connectivity features like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, USB 3.0 and HDMI. We reviewed the Lenovo Ideapad 110 bearing a price tag of Rs 24,790 to see if it's a worthy budget laptop or not, and here is what we think of it. | TOI Tech | Updated: Sep 3, 2016, 11.34 AM IST Critic Rating3.5/5 User Rating3.3/5 The days when laptop computers used to be super expensive are long gone. Thanks to the advances in technology and dropping manufacturing costs, there are numerous laptops (from manufacturers both big and small) available across all price segments today. So even for those who just want a notebook PC that handles the basics right, there's no dearth of choice in the market And that's precisely the audience Lenovo is targeting with its Ideapad 110 laptop. Glancing at the raw specifications, the Lenovo Ideapad 110 appears to be a fairly decent option for those who are in the market to get their first notebook PC. But a capable spec sheet doesn't automatically equate to good real-world performance. So, is the Lenovo Ideapad 110 a laptop you should spend Rs 24,790 on? Read our in-depth review, and decide yourself. Design and build quality With a 15.6-inch display, the Lenovo Ideapad 110 is definitely a sizeable machine. Although the laptop is entirely made of plastic, the all around textured finish makes it appear more premium than it actually is. The back of the screen-housing module is largely bare, save for a shiny Lenovo logo at the top right corner. The top edge of the display has a VGA resolution webcam and an array microphone. READ ALSO: Lenovo Ideapad Y700 laptop launched at Rs 99,990 As for the bottom-module, its centre is where the full-size chiclet keyboard. Thanks to the display size, the keyboard also has the number pad to its right. During our testing, we found the keyboard quality to be pretty good, especially given the laptop's price. The keys have decent travel distance and provide good feedback. A horizontal speaker grille (of which only the centre one-third is the actual speaker) sits above the keyboard, whereas the trackpad (along with left and right click buttons) is below it. Coming to the sides of the Ideapad 110, the left has the power jack, Ethernet port, USB 2.0 (1), USB 3.0 (1) and 3.5mm audio jack (1). On the right, there's nothing other than a tray-loading optical disc drive and a Kensington lock. There's also a card reader slot placed at the front edge of the bottom port. Overall, we found the design and build quality of the Lenovo Ideapad 110 to be appreciably good. However, the display-housing module wobbles a bit while working on the laptop. Display Lenovo Ideapad 110 has a 15.6-inch display of 1366x768 resolution. Due to the low resolution stretching over a comparatively large panel, pixelation is visible in everything from text to images. Granted, it's unrealistic to expect a Full HD panel at this price, but we feel that Lenovo could've upped the resolution at least a little bit. That said, the display has reasonably accurate colour reproduction and viewing angles are good as well. It's also quite usable under direct sunlight, provided you max out the brightness level. In a nutshell, the display quality of the Lenovo Ideapad 110, while not the greatest, is pretty good for the price. Performance The Lenovo Ideapad 110 is powered by a quad-core Intel Pentium N3710 processor clocked at 1.60GHz. Sporting on-board Intel HD graphics, the notebook PC comes with 4GB of RAM and 500GB of HDD-based storage. While this does appear to be hardware competent enough for delivering good day-to-day performance, it still makes the laptop struggle at basic tasks quite often. During our testing, we found the Lenovo Ideapad 110 to be a bit slow at times. Opening up multiple tabs in Google Chrome caused the computer to slow down to a crawl, and the browser crashed on numerous occasions. It's good that the Ideapad 110 ships with Windows 10 (Single Language) pre-installed, but its hardware isn't adequate enough to run Windows 10 without issues. However, the Ideapad 110 handles other basic tasks like document editing just fine. Talking about multimedia playback, the Ideapad 110 delivered well. The audio output from the built-in speakers is clean, even if a bit on the quieter side. Full HD videos (both streaming and local) play as they should. Unsurprisingly though, the Ideapad 110 falters with 4K playback. To quantify the performance, the laptop scored 1835 in PCMark's benchmarking test, which is just about average. Lastly, let's talk about battery backup. In the course of our testing, Lenovo Ideapad 110 lasted around 3-4 hours with a fully charged battery. This is not exactly the best battery backup, but still decent enough for the price. READ ALSO: Lenovo launches Xiaomi Mi Notebook Air rival, Air 13 Pro Verdict Indian consumers today have plenty of choice when it comes to budget laptops, with both global manufacturers (e.g. HP, Acer) and homegrown brands (e.g. Micromax) in the fray. Consequently, Lenovo Ideapad 110 has got some tough competition. But even though it's a markedly good budget notebook PC, it's not without its downers. These include a low-resolution display and somewhat underwhelming hardware. In the same price range (or for a little more), you can easily get entry-level laptops from brands like HP which are powered by much better Core-i3 processors and have more storage space. However, those generally don't come with Windows 10 pre-installed and use DOS or Linux instead.

Looking for a way to encourage your employees to show better results? The answer might be pizza. © AFP 2016/ JOHN MACDOUGALL Germany's New Civil Defense: Why Germans Urged to Stock Food, Drinking WaterIn his book, Ariely recounts an experiment conducted at an Intel  semiconductor factory in Israel. For the experiment, factory employees were split into four groups, three of which were promised a reward if they managed to complete stated goals by the end of the day. Members of the first group were offered about $30 cash apiece. The second group was told that they would receive a compliment from their boss, and members of the third group would get vouchers for pizzas. The fourth group acted as control, treating the task as a normal function of their duties. The results of the study showed that the small cash reward proved to be the least motivating. The cash group increased productivity by some 4.9 percent, compared to the control group. The group that was promised a compliment increased their productivity by 6.6 percent. It has been acknowledged that kindness is underrated in the workplace. But pizza proved to be the best motivator, as the group promised vouchers increased productivity by 6.7 percent. In a PBS interview Ariely suggested that the winning results did not stem from a desire for pizza. As the pizzas would be delivered to the workers' homes, it would make them seem "like heroes in the eyes of their families," he said. But who knows, maybe it is all about cheese and pepperoni. Or maybe the researchers will offer real money next time, and see how things go. ... Reddit Google+ Blogger Pinterest StumbleUpon Telegram WhatsApp 41 Related: Pizza Going Out!

The watch and leather goods maker crossed over into the tech world with a flurry of smart watches and smart analog watches. Among the three Android Wear smartwatches that Fossil has made so far, there’s one that’s made specifically for the ladies, the Q Wander, and two made for men, the Q Marshal and the Q Founder. Any watchmaker worth his gears will tell you that design is everything with watches. Everything from the angle of the lugs to the shape of the casing and the quality of the materials is incredibly important. While technology companies like Samsung enlist Swiss watch designers to improve smartwatch design, Fossil is already there. Its challenge is technology. Luckily, Fossil has some help from Misfit, a fitness wearable company it bought recently, and Google, which makes the Android Wear operating system available to its partners. We took a look at the ladylike Q Wander and the subtle, masculine Q Marshall, to see how Fossils tech is shaping up. The Q wander: A big, bold, feminine watch Believe it or not, the Fossil Q Wander has a 45mm casing, which is on the large end for women’s watches. It’s also rather thick at 13.5mm. When I first saw it, I was sure it’d be too big and bulky, but when I tried it on, it actually felt comfortable and didn’t overwhelm my wrist. Related: These are the 5 best Android Wear devices right now Fossil has used two classic watchmaking tricks to make the Q Wander look smaller than it really is. The lugs are slim and angled specifically to suit women’s wrists. And instead of having hard edges that would make it look bulky and awkward, it’s curved beautifully. The crown on the side of the watch feels very nice, too, and serves as the power button. Android Wear 2.0 greatly improves the look and feel of the OS. It’s hard to tell in pictures, but the Q Wander looks quite lovely on women’s wrists. It’s a bit similar to the second-generation Moto 360, which also offered a women’s version, though Fossil is larger in size. The rose gold casing and 22mm tan leather strap I tried on added to the air of femininity, and the shiny gold tone made the bulk of the watch disappear. You can use any 22mm strap you want on the Q Wander, which is great for those who change watch straps regularly. Fossil created a number of nice watch faces for the Q Wander, which you can customize with different color schemes. The watch faces mimic Fossil’s analog watches, but there are digital options for those who want something less traditional. You can, of course, use any watch face from the Google Play Store. The colors reproduced on the screen looks sharp and bright, but it is a flat tire display, so the bottom edge is sadly hacked off. The Q Marshal: A subtle, masculine watch The Q Wander goes some way to fix the only major problem with the Q Founder — it wasn’t in any way suitable for skinny wrists. The Wander is distinctly feminine, but there are men who want a more subtle smartwatch too. The new Q Marshal retains a masculine style, without the Founder’s chunkiness. In black, with a textured edge running around the face, it’s a stylish watch. And with the matte black silicone strap, it gains panther-like stealth appeal. Trying it with a brown leather band with stitched black edging gave it more of a classic Fossil look. There’s a single button on the side of the case to activate the settings menu on the device, but it’s otherwise a clean design. Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Compared to the Q Founder, the Q Marshal is just a little more subtle, a little more svelte, and the slimmed lugs mean it doesn’t stand out quite so much on smaller wrists. The numbers prove what we can see. The Q Marshal’s case is 2mm smaller, and 1mm thinner than the Q Founder. Also, the twisted design around the screen calms down the style compared to the flat surface on the Q Founder. It’s still primarily a man’s watch, but has lost most of the Q Founder’s “look at me” brashness when paired with anything other than the metal link strap. Android Wear powered by Qualcomm Both watches are powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor, which promises zippier performance to Android Wear watches, and should assist in prolonging battery life. The Q Founder used an Intel chip, so this is a considerable change for Fossil. In our quick hands on, the processing seemed very fluid, though we’ll have to test it more to be sure. The Q Marshal’s battery capacity is 360mAh, smaller than the Q Founder’s 400mAh cell. Still, Fossil says you’ll still get a day’s worth of use from the watch. The Q Wander has the same battery capacity, which charges up wirelessly via an easy-to-use charger, and should last all day on a charge, according to Fossil. Sadly, there’s no heart rate monitor on either. But you can track your fitness metrics, thanks to the accelerometer and gyroscope on board. Like most Android Wear watches, it connects to your phone via Bluetooth and uses your phone’s GPS. The current version of Android Wear is installed now, and an upgrade to version 2.0 will come in the near future, according to a Fossil representative. Related: Hands on: Android Wear 2.0 Android Wear 2.0 greatly improves the look and feel of the OS, so it can’t come soon enough. The watch was in demo mode and not connected to a phone when we tried it, so it’s impossible to comment fully on the experience. But as Android Wear is almost identical regardless of the watch it’s on, we doubt it’ll be drastically different to the Q Founder. Price and availability The Fossil Q Wander and Q Marshal are available to buy online for $295, or $315 depending on your choice of strap and case color, which is relatively cheap for a smartwatch. Fossil sells watch bands right on its site, too, or you can check out some on Amazon (buyer beware). Buy at Fossil Highs Attractive designs for both men and women You can use any 22mm strap Powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 2100 Decent price for a smartwatch Lows No heart rate monitor Not waterproof Share
TechRadar pro IT insights for business Search RSS News Reviews Insights TechRadar Business Laptop/PC Printers Hardware Software Mobile working Security Networks Management Data centre & Cloud Reviews HP ProBook 455 G3 review Hands on: HP ProBook 455 G3 review Not yet rated By Kane Fulton Laptops and netbooks  Solid build quality meets stylish design Shares What is a hands on review? Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Early Verdict HP's slick ProBook 455 G3 is a weighty entrant into the mid-range laptop world, but don't expect blazing performance out of its AMD APU and meager 4GB of RAM. For Great build quality Stylish design Passable battery life Against Low-resolution display Heavy Not great value With the ProBook 455 G3, HP is hoping to lure business users looking for a relatively affordable laptop with a premium feel. In terms of design, it's an upgrade on HP's 255 G3 model and even moreso on the value-focused 250 G4. The 455 G3 feels more grown-up, and expensive, than both - but not necessarily more capable; surprisingly. At £504 (around US$666 or AUS$874), part of its price tag is down to the 455 G3's premium materials which include a brushed aluminum pattern on the keyboard base. Build quality is robust; the space on each side of the wrist rest is rock solid and resists flex well. At 2.1kg (4.6 pounds) this is a heavy 15-inch laptop and not the most backpack-friendly option out there. The ProBook 455 G3's dark grey plastic lid positions a reflective HP logo in the centre, lending the unit a moody and professional appearance. Opening it up reveals a combination of plastic and metal materials, with a stylish mesh speaker grille, silver trackpad and matte-black keyboard base. The rear of the lid features an eye-catching strip of metal that helps break up the seat of black plastic. Combined with the metal sides of the body underneath, it looks great. HP has made the sensible choice of keeping the base free of stickers, adding to its minimal allure. The 455 G3's shape is consistent with budget laptop lines, featuring rounded corners and a flimsy lid that contorts under little pressure. The unit's keyboard isn't anything special but it's functional enough, with a crisp and sharp low travel action thanks to its chiclet-spaced keys. Our review unit came equipped with an AMD A10-8700P Radeon R6 APU, which features 10 compute cores. The 455 G3 can be configured with a number of enterprise options including a TPM that helps protect the machine from BIOS-level attacks from viruses and malware; a spill-resistant backlit keyboard and HP's security policy software courtesy of an HP Touchpoint Manager app. Other software includes HP's Drive Encryption app, Security Manager, Microsoft Security Essentials, Microsoft Defender, Validity Fingerernt Driver, HP SoftPaq Download Manager, CyberLink Power2Go, PowerDVD and YouCam, along with HP Connection Manager, 3D Driveguard, Recovery Manager and Support Assistant. Performance is nippy enough on the desktop and the merger 4GB of RAM isn't too much of a problem, save for the occasional hitch if you're opening multiple browser windows and tabs. The biggest offender on this machine is its lowly 1,366 x 768 pixel-resolution display, which far from impresses with average contrast and color saturation. Even on full brightness it's difficult to see what you're doing outdoors, which isn't helped by the display's average horizontal and vertical viewing angles. The unit's ports situation is a little better - there's two USB 3.0 ports, two USB 2.0, a headphone/microphone combo jack, Ethernet, and HDMI/VGA connections for hooking up the 455 G3 to an external displa. Benchmarks Cinebench R15: OpenGL: 23.13 fps; CPU: 200 points Geekbench (Single-Core): 2,076 points; (Multi-Core) 4,831 points Battery test (1080p looped video streamed over Wi-Fi in Edge, 50% brightness): 5 hours 31 minutes Laptops powered by AMD's APUs can often prove a savvy alternative to Intel-based ones with integrated graphics, as they can be capable of bringing superior graphics performance at as similar price. The ProBook 455 G3 unfortunately doesn't excel in this area, scoring a lower OpenGL score compared to the much more affordable HP 250 G4 that houses an Intel Core i3-5005U with integrated Iris graphics (23.13 fps, versus the 250's 24.6 fps). Battery runtimes were better than what the HP 250 G4 achieved, however; the HP ProBook G3's 4-cell 44 Whr Li-ion battery lasted for 5 hours and 31 minutes before giving up the ghost. Early verdict There are clear advantages here for business users thinking of stumping up cash for the ProBook 455 G3; Its build quality is excellent, there's a healthy selection of ports and it can reach up to around two hours more of battery life on a single charge compared to the more affordable HP 250 G4. That said, the AMD APU inside isn't much more impressive than the Intel Core chip in that cheaper model and even lost out in our graphics benchmark. For the price, though, the biggest offender is the ProBook 455 G3's low pixel-resolution display which is dull and simply does not have huge appeal stretched across 15 inches.

But first, it needs to come up with a useful product. Cheryl Swanson (CherylSwanson) Sep 3, 2016 at 2:02PM Image source: Flickr/Creative Commons. Glucose-monitoring contact lenses for diabetics, wrist computers that read diagnostic nanoparticles injected in the blood stream, implantable devices that modify electrical signals that pass along nerves, medication robots, human augmentation, human brain simulation -- the list goes on. That's not an inventory of improbable CGI effects from the latest sci-fi movie, it's a list of initiatives being tackled by Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Life Sciences research unit, recently rebranded Verily. For those who appreciate The Motley Fool's affection for William Shakespeare, "verily" is Shakespearean-era word that means "truly," or "confidently." As in: "I verily believe that sweater is the ugliest one I have ever seen." Confidence certainly exemplifies Google. Verily was hatched from Google X, the company's secretive lab for oft-nutty projects, such as space elevators, teleportation, and hoverboards. Google X also launched Google Glass, which was undoubtedly a super-cool device, but wasn't received well by its intended market, to put it mildly.    With that kind of background, what are the chances Verily will unleash something that will change healthcare? Are good things about to flow? Or -- courtesy of the Bard of Avon -- is Verily merely a tale full of sound and fury, signifying nothing? Let's look at Verily's current financial situation and then check out the prospect of a marketable product that could move Google's needle. A pound of flesh, but no blood   Like the moneylender in the Merchant of Venice, Verily demands a pound of flesh from its parent each quarter. Alphabet, Google's newfangled conglomerate, doesn't break out the performance of subsidiaries, but last quarter's earnings report offered a view into costs and output. Verily is a subsidiary lumped under Other Bets with Google's broadband business and smart home company. Revenue from Other Bets doubled to $185 million from $74 million in the year-earlier period, and rose 11% sequentially. Costs also increased: Operating losses widened to $859 million from $660 million a year ago and moved up 7% from the previous quarter. Despite the costs incurred, it's certainly not bleeding its parent dry. After all, Google has an almost endless supporting budget, and if any of Verily's projects pan out, what's being expended now will look like pocket change. In addition, while some Verily ventures may seem frankly nuts, they might have actual potential. A recent joint venture with U.K. drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) will use implants that create electrical pulses to help the body heal itself. The collaborators have agreed to spend up to $716 million over seven years, with GSK holding 55% of the joint venture and Verily 45%. It's a new field, called bioelectronic medicine. Despite the quasi-scientific sound of this endeavor, early studies reported in peer-reviewed journals have shown positive results in treating rheumatoid arthritis. Sanofi, AbbVie, and Biogen  have also teamed up with Verily over the past few years. Big pharma hopes to tap into Google's data analysis tools, as well as license Verily's miniaturized medical devices (after they are developed), to tackle various disease targets. In a slightly different kind of venture, Johnson & Johnson has inked a deal with Verily to develop medical robots. The less you speak of your greatness, the more shall I think of it   None of these ventures have led to a useful product yet. Meanwhile, Verily has been skewered by multiple scientists for not critically assessing the actual potential behind its various moonshots. "One needs to balance how much these toys are used mostly for marketing and giving a sense of a company really working on something impressive -- the brave new world -- or if we're talking about something that will have clear and immediate clinical impact. The latter is very hard to imagine," said Dr. John Ioannidis, a professor of disease prevention at Stanford University, commenting on Verily's projects.  In the blink of an eye In light of that, what about one of Verily's oldest initiatives? Looking back to 2012, the life sciences unit was originally developed to create "smart" contact lenses whose super-cool images were appearing all over the internet a scant two years ago. Designed to measure blood glucose levels, the lenses featured sensors and chips the size of flecks of glitter and a wireless antenna thinner than a human hair. On the face of it, a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) lens seems to meet Ioannidis' criteria of having a "clear clinical impact." Better yet: it has an investable thesis. Verily and its big pharma partner Novartis (NYSE:NVS) are aiming straight at the $10 billion diabetes monitoring market. With this kind of market, the project was clearly capable of becoming a needle-moving revenue generator. Look a little deeper, though, and the view is cloudier. DexCom (NASDAQ:DXCM) Executive VP Steve Pacelli pointed out, "Lots of companies have tried and failed noninvasively to sense glucose in tears. You can measure glucose in tears, but the concentration is a lot lower, there's going to be huge time lag issues; the consistency of measurement is going to be a challenge." There's a bigger problem. Both Dexcom and Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) have continuous glucose monitors on the market, but both face a major hurdle. The FDA does not consider continuous glucose monitoring -- from any device -- accurate enough to prescribe insulin dosing by itself. While CGM devices are being used, their market is very limited, since they are only allowed to be used as supplemental devices. Google's CGM lens will face the same FDA hurdle -- assuming this product comes out of the lab. The long and short of it Apple, Microsoft, Intel -- virtually all the tech titans, in fact -- are now pursuing major initiatives in healthcare. A confluence of factors, such as digitization of records, machine intelligence, genetic engineering, and rapid advances in medical equipment, have made the field ripe for disruption from data-enabled, mobile-based, and miniaturized devices. Even more enticing are the opportunities to massively grow revenue. The tech giants are billion-dollar companies, but healthcare spending is approaching $3 trillion annually in the U.S. alone. Looking globally, the World Health Organization estimates the annual expenditure at $6.5 trillion. Bottom line: Despite the big carrot enticing it, Google has yet to come up with anything that can lay claim to changing healthcare. Although Alphabet could be a potentially interesting addition to your healthcare portfolio, it should be added with the understanding that there are many other pure-play companies with a much clearer path and investing thesis than Verily. Still, let's allow Shakespeare to have the final word. While the bard makes an unlikely investment guru, he had plenty of useful things to say that have lasted through centuries, including: "Though this be madness, yet there is method to it." In other words, it may be that hidden within Google's craziness lies the seed of something that could still astonish us. And no matter what, we can be sure of one thing: The ultimate search engine will keep grabbing headlines with its latest moonshots. After all, we're talking about Google.

But first, it needs to come up with a useful product. Cheryl Swanson (CherylSwanson) Sep 3, 2016 at 2:02PM Image source: Flickr/Creative Commons. Glucose-monitoring contact lenses for diabetics, wrist computers that read diagnostic nanoparticles injected in the blood stream, implantable devices that modify electrical signals that pass along nerves, medication robots, human augmentation, human brain simulation -- the list goes on. That's not an inventory of improbable CGI effects from the latest sci-fi movie, it's a list of initiatives being tackled by Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Life Sciences research unit, recently rebranded Verily. For those who appreciate The Motley Fool's affection for William Shakespeare, "verily" is Shakespearean-era word that means "truly," or "confidently." As in: "I verily believe that sweater is the ugliest one I have ever seen." Confidence certainly exemplifies Google. Verily was hatched from Google X, the company's secretive lab for oft-nutty projects, such as space elevators, teleportation, and hoverboards. Google X also launched Google Glass, which was undoubtedly a super-cool device, but wasn't received well by its intended market, to put it mildly.    With that kind of background, what are the chances Verily will unleash something that will change healthcare? Are good things about to flow? Or -- courtesy of the Bard of Avon -- is Verily merely a tale full of sound and fury, signifying nothing? Let's look at Verily's current financial situation and then check out the prospect of a marketable product that could move Google's needle. A pound of flesh, but no blood   Like the moneylender in the Merchant of Venice, Verily demands a pound of flesh from its parent each quarter. Alphabet, Google's newfangled conglomerate, doesn't break out the performance of subsidiaries, but last quarter's earnings report offered a view into costs and output. Verily is a subsidiary lumped under Other Bets with Google's broadband business and smart home company. Revenue from Other Bets doubled to $185 million from $74 million in the year-earlier period, and rose 11% sequentially. Costs also increased: Operating losses widened to $859 million from $660 million a year ago and moved up 7% from the previous quarter. Despite the costs incurred, it's certainly not bleeding its parent dry. After all, Google has an almost endless supporting budget, and if any of Verily's projects pan out, what's being expended now will look like pocket change. In addition, while some Verily ventures may seem frankly nuts, they might have actual potential. A recent joint venture with U.K. drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) will use implants that create electrical pulses to help the body heal itself. The collaborators have agreed to spend up to $716 million over seven years, with GSK holding 55% of the joint venture and Verily 45%. It's a new field, called bioelectronic medicine. Despite the quasi-scientific sound of this endeavor, early studies reported in peer-reviewed journals have shown positive results in treating rheumatoid arthritis. Sanofi, AbbVie, and Biogen  have also teamed up with Verily over the past few years. Big pharma hopes to tap into Google's data analysis tools, as well as license Verily's miniaturized medical devices (after they are developed), to tackle various disease targets. In a slightly different kind of venture, Johnson & Johnson has inked a deal with Verily to develop medical robots. The less you speak of your greatness, the more shall I think of it   None of these ventures have led to a useful product yet. Meanwhile, Verily has been skewered by multiple scientists for not critically assessing the actual potential behind its various moonshots. "One needs to balance how much these toys are used mostly for marketing and giving a sense of a company really working on something impressive -- the brave new world -- or if we're talking about something that will have clear and immediate clinical impact. The latter is very hard to imagine," said Dr. John Ioannidis, a professor of disease prevention at Stanford University, commenting on Verily's projects.  In the blink of an eye In light of that, what about one of Verily's oldest initiatives? Looking back to 2012, the life sciences unit was originally developed to create "smart" contact lenses whose super-cool images were appearing all over the internet a scant two years ago. Designed to measure blood glucose levels, the lenses featured sensors and chips the size of flecks of glitter and a wireless antenna thinner than a human hair. On the face of it, a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) lens seems to meet Ioannidis' criteria of having a "clear clinical impact." Better yet: it has an investable thesis. Verily and its big pharma partner Novartis (NYSE:NVS) are aiming straight at the $10 billion diabetes monitoring market. With this kind of market, the project was clearly capable of becoming a needle-moving revenue generator. Look a little deeper, though, and the view is cloudier. DexCom (NASDAQ:DXCM) Executive VP Steve Pacelli pointed out, "Lots of companies have tried and failed noninvasively to sense glucose in tears. You can measure glucose in tears, but the concentration is a lot lower, there's going to be huge time lag issues; the consistency of measurement is going to be a challenge." There's a bigger problem. Both Dexcom and Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) have continuous glucose monitors on the market, but both face a major hurdle. The FDA does not consider continuous glucose monitoring -- from any device -- accurate enough to prescribe insulin dosing by itself. While CGM devices are being used, their market is very limited, since they are only allowed to be used as supplemental devices.

(Linda Davidson/The Washington Post) By Perry Stein September 3, 2016 Follow perrystein The idea started on an empty alley lot in Northeast Washington’s little-known Stronghold neighborhood. Brian Levy wanted to show those around him the benefits of minimal and environmentally friendly living. So in 2012, he enlisted an architecture firm and builder to construct a 210-square-foot house on wheels — a particularly chic structure with stainless-steel kitchen countertops and maple floors. It garnered media attention — a couple of spreads in glossy design magazines — and some quibbles from neighbors who had grown accustomed to parking on the empty lot. It also raised questions over whether the city’s zoning laws even permitted Levy to use the lot for his tiny-house experiment. Yes and no. He cannot use his micro home as a permanent residence. But because Levy and other local urbanists lobbied the city to loosen its zoning restrictions, new laws that they say are friendlier to the tiny-house movement are slated to go into effect Tuesday. These new zoning laws coincide with Levy’s latest business venture: He and his business associates have partnered with a Pittsburgh-based manufacturer to build prefabricated versions of the house and deliver them to customers in the District and elsewhere in the country. “We’re aiming to be the premier micro-house manufacturer in the country,” Levy said. “We’re a business, but we’re also mission-driven. We’re focused on helping people live more simply, more cheaply and more ecologically.” Micro houses — or tiny homes — are part of an architectural movement encouraging simple and sustainable living. The movement has gained steam in recent years as urbanists and hobbyists alike pitch the structures as a cheap solution to the expensive housing crisis plaguing many fast-gentrifying cities. There’s even a popular HGTV show based around the homes called “Tiny House Hunters.” But critics of the movement contend that it focuses on single adults and overlooks vulnerable segments of the population, such as families and children, who experience poverty — and are often on the losing end of urban housing shortages. [Tiny house, big benefits: Freedom from a mortgage and worries — and stuff.] When Levy built his tiny home — a glamorous trailer he dubbed the Minim House — he wanted to see what the response in the District would be. Designed by D.C.-based Foundry Architects, the house is “off-grid,” meaning it requires no outside electrical outlets or plumbing for water, sewage, electricity or Internet. He created a nonprofit called Micro Showcase, where individuals and classrooms can schedule tours. For a while, Levy experimented with creating a community of tiny houses on the lot called Boneyard Studios, which disbanded amid controversy in 2014. There was a rift between Levy and the two other micro-home owners on the lot, which included questions over the sometimes smelly disposal of sewage, since the homes are not connected to sewage treatment. The lot now includes four micro structures, a garden and other projects that friends are working on and which people can tour. Together, these projects showed Levy that interest existed in tiny houses and that the venture could be worth a bigger investment. He created Minim Built — initially called Minim Homes — where he and his two partners sold 88 plans of his flagship micro house for $495 each. Chris VanArsdale, one of the co-owners, said that he fielded questions last summer from interested buyers and that they considered selling. But ultimately they decided to see if they could create a business model around selling a version of the Minim House on their own. Customers can now order one of the houses — with or without wheels — for $71,000, plus shipping, and have it delivered ready for move-in. At 265 square feet and 12 feet wide, the Minim House he is selling is slightly bigger than the one currently showcased on his Stronghold lot. The company is hoping to sell at least one house a month in its first year. They said they already sold one test model to the technology company Intel, which used the structure as a traveling showcase for its products. The District’s new zoning laws would allow micro homes to essentially function as carriage houses in the city, provided the structures are not on wheels. Under the new regulations, it will be easier for homeowners to purchase a micro house for their back yard and rent it out. The old rules required owners seeking to rent out units to argue their case before the Board of Zoning Adjustment to receive an exception. Under the new regulations, the structures will be automatically permitted in some neighborhoods — such as Brookland and Chevy Chase, where there are larger single-family homes — as soon as homeowners acquire building permits from the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs. Eric D. Shaw, director of the D.C. Office of Planning, wrote in an email that with these new zoning laws, the city wanted to give homeowners more opportunities to have accessory dwellings on their properties. “Accessory units can provide additional and often more affordable housing options, can facilitate aging in place, and can help homeowners afford their homes,” Shaw wrote. [D.C. shift could make tiny houses more abundant] Levy said their target customer includes retirees looking to downsize, cramped D.C. homeowners looking for extra space or rural cabin dwellers. “It’s ideal for one, possibly two people, depending on how much you love them,” Levy said. “It’s low-maintenance.” It is also designed to be as functional and livable as possible, Levy said. There are large windows and a full kitchen. A cozy table for two pushed against a wall can swing to the middle of the house for an eight-person dinner party. There is a couch that can double as a bench for the table, and a 96-inch projection screen. A queen-size trundle bed pulls out when needed, and there are bookshelves, closets, a work area and a bathroom. And they are all small. Levy said it will take a maximum of three months from order to delivery. local Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

By Annie Karni 09/03/16 07:46 AM EDT Trailing Hillary Clinton since she became the Democratic nominee has been less about developing a relationship with the candidate and more like a sensory deprivation experience. | Getty Facebook Twitter Google + Email Comment Print Hillary Clinton has never felt comfortable with the traveling political press. As first lady, she would sometimes arrange travel for herself and daughter Chelsea separate from her husband, partly to avoid the protective pool of reporters assigned to the president. In 2008, she “fought tooth and nail,” former aides said, to avoid sharing the plane with her press corps and relented only when her campaign was running out of money and had to either bring the reporters on board or downgrade to commercial. Story Continued Below And in 2016, with plenty of cash and a winning position in the race, Clinton has managed to keep the press at arm’s length — preserving her private plane as a refuge where the only people around are her trusted campaign aides. That changes on Labor Day, when the reporters and their press-leery candidate will for the first time board a “Stronger Together”-wrapped 737 and fly from New York to Ohio to Iowa, and remain flying companions for the final stretch of the campaign. Her team insists Clinton is on board with the setup, despite her distrust of the national media. "She does understand that there is very good reason why it's important for everyone to be together in the thick of a general election,” said her traveling spokesman, Nick Merrill. “We're going to wrap the plane in blue and get on it together. There's a desire to be efficient and be able to do things a little more impromptu.” But closer quarters are no guarantee of a new level of access. “The times she'll go back and schmooze will be few and far between,” predicted one longtime Clinton ally. “She'll send other people back there, instead.” Indeed, trailing Clinton since she became the Democratic nominee has been less about developing a relationship with the candidate and more like a sensory deprivation experience. When she’s speaking at a fundraiser, reporters camped outside can sometimes hear a muffled voice but can rarely make out her actual words. When she’s greeting voters at a coffee shop or on a rope line after a rally, the former secretary of state often looks right through the reporters hovering around her, like they don’t exist. And when she does acknowledge their physical presence, she smiles through the questions barked at her and encourages reporters to sample a coffee, or a chocolate, instead. Ryan: Clinton's handling of classified information 'downright dangerous' By Bianca Padró Ocasio There are full days when the rotating pool of traveling press does not even set eyes on Clinton. In one instance last month, Clinton slipped out to Martha’s Vineyard from New York, ditching the pool of reporters assigned to cover her altogether. Certainly, the past month has been somewhat out of the ordinary for the campaign — Clinton has been on a cash dash, spending the bulk of the end of summer at private, closed-press fundraisers rather than public events. (Twice, she popped up to call in to cable television programs.) But there has hardly been a halcyon period of accessibility since she launched her campaign 18 months ago. As she enters the final stage of the race, sparking new hopes of accessibility onboard Hill Force One, here is a sampling from life on the road with Clinton, culled from the print pool reports for the past 20 days: Drowned Out By a Jet Engine, Aug. 31: Clinton’s plane landed in Cincinnati, from East Hampton, New York, ahead of her speech to the American Legion. On the tarmac, Clinton was greeted by a group of county Democratic Party chairs. But, “your pooler was not close enough to hear any conversations over the noise of the plane.” They Paved Paradise and Put up a Parking Lot, Aug. 30: Clinton hit up three big fundraisers in the Hamptons. While she raked in the cash, the pool didn’t have much to report on. “Pool was unable to hear a word of HRC's remarks at first cocktail party. She also took questions, which pool was also prohibited from hearing.” At an evening fundraiser hosted by Jimmy Buffett, Clinton was inside dancing with Paul McCartney, according to attendees. Pool reporters were stationed about 400 yards away from the house, “among the parked cars.” Basement Blues, Aug. 29: While Clinton entertained donors who coughed up $33,400 a head to attend a Hamptons fundraiser at the home of Jay Snyder, there was “no chance of your pool hearing Clinton here. We are being held in a quaint, but lovely guest house, while Clinton is in the main house.” Earlier in the day, there was a brief window at a fundraiser when the pool could hear Clinton’s remarks. That was quickly remedied. “Staff shooed us into a hidden room farther in the basement out of earshot.” Clinton told FBI she relied on others' judgment on classified material By Louis Nelson and Nick Gass Exclusive Interview with a Caretaker, Aug. 28: Clinton attended four fundraisers in the Hamptons. In Bridgehampton, pool “had a funny exchange with the man who described himself as the caretaker of the house where we waited. He asked when we were leaving to go into the fundraiser and see her. We told him no, we aren’t allowed to do that. He seemed incredulous.” Pool reported no sighting of Clinton the entire day. Intel Briefing, Aug. 27: Clinton attended her intelligence briefing in White Plains, while the pool loitered in a parking lot outside. Pool was driven out to Sag Harbor while Clinton returned to her Chappaqua home, post-briefing, and did not know her whereabouts for the rest of the day. Chocolates > Questions, Aug. 25: Clinton popped into Hub Coffee Roasters after a rally in Reno, Nevada. There, she ignored questions about Donald Trump lobbed at her from the reporters in the coffee shop. Instead, she encouraged them to sample Dorinda’s Chocolates. “It’s really good!” she said. Muffled Mumblings, Aug. 24: Clinton attended a full day of fundraisers in California, but at the end of a long day that ended at 10 p.m., “pool lost sight of the motorcade as it pulled into the hotel garage, marking a full day without a glimpse of Clinton.” While Clinton raised money at the estate of Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Steve Jobs, the pool didn’t even catch a glimpse of the house, instead “we have to hold at a nearby restaurant.” At a fundraiser earlier in the day, "pool could hear Clinton's voice, but could not make out any exact words.” The Wave, Aug. 23: In Burbank, California, as Clinton entered Justin Timberlake’s mansion for a fundraiser, pool reported that Clinton “waved to us.” Also, a Jennifer Aniston sighting. 2016 Clinton advisers see multiple paths to a commanding win By Annie Karni Magic Johnson’s Driveway, Aug. 22: After a fundraiser at Magic Johnson’s house, pool “was able to see Magic wave goodbye to HRC from the driveway.” We Can Hear Her! Aug. 21: Clinton attended a fundraiser headlined by Cher in Provincetown, Massachusetts. The pooler was able to catch snippets of Clinton’s remarks, which touched on issues like infrastructure, health care, mental health and the fact that she plans to include LGBT people in her administration. “Friends don’t let friends vote for Trump,” Clinton told the audience. Martha’s Vineyard, Aug. 20: At a fundraiser on the island, attended by both Clintons, pool didn’t have as much luck as in Provincetown. “At one point we could hear HRC’s voice followed by large cheers, but nothing more.” Stranded in New York, Aug. 19: Straight from the pool report: “Clinton went out to Martha’s Vineyard a day early, without the pool. Although we had a pooler on standby in New York, the campaign told us about this development only after the fact.” Ignoring Questions, Aug. 17: Clinton ignored questions shouted at her about Trump’s campaign shakeup, while she took a tour of John Marshall High School in Cleveland, ahead of a rally there, one of her two public events of the past two weeks. Police Reporting, Aug. 11: Sitting at a Starbucks across from Clinton’s Chicago fundraiser, pool noted that “opposite us on Wabash Avenue a blue minivan is on fire.” Pool called 911. When Clinton departed about 90 minutes later, pool had “abandoned its position at the Starbucks on Wabash — opposite the charred husk of the minivan — to get a glimpse of her on the way out. No such luck.” Follow @politico Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Authors: Annie Karni akarni@politico.com @anniekarni This story tagged under: Hillary Clinton Bill Clinton Elections Chelsea Clinton Donald Trump 2016 Elections Hillary Clinton 2016 Donald Trump 2016 Show Comments Politico Magazine Putin’s Real Long Game By Molly K.

TechRadar pro IT insights for business Search RSS News Reviews Insights TechRadar Business Laptop/PC Printers Hardware Software Mobile working Security Networks Management Data centre & Cloud Reviews HP 250 G4 review Hands on: HP 250 G4 review Not yet rated By Kane Fulton Laptops and netbooks  A full-fat Intel Core processor makes this a bargain laptop Shares What is a hands on review? Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Early Verdict For small businesses seeking a bit more oomph in their budget laptop purchase, the HP 250 G4 sneaks in a full-fat Intel processor usually found in models higher up the price ladder. For Full-fat Intel Core i3 processor Affordable Snappy keyboard Plenty of ports Against Dull design Cramped display Quite heavy Small businesses have a number of choices these days when it comes to outfitting employees with affordable computers. HP has thrown another option into the ring with its 250 G4, an affordable budget laptop that comes with a full-fat Intel Core processor that's more capable of handling business applications compared to others in its price range. It can be picked up for as little as £224 (around US$269) online, which places it squarely in budget territory and even on an even footing with Chromebooks and low-end 2-in-1 devices. In terms of its design, the 15.6-inch 250 G4 looks like a budget offering. That's not saying much these days, with bargain bucket devices such as HP's own Stream 11 and Stream 14 bringing a splash of color to the low-end. Howeverr, the 250 G4 really is clad in black plastic from head-to-toe (or lid to keyboard base). HP has attempted to make it look less boring by giving the black base a thatched diamond effect, which is repeated in a silver mesh pattern on the lid, but it doesn't prevent the machine from looking dull. Build quality is impressive for the price. There are signs of flex around the edges of the lid and base if you try to bend them with enough force, but the keyboard area stands up well to contortion. The 250 G4 is so clad in plastic that picking up scuffs over time is inevitable. Despite its plastic exterior, it's not a light device, tipping the scales at 2.8 pounds. Even at the low-end, laptop makers have reduced the travel of their device's keyboards - and the 250 G4 is no exception. Its chiclet-spaced keys are of a decent size and typing is as pleasurable and fast as you will experience on a laptop in this price category. There's a roomy trackpad underneath that refrains from sticking as you scroll across it, and is paired with click buttons that both feel and sound cheap to use. There's not much to shout about where the G410's display is concerned. Its lowly pixel-resolution of 1,366 x 768 is too cramped for multi-tasking and makes it difficult to pin apps or browsers side-by-side to use simultaneously. However, this is compensated somewhat by the display's high peak brightness which makes it easy to read websites, menus and labels without eye fatigue. Horizontal viewing angles are average at best due to the TN panel used, and vertical ones are even worse. Color saturation and contrast is sufficient for everyday web browsing and general use, but you would be better off hooking up a desktop monitor for image editing. The good news is that you can at least hook up the G410 to an external display using either the VGA or HDMI port build along the left-hand edge. They're accompanied by an ethernet port, two USB 2.0 ports, in addition to an optical drive, another USB port and an SDcard slot. Benchmarks Cinebench R15: OpenGL: 24.6 fps; CPU: 207 points Geekbench (Single-Core): 2,072 points; (Multi-Core) 4,292 points Battery test (1080p looped video streamed over Wi-Fi in Edge, 50% brightness): 3 hours 50 minutes The real start of the show here is the HP 250 G4's Intel Core i3-5005U (dual core, 2GHz) processor, which is backed up by a healthy 8GB of RAM. These components aren't going to give you powerhouse performance, but having a full-fat Intel Core processor tucked away inside at this price point is a rarity. There's usually one of Intel's Celeron or Bay Trail variants instead. When it comes to CPU-intensive tasks such as working with large spreadsheets or high-resolution images and video, this budget laptop will give you the edge over others in its price range. Unfortunately the processor can't compensate for the slow 5400rpm hard drive in there. HP has chosen a 1TB model, which provides plenty of room for storage. However, it's a spinning hard disk, rather than an SSD, and anything from boot to application loading times suffer as a result. Early verdict A low-resolution display is the all that mars an otherwise impressive package here. It's rare that you'll get an Intel Core-series processor lurking in a laptop like the HP 250 G4, and that alone means that businesses should at least consider it for workers who undertake certain tasks. It's not the prettiest or lightest 15-inch laptop out there, and users will need to hook it up to an external display for working with multiple applications or browser windows side-by-side.

The best of IFA 2016: The top 7 highlights from Samsung, Acer, Sony and more International Business Times 03/09/2016 James Billington © Lenovo Lenovo Yoga Book The giant tech expo IFA is underway in Berlin and IBTimes UK has seen some banner announcements and shiny new products including the latest and greatest wearables, home entertainment and gadgetry — but what have been the best products on show? Acer laid down the gauntlet early on the eve of the show by hosting a press conference where it showed off a bevy of exciting new kits to no shortage of gasps and applause. First reveal was the world's first curved laptop – the Predator 21 X – a monster-sized gaming laptop powered by two Nvidia GTX 1080 processors and Intel's brand new 7th generation Kaby Lake processor. Although it will not be one for commuters measuring 21in and weighing 8kg. © Acer Acer Predator 21 X curved display laptop Instead, they could opt for Acer's world's thinnest laptop, the Swift 7 which is the first to fall under 1cm at 9.98mm. Its MacBook Air rival weighs just 1.1kg, has a 13.3in Full HD display and runs Windows 10. Full marks for presentation. Acer did not stop there, it also pulled out the StarVR – a 5K virtual reality headset with the capability to watch IMAX movies. The headset is likely to hit the market in 2017 with its intended use for "high-end cinemas and gaming arcades", rather than a direct competition for Oculus Rift et al.  Samsung Gear S3 © Samsung Samsung Gear S3 range Following Acer's act, most eyes switched to Samsung. With a typical glossy presentation we were introduced to the new Gear S3 smartwatch. The new wearable was heavily rumoured to be at the show and it did not disappoint. The S3, which comes in two models; the Classic and more outdoorsy Frontier, looked really appealing and might hopefully make wearables more, well, wearable with a traditional watch-like design, steel facia and always-on display. A quick glance and you could be forgiven for mistaking it for a Tag Heuer brand. With thousands of custom watch faces, up to four days battery-life and the inclusion of GPS and LTE it represents a significant development in the smartwatch market.  Sony Xperia XZ and X Compact © IBTimes UK Sony Xperia XZ vs Sony Xperia XCompact Smartphones were not a dominant theme at this year's IFA but that did not stop Sony whipping the wraps off two new flagship phones, the Xperia XZ and X Compact. If that elicited a yawn, then your interest will surely pique at the unveiling of its Xperia Ear – an in-ear peripheral that allows wearers to control said phones and receive aural updates including messages, directions and answers to questions. If you have seen Spike Jonzes' Her, then you get a rough idea of where this is going. Lenovo Yoga Book © Lenovo The Lenovo Yoga Book Android More innovation came from Lenovo who sounded a possible death knell for the future of the keyboard with its Yoga Book hybrid tablet, which has two displays with one being used as a writing pad and instantly projecting what you write on the other screen. The unique device's digital smart keyboard can stretch, include a customise key based on your needs and looked impressive in demonstrations. It will be ideal for graphic designers or artists but still might find it hard to win over physical keyboard warriors. Philips 4K OLED TV © Provided by IBT Media (UK) Philips OLED TV Ambilight Philips made a bit of a splash by announcing it will be launching a brand new OLED TV. While they are nothing new this will be the company's first effort and comes with the world's first Ambilight technology. The colour-changing technology that mimics what is on screen has been a signature feature for Philips for years and with the already enahance contrast levels coming from an OLED panel it will be great to see how this lifts it even further. The 4K 55in set is priced at £3000 and will compete with Sony, Panasonic and LG for OLED bragging rights. Alcatel Vision © Provided by IBT Media (UK) Alcatel Vision Smartphone manufacturer Alcatel also made its first move into a new category by announcing its first all-in-one VR headset. The Vision is a standalone unit that does not need a smartphone or have to be plugged into a machine to work. It has two 3.8in AMOLED HD displays and comes with a built-in accelerometer, gyroscope and proximity sensor track the user's movements. What is interesting about the headset is its positioning between the two stables of budget VR like Google Cardboard and expensive professional headsets like Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. The Vision is expected in early 2017 for an estimated £500 - $420. Wearables © TomTom TomTom Touch wearable There were a wealth of wearables on show including a new range from TomTom, which included its Touch fitness tracker and Spark 3 with GPS. Fitbit flaunted its new Charge 2 and Flex 2 activity-tracking wearables with the latter being its first swimproof device that will start counting burned calories and automatically detects when wearer is in the water. Finally Asus gave smartwatches another boost in the beauty stakes with its ZenWatch 3. The Android Wear watch showed a premium look with its circular display and even more affordable price at around £190.

Skip to main content ContributeSubmit an article about your project to KDE.News About KDELearn about KDE software and the community Download KDEDownload KDE Desktop and related applications  KDE.org  KDE Forums  KDE Wikis  Developer Blogs  Planet KDE SEP 2 2016 QtCon FInished First Day of 13 Tracks of Talks Submitted by Jonathan Riddell Today is a historic day for KDE, a community founded 20 years ago. We are celebrating with like-minded communities doing what we do best; discussing and promoting technical achievements with our friendly communities of FSF-E, Qt and VLC. A massive thirteen tracks of talks run concurrently here at the Berlin Conference Centre covering topics from community to debugging to the switch to Qt 6. Dot News can't begin to cover all of them, and many are available on the CCC streaming coverage which already has many talks from today. Here we've picked a few to give some highlights. David Faure David Faure is one of the longest-standing developers of KDE software. Today he wanted to give some history of KDE development as it was done back in KDE 1 days, to see how that links to current community practices. The K in KDE stood for Kool before that was dropped, but who knew the Q in Qt stood for Quasar before that was transformed into Cute. He spoke of the original kfm code which Martin Graesslin said still remained in KWin to support Konqueror as a desktop window. Today it was decided this code could now be removed! Top Qt hacker and author of qmlbook, Johan Thelin, spoke about Qt in the car industry. Speaking to Dot KDE News before giving the talk, he said he threw away half the slides as marketing, in order to cover stuff which is interesting to open-source coders. He said car industry adoption of open source is hard because changing requirements requires a commercial discussion to work around companies who make some arbitrary specifications from microcontroller-level timing decisions to vague "HTML5 compliance" orders. Ticking the requirements boxes leads to forked or proprietary software. There is also a clash of processes, because everyone comes from waterfall development, are trying to move to agile, but how do you add open source into an environment which needs predictable releases and documentation standards? Qt as an open-source project fulfills these requirements well, compared to other parts of the open source community. Pradeepto Pradeepto told the inspiring story of KDE India. He wanted to spread the word about KDE but didn't know how, so he invited himself to conferences around India to talk about it and soon found he had no free weekends. He was encouraged when Aaron Seigo visited the country bringing his energy to FOSS.IN. Pradeepto spoke about and showed photos of his other KDE heroes who inspired and encouraged him. Running stalls at computer shows around India, the KDE booths became hacking hubs for free software projects and people. Then he started Conf.kde.in which has run for several years at universities in India and found new heroes, now people from India spreading the word about KDE and our software across India and around the world. Jens After lunch VDG founder Jens gave the KDE keynote about design and angry nerds. He gave the popular story of people who were designing a DVD burning application for Apple when Steve Jobs walked in to draw a square on a whiteboard for files with a button for burning, throwing away all the work that had already been done! Jens always worries about the desire for designers, because that can be the desire to be bossed around. But geeks and nerds rebel against people who try to boss them around (like Linus' NVidia salute). How best to organise? The VDG isn't bossy and isn't good at it and shouldn't be because they'd lose people quickly. Jens spoke about getting excited and knowing that many devs are scared to get too excited but shouldn't be. He said, "focus on inspiring people to work instead of complaining or ordering." Talk more about the people who make, such as Marco, who is a rock star. Know that criticism is 90% complements and that criticism can hurt. Inspire through action and creation instead of words. Accept dissent, applaud it, and learn to deal with it. Spot the difference between an angry debate and a divisive fist fight. Collaboration is key with whomever. Be happy to fail; it can be magnificent! Was KDE 4.0 something good? He said yes, because we had to do it for each other to support the community. David Edmundson Plasma maintainer David Edmundson spoke about the last year for our flagship product, Plasma Desktop. He showed a graph of hours use of a desktop which shows that use is not reducing making the desktop as relevant as ever. Linux on the desktop has increased to be 2.5% of all users, which is millions, and any company would be pleased to have that many users. He highlighted the new features in the three releases Plasma has had since the previous Akademy and highlighted the upcoming LTS release of Plasma 5.8. In the last 12 months 194,000 lines of code have changed with 26 commits on average a day by 146 different contributors. Making a desktop like Plasma requires many different skills and knowledge as all the needed components are integrated. For instance, systemd decided to change how suspend in handled when you close a lid, which needs both the old and new use-cases supported. The X session management protocol is so old it predates the Spice Girls but we still get complaints if we try to drop it. We are now trying to support computers with less resources than a few years ago such as an ARM computer which was given free with a magazine, so resources for running a desktop are not necessarily increasing. David also spoke to a full room about bad Qt Quick coding. Having coded a lot of Plasma 5 and ported many Plasmoiids he has a whole catalogue of poor design decisions. He gave a technical talk which covered a range of problems that are common such as widgets not being sized properly with word wrap. Bhushan Shah Bhushan gave an update on Plasma Mobile on which he has been working for the past year. He highlighted the KWin Wayland improvements which had been made for Mobile which will work on Desktop too. There was the release of Kirigami, the toolkit previously known as Plasma Mobile Components. He wants better integration with Plasma Desktop such as having KDE Connect "just work" or Plasma Desktop showing when you plug a phone into a larger display. Lars Knoll Qt's Chief Maintainer and former KDE hacker Lars Knoll gave an update on the state of Qt. There's over 250 active contributors and the latest edition has had half a million downloads directly from their website. He showed graphs of contributors which are about 2/3rds from Qt Company, most of the rest from KDAB, Intel and Audiocodes. He'd welcome more people from other companies and communities. He spoke about the CI system which runs more incrementally than previously but will need some work in the next year to keep it running smoothly. Coming soon is a new configuration system, unified between all platforms and based on Qmake but with JSON as the input. Qt Lite will be way to make a customised version of Qt. What about Qt 6????[sic] Is this year the right time to start? No. One possibility is after Qt 5.11 in 2019? The last release in the Qt 5 series has to be an LTS edition. He doesn't think we have an urgent need to move over. Qt 6 wants to be as source compatible as possible with Qt 5 and probably use C++17. PySide should become part of Qt again, people are working on it again but it requires a lot of work, and the goal is to fully support Python. He says that for Qt 6 we should consider what to move out of Qt Core, because it's big enough. Web Assembly is a new low level virtual machine to run C++ code in a browser. it's being worked on by Google and others and it has a large potential to bring Qt to the web. To finish the day there were dozens of short lightning talks. Jens gave some rules of bad UI design and hypnotised us with an animation that showed why animations should never last more than 2 seconds. Riccardo (Ruphy) gave an update on WikiToLearn which now has over 800 textbook chapters and expects to have over 1000 by the end of the week. Tonight, we party in Berlin, including this unique take that VLC team has on playing Pokemon Go. See you for more talks tomorrow, keep an eye on the Live streams.

Jump to Content A brief history 2015 David Antón Sánchez built (under supervision of René Bohne) OpenVNAVI: A Vibrotactile Navigation Aid for the Visually Impaired, similar as the one Sean Benson built for Hackaday, but with a much higher resolution. While it turns out that the vest works surprisingly well, we had some reliability issues when the vibration motor got stuck in their 3d-printed housing. Furthermore, soldering all the pcbs and especially the wiring is far to complex this way. Personal Photonics: Haptivest Beginning with June 2016 we have now funding from the BMBF as part of their Open Photonics call to improve the vest and develop a haptic toolkit for easier prototyping of different kind of vibration feedback systems. As a first step, we reduced wiring of Davids vest by exchanging the central I2C expander hub on the backside with 8 Adafruit 16*Servo boards on the front, making it easier to maintain the vest and reducing weight - on the cost of a less balanced version (the front part is now far heavier than the back side). This updated vest - along with future versions - will be displayed on different locations: CHI 2016 WILA Bonn Mini Makerfaire Essen Makerfaire Berlin Makerfaire Rome This allows is to get us feedback and testing the reliability of the hardware setup. Control a bunch of vibration motors: The original vest used pcbs with a amplifier circuit (left picture) in a 3d-printed housing for each vibration motor, which was mounted on the pcb within the housing. This allowed to use cheap surface mounted vibration motors, but needed both power lines for voltage supply and a data line for each motor. The standard 3pol pin header allows an easy exchange of these motor units (along with the velcro attachment of the housing and vest). Each half row is connected with the two supply lines in parallel, which are bundled in the middle in a central node as one power supply line, while the data lines goes in between the housings upwards to the controller unit. This at the beginning a central unit (left picture) in a box at the back, where each of eight 16* I2C PWM-driver on a central PCB controls one row of vibration motors. The layouts and schematics for both boards can be found here, as well as the files for the 3D-printed housings (and of course a more detailed description in his thesis). For reducing wires and simplify exchanging the driver units this board was later replaced with the standard Adafruit 16* Servo boards, which also allows the decrease significant the size of the back box, which now only contains the raspberry pi as brain and a Jtron buck converter for the power supply, which could be either a battery pack or cable connection. Personal Photonics: Haptic Toolkit For future versions, we developed until now different methods to use huge numbers of vibration motors (pcb layouts and circuit diagrams can be found here, with the goal of developing an easy-to-use toolkit to develop different kind of systems with huge numbers of vibration motors with acceptable effort. I2C PWM driver: Can be used int he same way as the Adafruit 16*Servo driver, because it uses the same controller, but has an integrated voltage regulator and driver for the vibration motors, such that either encapsulated or pancake vibration motors can be directly connected with the board. Six address pins (solder on resistor) allows to use up to 62 of these boards at one I2C bus. For wiring use a flexible wire, and stabilize the solder joints either with shrink tube (vibration motor side) or hot glue (on the board itself). These boards are then interconnected with each other (and e.g. with the raspberry) with the two voltage and the two I2C lines. Since a voltage converter is on each board, we don't need the bulky central unit anymore and can supply a higher voltage to each board, therefore cables with smaller diameter can be used. This is at the moment our best way to control the vibration motor arrays, because of the small amounts of components to solder and the simple wiring. Serial Connection Here we use the WS2811 driver, which is normally used for RGB led stripes with a serial one wire data bus. Instead of a led, we control the vibration motor with this ic. While it is possible to control up to three motors with one ic (one for each color), we decided to control just one and add two (single-color) control leds instead. Therefore, we can daisy chain this board just like the led boards, and use the same libraries and programs like the Adafruit Neopixel library to control them, up to 1024 at one data pin of a micro controller. Main disadvantage is due to the serial connection if one board breaks, the rest behind will be also dead. Therefore we would only recommend it for non-wearable solution, where the wiring won't be stressed to much or use cases were the motors are spread over a big area. A one wire data lines and the two voltage lines are connecting each board in series. Parallel Connection A dedicated micro controller on each board controls up to four vibration motor. Since the PWM is now done with a general-purpose controller, we can control even linear resonant actuators, which is not be possible for the above mentioned systems. A micro plug system for flat ribbon cable allows an easy setup with crimping 4 pol connectors in parallel on a cable, for the voltage, the serial data line and for programming the micro controller. Current on a standard ribbon cable is limited, therefore after a certain number of vibration motor boards a voltage controller board is plugged in between (again with the same micro plug system), which converts a higher supply voltage down to the 3.3V needed for the boards, reducing the current on the supply lines. Each controller will just listen in parallel for commands, allowing them to work even when some of them break. While we have a highly adaptable wiring system here, which allows also to reuse the boards for different setups, the boards are harder to solder by hand, and you have to program each board individually since each controller needs a unique ID to be addressed individually. Wiring While Davids version used standard 0.14 mm2 stranded wire with pin header connectors for the vibration motor boards, this is to stiff for directly soldering on the vibration motor cable (which is necessary for the I2C expander boards with integrated driver), because the vibration causes the solder joints to break. Additional reinforcements with shrinking tube reduces this problem (and additional fixation on the textile will further reduce it), but since a bunch of wires are used the system will be overall stiff and heavy, and coupling between the different motors might occur via the cables. Therefore we decided to switch to smaller 0,05mm2 stranded wire - an stranded is very important in this case, otherwise the cable itself will break easily. After several tests we settle at the moment on a 0,04 mm2 twin wire for each vibration motor, which is easier to solder than the version with a common wire, allows cleaner routing for detecting faults and allows easier repairs in the future (See the next section for the corresponding image). Special Thanks to Ceyda who had to do this nightmares of soldering. Determine the best Resolution for a haptic image For the original vest David took 4cm distance as a distance dependent on the two-point discrimination threshold of roughly 3,5cm on the human belly according to Kandel et Al. 2013. The grey color values of a depth image are then mapped to the PWM values for driving the corresponding vibration motor. For a more individual approach the distance between the motors might be smaller or bigger if different body parts are used as display area or dependent on the individual user, if such a system is built for one person alone. To determine the optimal distance (and also validate the 4cm distance) we developed a test setup: A matrix of 4*4 vibration motors - driven by one I2C driver is placed within a laser cutted form of foam rubber. This allows precise distances between each motor. Since far smaller distances are used then the expected distance, we can play different pattern on it and determine automatic which distances and changes we can detect. E.g. if the first and thereafter the second row of vibration motors is turned on and the user couldn't feel a difference, this distance between two vibration motors is too small and shouldn't be used in the planned layout. Both changing of the position of a line of vibration motors with or without a pause in between can be tested, for both general detection of in image and to detect motion in a haptic motion picture. The user then has to decide if change in position happens or not. The whole system is then placed with velcro tape on the users body. With a second set up we can determine the possible "color depth" of the haptic image, the PWM or power level which the user can distinguish. Here the power level of one vibration motor is changed and the user has to decide if the vibration got stronger, lesser or stays the same. Since we need a certain pressure of the vibration motor to the skin, the best way is using a certain hanging weight around the system to fixate it on arm or leg (if seated) and apply comparable pressure if you want to compare different user. Otherwise just use velcro to attach the sensor on the human body, where the user can adapt it to his personal preferences. This information allows to reduce the data communication and processing if different sensors and image processing is used. Sensor input and processing David used a Asus XTion depth camera for his vest, which is relative small and runs on USB power. Since only USB2 is needed for the camera, a raspberry pi can be used to process the data. The setup for the pi is well described on his Git-repository, just follow the steps there. As long as either the Adafruit 16*Servo boards or our I2C PWM-driver are used to control the vibration motors - and each driver represents one row, with an ordered address range from 0x40 to 0x48 - you can just use the software without further modifications For more generic layouts we will adapt this software in future to allow an easy setup at the beginning, where you can change which connection is used (I2C for the I2C driver, RX/TX for the parallel driver, or one generic pin for the WS2811 variant) and a simple mapping function between hardware and software solution, but this is future work. Another important upgrade which we will do in the near future is the option to add other sensors, either additional depth cameras - because of the viewing field of the camera things at the bottom and head height disappear from the sensor area when they come closer, which is not acceptable - or other sensors to circumvent certain limitations of the depth camera, e.g. it can't see glass. One option are ultrasonic sensors for short distance warnings or using two normal cameras e.g. on the shoulder for a stereoscopic depth image. The Asus XTion might be replaced in the future with a Intel Realsense camera or other more advanced sensors, but most of the newer ones nowadays use USB3, which is not possible wih the Raspberry Pi at the moment, therefore it might be necessary to switch to a different controller like the OdroidXU4 for example. But staying with the old setup: The Depth camera is just connected with one of the Raspberry USB ports, its I2C port (Pin 3 and 5) is connected with the I2C PWM expander in a row, which are then connected with the individual vibration motors. Power connection comes either with a external power supply or a racing battery pack (7,4V and a big capacity), the 5V USB power banks couldn't deliver enough current. While the original version has PI and vibration motors supplied with a Jtron buck converter, for the versions with distributed voltage controller we need another one for the Pi, a standard 5V/3A DC/Dc converter should be enough as long as not more (USB-)devices are attached to the Pi. The last minor thing to add is a button to enter low-power mode (turning off the vibration motors) at GPIO18, or pin 10 on the GPIO header, which is internally pulled low, therefore a connection to 3,3V of the pi is sufficient, but an additional hardware pulldown with a 10k resistor to ground is of course additional possible. Textile Stuff The original vest had be adaptable to different body sizes while pressing the vibration motors on the body. Therefore the vest was made out of two sheets of stretch fabric with a sleeveless shirt pattern, which where stitched together at the shoulders. We later replaced on shoulder seam with velcro to accelerate vest dressing on the demo sessions. On the belly stripes of velcro are used to attach the vibration motors, and fasten the vest front and back with overlapping velcro stripes at the sides. The Depth camera is mounted with a small 3d-printed holder on the upper body area, while the Pi and Voltage regulator case is located at the back with a Battery. Again, velcro is your friend. A lighter version with encapsulated vibration motors and our new I2C board might be reduced to a sort of kidney belt, where the I2C boards are mounted on the left and right of the belly on small laser cutted boards (e.g. out of POM for stability reasons) with two strips of velcro in between, on which the motors are mounted. These strips are sewn on the laser cutted board with a small stretch band loop to adapt a bit to the belly form. On the upper two strips is a holder for the camera mounted in the middle, and each pair is connected with a 2cm lashing strap on the back, which allows fastening of these pairs. To keep the vertical distances between the vibration motors the velcro strips has to be sewn on a piece of stretch fabric again. For a personal version things will be much easier, because in this case you just need a tight stretch shirt, where the vibration motors are either sewn into pockets, or even just glued on, the problem to be adaptable to different body sizes can be ignored.

This year, at the three-day Huawei Connect event held in a giant arena on the banks of Shanghai’s Huangpu River, the company outlined a plan for getting there. In a keynote speech, Ken Hu, one of Huawei’s three rotating CEOs, said the company aims to position itself as the enabler and driver of an intelligent world. Over the next three days the meaning of these words became clear: Huawei will sell the hardware and software other companies need to build their own clouds. Ambitious Becoming the leading IT company was, and remains, an ambitious goal. It means taking on the likes of HP, Cisco and IBM. These US technology giants are long-established, well-known global brands. They have long-standing customers and deep relationships. Every technology company likes to talk about disruption as if they invented the term. For some of the dinosaurs it is just an idea they pay lip-service to. At Huawei, disruption is a way of life. Over the last decade and a half Huawei pulled off an audacious, disruptive take-over of the telecommunications equipment sector. A decade earlier that industry was dominated by its own set of secure, long-established western giants. Now most of those names have disappeared. Phone disruption More recently Huawei disrupted the mobile phone market. Its first handsets were low-cost models. Huawei sold then to telecommunications carriers who in turn sold the phones to customers using their own brands. Huawei realised these devices were good enough to sell in their own right. Today Huawei is the third biggest phone maker behind Samsung and Apple. Now it’s the turn of the information technology incumbents to face disruptive Huawei. These are already difficult times for traditional information technology companies. For year they sold high margin products and services to a world hungry for computers and software. Those high margins were under pressure for a generation, but that was nothing compared to the threat from cloud computing. Infrastructure-as-a-service Many organisations have stopped or slowed down their IT capital expenditure purchases. Instead they spend operational expenditure money buying infrastructure-as-a-service cloud services from companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Where they once installed expensive and complex applications, they now buy software-as-a-service from the likes of Salesforce, Netsuite and SAP by design. This shift in spending, from traditional IT equipment to cloud services is the key to Huawei’s ambition. Extend the brand In some ways it is a classic brand extension exercise. Huawei’s most important customers have always been the telecommunications carriers. Huawei sells them wireless and fixed line network equipment. In New Zealand it does business with Spark, Vodafone, 2degrees and Chorus. Now many of these companies are embracing cloud computing. Spark New Zealand has made huge cloud investments. It is one of the largest local cloud service providers. Many other telecommunication service providers in countries like China and Germany are starting their own cloud offerings. Huawei already has the relationships in place with these telecommunications firms. It also has a track record of delivering. So it makes perfect sense for telecommunications companies to buy the hardware they need to operate cloud services from the same company that sells them network equipment. And that’s the key to Huawei’s strategy. Another of the company’s three rotating CEOs, Eric Xu, says the company isn’t going after Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, at least not on a global scale and not at this stage. No public clouds...yet He says Huawei will work with service providers for public clouds; “We don’t plan to provide public clouds outside of China.” In the rest of the world Huawei provides the infrastructure other companies need to build their clouds. Huawei also says it doesn’t plan to operate at the higher levels of, say, software-as-a-service, it wants to build the pipes, although it stresses these are intelligent pipes. Telecommunications carriers building cloud projects are the low-hanging fruit for Huawei, but they are just the start, the company intends to sell its cloud products to every company. Xu says there are plans to help organisations in sectors such as finance build clouds, but there’s an even bigger opportunity with manufacturing and industrial companies. He sees room for thousands of new specialist industry-specific clouds. Product firehose There are a lot of cloud products. At Huawei Connect the company announced a slew including 31 FusionCloud Services, FusionStorage 6.0 and the FusionStage PaaS Platform. There are faster switches and faster processors. To get this moving Huawei is looking to forming partnerships and to stick with open source software. Partners were visible at Huawei Connect, executives from Infosys, SAP, Intel and China Telecom among others gave keynote presentations. In a cavernous building next door, expo space was given over to others including Toshiba and SuSE. Outside the Huawei Connect arena, massive industrial barges chug slowly up the river under yellow, smoggy clouds. There’s a powerful metaphor in the contrast between the old face of Chinese industry and the new one. Huawei has a proven track record and a willingness to do the hard work needed to make ambitious plans succeed. It knows how to deliver customer value. There’s every reason to believe it can disrupt the information technology business.
