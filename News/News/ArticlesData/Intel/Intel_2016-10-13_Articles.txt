The Open Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface represents, the consortium says, a data-centric approach, and "provides an open, high-speed pathway for different types of technology – advanced memory, accelerators, networking and storage – to more tightly integrate their functions within servers." It "puts the compute power closer to the data, removes inefficiencies in traditional system architectures to help eliminate system bottlenecks and can significantly improve server performance," according to the consortium. The design specification is "built to minimize the complexity of high-performance accelerator design. Capable of 25Gbits per second data rate, OpenCAPI outperforms the current PCIe specification, which offers a maximum data transfer rate of 16Gbits per second." The consortium's announcement release declares: "Many technology companies have developed innovative solutions that today's data center technology cannot effectively leverage due to limited legacy interfaces. New technologies such as storage class memory and accelerators to support emerging workloads do not fit well on existing interfaces and a closed, proprietary approach does not allow for full industry participation nor innovation." OpenCAPI was founded by AMD, Google, IBM, Mellanox Technologies, and Micron. Other members include Dell EMC, HPE, Nvidia and Xilinx. Several members have product/tech introductions coming: IBM plans to introduce Power9-based servers that leverage the OpenCAPI specification in the second half of 2017. IBM will enable members of OpenPOWER Foundation to introduce OpenCAPI-enabled products in the second half 2017. Google and Rackspace's new Zaius server under development, announced at the OpenPOWER Summit in San Jose, will leverage Power9 processor technology and plans to provide the OpenCAPI interface in its design. Mellanox plans to enable the new specification capabilities in its future products. Xilinx plans to support OpenCAPI-enabled FPGAs. So it's mostly a Power9-driven effort currently. The OpenCAPI consortium plans to make the OpenCAPI specification fully available to the public at no charge before the end of the year. Find out about this and membership details at opencapi.org. Oh, and the supplier of the vast majority of server CPUs, Intel, is not a member. It's welcome to join though, the consortium says. Background The background includes the point that Intel bought FGA supplier Altera for $16.7bn in December 2015, and has its own QPI (Quick Path Interconnect) technology, not to mention Silicon photonics. It seems to us that OpenCAPI overlaps with the Gen-Z Consortium open memory fabric initiative. Both address the memory/storage-class memory interconnect area. Gen-Z aims to provide a direct-attach, switched or fabric topology – a flexible, high-performance memory semantic fabric – to interconnect Compute (SoC memory), FPGA and GPU accelerators, pooled memory, and network/storage IO links. OpenCAPI is meant to allow any microprocessor to attach to coherent user-level accelerators and I/O devices, and advanced memories accessible via read/write or user-level DMA semantics. Then there is the CCIX (Cache Coherent Interconnect for Accelerators) group formed by AMD, ARM, Huawei, IBM, Mellanox, Qualcomm, and Xilinx (but not Nvidia or Intel) in May, to devise and make a cache coherent interconnect fabric linking multiple suppliers' CPUs, accelerators – FPGAs and GPUs – and network adapters so they can exchange data and share main memory. Why are there three such overlapping efforts? The simple answer is that none of the members of these consortia want to let Intel own the CPU-memory-accelerator-network interface technology and so grab an even higher percentage of customer spend on servers, plus favor its own CPU and FPGA efforts. They each and all think that the PCI interface is too slow and a higher-speed, lower-latency interconnect scheme is needed to let faster processors talk to faster accelerators, DRAM and the various storage-class memories emerging (think XPoint-type stuff), and RDMA-accessed external arrays. Gen-Z consortium members are AMD, ARM, Broadcom, Cavium Inc, Cray, Dell EMC, HPE, Huawei, IBM, IDT, Lenovo, Mellanox, Micron, Microsemi, Red Hat, Samsung, Seagate, SK Hynix, Western Digital Corporation and Xilinx. Google and Nvidia are the only OpenCAPI members not in the Gen-Z consortium. Support for OpenCAPI OpenCAPI declares: "Backed by a total of more than 30 leading technology companies, the three organizations welcome each other's announcements as part of a collaborative industry effort to create an open data center architecture for the future." As an example of vendor support, here's Tom Eby, VP and GM of Micron's compute and networking business: "Because open standards present the best opportunity for rapid innovation, the OpenCAPI, Gen-Z, and CCIX consortiums are an important step in ensuring that developing architectures can quickly adapt to capitalize on the dramatic benefits provided by new memory technologies." Here's Gaurav Singh, CCIX Chair: "The CCIX group of companies believe in the need to foster innovation in the industry. We welcome the efforts of and look forward to collaborating with the Gen-Z and OpenCAPI consortiums, which will further the development of key technologies that will define the data centers of tomorrow." Completing the fulsome threesome's joint supportive comments is Kurtis Bowman, Gen-Z Consortium president: "The Gen-Z Consortium is committed to establishing an ecosystem where members, the broader industry, and customers work together to deliver robust, high-quality specifications that enable new data center architectures. The formation of these three new consortia (CCIX, OpenCAPI, and Gen-Z), backed by more than 30 industry-leading global companies, supports the premise that the data center of the future will require open standards. We look forward to collaborating with CCIX and OpenCAPI as this new ecosystem takes shape." Reg Comment Key customers for any non-proprietary alternative to Intel fabric interconnect technology are: The server and hyperscaler suppliers: Cisco, Dell, Fujitsu, HDS, HPE, Huawei, IBM, InSpur, Lenovo, Oracle, Quanta and Supermicro on the server side. Businesses like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft on the hyperscale data center side. End users will basically buy what the server vendors adopt. The three consortia, in a crude view, represent overlapping anti-Intel groups, wanting to constrain and limit chipzilla's ability to grab more of the server silicon component market to itself. It would be more hopeful for them if they could combine in a single CCIX, OpenCAPI, Gen-Z organization, but the individual members' concerns and technology preferences would make such an attempt unwieldy and difficult to bring to a successful conclusion. Hopefully, and nonetheless, they will try anyway. Intel would rather face, we're sure, three partly or ill-coordinated and overlapping groups that collectively confuse interconnect-buying customers, and contrast the trios's confusing messages and timescales with its own, hopefully clearer and simpler message.

The Linux Link Tech Show "We're bringing open Power architecture to the workstation and high-end desktop level." (Podcast) Talos™ is a state-of-the-art mainboard designed for the new IBM POWER8 architecture. It is the first and only high performance computer with absolutely no proprietary software or firmware blobs. With its ATX form factor, Talos™ brings a level of performance to the workstation realm usually found in dedicated servers and a level of freedom and user control long extinct in modern hardware. In addition to its onboard, open-toolchain FPGAs, Talos™ easily and tightly interfaces with GPUs, FPGAs, and custom hardware. Overview Performance Talos™ competes with the highest-end mainstream (e.g., x86) computers available - Intel Xeon E5 and even E7 machines. Whether it’s AAA games, intensive CAD and modeling software, or machine learning algorithms for crunching huge datasets, Talos™ is well-equipped to handle the workload: Up to 256 GB RAM Up to 96 logical cores Multiple PCIe, USB, and other interfaces Onboard FPGAs Security Talos’™ fully open firmware means there are absolutely no inscrutable binary blobs where bugs, backdoors, and vulnerabilities can hide. If you deal with sensitive information or you care about the safety of your intellectual property, Talos™ will dramatically reduce the risk of intrusion and theft with features like: Trusted Platform Module (TPM) that verifies all firmware before boot No Intel Management Engine or equivalent Auditable schematics, firmware, and software 100% self-hosting, no need for external tools or compilers Control Say goodbye to the days of not being able to configure your system to your needs because of inaccessible firmware, schematics, or toolchains. With Talos™, you own the machine and can modify it to your heart’s content: No signing keys preventing firmware modification Openly licensed firmware and software (Apache 2.0, GPL 2.0, GPL 3.0) Open toolchains for the onboard FPGAs allow for tuning of power sequencing, IRQ routing, and more Extensibility You can extend Talos’™ capabilities with hardware accelerators (e.g., FPGAs and GPUs) and with custom peripherals, using a wide array of interfaces: GPIO header Seven PCIe slots Eight USB 3.0 ports High-level overview of Talos™ mainboard components A. 1 x PCI slot G. 8 x DDR3 ECC DIMM slots B.

IBM has published a significant amount of detailed POWER8 design and software documentation: POWER Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) v2.07 POWER8 Processor User’s Manual for the Single-Chip Module IBM’s OpenPOWER Connect portal (free account creation required) OpenPOWER Foundation Raptor Engineering (a partner of Raptor Computing Systems) is a member of the OpenPOWER Foundation, an open technical membership organization dedicated to the POWER architecture. A World Beyond x86 The x86 architecture, while ubiquitous in personal computing, suffers from irreparable security and lockdown issues. For example, the Intel Management Engine (ME) is a problem that’s been brewing for about ten years, even though the popular technology press has only recently started reporting on it. The Intel ME is present on all modern Intel processors and is essentially a backdoor with full access to the entire computer - a security disaster waiting to happen. Due to the deeply entrenched interests of current players (e.g., Intel and AMD), and the presumed jungle of legally binding contracts those interests have with their myriad partners, this situation will never improve and will only worsen. The video below goes into detail about why Talos is a great alternative to x86. (This presentation was first given at the Coreboot conference and developer meeting in San Francisco, June 2016.) Comparisons & Benchmarks AnandTech recently did an extensive comparison of IBM’s POWER8 processor with Intel’s Xeon E5. This quote from the conclusion highlights the strength of the POWER8 processor: The POWER8 microarchitecture is clearly built to run at least two threads. On average, two threads gives a massive 43% performance boost, with further peaks of up to 84%. This is in sharp contrast with Intel’s SMT, which delivers a 18% performance boost with peaks of up to 32%. Taken further, SMT-4 on the POWER8 chip outright doubles its performance compared to single threaded situations in many of the SPEC CPU subtests. All in all, the maximum throughput of one POWER8 core is about 43% faster than a similar Broadwell-based Xeon E5 v4. Considering that using more cores hardly ever results in perfect scaling, a POWER8 CPU should be able to keep up with a Xeon with 40 to 60% more cores. Benchmarks and graphs in the remainder of this section are provided as-is for general reference only, and are copyright Raptor Engineering 2016. High-level Comparison of Machine Architectures Values are approximate and for illustration purposes only. The State of General Purpose Computing Where does Talos™ fit within the larger spectrum of general purpose computers? Talos™ is the only powerful, auditable machine available in a standard ATX workstation / server form factor. Nothing else comes close. While certain ARM SoCs are relatively open and libre-friendly, their performance leaves much to be desired. Most of these ARM SoCs cannot even compete against x86 hardware from the late 2000s on a raw performance or performance per watt basis. However, they are inexpensive and in some cases suitable for light web browsing or other non-intensive tasks. On the x86 end, all currently available hardware has been effectively “TiVoized” through vendor- and manufacturer-signed binaries, and can never be audited or modified by the machine owner. Multiple scandals have come to light over the past year involving the manufacturer abusing this position of power to install various forms of malware through a hostile firmware image. In many cases the only recourse was to stop using the computer entirely until the manufacturer released a new firmware version with the malware ostensibly removed. This tradeoff of inexpensive machines for loss of owner control over said machines is unacceptable for many users in the current age of diminishing privacy and increasingly damaging cyberattacks. Even machines ostensibly built for security are impacted by this situation. For example, the ORWL listed in the table below may have excellent hardware security features, but the software and firmware stack running on its x86 processor is completely unauditable, has full machine control even after operating system launch, and may not be trustworthy. Why would a criminal even bother attacking such a machine physically when a remote wireless or Internet-based exploit would be not only more cost effective but virtually untraceable? Talos™ does not allow such malware or bugs to hide undetected in the most privileged and sensitive areas of your system, namely the firmware and kernel, nor does it ask you to give up modern, high-end general purpose compute performance in the name of security.

These applications are using the full 3D hardware capabilities of the host POWER8 machine, and have access to the host’s ALSA audio. Applications that primarily use scalar instructions perform quite well, while applications making heavy use of vector instructions experience lag and stuttering due to missing features in QEMU (see notes below). Multiple 3D games were used to demonstrate the feasibility of a non-native engine binary interfacing with the POWER8 host GPU. At the end of the video, several applications are re-launched using native ppc64el builds for a performance comparison. Notes: Video captured straight from Radeon DVI output. ALSA audio functions also, but was not captured for this demonstration. This QEMU patch series is required, and was applied to the QEMU master version used in this demonstration. Stuttering is largely caused by QEMU not translating target SIMD / vector instructions to host SIMD / vector instructions. QEMU currently translates each vector instruction (e.g. from SSE/SSE2/AVX/NEON/AltiVec) to large chunks of scalar code, resulting in very slow vector execution. This currently affects all target / host pairs available in QEMU, not just the OpenPOWER / x86 combination. The QEMU project is seeking volunteers to implement SIMD / vector translation, so if you would like to help out please contact the developers! setreuid() / setegid() calls from target binaries currently crash QEMU. Alien Arena was recompiled for x86 with those two calls commented out for this demonstration. Tested using POWER8 with a single AMD Radeon R290X and the open Radeon driver. Host kernel must be compiled with 4k page support to match the x86_64 architecture-defined page size. DRM passthrough requires that the QEMU host process LP mode match the target LP mode; i.e. i386 targets would require a 32-bit build of QEMU. Because OpenPOWER™ ships with a stock 64-bit kernel and userspace, i386 targets have not been tested. Unreal® Engine 4 on OpenPOWER™ The following video illustrates the power of Talos™ to accelerate game development. Talos™ allows you to keep your valuable assets and proprietary engine code safe and secure through full owner control, while outperforming similarly priced systems running on the x86 and ARM architectures. Talos™’ massive RAM and GPU bandwidth reduce both compile and asset cook times which frees developers to focus on improving the design and gameplay of their next AAA title. Notes: Radeon 290X used with Mesa 12 in OpenGL 4.3 mode on Debian Strech (LLVM 3.9). Flickering directional lights are a general bug in the Unreal® Engine OpenGL backend; this issue is present on all architectures and has been reported to Epic Games. Editor load time is similar to load time experienced on the x86 architecture using Linux. Video recorded directly from R290X output at 1920x1080 60FPS using 5.1 HDMI audio. Several minor dropouts are present in the video due to the extreme bandwidth of the source stream. These dropouts are an artifact of the recording process used and are not visible during gameplay. This Unreal® Engine 4 patch series is required (agreement with Epic Games required for private access), and was applied to the Unreal® Engine 4 master version used in this demonstration. This Unreal Tournament™ patch series is required (agreement with Epic Games required for private access), and was applied to the Unreal Tournament™ master version used in this demonstration. This Radeon driver patch is required, and was applied to the radeon driver used in this demonstration. Building a Complete Talos™ System You’ll need the following components to build out a complete Talos™ system. CPU If you don’t already have one, you can add a POWER8 CPU to your order. We currently offer 8-, 10-, and 12-core options. RAM While a full RAM hardware compatibility list (HCL) is not yet available, we can recommend Hynix 16GB x4 ECC RDIMMs operating at DDR3 PC-12800 speeds. GPU Although an integrated display driver comes with the Talos™ mainboard, you can also install a discrete GPU of your choosing. We recommend any NVIDIA GK104-based card, which is a reasonably modern GPU that can be initialized by and used with the libre Nouveau driver. Should a discrete GPU be installed, the integrated display driver can either be safely disabled or used as a secondary display output, contingent on software support. Enclosure A good choice for an enclosure is the Super Micro Computer SC747TG-R1400B-SQ. Development Process Our firmware and software development system for OpenPOWER uses a two-socket reference server from IBM codenamed “Firestone.” This allows us to directly verify functionality, check performance, and develop / port new software to Talos™ machines even before Talos™ prototypes have been manufactured. The following images show our test setup. Angled view of the internals of the Firestone server used for Talos™ prototyping Top view of the internals of the Firestone server used for Talos™ prototyping To configure Firestone emulation of Talos™, we pull all cards and disable the secondary CPU package, then we install two memory buffer cards on CP0 and add in PCIe cards containing the new peripherals present on Talos™. While the resultant configuration is not exactly the same as a Talos™ system, and in fact from a pure hardware perspective is quite different, from a performance and software view it is nearly indistinguishable. This configuration is what we use to patch the kernel, modify the OpenPOWER firmware, and gather benchmarks for the Talos™ machines. Manufacturing Plan We are in the process of converting the Talos™ designs into the requisite PCB layout. During this process, firmware development is occurring in parallel. Once these two processes are complete, initial bringup will commence, followed by full testing and requisite minor modifications before release for manufacture. We have many years of experience in all aspects of electrical and software engineering, spanning board level layout through high level application development, without any gaps. As a result, we fully understand each and every part of our designs, the interactions between those parts, and are uniquely situated to handle large, complex projects requiring each component to mesh neatly with the surrounding components, whether those components be hardware, firmware, or software. Our design philosophy is to do it right the first time, and we take explicit steps to ensure that the resultant product will operate in a wide range of adverse conditions. For this particular project we also have the backing of our major silicon vendors, who are willing to work with us to ensure that their devices are used correctly and to their maximum potential. Risks & Challenges What could go wrong? With a project of this complexity, there are numerous potential failure points. Raptor Engineering has significant experience in board level design and system bringup, so we have anticipated and handled the most likely points of failure. That being said, certain unknowns still remain: Board space! Cramming a high-performance POWER8 processor and its support circuitry onto a densely populated ATX board means there is zero physical margin in many areas. While we are fairly confident that the board can be routed as depicted, there is still the off chance that some changes to the list of Talos™ peripherals may need to be made during the routing phase. The open toolchain for the FPGAs, while apparently stable, has not been tested to the same degree as most commercial offerings. Any number of issues could crop up during bringup of the FPGA section as a result of the toolchain – our fallback plan would involve developing the FPGA HDL using the proprietary software and assisting the open toolchain project(s) where feasible after Talos™ has shipped. DDR3 / PCIe routing / signal integrity issues. Even when design guidelines are rigorously followed, there is always the chance that signal integrity will be compromised somewhere due to nearby signals and components. If this occurs, the fault will need to be isolated and repaired in the prototyping stage. System firmware. Current offerings from IBM require the machine owner follow strict guidelines for memory population and related hardware configuration. It is likely that bugs in the IBM firmware will be discovered once these rules are no longer enforced. Linux drivers. While overall the switch to little endian has ensured the vast majority of existing Linux drivers function normally on Talos™, there is still the potential for various bugs in these drivers to appear in the final system configuration. Ordering & Payment Crowd Supply can accept a wide array of payment options, though credit card is the easiest way to place an order. Because this is a crowdfunding campaign, any order you place for a Talos™ system using a credit card will not actually be charged until the campaign reaches the funding goal ($3.7M USD). If we don’t reach that goal, no credit cards will be charged and orders paid by means other than credit card will be refunded. For some product options, you will need to add a POWER8 processor as a separate line item to your order (or order it separately later). These processors are in “pre-order” mode, which means you will be charged for them right away. However, if the campaign does not meet the funding goal, all pre-orders of POWER8 CPUs will be fully refunded. Why are the CPUs Sold Separately? Unfortunately, the answer to that question is a little complicated. Basically, it has to do with the complexities of crowdfunding and ensuring that we’re doing all we can to protect backers. Generally speaking, the CPUs are offered separately from the mainboards in order to ensure that the campaign’s funding goal is accurate. While the funding goal is a dollar amount ($3.7M), it is based on a minimum order quantity (MOQ) of Talos mainboards, 900 units. The problem is that basing a campaign on an MOQ is impractical for a number of reasons. For example, backers are unaccustomed to such campaigns, there’s no way to account for support-only pledges, and different components that go into the product can have different MOQs. Given this reality, the wide price range of CPUs (from $0 if a CPU isn’t wanted, up to $3350 for a 12-core CPU) means it would be basically impossible to accurately or meaningfully set a funding goal. For example, if no one bought a CPU, the goal would be 900 x $4100 = $3.7M. On the other hand, if everyone bought a 12-core CPU, then the funding goal would need to be 900 x ($4100 + $3350) =$6.7M. Because we can’t possibly predict the demand for each CPU, we therefore need to sell them separately from the mainboards. You’ll also note that the CPUs are sold in “pre-order” mode as opposed to “crowdfunding” mode, which means your card is charged as soon as the order is placed. That’s because, unlike the mainboards, there is no strict MOQ to meet before they can be manufactured. As with all pre-orders on Crowd Supply, you can cancel and get a full refund at any time. As we note on the CPU page, if the Talos campaign fails to meet its funding goal, all CPU orders will be promptly canceled and refunded in full. On one hand, this is all a little cumbersome and confusing. On the other hand, it allows you to spread out the cost of purchase over a longer time by giving you the option of purchasing the CPU later. The bottom line is that these processes are in place to best protect backers while maximizing the potential for a successful campaign.

Advanced Micro Devices officials said Chinese internet giant Alibaba will use the company's graphics technologies in its cloud computing efforts, a significant win for the chip maker as it looks to re-establish itself in the data center against larger rivals Intel and Nvidia. AMD President and CEO Lisa Su and Simon Hu, president of Alibaba's cloud computing unit, announced the partnership Oct. 14 during the Alibaba Computing Conference in China. According to AMD officials, Alibaba will use AMD's Radeon Pro graphics cards in its global cloud data center as part of an effort to expand its cloud offerings and drive adoption of its cloud-based services. Graphics has been a key component of AMD executives' larger strategy to grow the company and return it to sustainable profitability. GPUs enable the company to compete in a broad range of growth areas in the industry, including gaming, immersive computing and virtual reality (VR). In addition, GPUs increasingly are used as CPU accelerators in the data center for enterprises, supercomputer and high-performance computing (HPC) environments, increasing the performance of systems while reining in power consumption. The chip maker created the Radeon Technology Group (RTG) for its GPU efforts and over the past year has unveiled a range of new GPUs, introduced new technologies to the chips like high-bandwidth memory (HBM) technology, rolled out Radeon Software Crimson to replace its Catalyst Control Center and compete with Nvidia's GeForce Experience software, and introduced the Boltzmann Initiative (a project designed to make it easier to develop high-performance computing applications for the FirePro graphics technology). Most recently, AMD has introduced a growing portfolio of GPUs based on its new Polaris architecture, a 14-nanomter 3D FinFET transistor design that helps the chips more than double the performance-per-watt of previous Radeon graphics technologies. Officials also have begun talking about the company's next-generation GPU architecture, dubbed "Vega." AMD CEO Su in a statement said a collaboration like that with Alibaba Cloud "helps ensure the investments AMD is making in our high-performance graphics and computing data center products continue to align with the needs of the broader cloud market." During Alibaba's show in China, the companies demonstrated an Alibaba Cloud solution featuring AMD's Radeon Pro server GPUs. The chip maker is targeting the data center as another growth area. More than a decade ago, AMD made inroads into the space against Intel with the launch of its Opteron processors, enabling it to grab almost a quarter of the worldwide server chip space. However, Intel, with all of its financial and engineering resources, and missteps by AMD, conspired to knock that market share down, and now more than 95 percent of all servers run on Intel processors. However, an array of companies—not only AMD, but also ARM with its low-power architecture and IBM with its Power chips and OpenPower efforts—are looking to grab some of the market, positioning themselves in the industry as the best alternative to Intel. AMD is looking to compete against Intel with its upcoming "Zen" microarchitecture, systems powered by Zen-based "Naples" chips shipping in the second quarter 2017. At the same time, AMD officials want to challenge GPU giant Nvidia with the company's Radeon processors. The company apparently is beginning to make inroads. Jon Peddie Research analysts said in a recent report that AMD saw a bump in its market-share competition against Nvidia and Intel. AMD's worldwide market share in the second quarter grew 2.8 percent from the same period last year, to 13.5 percent. Both Nvidia and Intel showed slight declines, though Nvidia still holds a commanding lead with a 72.6 percent market share. In addition, AMD saw a 4.03 percent bump in sales of discrete desktop GPUs over the first quarter, according to the analysts. Alibaba is looking to grow its cloud business to help it compete with the likes of Amazon Web Services and Microsoft's Azure cloud business.             LATEST CLOUD ARTICLES   Google, Facebook Move To Curb Ads On 'Fake News' Sites Microsoft Outlook Customer Manager Helps SMBs Track Tasks, Contacts Facebook Unveils Messenger Group Chat in Canada, Australia How the Internet Came of Age as a Campaign Tool in 2016 Election Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

(Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images) Blades, Dell, Google, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel Google, IBM, Others Pitch Open Standard for Cloud Server Design by Yevgeniy Sverdlik  on October 14, 2016 Add Your Comments Tweet A group of tech giants working to mount a serious challenge to Intel in the data center, has previewed an upcoming open standard for interconnecting components in a server it is positioning as an alternative to Intel’s proprietary technology. The group includes Google, hardware vendors IBM, HP Enterprise, Dell EMC, as well as Intel’s more direct rivals AMD and NVIDIA, among others. IBM’s upcoming Power9 processors, expected to launch next year, will support the standard and so will IBM’s servers they will power. Intel currently dominates the market for server chips, and hyperscale data center operators like Google, which spend enormous amounts of money on hardware every quarter, want a viable alternative. They have generally adopted a multi-vendor strategy for sourcing nearly all components of their infrastructure, but it’s difficult to extend that strategy to processors given the size of Intel’s lead in the market. OpenCAPI and Power9 are aimed at the high end of the server market – computers used for data-intensive analytics workloads or machine learning. The group claims that the standard will be capable of boosting server performance tenfold. That performance improvement comes as a result of two things: higher bandwidth on the links between CPUs and accelerators and cache coherency, which essentially means data needs to be shuffled less within the system as it is being processed, saving resources as a result. Click chart to enlarge: Accelerators, or additional processors that take on a portion of the CPU’s workload to free up its resources, have been a mainstay in the world of supercomputers for years, but their role is now growing in importance in server architecture for cloud data centers and for the quickly emerging field of machine learning. “The compute model going forward is the marriage between a really good data-centric processor, like Power, and a really good set of acceleration technologies,” Doug Balog, general manager for IBM Power Systems, said in an interview with Data Center Knowledge. Most accelerators in use today are GPUs, made by the likes of AMD and Nvidia, and some are Intel’s Xeon Phi, but there has also been growth in the use of FPGAs, or Field-Programmable Gate Arrays, as accelerators. The advantage of FPGAs is that they can be reconfigured as workload needs change. Intel has invested heavily in FPGAs last year, paying $16.7 billion to acquire FPGA specialist Altera. The most prominent user of FPGAs to accelerate cloud workloads is Microsoft, whose latest-generation cloud server design supports the technology.

There are divergent views on this today, with companies like Nvidia supporting GPU-accelerated AI servers and Intel saying that model isn’t scalable, pitching the next generation of its Xeon Phi processors – codenamed Knights Mill and expected to hit the market next year – as the better alternative. Amazon’s cloud servers for data-intensive workloads, including machine learning, rely on GPUs, and so does Big Sur, Facebook’s open source server design for AI workloads.

The company hasn’t revealed any details about TPU’s architecture, saying only that it is an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) and that it is optimized for TensorFlow, its library of open source software for making AI applications. Google is also working on a server design together with Rackspace, which will run on IBM’s Power9 processors and have the OpenCAPI interface. The companies released the first draft of the Zaius server spec, which they plan to contribute to the Open Compute Project, today. The OpenCAPI consortium has an FPGA player among its members, in addition to server and GPU vendors. San Jose-based Xilinx plans to support OpenCAPI-enabled FPGAs, according to Friday’s announcement.

[Photo: Flickr user Brett Jordan] Mark Sullivan 10.14.16 6:01 AM Do Fortune 500 CEOs dream of electric sheep? No, they dream about the hundreds of ways their companies could be put out of business by the radical idea that they never see coming. A new business model, or some gadget. At first it's a novelty, easy to laugh off, but then it evolves, people begin to get it, and it catches on. Next thing you know, your company is Kodak, Blockbuster, or a taxi cab. There's no shortage of research and consulting firms that offer to help companies avoid these fates. Some might tout their design thinking chops, others employ improvisational comedy tropes. But a small Burbank, California, consulting and prototyping firm called SciFutures caught my eye for its own slightly odd approach. The firm works with a panel of 100 published science fiction writers to help its clients visualize their worst disruption nightmares, and then begin to imagine the products or business ideas that might offer them an alternate reality. SciFutures CEO and founder Ari Popper and CTO Scott Susskind truly believe that the biggest and most influential technologies of the future are often foretold in science fiction writing. Examples of this aren’t hard to find. In 1945, Arthur C. Clarke came up with the idea of using satellites for global communication. The internet was foreseen in the cyberpunk tales of William Gibson in the early '80s when people in university labs were just beginning to connect networks of computers. Oculus chief scientist Michael Abrash credited The Matrix for showing that virtual reality (VR) is a viable idea. The augmented reality (AR) startup Magic Leap hired Snow Crash author Neal Stephenson to be its chief futurist. Scott Susskind The secret of innovation, according to SciFutures, can be unlocked by understanding how the realities, the knowns, of the present logically move toward the as-yet-unknown realities of the future. Science fiction prototyping—turning futuristic ideas into applied technologies—has been successfully used in the past, notably by futurist Brian David Johnson while he was working at Intel. Their integrated circuits had very long life cycles of between seven and 10 years, which meant the company had to anticipate the needs of the marketplace a decade in the future in order to design the next generation of chips. Companies had already been prototyping products using scenario-based design; Johnson had the good idea of using science fiction writing techniques to cast those scenarios 10 years in the future. He soon expanded the idea and wrote it into an Intel product design framework called the Consumer Experience Architecture. Johnson may have introduced the concept to the world, but Popper says SciFutures is the first company to found a business on Science Fiction Prototyping. The story goes that Popper was doing a sci-fi writers group when he had an epiphany that sci-fi might help unlock the corporate creative forces that give birth to game-changing products. He says he wasn’t completely sure the idea could become a viable business, but he decided to try it anyway. He later brought on Susskind to focus on the physical prototyping part of the business. As Popper and company have refined their "future-casting" workshops and the way they work with sci-fi writers, the SciFutures idea started to work. Now the firm’s client list includes Samsung and Intel, consumer packaged goods companies like The Hershey Company and Clorox, and financial services companies such as Visa and the Ford Motor Company. Ari Popper SciFutures’ best-known project was helping the Lowe’s hardware store chain conceive of and create the HoloRoom, a 20-by-20-foot physical space in which shoppers can see how various Lowe’s products (like paints, flooring, or window coverings) would look in their own homes. Customers use a tablet to pick out the products—3D representations of them—then use an AR headset to see the products placed in context in the home. They can then quickly flip through different paint and window covering combinations, for example. The first HoloRooms were opened in two Lowe’s stores in Canada in 2014, then in 19 U.S. stores starting in 2015. Since then Lowe's has continued developing the HoloRooms with different technology partners. The HoloRoom was one of the ideas that bubbled up when Lowe’s Innovation Lab went through the SciFutures process, complete with science fiction writer punch-ups and product prototyping. Augmented reality-aided shopping isn’t exactly new, but SciFutures and Lowe’s brought it to consumers well in advance of other major retailers. Ikea, for example, launched its AR shopping app this past April. The online furniture retailer Wayfair.com launched its WayfairView app in June using Google's Project Tango AR software. A Trip To Tomorrowland The SciFutures office is nestled between an audio/video rental shop and a rehab center in a cluster of office buildings. The top floor is an open space with large skylights, a couple large conference rooms, an open kitchen, one large office where Popper and Scott sit, and a couple of large worktables where the company’s account reps, marketing people, and support staff work. On the first floor I saw a shop loaded with tools for building demos and prototypes, and a big industrial space where large physical exhibits are built, such as a car interior exhibit built to demo Visa’s in-car mobile payments. The most interesting place in the building was across the hall: the emerging technology and prototype demo lab. The space is partly for show and partly for work. Half of it is outfitted with the couches, tables, and TVs you always see in Internet of Things (IoT) or smart home demos. VR headsets were there for use by visitors. And underneath one of the TVs was a dense bank of digital production gear, a keyboard, and some headgear. Some serious VR or AR programming—real prototyping and development work—had been going on there before I arrived. Maybe the L.A. heat had got to me, but in this room I started to pick up on a sort of Disney World "anything can happen" vibe. The room is full of tables on which staff are busy "playing" with emerging technologies that will be combined in various ways to create something as yet unseen. Most of the prototypes are top secret at the moment, but a few were already public. One table was littered with home appliances and tablet PCs, with an Amazon Echo voice-based personal assistant device in the center controlling it all. In fact, SciFutures has become a leading developer of new "skills" for Alexa, the natural language brain that powers Echo. They just built a skill for Glad that tells you what’s recyclable and gives advice on how to do it. One table was littered with the fronts of credit card payment terminals; the SciFutures engineers were demonstrating how thieves use them to easily "scrape" credit card information at the countertop or the ATM. SciFutures has at least one military client, NATO’s Allied Command Transformation, who it is helping "imagine the future of warfare," says Popper. And that’s about all he would tell me about it. The Storytellers The freelance writers who work with SciFutures aren’t given a whole lot to go on, and they never meet or talk to the client. That’s by design. They’re given a short brief about the client’s products and industry, and about the outcomes of a workshop (more on that later). The writer then creates a two- to three-page story treatment over the course of a few days that shows where the technology might go. The treatments use a familiar format and story arc; they usually focus on one or two main characters and their discovery and interaction with the technology, as well as the cultural context in which it happens—the political, social, and psychological effects on people. SciFutures exerts some influence on the result by selecting which writer or writers will work on a specific client account. SciFutures categorizes writers by their focus areas, interests, research areas, hobbies, prior careers, age, geography, and psychographic information. It’s also important that the writer targets the right kind of "future" in the treatment. Popper says he looks for the right balance between the fantastic and the realistic. "You kind of remove a layer of abstraction between the person sitting in a lab and the user deriving pleasure from using the product."—Divya Breed, sci-fi author "The work we do is more like predicting, like projecting 10 to 15 years out into the future," one of the writers from SciFutures’ panel, Divya Breed, told me. "It’s not so much fantasizing but more like thinking wishfully—thinking of fun ways the tech could be developed." Breed, who once worked as an engineer at a tech company, says now that she’s a professional writer she’s still immersed in tech; she still runs in social circles where it's usually the topic of conversation. Emerging technologies are also the subject of her research for her own sci-fi work. All of that can potentially influence her take on the technology described in the assignments she gets. Another SciFutures writer, Brenta Blevins, is a professor at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and focuses her research on virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality tech. "The writers are trying to produce multiple science fiction treatments that show multiple different ways these products can change people’s lives," she told me. Brenta Blevins I asked Blevins why she thinks the SciFutures process works. "It’s the power of story; stories are the original reality simulators," she says. "These are thought experiments that provide this wide range of ways to think about these products." The narratives offer a chance to portray all the ways new technologies might impact human beings, she says. The imaginings of writers like Breed and Blevins brings a very different flavor to SciFutures’ process and deliverables, compared to that of other consultants. "You kind of remove a layer of abstraction between the person sitting in a lab and the user deriving pleasure from using the product," says Breed. "It helps bridge that gap and helps people make new product real." The work done in the workshops, and the further ideation by the sci-fi writers, culminates in an array of deliverables for the client company. It might be written or verbal consulting, animations, or videos, or a graphic novel. Divya Breed SciFutures also provides clients with a graphical map that shows all the ideas discussed and the technologies that would need to be brought to bear to create them. The map looks something like a solar system map, with each idea placed by type into a pie slice around the middle. Within each of those segments the supporting technologies for the ideas are arranged closer or further from the center based on their viability score. That is, technologies closer to the middle are mature, ready to deploy, while less mature technologies (like mind-machine interfaces) are placed toward the outside solar system. For Hershey, SciFutures created a graphic novel that portrayed how people might use 3D-printed food (not just chocolate) in the future. The point is to place the ideas created in the workgroup or by the sci-fi authors into real-life settings and human situations to bring the whole thing closer to reality. Hershey had already built and productized 3D-printed chocolate after the company’s CEO met a 3D printing company executive at a conference and told his new friend "we should do business together." Soon after, it became Hershey innovation group manager Jeff Mundt’s task to figure out how the technology might evolve, how people might want to 3D-print food in the future. "We have created very intricate [chocolate] shapes, but now what?" Mundt says. "What’s the commercial path for this? If people are going to use it, what might that look like? Are you really going to print out your breakfast while you’re sleeping?" Understanding what chocolate consumers want today requires only traditional market research, Mundt points out, but understanding the wants of people in the future is something different. The SciFutures process helped Mundt and his group tackle some hard questions about 3D printing. "The story can help you create that roadmap," Mundt says. "If that’s going to be true, then what are the steps that are going to be necessary to get us there? So you can kind of work backwards." Mundt points out that the SciFutures process was just one possible approach, and that approach isn’t for everybody. "We are a conservative company, and what you get from working with SciFutures is something that looks like a comic book," Mundt says. "It’s actually an illustrated narrative, but a senior manager at a conservative CPG (consumer packaged goods) company might be looking for Nielsen data, [and might ask] ‘Why would I do that?" "There's definitely a healthy tension between being too close in, where you're not really disrupting and pushing, and so far out where it becomes ridiculous and meaningless," Popper says. "[We] know how to really get the best out of both worlds, so it will be disruptive and imaginative enough that you're pushing the boundaries, but have enough of a link back to today so that you can build to that." SciFutures earns consulting fees for their initial ideation work with clients, but the hope is that the process will graduate to the next phase. "What we then hope it does is trigger the prototyping so that we can start to build early-stage articulations of [actual products]," Susskind says. The entire bottom floor of SciFutures’ space in Burbank is reserved for just that. Antibodies SciFutures has had its failures. A couple of young and energetic executives from a large consumer products company (Popper asked me not to mention the name) came to SciFutures to help them conceive of some new and futuristic ways of marketing a new technology they’d invented. The first major step in SciFutures’ process is a "grounding" meeting with the client in which Popper, Susskind, an in-house sci-fi writer, and some staffers work to orient the client to emerging technologies in general, and to the emerging technologies that might impact the client specifically. The workshops involve anywhere from five to 30 people. After the foundations have been laid, a new phase begins: the "disorienting." The client is told to forget about the day-to-day concerns of the business and complete a number of writing exercises in which they imagine the dystopian future of the company, and the technology and services that might be in it. "Let's put ourselves out of business applying what we've learned," Popper says (speaking for the client). For instance, during a workshop SciFutures did with Ford’s Future’s Group, the Ford people imagined a future in which nobody owns cars but rather shares or borrows them. "It helps everyone articulate unconscious fears that they might have about their business that they've never brought up or have frankly never even thought about," says Popper. After the client has scared the daylights out of themselves by imagining a future where their company has been disrupted out of business, they start to think about how a happy ending might come about. "They do a little dystopic diligence and use that information as a way to elevate their company, their product, business model, whatever it might be," Susskind says. Some of the ideas generated in the workshops, if acted upon, could mean major strategic changes and reallocation of resources. That’s scary to people with children and mortgages. Popper says these people often hit a breaking point when those self-preservation instincts kick in. They often use statements like: "That will never work," or "You can't do that," or "Why?" or "You just can't," Popper says. "The body language is funny," Susskind says. "It's like a threat; I'm protecting my body against a threat." Popper says when his team initially began to witness this type of response, they thought they were doing something wrong by going too far. But they soon recognized it as a symptom of something going right. "We push them, and sometimes they're just too afraid, and they stop," Popper says. "We've had clients where we've had to go, ‘Okay.’" In the case of the unnamed consumer products company, the junior execs who championed SciFutures internally were full of energy and good intentions, Popper says. But more senior people within the company were only interested in "giving lip service" to innovation without really doing anything. They had even set up an "innovation fund" and allotted some cash to it. One high-ranking exec pulled Popper aside and said: "Look, I'm not supposed to say this, but I'm going to tell you guys anyway. We need to change—and we never will." And that’s why the SciFutures process ultimately didn’t work there. "You can't do this halfheartedly, Popper says. "It's painful and it's bruises, but that's when you get to the really great work; they just didn't give themselves the permission or the space to get into it." They Want To Believe Popper is a very convincing guy. He’s a very likable guy. His customers say he’s extremely energized about technology, a true believer, and that his excitement has a way of rubbing off on others. Popper’s personality is important because SciFutures wants to do more than just sci-fi ideation and prototyping. They want to evangelize; they want to help win the battle for hearts and minds within the client’s walls. Popper and Susskind told me they are very concerned about finding people at the client who get the need for change and new ideas, but also a budget, and the political juice to push the ideas to fruition. Popper: "We feel that if we haven't changed behavior or if we haven't created a need for product or a meaningful new way of doing business, then we actually haven't been that successful, all we've done is entertain people, and you can go see a sci-fi film to do that." Susskind, too, exudes the kind of blue-sky, optimistic vibe I felt in Burbank. He’s also an engineer—steeped in a kaleidoscope of near-field and far-field emerging technologies—a kind of MacGyver, the guy who knows how to gather all the right hardware and software ingredients. For one prototype, Susskind might source technologies from 10 different partners and piece them altogether into a device that’s never been seen before. The tables down on the first floor at SciFutures are littered with such parts. The trouble with prototyping is that it's expensive. Building just one can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. That's why SciFutures has begun creating virtual prototypes using augmented reality tech, to show clients how a product might work in the real world, and allow people from the client to share it with other people in the company. The difference is that the product is seen through the screen of a tablet or through a headset like Microsoft’s HoloLens. "People can see them and almost have a visceral experience, just short of actually physically holding it in your hand, but it will still show potential," Susskind says. But no matter how real the simulation or convincing the prototype, for executives who can’t or won’t confront change and embrace their fears, the future will remain a scary, dangerous place. And those who do choose to change have to survive sometimes painful internal transformations, overcoming lots of doubt along the way. Popper makes it sound almost spiritual: "In order to start something new you have to stop doing what you were doing," he says. "It’s about realigning your efforts, and it ultimately leads to a new place of knowledge, confidence, and wisdom." Never miss a story.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Microsoft may announce updated Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 devices later this month 0 by Pradeep  @pradeepviswav Oct 14, 2016 at 15:53 GMT1 month ago Microsoft is expected to introduce a new type of Surface device later this month at an event in New York. It is almost confirmed that the new type of Surface would be an All-In-One. Earlier this week, we also reported that Microsoft may also reveal updated Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book devices  featuring Intel’s Kabylake processors. Amazon listings of these devices have been now updated with “OLD VERSION” tag which indicates that new versions of these devices are coming. Intel 7th Gen (Kaby Lake) processors are built using 14-nanometer architecture and they offer improved graphics, native USB 3.1 support, improved 4k video support, and more. More importantly, 7th gen processors offer more battery life as well. I expect Surface Book Clipboard with Intel Kaby Lake processors to offer battery life of solid 3-4 hours. I think it will be a good move from Microsoft to release the updated Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 devices this year instead of waiting for the major upgrade which is expected in Q2 2017. Meanwhile, Amazon is also offering great discounts on these devices. You can now get Microsoft Surface Pro 4 (128 GB, 4 GB RAM, Intel Core i5) for just $719.

In what may signal the start of a revival of its data centre chip business, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has announced a collaboration with Alibaba which will see the cloud giant use AMD’s technology to help expand its cloud offering. Announced at the Alibaba Computing Conference, the two companies will work together to strengthen research and cooperation related to the use of AMD Radeon Pro GPU technology in Alibaba Cloud’s global data centres. Simon Hu, President, Alibaba Cloud Computing. “The partnership between AMD and Alibaba Cloud will bring both of our customers more diversified, cloud-based graphic processing solutions. It is our vision to work together with leading technology firms like AMD to empower businesses in every industry with cutting-edge technologies and computing capabilities,” said Simon Hu, president of Alibaba Cloud. The deal signals a golden opportunity for AMD to rival Intel in the lucrative data centre market. Graphics chips are emerging in the data centre space as an integral component, one which has the ability to process information in parallel. In recent times, the US chip maker has been overtaken by competitor Nvidia in the graphics chip segment, while also struggling to compete with Intel in general purpose processors.  However, the deal with Alibaba may continue the company’s upward sales trajectory and aid in its attempt to return to profitability. “The collaboration between AMD and Alibaba Cloud leverages the world-class technology and software engineering capabilities of both companies to meet the growing demand for standards-based GPU computing solutions capable of enabling more immersive and intuitive cloud services,” said AMD President and CEO Dr. Lisa Su. “Working closely with industry leaders like Alibaba Cloud helps ensure the investments AMD is making in our high-performance graphics and computing data centre products continue to align with the needs of the broader cloud market.” AMD is not the only company looking to take on Intel in the data centre space, with several of the largest tech companies in the world having come together to boost data centre server performance. The creation of a new standard, called Open Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface (OpenCAPI), has been undertaken by Google, Dell EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Micron Technologies, Mellanox Technologies, NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices, and Xilinx.

Yesterday the venerable Christian Science Monitor announced it was abandoning daily print publication. In Portfolio, Marc Andreessen proposes that other newspapers follow suit and finally give up on print: If you were running the New York Times, what would you do? Shut off the print edition right now. You’ve got to play offense. You’ve got to do what Intel did in ’85 when it was getting killed by the Japanese in memory chips, which was its dominant business. And it famously killed the business — shut it off and focused on its much smaller business, microprocessors, because that was going to be the market of the future. And the minute Intel got out of playing defense and into playing offense, its future was secure. The newspaper companies have to do exactly the same thing. The financial markets have discounted forward to the terminal conclusion for newspapers, which is basically bankruptcy. So at this point, if you’re one of these major newspapers and you shut off the printing press, your stock price would probably go up, despite the fact that you would lose 90 percent of your revenue. Then you play offense. And guess what? You’re an internet company. The Intel reference here is an oblique reference to Andy Grove’s famous comment to the ASNE that the newspaper industry had three years to adapt or die. That was in 1999. Andreessen’s advice makes total sense in many ways — it would be fascinating and worthwhile for at least one major newspaper publisher to try it. This sort of turn-your-company-on-a-dime idea is part of the Silicon Valley ethos. But I just don’t see it happening. Hard though it no doubt was, it’s still a lot easier for a hardware company like Intel to retool its fabs and its engineers to produce a different kind of chip than for a newspaper company to retool its reporters and editors to produce a different kind of media product. Shutting off the presses at the New York Times, or any other major newspaper publisher, would make the company an “internet-only company.” But it wouldn’t make it an Internet Company, in the larger sense. You’d still have a newsroom full of people used to doing things a certain way, proud, with good reason, of that way, and suspicious of change. It’s much easier to build a new company from scratch than to transform an existing one into something new. But the bigger problem isn’t psychological, it’s financial. I base my views on a decade of experience at Salon, trying to support an online-only newsroom with online-only revenues. It turns out that the hardest part of this massive and inevitable industrial transition is not reconstituting high-quality journalism in a new media environment. That’s only mildly hard. Top-notch journalists will always seek to do top-notch work. The really tough part — the part that to this day remains unsolved — is figuring out how to support those top-notch journalists with the salaries and benefits they are accustomed to, and often deserve. (That’s not even taking into account the loss of jobs on the printing and distribution side. But they are disappearing eventually no matter what.) The problem today is not much easier than it was when we started Salon in 1995: Look at Politico — an online success d’estime that still earns 90 percent of its revenue from a niche print product. Newspaper companies are clinging to their dwindling print profits because they can’t yet see a way to keep anything close to their current pay scale and benefits in an online-only world. And the hardest pill for the industry to swallow is that there may not be any way to do that. Internet companies pay top dollar to their engineers, not their “content producers.” There is no shortage of reasonably high quality content on the Web, much of it produced for free or little pay. Of course blogs and “user generated content” can’t replace the collective output of the nation’s journalism professionals today. But they offer plenty of alternatives, and enough occasions on which they surpass the pros (or expose the pros’ failings) to keep readers occupied, and sometimes satisfied. As Bruce Reed wrote in Slate last year during the Hollywood writer’s strike, “There is no such thing as a writer’s market. With or without subsidy, words are always in surplus, and it’s always a reader’s market.” No amount of handwringing will change that. If newspapers are really going to take the leap Andreessen proposes, they will have to do it while simultaneously restructuring their deals with their employees and mandating painful cuts that nobody wants to accept. Which is why I don’t think they will do it at all. Ironically, of course, those jobs will vanish anyway. As I wrote in June, I think the newspaper-company ships are doomed to sink, and individual journalists will have to find their own individual lifeboats and routes to shore. The sooner they start, the better. ELSEWHERE: Mark Potts thinks “Newspapers haven’t even scratched the surface on potential online advertising revenue” and an exclusively online operation could rake in more money. I don’t know; I’ve been there, done that, and it’s not so easy. Alan Mutter says the magic multiple is 3 — newspapers would have to triple their current online revenue to break even.

Comments Rangachari Anand October 29, 2008 at 12:15 pm I think newspapers will have to move to the NPR model and become non-profit organizations supported by donations. turph October 29, 2008 at 12:31 pm I agree that newspapers have not scratched the surface of advertising yet either. We went through a brief period where content was king, but now good content with blended attributes is king. Google is printing money serving out loosely targeted ads based on very unstructured content. CTR is ridiculously low when ads are populated next to this unstructured content. What leverage/value could publishers gain by “adding value” to their content? Adding contextual relevance to content would only increase CTR, creating premium content, demanding higher CPC which the publisher should be charging for… Cléo Saulnier October 29, 2008 at 3:33 pm Fantastic post. Scott, I’m curious what you think the effect is of the current trend of the medium itself having no value. In the past, if you wanted information, you had to pay for the medium no matter what was on it. We’re seeing the music and the film industry fight with this issue right now in what they call piracy. Now, there isn’t as much alternative content in music and film as there is for printed materials, but do you see a crossover symptom with the lowered costs of the medium itself? Andrew Brown October 30, 2008 at 3:28 am As someone who has just started a newspaper subsite, which pays contributors insultingly little, I have a lot of sympathy with this argument but I can’t believe it represents the only future. Newspapers which deliver news that people need to make decisions from — eg the Financial Times — will continue to be profitable, I think, and to be able to charge. In the meantime, what papers need to do is to put huge resources into comment moderation. Because, while comments are free, the toxic ones are fantastically expensive in terms of opportunities foregone, and fastidious or even literate readers driven away. ON a purely self-interested argument the papers are pissing away the kind of readers to whom advertisers might be attracted. Geoff Dougherty October 30, 2008 at 12:38 pm We get a 10% CTR on ads that are geotargeted to appear alongside news that happens near our advertisers’ stores. It took us a day to write the code to make this work, and we sell the ads for well over the standard $10 cpm. Clearly there are unexplored strategies out there that could make online more lucrative. There’s also thousands of newspapers out there that still publish “websites” consisting of jpegs of their print pages. The issue isn’t lack of options, it’s lack of a clue. J. Todd Foster October 30, 2008 at 1:16 pm Not all newspapers will be dying such quick deaths. Community papers will be around for decades because most of our readers prefer ink on paper, not computer screens. And most of the advertising dollars out there are national ads, not local ones in small markets where much of the population is not wired. Scott Rosenberg October 30, 2008 at 1:21 pm But will “most of your readers” prefer ink “for decades”? Really? Even as the grandparents pass away and the kids weaned on the Web and iPhones grow up? I don’t know. Here in the Bay Area the community papers are already in trouble; this is an early-adopter kind of community, but it seems to me that the rest of the nation isn’t likely to be too far behind… sophie jensen October 30, 2008 at 1:39 pm Andrew Brown: what you said! Those toxic comments do drive away readers. Of course we know we can not read them but they have a hypnotic effect and once in a while there’s a gem like yours. Without moderation many sites will become Idiocracy attracting only the sub-literate– probably not what advertisers want. Walter Abbott October 30, 2008 at 2:03 pm Newspapers never were producers of a product. ‘News’ isn’t a product, it’s merely distributed information and newspapers are just one of the distribution systems. The worth to advertisers was the monopoly that newspapers had on distribution via a durable media. Newspaper could always tell advertisers that unlike electronic broadcast distribution, paper ads were semi-permanent. That’s gone now. The internet is a technologically superior method of information distribution and can more efficiently deliver advertising to potential customers. There’s nothing anyone can do. It’s progress. Newsmaven October 30, 2008 at 2:37 pm It’s true there are a lot of community papers out there that have some life left in them. They’re making money while most of top metro papers are not. The Monitor is stopping its print edition, but will keep some kind of weekly magazine. Politico, as pointed out, stays afloat via their print side. The Times, if they put a yardstick to it (which they surely do), probably loses money on most weekdays and rakes in cash on Sundays. This points to a transitional model that’s a digital/print hybrid which could take many forms in different places. To do this, however, newspapers first have to turn their heads around and decide, finally, that they are digital businesses, focused on publishing online content and creating online communities, 24/7. No US newspaper organization, including the Times, has truly done this—they continue to be organized around that evening deadline for the print product, and everything else is secondary. And their reporters and salespeople continue to carry business cards with the prominent name and logo of the printed paper, not that of their web site. Andreessen’s solution is radical, and he probably knows it’s not going to happen, not right now. But the Times and all other daily newspapers could, and should, consider the radical-enough solution of going digital by dropping everything except a profitable, ad- and feature-laden Sunday package (and probably switching that to Saturday publication). Cutting out six mostly break-even distribution days a week would be a lot smarter than cutting out 40 percent of their news staffs. Scott Rosenberg October 30, 2008 at 2:46 pm I’m with you on most of that. I just doubt newspapers will make these hard choices until it’s much too late. Too much pride, too much head-in-the-sand thinking, too much unwillingness to give up on an outmoded but still partially lucrative business model, too much confusion between the “product” (paper goods) and the service-that’s-valued (providing news and information). In other words — yes, they’d have to “turn their heads around” and no, I don’t think they will. tjm October 30, 2008 at 4:40 pm Russ Stanton, the latest LAT editor, said in a radio interview early this year that the LAT web revenue was at or near the break even point of editorial costs, meaning that assuming continued modest growth since, it could support the newsroom right now. The problem many newspapers have been having is not that the web isn’t profitable, it’s that it isn’t profitable enough to sustain their owners at the levels to which they had become accustomed. Or, as in the case of the LAT and Tribune, not profitable enough to support Sam Zell’s debt. The great irony is that the traditional newsprint product, over the decline of which so much angst is being spent, is still a cash-flow powerhouse. People won’t get rid of it because it’s too profitable. If I owned a newspaper, I’d get rid of the trucks and the trees tomorrow, give every subscriber a custom Kindle or netbook-type device, in-home training in how to use it and make myself into a media, database and internet-training company. I would consider partnerships to build out civic WiFi infrastructure and paper (sic) the circulation area with video readerboards of the newspaper’s content. Trackbacks Certamente!

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 14 October 2016 | MYT 1:46 PM IBM, Google, others to unveil new open interface to take on Intel Opting out: Intel is known to protect its server technologies and has chosen to sit out of the new consortium. — Reuters Technology giants IBM Corp, Google and seven others have joined hands to launch an open specification that can boost datacentre server performance by up to ten times, to take on Intel Corp.  The new standard, called Open Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface (OpenCAPI), is an open forum to provide a high bandwidth, low latency open interface design specification.  The open interface will help corporate and cloud datacentres to speed up big data, machine learning, analytics and other emerging workloads.  The consortium plans to make the OpenCAPI specification available to the public before the end of the year and expects servers and related products based on the new standard in the second half of 2017, it said in a statement.  Intel, the world's largest chipmaker, is known to protect its server technologies and has chosen to sit out of the new consortium. In the past also, it had stayed away from prominent open standards technology groups such as CCIX and Gen-Z.  "As artificial intelligence, machine learning and advanced analytics become the price of doing business in today's digital era, huge volumes of data are now the norm," Doug Balog, general manager for IBM Power, told Reuters.  "It's clear that today's datacentres can no longer rely on one company alone to drive innovation," Balog said.  Advanced Micro Devices Inc, Dell EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co, Mellanox Technologies Ltd, Micron Technology Inc, NVIDIA Corp and Xilinx Inc are also members of the the OpenCAPI consortium. — Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Corporate News , Investing , Technology You May Be Interested Closure of 106 bank branches due to rationalisation plans, says Deputy Finance Minister Weak ringgit to impact 5 sectors Best smartphones for the holidays Alibaba's founder to support 'mini Jack Ma' until university graduation Private-public partnerships in a connected world Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Hunting big game at sea Tourists now prefer lodgings with Airbnb flavour, hoteliers told MRT fare starts at RM1 advertisement Latest News Photo Kit: Taking better photos of your pets (and kids) Make perfect copies of old photos with PhotoScan Taliworks net profit jumps 80% SME contribution to GDP to grow 5%-5.5% this year US trade panel eyes Qualcomm patent complaint against Chinese firms Most Viewed in Tech GE acquires two artificial intelligence startups Best smartphones for the holidays Singapore to launch blockchain project for interbank payments Photo Kit: Taking better photos of your pets (and kids) Google commits to post-Brexit UK with major London investment Warning!

This is why it isn’t surprising to see that Intel has actually branched out into drones, and we’re not talking about reference designs or chipsets for drones, but an actual Intel-branded drone called the Falcon 8+. This is actually not Intel’s first foray into the drone scene as previously the company had partnered with Ascending Technologies, but this is the first time Intel has actually made a drone of its own. Unlike drones made by other companies such as Parrot DJI, Intel’s Falcon 8+ isn’t really a drone for hobbyists, but rather it is a drone made for industrial work. For example it can be used on construction jobs where the Falcon 8+ can fly around the site to survey things and also for inspection purposes, an activity that might otherwise take humans a couple of hours to complete. It also features a waterproof cockpit so pilots don’t have to worry about it getting damaged. The Falcon 8+ weighs 6 pounds and is capable of reaching speeds of up to 35 mph, a lot faster than most hobbyist drones out there in the market today. No word on availability or how much it will cost, but we don’t expect that it will come cheap. Filed in Robots. Read more about drones and Intel.

Read more about the stories in today's news: HP Closes In on Lenovo in a Consolidating Global PC Market Intel Launches Its First Branded Drone Google Acquires FameBit to Boost Branded Video Content on YouTube Amazon Unveils Amazon Music Unlimited Streaming Service       Today's topics include the increasingly competitive global PC market and how it is driving top vendors, the launch of Intel's first branded drone, Google's acquisition of FameBit in an effort to enable better branded video content on YouTube and the unveiling of Amazon Music's unlimited streaming service. Lenovo and HP Inc. continue to vie for the top spot in a still-slowing global PC market that is consolidating around a handful of top vendors. Third-quarter numbers released this week by market research firms IDC and Gartner showed that HP is inching closer to market leader Lenovo, with less than a percentage point separating them in the number of systems shipped. "There are two fundamental issues that have impacted PC market results: the extension of the lifetime of the PC caused by the excess of consumer devices, and weak PC consumer demand in emerging markets," Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner, said in a statement. "According to our 2016 personal technology survey, the majority of consumers own, and use, at least three different types of devices in mature markets. Among these devices, the PC is not a high priority device for the majority of consumers, so they do not feel the need to upgrade their PCs as often as they used to. Some may never decide to upgrade to a PC again." Intel officials have cited drones as an important growth market for the chip maker, and the company has been aggressive in getting its technologies--including silicon and software--into devices from other companies. Now Intel is rolling out a drone of its own, with the company's name not only on components inside the unmanned aerial vehicle, but also on the outside. At the InterGeo 2016 show this week, Intel officials unveiled the Falcon 8+, the company's first branded drone. It builds off the work done on the Falcon 8, a commercial drone developed by Ascending Technologies. The octocopter is designed for industrial and commercial work, including inspection, surveying and mapping, and comes with a broad range of capabilities and a sophisticated control unit. Google has acquired marketing firm FameBit in a move the company says will make it easier for brands to work with YouTube creators in pitching products through sponsorships and paid promotions. The acquisition will increase the number of branded content opportunities that are available on YouTube in the form of product placements, sponsorships and promotions. And it will bring in more revenue for content creators on the video-sharing platform, Ariel Bardin, Google's vice president of product management, said in announcing the deal on Google's YouTube blog. Amazon is boosting its streaming music subscription offerings with a new Amazon Music Unlimited service that will provide customers with tens of millions of songs to choose from, an increase from the 2 million songs currently available for free to Amazon Prime customers. The paid service is priced at $7.99 a month or $79.99 a year for Prime members, or $9.99 a month for non-Prime customers, for one account for all of a user's devices. The company is also offering a $3.99 monthly subscription for Amazon Echo users to get music on one Echo, Echo Dot or Amazon Tap device. Echo subscribers who want to expand their service to their other devices can upgrade to a standard plan later at the rates for those plans.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

We weren’t big fans of the original HP Spectre x360, for example. It annoyed us with a mediocre keyboard and surprisingly hefty design that made 2-in-1 use cumbersome. But times – and companies – change. HP has made serious strides over the last year with new, cutting-edge products like the HP Spectre laptop, which was the world’s thinnest when it launched, and an updated Spectre x360 with an OLED display option. Now, HP has completely redesigned the x360. Though the Spectre x360 looks rather like its predecessor at a glance, it features the latest 7th-generation Intel Core processors. Pricing starts at $1,049 for a Core i5, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB solid state drive. Our review unit, with a Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD, costs just $1,299. The most expensive version has all that and a 1TB SSD, for $1,499. Does the new design address our concerns, and work its way into our hearts? Thinner, lighter, better The engineers at HP were apparently fans of the old Spectre x360’s design because, despite the fact the Spectre x360 is entirely new, it looks very much like its predecessor. The similarities begin with the matte silver metal unibody, and extend to the cooling vent, the rounded rear edge, the dual chrome display hinges, and the shape of the power button. A blindfolded owner of the previous model might have a hard time telling the two apart. Size is the only trait that might give away the new Spectre x360. The update has slimmer display bezels and a thinner chassis that’s barely more than half an inch thick. Though it doesn’t feel as svelte as HP’s Spectre laptop, or Acer’s Spin 7 2-in-1, it’s no great burden. Weight comes in at 2.85 pounds, down a half-pound from the outgoing x360. That’s less than Apple’s new MacBook Pro 13, and about equal to Dell’s XPS 13. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Reducing the footprint makes the Spectre x360 easier to use as a tablet, but like most systems of its size, it’s not the best experience. The device is simply too heavy and too thick to hold aloft for long periods of time. Unfortunately, the design exacerbates the problem, as the lower half is tapered in a way that places large gaps along the sides of the 2-in-1 when it’s held as a tablet. Overall, the Spectre x360 is still more likely to be used with the keyboard as a stand, for desktop touchscreen use, or some easy in-flight entertainment. Related: HP Envy Spectre x360 review Thinning the chassis does help the x360 as a laptop, however. Dell’s XPS 13 set a new standard for how small a 13-inch laptop can be, and everyone else has been forced to catch up. The HP Spectre x360, for the most part, does – though its top bezel is much thicker than the Dell XPS 13, and the system’s overall footprint is larger. While that’s a downside, it does have a benefit. Unlike the XPS 13, which awkwardly locates its webcam below the display, the HP Spectre x360 puts it up top, where it should be. USB Type-C, but old-fashioned USB is here too The HP Spectre x360 has a modern array of ports. That means two USB 3.1 Type-C ports, which also support charging and Thunderbolt 3. Legacy peripherals aren’t out in the cold, however, because there’s one USB 3.1 Type-A port. There’s also a headphone jack. That’s it – sorry, no card reader. A good keyboard, a great touchpad The HP Spectre x360 is thin, but it’s not as absurdly thin as HP’s Spectre, Asus’ Zenbook 3, or Apple’s MacBook. You’ll notice it the first time you pick the laptop up, and you’ll notice it again when you begin typing. The x360’s Handbrake score is the best we’ve yet seen from a dual-core laptop. Key travel, size, and responsiveness all feel much as you’d expect from a quality Windows laptops of any size – and that’s good news. Touch typists can easily pick up this laptop and hammer away with no need for adjustment. A keyboard backlight is included, and while it doesn’t illuminate as evenly as we’d like, it does its job. Some recent ultra-thin systems, like Acer’s Swift and Spin 7, have ditched the backlight because it’s difficult to fit LEDs behind keys without compromising key travel. The touchpad is ultra-wide, measuring almost five inches across, and a bit more than two inches deep. That’s becoming a trend, as Acer’s Swift 7 also includes a wide touchpad, and the new MacBook Pro has one that takes up about a third of the entire space below the keyboard. We think it’s a wonderful addition. Extra space means lower sensitivity, as users can easily span the entire display in one swipe. And it helps provide room for multi-touch gestures, a feature that is robust in Windows 10. Seriously, give it a try. As with the Acer Swift 7, the Spectre x360 had no issue with unanticipated mouse input, a sign that the touchpad’s palm rejection is doing its job. Integrated physical click buttons are included, and the click action is good, with decent travel and a solid tactile thunk. But the large touchpad surface and lack of visible differentiation between left and right click makes it clear this laptop is meant to be used with tap-to-click enabled. Clicking the touchpad surface is clumsy, and gets old after a while. HP Spectre x360 13-w023dx Compared To Dell Inspiron 17 7000 2-in-1 (2016) Acer Switch Alpha 12 Dell Inspiron 13 7000 2-in-1 (2016) Huawei Matebook Vaio Z Flip Dell Inspiron 11 (2015) Dell Inspiron 13 7000 Special… HP Envy Spectre 360x - 13-4003dx Asus Transformer Book T300 Chi Toshiba Satellite Click 2 Pro Lenovo Yoga 2 (13-inch) HP Spectre 13t x2 HP EliteBook Revolve Acer Aspire P3 Lenovo ThinkPad Edge Twist Don’t count 1080p out Our review unit came with a 1080p IPS touchscreen, the only display available on the Spectre x360 right now. That’s a bit of a disappointment. The previous model was available in a variety of configurations including a 3,200 x 1,800 IPS display IPS display, or even an OLED panel. We won’t knock the x360 too hard for stepping back to 1080p, however, as many competitors have done the same. Most content remains available at only 1080p, and increasing display resolution typically increases power draw, which can hurt battery life. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends And the panel on the Spectre x360 performs well. In our testing, it delivered a solid contrast ratio of 910:1. That’s on par with the Asus Zenbook 3, which hit 860:1. It’s also better than the Acer Switch Alpha 12, the Samsung Notebook 7 Spin, the Huawei Matebook, and the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga with IPS display. Color gamut came in where we’d expect, at 99 percent of sRGB, and 75 percent of AdobeRGB. That’s right in line with most competitors, though the Samsung Notebook 7 Spin underperforms there, reaching just 50 percent of AdobeRGB. Color accuracy proved a highlight, as we recorded an average error of only 1.44. An error of one is considered noticeable by the human eye, so this is a solid score. Acer’s Swift 7 did better with its error of 1.19 (lower is better in this test), but most comparable systems we’ve recently tested fall behind, scoring an error somewhere between two and three. We measured a maximum brightness of 355 lux. That’s average for the category, and in practice, it felt a bit too dim. The Spectre x360’s panel is extremely glossy, and in certain situations, the backlight can’t keep it from looking mirror-like. But this too is par for the course with 2-in-1 laptops, since non-gloss touchscreens are extremely rare. In day-to-day use, the display looked as good as the numbers suggest. High-quality 1080p content was crisp, clear, and realistic. Colors were not overblown, but remained vibrant enough to create a sense of depth that adds to immersion. The glossy display is a bummer if you’re watching a dark scene in a brightly lit room, but that’s our only serious complaint. This is about the best you can expect from a laptop without an OLED panel – which is still a rare, and expensive, option. Four speakers, with modest performance HP boasted about the Spectre x360’s speakers in its press briefing. The system now has four of them: two near the display, and two near the forward edge of the laptop. This creates even sound that doesn’t suffer much if the laptop is placed on a surface that absorbs sound, a problem that often plagues thin laptops with forward-facing speakers. Related: Better battery life, 4K love, and more of the perks to Intel’s next Core chips The audio is clear, and crisp, and reasonably loud at full volume, though it doesn’t blow away other laptops we’ve tested. Asus’ Zenbook 3 offers at least equivalent, if not superior, sound in a smaller package. The HP Spectre x360 does beat the Acer Swift 7, however, as well as 2-in-1s we’ve tested recently, such as the Acer Switch Alpha 12 and Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga. Processor performance Many HP Spectre x360 configurations are available. We received one of the most expensive variants, which has a Core i7-7500U processor backed by 16GB of RAM. It’s a powerful configuration, which immediately proved itself in our benchmarks. Unsurprisingly, the Spectre x360 goes toe-to-toe with the other 7th-gen Core i7 system we’ve tested, Asus’ Zenbook 3 – but the HP ultimately gets the better end of the deal. This is evident in Handbrake, where the Spectre x360 cranks through our 4K trailer encode test in 18 minutes, 15 seconds. That’s almost four minutes faster than the Asus Zenbook 3, and much quicker than the Acer Swift 7. In fact, the x360’s Handbrake score is the best we’ve yet seen from a dual-core laptop. That’s excellent, not only because of the x360’s great scores, but also because of its price. At $1,299, our review unit significantly undercuts most of its peers. The Asus Zenbook 3 is $1,599, and while you can build an XPS 13 with the same processor for this price, it’ll have half the RAM and half the hard drive space. Plus, neither of those systems are a 2-in-1. Hard drive performance HP didn’t skimp on the hard drive, either. Our review unit came with a 512GB solid state drive. Importantly, it was a PCI Express drive that connects over the Non-Volatile Storage Express specification, two requirements for maximum performance. Every Spectre x360 model includes these features, no matter its price, or the size of the drive. This had an obvious impact in our hard drive test, where the HP Spectre x360’s results were in line with the blazing fast HP Spectre laptop, and in league with the Asus Zenbook 3. The Acer Switch Alpha 12 and Samsung Notebook 7 Spin, meanwhile, provide examples of how a SATA-based solid state drive performs. Both are about half as quick as the x360. The Switch Alpha 12, for example, hits a transfer speed of 489 megabytes per second in the write test, while the Spectre x360 hits 1,202Mbps. Graphics performance Gaming and 2-in-1 rarely go together, and the Spectre x360 does nothing to change that. It relies on Intel HD Graphics 620, a mid-range integrated solution that we’ve tested many times before. With that said, performance can vary depending on a laptop’s design. So, how does the x360 stack up? The Spectre x360’s score of 794 was about the same as the HP Spectre 13, a bit behind the Acer Switch Alpha 12, and better than the Asus Zenbook 3. It’s quite far behind the Samsung Notebook 7 Spin, though, because that has a secret weapon – it’s the only 2-in-1 laptop we’ve ever tested with discrete graphics, in that case, Nvidia’s GeForce 940MX. Don’t take this to mean the x360 can game, though. Even at minimum settings, Civilization VI struggled to maintain an average of 30 frames per second at 1080p resolution. You’ll be able to run older or less demanding titles, like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, but most new games won’t run well. All-day endurance The HP Spectre x360 is .54 inches thick, and weighs 2.85 pounds. The Acer Spin 7 is substantially slimmer at .43 inches thick, and it weighs about 2.6 pounds. But most alternatives are larger. Lenovo’s Yoga 910 is equally thick and weighs a hair over three pounds. The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga is similar. Dell’s Inspiron 13 7000 2-in-1 is .76 inches thick, and weighs in at a hefty 3.86 pounds. In other words, the x360 is small. It’s not a feather-weight like the Acer Spin 7, but it feels petite in-hand, and is easy to forget once you’ve placed it in a backpack or messenger bag. It’s hard to find a lighter machine without dropping down to a 12-inch display. The battery gets results, lasting over nine hours in real-world use. Every version of the new Spectre x360 comes with a 3-cell, 57.8 watt-hour battery. Lenovo’s Yoga 910 has it beat with its 79 watt-hour unit, but you’ll find little else that exceeds the x360, and Lenovo’s laptop is a bit larger, anyway. The battery gets results. We measured four hours and 54 minutes of run time in the Peacekeeper web browsing benchmark loop. That extended to an incredible nine hours and 18 minutes in our “real world” web browsing loop, which loads actual websites and pauses for idle time between each load. These figures are about in line with Dell’s XPS 13 with 7th-generation Core processor. That makes sense, as the Dell has a just slightly larger battery, and otherwise similar hardware. The x360 easily beat the Asus Zenbook 3, which lasted six hours and 51 minutes in our real-world browsing loop. Other 2-in-1s, like the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga with OLED display and Samsung Notebook 7 Spin, are hours behind. Related: After years of stumbling, 2-in-1 laptops will finally find their stride in 2016 These numbers are nowhere near HP’s sky-high battery life claim of 14 hours and 15 minutes. Companies have gone to town with their figures lately, basing them off extremely low-demand tests that stretch the most seconds out of every watt. Even so, the Spectre x360 is clearly among the best 2-in-1s for mobile use. It packs all-day battery life in a chassis that’s among the thinnest around. Keeping your cool Though it’s thin, the x360 isn’t pushing the limits of design like the Asus Zenbook 3 or Acer Swift 7. That reaps benefits in the laptop’s thermal performance. In normal use, it barely feels warmer than room temperature. Benchmarking heats the system up, but it never becomes uncomfortable. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends The fan doesn’t work that hard, either. Though not silent at idle, most users will need to make a point of trying to hear it, unless you find yourself in a sound-proof chamber. The fan is noticeable at full load, but its whirr is no louder than with other 13-inch systems that lack discrete graphics. 1-year warranty, as usual HP ships the Spectre x360 with its usual one-year limited hardware warranty, which exists to protect against defects. It’s always disappointing to see a $1,300 device come with only a single year of coverage, but that’s unfortunately standard in the PC industry. Our take Is there a better alternative? HP’s Spectre x360 will be different things to different people. Some will see it primarily as a 2-in-1, a device that spans the laptop and tablet markets. For them, the x360 has few worthy competitors. The Lenovo Yoga 910 is worth a look if you’d like something with a 4K display option, and the Acer Spin 7 is even lighter. We like HP’s balance of performance, weight, and affordability. Even when judged only as a laptop, the x360 is very good. It’s not quite as nice as the Dell XPS 13, but it’s close. And HP delivers more RAM and solid state storage at most price points. How long will it last? The DT Accessory Pack Logitech MX Anywhere 2 wireless mobile mouse $58 Snugg PU leather laptop shoulder bag $70 Tronsmart USB C power bank $27 With all-metal construction, and cutting-edge hardware, the Spectre x360 is as future-proof as any laptop can hope to be. It doesn’t lag behind the competition in any area, and while it includes two USB Type-C ports for forward-looking connectivity, it also has a standard USB Type-A port for your existing devices. Should you buy it? Yes. The HP Spectre x360 can come off as a bit drab compared to an Acer Spin 7, Asus Zenbook, or Dell XPS 13. Those competitors all do at least one thing better than the x360. But a jack-of-all-trades can make for a great PC, because most people need a PC to do many things, and the x360 does almost everything well. It’s fast, it’s light, it lasts all day on a charge, the keyboard is good, the touchpad is huge, and the high-quality touchscreen folds back for tablet use. There’s just one thing you can’t do – play modern games. But none of its competitors do that, either. The base MSRP of $1,049 is by no means affordable, and our test unit’s MSRP of $1,299 is a lot of money. Yet the prices are justified by the hardware. Buying this HP will net you more RAM and storage than you’d manage by spending the same elsewhere. There’s a lot to like about the Spectre x360. If you’re looking for a flagship 2-in-1 that makes no compromises, you’ve found it.

The notebooks resemble their predecessors featuring Skylake CPUs, but naturally offer all the advantages that Intel’s latest chips have, including higher performance and better energy efficiency. Other notable enhancements over the predecessors are a new battery and a USB Type-C port. In addition, HP reduced the starting price of the ENVY 13 to $849, down from $899 in case of the previous-gen model. The HP ENVY 13 2016 uses exactly the same chassis as its predecessor released a few years ago. The PCs feature lifted hinge design to enable more comfortable typing (says HP, others may disagree) and are made of machined aluminum and magnesium. As for weight and dimensions, they are up to 12.95 mm thick and they weigh up to 1.49 kilograms (3.3 lb) depending on the actual configuration. Display panels of the ENVY also remained the same: HP offers a choice between a QHD+ (3200×1800) IPS panel (with or without touch support) and an FHD (1920×1080) IPS panel. Internally, the HP ENVY 13 also resembles its ancestor with 8 GB of DRAM (optionally upgradeable to 16 GB), 128 GB SATA AHCI or 256 GB/512 GB/1 TB PCIe NVMe SSDs. The new HP ENVY 13 is also equipped with a 802.11ac 2×2 Wi-Fi + BT 4.1 controller, a backlit keyboard, a webcam and so on. Among external ports, the ENVY 13 offers one USB 3.0 Type-C, two USB 3.0 Type-A, an HDMI output, a TRRS connector as well as a microSD card reader. The key improvement of HP’s ENVY 13 over previous-gen model is its processor: the manufacturer offers to install either the Intel Core i7-7500U or the Intel Core i5-7200U with Intel’s HD Graphics 620. The new CPUs feature higher frequencies, considerably improved video encoding/decoding engine, refined graphics as well as Speed Shift v2 technology, which should make the new ENVY 13 snappier and more responsive in general. It is also noteworthy that HP uses hyperbaric chamber cooling for its premium notebooks (ENVY 13, Spectre, etc.), so, everything should run more or less cool and quiet. Yet another improvement of this year’s ENVY 13 is the new 57.8 Wh battery, up from 45 Wh on the previous-gen models. The higher battery capacity along with improved energy efficiency of Intel’s new CPUs will naturally prolong battery life of the new ENVY 13 laptops: HP claims about up to 14 hours, but everything depends on actual configuration and usage model (a notebook with a QHD+ display will not last that long). Finally, HP decided to lower the price of the entry level ENVY 13 (Core i5-7200U, 8 GB of RAM, 128 GB SSD, an FHD panel, etc.) to $849, down from $899. The machines with higher performance and better displays will naturally retail at higher price points, when they hit the market in the coming weeks. Source: HP via Lilliputing.

I realize 15" is a little different, but come on. Reply repoman27 - Thursday, October 13, 2016 - link I'm confused as to what you're looking for here. Apple has had a 13" laptop with a 2560x1600 screen for 4 years now (granted that's almost 30% less pixels, but it is a preferable aspect ratio and comes standard even on the base model). Of course they won't be shipping a Kaby Lake version until the GT3 parts are available since Apple generally doesn't do GT2. However, Intel paper launched Skylake-U 2+3 in Q3'15, despite them not shipping until Q1'16, and as far as I can tell have only been available in the Vaio Z and Vaio Z Flip since then. Furthermore, Intel's roadmap from nearly a year ago showed Kaby Lake-U 4+4 as TBD, and 2+3 as week 6-18 2017, so I wouldn't exactly be holding my breath for a Kaby Lake MacBook Pro release this month. Although the Envy 13 is definitely thinner, it only weighs a hair less than the 13-inch MBP, which is crazy because the MBP packs a 74.9 Wh battery vs the Envy's 57.8.

Reply MrSpadge - Thursday, October 13, 2016 - link I suspect this poor notebook envies the display of the XPS 13. Reply nikon133 - Thursday, October 20, 2016 - link I love XPS screens (especially bezels)... but I don't like soft touch material they use for palm rest. Whenever I see XPS in the shop, they look quite greasy and "mushy"... material seems to be very fingerprint-friendly. When I look at XPS in computer shop, it always look more worn than surrounding full-metal machines, because of that finish. It is all mater of taste, but personally, I don't like it much. The other thing that, in general, worry me about these soft-touch, rubbery finishes... I've seen a few of them getting all shiny and "polished" from everyday use, and occasionally start peeling off. I'm not talking about XPS but about this type of finish. Perhaps Dell has used really quality solution that will stand test of time (and abuse) better?

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 13, 2016 at 2:00PM Image source: Intel.  There is little denying that microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been and will continue to be highly dependent on the declining personal computer market. There's little that the company can do at this point to stimulate customer demand for personal computers, but what it can do is try to leverage its core technologies and competencies to open up new revenue streams. The most successful of these efforts by a large margin has been the company's work to develop processors and related hardware and software components for data center applications. Intel's data center group, or DCG, is an important part of the company's business today and is only going to become more important going forward. In light of this, here are three key facts that current and potential Intel investors should know about this essential Intel business unit. It's a large part of revenue, and growing In 2015, Intel's data center group pulled in about $16 billion in revenue, good for around 29% of the company's total revenue in that year. For the current year, Intel's most recent guidance calls for DCG to deliver revenue growth in the low double digits.  Intel seems confident that it can keep growing DCG at over 10% for a while, whereas its goal with its client computing group, or CCG, seems to be to try to simply keep its revenue from declining (CCG is mainly tied to a declining personal computer market). Since DCG revenue is likely to dramatically outgrow CCG revenue for quite some time, it's only reasonable to expect this segment to continue to grow as a percentage of Intel's total revenue. It's ridiculously profitable In 2015, Intel's DCG reported operating profit of $7.8 billion on revenue of $16 billion, meaning that operating margin came in at 49%. These high margins are the result of a couple of factors. First, the products that DCG develops and sells leverage a lot of the technologies that Intel already builds to support its personal computer business -- a point that former Intel CFO Stacy Smith made back at the company's 2014 investor meeting. Intel's PC and server chips have a lot in common. Image source: Intel. In a nutshell, this means that because of the work that Intel does to build its high-volume personal computer products, its data center group needs to invest in building only the technologies and products specific to its business, rather than reinvent the wheel. That winds up saving Intel money and ultimately allows this segment to maximize the return on each incremental research and development dollar. Beyond that, though, Intel has an extremely strong competitive positioning in the server processor market. This has translated into both extremely high market-segment share (technology research company IDC estimates it at around 99.2% unit share) and robust pricing power. It wouldn't be surprising if Intel's DCG, today, delivered meaningfully better gross profit margins than CCG. It's worth noting that many companies have announced their intentions to go aggressively after Intel's share in this market; ARM, for example, believes that its partners will collectively capture 25% of the server market from Intel. Should these competitors field credible, competitive offerings (easier said than done), Intel risks some combination of margin compression and market-share loss. It's about more than just server processors Although the bulk of the company's DCG revenue today comes from the sale of server processors, Intel aims to significantly grow its sales of complementary components to its bread-and-butter server processor business. At the company's 2015 investor meeting, the general manager of DCG, Diane Bryant, talked about Intel's opportunities in silicon photonics, Omni-Path interconnect products, and nonvolatile memory modules using 3D XPoint memory technology, jointly developed by Intel and memory maker Micron. All told, Intel is calling for the CPU-related revenue in DCG to increase at a 12% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR), through 2019, while "non-CPU" will drive enough growth to allow the business as a whole to grow at a 15% CAGR in that time.

Confident in Battle Against Intel Corporation This small data center connectivity specialist believes that despite aggressive pricing from a powerful competitor, its core InfiniBand business should continue to thrive. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 13, 2016 at 11:00AM Image source: Mellanox.  Data center connectivity specialist Mellanox (NASDAQ: MLNX) is well known for its data center connectivity products that implement the InfiniBand standard. InfiniBand, the company says, "provides superior bandwidth and latency relative to other existing interconnect technologies and has maintained this advantage with each successive generation of products." InfiniBand is extremely important to Mellanox's business, comprising a whopping 52% of its revenues during the second quarter of 2016.  In the past, Mellanox used to compete with a company called QLogic in developing Infiniband-based products. Mellanox was the market leader, while QLogic was a clear second. However, QLogic sold its InfiniBand assets to microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) back in 2012. Intel didn't continue the development of InfiniBand-based products, however. Instead, Intel used those assets to define a proprietary interconnect technology that it dubs Omni-Path. Omni-Path is now, at long last, shipping. On Mellanox's second-quarter earnings call, management provided some insight into how the introduction of Omni-Path into the marketplace is affecting its InfiniBand business. Let's take a closer look. Intel is apparently way behind on performance, pricing aggressively Mellanox CEO Eyal Waldman told investors on the aforementioned earnings call that the company was "able to conduct several application level tests comparing costs between Mellanox's EDR InfiniBand solutions and Intel's Omni-Path offering." Waldman says that Mellanox's solutions delivered 45% better performance and 27% lower cost on average relative to Intel's Omni-Path offering. The executive further added that the performance deficit of Intel's Omni-Path relative to Mellanox's InfiniBand products "has led Intel to aggressively price Omni-Path in an attempt to gain market share." The impact to Mellanox's business During the call, analyst Harlan Sur asked Waldman about the potential impact that Intel's aggressive Omni-Path pricing could be having on Mellanox's InfiniBand "design win momentum." Waldman was blunt, replying that the company is "seeing some impact." The executive pointed to the fact that Intel's Omni-Path technology now powers eight of the TOP500 list of supercomputers. Additionally, Waldman said Mellanox is "seeing some price pressure in some locations." Waldman asserted that Mellanox doesn't "expect to lose significant market share" but conceded that "Intel is seeing some success where people say good enough [performance] is good enough for them." As far as the impact on margins goes, Waldman explained that in situations where a "small reduction in price" will allow it to keep business out of Intel's hands, the company will go for it. However, Waldman did say that Mellanox won't "go overboard with [its] pricing tactics" -- something that he indicated will allow the company to keep its gross profit margins in the low-70% range. When all is said and done, Waldman seems confident that despite the challenge posed by Intel, the company expects its InfiniBand business to grow, particularly as the performance characteristics of Mellanox's InfiniBand technology "will remain a key differentiation for [its] customers." The investment takeaway What we have here with Mellanox versus Intel is an interesting battle. Mellanox appears to have a significant technical edge over Intel when it comes to performance relative to Intel's solution. However, in the near term, Intel has the advantage of being able to undercut Mellanox, as Omni-Path is just one part of the full server platform that Intel can offer potential customers -- CPUs, flash storage drives, software, FPGAs, and so on. Further, Intel has indicated that it plans to integrate key Omni-Path fabric components into its future processors, which could potentially make it even easier for Intel to "throw it in" at a much lower upfront cost than going with Mellanox's standalone solutions. Mellanox's bet is clearly that the performance and power advantages of its solutions should, for many customers, lead to an overall total cost of ownership advantage relative to the more aggressively priced Omni-Path solutions from Intel. Given that both InfiniBand and Omni-Path are technologies that fundamentally target applications that demand very high levels of performance, I suspect that -- barring a dramatic improvement in the performance and power competitiveness of Intel's Omni-Path solutions compared with Mellanox's InfiniBand -- Mellanox's InfiniBand business will stay in good shape.

The new MSI Cubi 2 is built upon the same philosophy as its successor but brings several modern accoutrements such as Intel Kaby Lake-U processors, a USB3.1 Gen1 Type-C port, and 4K sensibilities. As you might expect, the MSI Cubi 2 Mini-PCs are ideal for many uses in homes and offices, or even for commercial projects. Like the Gigabyte Brix Kaby Lake update models we saw last week, MSI is offering a choice of 7th gen Intel Core i3 7100U / i5 7200U / i7 7500U processor in one of two compact form factors. The so-called 'SSD SKU' can fit 1x M.2 SSD and measures 115.2 x 112.2 x 32.6mm (390g), the slightly taller 'HDD SKU' can accommodate both an M.2 SSD and a 2.5-inch SATA HDD (or SSD) and measures 115.2 x 112.2 x 42.7mm (510g). Both MSI SKUs are a little smaller than the Gigabyte BRIX rivals, and it claims they are the smallest of their kind. Even opting for the 'SSD SKU' doesn't preclude the option to add a high capacity HDD at a later date, thanks to MSI's modular options of an HDD base expansion. MSI's design provides front access to a USB 3.1 Gen1 port, a USB Type-C port, headphone and microphone ports, a storage activity light, and the power/reset switch. The Cubi 2 facilitates 4K content consumption and, with its HDMI and DP ports, can support dual-monitor setups. You can mount the Cubi 2 on the back of a monitor or TV with its standard VESA mounting holes. Users should also benefit from a "quiet as a forest" system, as the Cubi 2 only emits 23.7dB of noise in operation, partly down to its two-ball Fan Heatsink design. The MSI Cubi 2 uses Intel's H110 chipset and users can install up to 32GB of DDR4 2133HMz RAM. The full list of I/O options is as follows: 3 x USB 3.1 Gen1, 1 x USB 3.1 Gen1 Type-C, 1 x mic in, 1 x headphone out, 1 x HDMI out, 1 x mini DP out, 1 x RJ45 (Realtek RTL8111H GigaLan 10/100/1000), 1 x DC jack. A 65W AC adaptor is supplied. MSI says that Windows 10 is the recommended OS for these barebones systems. MSI will be releasing the Cubi 2 in a choice of black and white chassis globally, very shortly.

The drone has been developed by Ascending Technologies, which was acquired by the company in January this year. The Falcon 8+ has been designed for commercial uses like inspection, surveying, and mapping. The drone is essentially a successor to AscTec Falcon 8 and has been developed keeping North American markets in mind. The drone can achieve speeds up to 35 miles per hour (56.3 kilometres per hour) and has a take-off weight of 2.8kg. The drone features a new Intel Cockpit, which is waterproof for use in harsh outdoor environments. "The Intel Cockpit integrates independent control and safety features with low latency digital video link. This supports payloads with up to 1080p resolutions for the best possible live view," Intel says on its website.Intel has shown its interest in machine vision throughout this year as the company acquired the machine-vision firm Movidius in September. Movidius was already working with companies such as Google, DJI, FLIR, and Lenovo to provide its vision technology to various electronic devices such as drones, security cameras, AR/VR headsets etc. Previously, the company announced Project Euclid, at its Intel Developers Forum in August, based on company's RealSense perceptual computing platform. Meant to help power machine vision, Joule was termed as a powerful developer kit that's essentially a tiny computer for devices that use cameras for vision, like robots or drones. It will be interesting to see how the company performs with its latest product as the competition is relatively less in the commercial sector for unmanned aerial vehicles.

HP upgrades the Envy 13 laptop with Kaby Lake, debuts the 4K Envy 27 display A few good improvements refresh the stylish product line. Ian Paul (PC World (US online)) on 12 October, 2016 15:01 0 - - - - print email HP's injected a little hot hardware into the stylish Envy 13 laptop and Envy 27 display announced Tuesday night. You'll find the latest CPU from Intel in the former, and in the latter, 4K resolution and support for AMD’s FreeSync technology. HP Envy 13-inch laptop Pricing on the new Envy will start at $850, and it’ll hit store shelves on October 26. Though many of its upgrades are incremental, the primary highlight is the dual-core 2.5GHz Intel Core i5-7200U 7th-generation Kaby Lake mobile processor, paired with Intel’s HD 620 integrated graphics, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD. For ports, the Envy 13 comes with one USB 3.1 Type-C port, two USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports (which basically means they’re standard USB 3.0), and HDMI. The laptop leans on 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2 for wireless connectivity. The other highlight: HP says the new Envy 13 boasts a 14-hour battery life. A fast-charging features boosts said battery from depleted to 90 percent in about 90 minutes. The story behind the story: On paper, the upcoming HP Envy 13-ab016nr is evolutionary rather than evolutionary, packing hardware that’s roughly similar to the HP Envy 13-d040nr you can buy right now. The older Envy notebook also has the same amount of RAM, a 256GB m.2 SSD, and a 2.5GHz dual-core Core processor. The older laptop, however, has a 3200-by-1800 resolution display, and three USB 3.0 ports—lacking the USB 3.1 that the new Envy has, let alone the Kaby Lake CPU. HP Envy 27 Display HP’s new 4K Envy monitor could make an older PC suddenly "look" a lot better. HP’s Envy 27-inch IPS display features 3840x2160 resolution at 60Hz and scrumptious 178-degree viewing angles. It’s also FreeSync-compatible for stutter-free gaming performance when paired with AMD Radeon graphics cards. Connectivity-wise, the Envy 27 Display rocks two HDMI outlets—one is HDMI 2.0 and one HDMI 1.4—and the DisplayPort 1.2 connection that’s crucial for FreeSync support. On top of that, you’ll find a USB-C port with a power delivery capability of up to 60 watts. You know, in case you want to use your monitor to charge your phone. If you want the Envy 27, you’ll have to wait a bit. HP says it won’t go on sale until December 4. Prices of the new monitor will start at $499.99.

Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

The Falcon 8+ (not to be confused with SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket) builds on the success of the AscTech Falcon 8 already in commission in the European market. The chipmaker, if you recall, purchased Ascending Technologies early this year for an undisclosed sum. Rather than going after the hot consumer market, Intel’s new drone is built specifically for commercial-grade applications. Josh Walden, a senior vice president and general manager of Intel’s New Technology Group, says the Falcon 8+ is setting a new standard for commercial-grade drones with full electronic system redundancy (think batteries, sensors, communications hardware and more). Operators will control the Falcon 8+ using the Intel Cockpit, a redesigned mobile ground station that’s sturdy enough to use even in harsh outdoor environments. As you can see by the photo above, this is a seriously detailed bit of kit that should allow operators to pilot the drone with a high degree of precision. With a top speed of around 35 miles per hour, it’ll also be able to outrun most consumer-facing, hobby drones. Intel hasn’t yet said how much the bundle will sell for although given its looks and that awesome controller, I imagine it won’t be cheap.

October 12, 2016 * * * congatec – a leading technology company for embedded computer modules, Single Board Computers (SBCs) and embedded design and manufacturing (EDM) services and editor of the upcoming COM Express 3.0 standard that includes the new COM Express Type 7 Pinout– is introducing new Server-on-Modules with Intel® Xeon® D processors (codename Broadwell) parallel to the preview release of the COM Express Type 7 specification. Based on the world-leading COM Express Basic standard form factor (95 x 125 mm), the modules feature 10 Gigabit Ethernet interfaces, 32 PCIe lanes and headless server performance currently with up to 16 server cores and 48 gigabytes of DDR4 ECC RAM. Examples of target applications for the new Server-on-Modules are industrial automation, storage and networking appliances as well as modular server designs and base stations for telecom carriers, service providers‘ server farms as well as cloud, edge and fog servers for IoT and Industry 4.0 applications. The application-ready, modular core of the long-term available congatec Server-on-Modules offers a standardized footprint, carrier board interfaces and a cooling concept, which significantly simplifies system designs – accelerating the launch of new, robust server technology. Plus, future performance upgrades can be carried out in a remarkably simple and cost-saving way, as only the Server-on-Module needs to be exchanged – even in case of a switch in the processor architecture. Without module technology, upgrading proprietary SBC designs and ATCA platforms used for carrier infrastructures is significantly more expensive. Christian Eder, Marketing Director at congatec and editor of the COM Express 3.0 specification that includes the new COM Express Type 7 Pinout, emphasizes the significance of the new COM Express Type 7 specification Server-on-Modules: “Up to now, it was not possible to execute 10 Gigabit Ethernet natively on the modules. However, this bandwidth is required to create easily scalable, module server topologies via virtualization. The Type 7 pinout fulfils these demands. It offers up to four 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports and an impressive number of 32 PCIe lanes which are commonly used on this type of server to connect fast SSDs or discrete GPUs. The COM Express footprint is tiny and allows more cores per rack. This extremely compact and robust server technology allows 10 GbE connections to be carried into the field, which is essential for hosting IoT applications.“ The feature set in detail The new conga-B7XD COM Express Type 7 Server-on-Modules come in a headless design and are available with ten different server processors: From the 16 Core Intel® Xeon® processor D1577 to the Intel® Pentium® processor D1519 for the industrial temperature range (-40 °C to +85 °C). In terms of memory, they offer up to 48 gigabytes of fast 2400DDR4 memory with or without error correction code (ECC) depending on customers’ requirements. An outstanding characteristic of the new congatec Server-on-Modules is the high level of network performance due to 2x 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports. It also supports the NC-SI Network Controller Sideband Interface for connecting a Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) allowing out-of-band remote manageability. Powerful system extensions including Flash memory can be connected via up to 24 PCI Express Gen 3.0 Lanes and 8x PCIe Gen 2.0 Lanes. 2x SATA 6G ports are available for conventional storage media. Further I/O interfaces, including 4x USB 3.0, 4x USB 2.0, LPC, SPI, I2C Bus and 2x UART, are featured. congatec offers operating system support for all popular Linux distributions and Microsoft Windows variants, including Microsoft Windows 10 IoT. An extensive range of accessories, such as standardized cooling solutions and the new COM Express Type 7 carrier board for evaluation, simplifies the design-in and will become available parallel to the launch of the new modules.

Now, a 3D-printed back brace has been created to help prevent further curvature of the spine while looking and feeling more comfortable. ADVERTISEMENT Designed in collaboration with Studio Bitonti, the Align by UNYQ is a customisable and "breathable" brace that aims to be stylish, use fewer materials, and can be worn for multiple hours a day. The Align is also able to help patients track their personal data, which can be used in the treatment process. To do this an Intel chip, said to be the size of a button, has been included in the brace.

He also said it was rare for a device that can be used for medical treatments to be launched at a fashion show. "Francis Bitonti, Peter Wildfeuer and Li Chen used innovative topology optimisation technology to create the most lightweight and beautiful scoliosis brace," Eythor Bender, UNYQ's CEO added. ADVERTISEMENT "A pilot program demonstrated the UNYQ Brace is as effective as the current gold standard and easier and more desirable to wear," UNYQ says on its website. The UNYQ Align has even garnered attention at the highest levels in the US. On September 15 the firm launched the Align at the White House. At the event, Grace Mosier, a 15-year-old wearer of the brace said it was "more comfortable" and made her feel more confident than other braces she had previously worn.

China’s largest e-commerce company is working on expanding the range of services it offers over the internet and will work with Advanced Micro Devices to use the chipmaker’s Radeon Pro graphics, the companies said Friday in a statement. For AMD, which is the second-largest maker of graphics chips used in high-end computers behind Nvidia Corp., the deal is the chance to kick start a return to the lucrative data center market dominated by Intel Corp. Graphics chips are playing an increasing role in data centers where their ability to process information in parallel makes them useful in certain work loads such as image recognition. Nvidia has pioneered this more general use of the chips, which had mainly been used by computer gamers to get a more realistic experience from their hardware. AMD, based in Sunnyvale, California, has begun its fight back from market share losses to Nvidia in graphics and Intel in general purpose processors with new products that have closed the gap in performance. AMD’s stock has more than doubled this year, making it the best performer on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index, spurred by improving sales and progress in its attempt to return to profitability.

Among the new HP offerings are a new tablet-laptop convertible, a svelte laptop, an innovative all-in-one model, and a 4k display designed for dual screen setups. "HP has absolutely raised their bar in design, quality and performance," said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy. The new HP machines target the premium end of the PC market, he told TechNewsWorld. "The target market for these are consumers who care a lot about design and performance and are willing to pay for it," said Moorhead. "HP has been gaining premium PC market share in U.S. retail, so they must have obviously cracked the code there." Convertible and Laptop HP's convertible offering is the Spectre x360 (pictured above), which is 2 millimeters thinner than its predecessor and now weighs less than 3 pounds. It has a 13.3-inch FHD IPS display, four speakers and is offered with either an i5 or an i7 seventh-generation Intel Core processor. It supports log-in via facial recognition and has up to 15 hours of battery life. What's more, the battery can be charged 90 percent in 90 minutes via a quick-charge function. The Spectre x360, available immediately, sells for US$1,049.99. HP's laptop offering, the Envy, offers more battery life than its predecessor -- it has a runtime of up to 14 hours -- but at 14mm thick and 3.15 pounds, it's not as thin and light. It has a 13.3-inch display with a touchscreen option and an extra-wide glass touchpad. HP Envy Laptop The Envy will be available Oct. 26 priced at $849.99. All-In-One and Monitor The Envy AIO 27 is HP's all-in-one desktop unit. It has a 27-inch QHD 3.6 million-pixel display that is just 15mm thick, because all the computing and storage power resides in the monitor's base. The display supports a "low blue light" mode for improved eye comfort. The base has a sound bar with four speakers tuned by Bang & Olufsen. Other features include a webcam that pops into the display when not in use, support for sixth-generation Intel quad core i5 or i7 desktop processors, storage on a solid state drive of up to 256 gigabytes, a hard drive of up to 2 terabytes, and HDMI in and out ports. The AIO 27 sells for $1,299 and will be available this month. HP's new monitor is the 27-inch Envy 27. It supports 4K video and has a micro-edge bezel. Its RGB color accuracy exceeds 99 percent and includes a Display Port, HDMI and USB C, which can be used to charge devices. The Envy 27 will be available Dec. 4 for $499.99. Apple Dropped the Ball The new HP offerings meet an unfulfilled need in the market, said Bob O'Donnell, chief analyst at Technalysis Research. "These are premium-looking and well-configured products," he told TechNewsWorld, "and given how Apple has dropped the ball advancing the Mac, there's an opportunity on the premium side of PCs." Sinking PC shipments have spurred computer makers to intensify their efforts to impress. "It's become more incumbent upon the companies staying in the market to drive more profit from the premium end," said Ross Rubin, principal analyst with Reticle Research. "Of course, Apple has been strong in that segment of the market," he told TechNewsWorld. However, Apple is expected to pick up the ball again at the end of the month with a refresh of its Macintosh line of computers. "It's too early to tell if HP has upstaged Apple until we see what Apple comes out with next," Moorhead said. "It does set a higher bar for Apple to cross, though." Reviving PC Market PC shipments have been declining for years, although there was a small bump up in this year's second quarter. PC shipments in the United States jumped 1.4 percent compared with the same period a year ago, reported Gartner, which includes tablets in its tallies. PC shipments climbed 4.9 percent, according to IDC, which excludes tablets. Worldwide shipments fell, however -- by 5.2 percent according to Gartner, and by 4.9 percent according to IDC's analysis. HP and others hope to create some momentum in the market by introducing new premium products capable of generating the kind of excitement that could infect the whole market. "In aggregate with what Dell and Lenovo have done, HP's new line could breathe some new life into the PC market," Moorhead said. PCs Not Dead HP also is hoping the new line can prod consumers to buy a new computer. "All PC manufacturers are trying to kickstart the replacement market," said Jack E. Gold of J.Gold Associates. "Everyone says PC's are dead," he told TechNewsWorld. "PCs aren't dead. It's just that people are holding onto them for much longer than they have in the past," Gold pointed out. "Lenovo, HP, Dell -- they're all trying to find ways to bring some excitement back into the market," he said. "They're looking at new form factors and all sorts of things to get consumers to get excited and buy upgrades. It's not a bad strategy." Will the new HP offerings excite consumers enough to trade in their old PCs? "It's always a challenge to get people to spend money for tech," Gold acknowledged, "but for those users who have not been upgrading in the past, there's a lot of stuff here to really like."

In the role, Reid will lead creative across Deep Focus’s client roster, which includes Nestlé, Frito-Lay, eBay, Intel and Purina, while reporting directly to CEO Ian Schafer. “John’s unique mix of traditional and digital brand-building experience makes him well-positioned to further establish Deep Focus as a world-class integrated creative agency,” Schafer said in a statement, adding that he sees Reid’s hire as a turning point and that Deep Focus has begun to compete more directly with “traditional” agencies for new business — especially over the past year. Schafer said: “There are instances where we’ve been brought on as a social agency and ended up as lead creative agency. It seems like everything is up for grabs to everyone in many cases as long as you meet the minimum requirements. … The RFPs we’ve been getting over the past year have been vaguer than ever before, and I see that as an opportunity.” Reid fills a role left vacant since Engine Group spun off Deep Focus’ content creation studio, Moment Studio, as a separate Engine Group unit with Ken Kraemer serving as CEO. “It’s been quite a long journey in hiring someone [to replace Kraemer],” Schafer told Adweek. “We’re happy to have found the right person.” Reid has served as executive vice president, chief creative officer for Wunderman since July of 2010, working with clients including P&G, Audi, Campbell’s V8, E*Trade, the Ad Council, AARP, BMO Harris Bank, Johnson and Johnson and Land Rover. Before joining Wunderman he served short stints as a creative director with ATTIK, working with Toyota, TiVo, Lucas Arts, OnLive, Ubisoft and HBO, and a freelance creative director with CP+B before that, working with Microsoft, American Express, Best Buy, Burger King and Coke Zero. Prior to that he spent over six and half years as a vice president, associate creative director with McCann Erickson, where he worked with Microsoft, HP, the Oakland A’s, Nortel, and AMD. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

The compact desktop computer measures 4.5 x 4.4 x 1.7-inches (or less) and supports Intel Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 Kaby Lake-U series processors. Small enough to attach to the back of a display using a VESA mount, the Cubi 2 comes with both a DisplayPort and HDMI output, allowing users to attach two displays. Related: Best gaming PC What's more, the integrated Intel HD 620 graphics means the Cubi 2 is capable of supporting displays with up to 4K resolutions. In terms of other ports, there's also three USB 3.1 ports, a USB Type-C connection, separate mic and headphone jacks, and an Ethernet port. MSI is offering two versions of the computer, one with enough room for an M.2 solid state drive, and a slightly larger version capable of housing M.2 storage and a 2.5-inch hard drive or SSD. The company also claims the device is as 'quiet as a forest', which basically means the Cubi 2 comes with a low noise fan, resulting in a noise level of 23.7 dB. There's a black and white version of the Cubi 2, both of which will be available globally soon. While the computer seems to be available in the US now, UK pricing is currently unavailable, but we're hoping to have more on that in the near future. In the US, the computer is available starting at $299 for the Core i3 model, $379 for the i5 model and $499 for the i7 version.

Smith Oct 14, 2016, 6:02 AM PlayStation VR has finally arrived and you, tech-savvy consumer that you are, find yourself at a three-forked road. In one direction lies the HTC Vive ($799) with its room-tracking technology that lets you walk around in a virtual space. The Oculus Rift ($599) has a solid library of games, apps and movies, and the long-awaited Touch controllers ($199) are almost here. Then there's the PlayStation VR ($399 for headset, $528 with camera and controller), which offers titles from popular developers such as Rocksteady Games and has a built-in audience of loyal PlayStation 4 owners, which makes for a cheaper entry point. With so many strong candidates vying for your VR dollar, it can be difficult to find the right system for you. But fear not! Our three-way face-off should help you decide. Design In the world of high-end VR head mounted displays, every company has their own aesthetic vision. Oculus Rift. Credit: Jeremy Lips / Tom's Guide MORE: Oculus Rift Review: Worth the Hype The Rift's black plastic chassis is all about clean lines and gentle curves while the Vive and its strategically placed photo sensors makes the wearer look like they stepped out of a sci-fi anime. The PS VR is a conglomeration of black and white plastics, glowing tracking lights and a black undisclosed material for the headband. No matter the look, I wouldn't be caught dead wearing one of these public. HTC Vive. Credit: Jeremy Lips / Tom's Guide MORE: HTC Vive Review: The Cost of True VR Freedom At 1.3 pounds, the PS VR is a tad heavy compared to the Vive (1.2 pounds) and the Rift (1.03 pounds). Despite its heavyweight status, it still manages to be the most comfortable out of the three. PlayStation VR. Credit: Jeremy Lips / Tom's Guide MORE: PlayStation VR Review: Serious Fun for a Sane Price Instead of pressing the headset into your face for inordinate amounts of time like the Rift and Vive, when worn correctly, the PS VR's rubber light guards should gently brush against your cheeks. That means you won't have those unsightly HMD marks on your face when it's time to disembark. The bulk of the headset's weight lies in the rear of the device, which makes for a more comfortable wearing experience. Winner: PlayStation VR. Despite being the heaviest headset, PS VR's clever design ensures that you'll never feel those extra ounces. Setup Some HMDs require a bit more setup than the others, and it shows by what's included in the box. The Vive requires the most space and time to get running, needing a whopping seven power outlets just to power everything. Once that's covered there's the matter of positioning the two base stations, connecting the HTC Media Link to the Vive and the PC, and mapping the room using the pair of controllers. It's a lot of moving parts, especially when you consider you might have to drill the base stations into position along your wall. Oculus Rift and motion sensor. Credit: Jeremy Lips / Tom's GuideThe PS VR doesn't require as much work, but there's a bit of effort involved. Once you unpack the headset, there's the matter of setting up the processing unit, which requires running cables between the television and the PlayStation 4. From there, you have to plug the camera into the console and connect the headset to the processing unit before powering everything on. MORE: Best VR Headsets The Rift is by far the easiest to set up, taking just about 2 minutes. You simply plug the sensor into an awaiting USB 3.0 slot on your PC or laptop. Just make sure you have another USB 3.0 slot and an HDMI 1.4 port to accommodate the headset,and you'll be good to go on the hardware front. Winner: Oculus Rift. The Rift is the king of the "no muss, no fuss" setup. Specs and Features When it comes to specs, the Rift and the Vive are almost identical. Both headsets feature 2160 x 1200 OLED displays that deliver a resolution of 1080 x 1200 per eye with a 90Hz refresh rate and a 110-degree field of view. HTC Vive with room sensor. Credit: Jeremy Lips / Tom's GuideThe PS VR offers a single 1920 x 1080 display, which offers 960 x 1080 per eye with a 100-degree FOV. As far as the refresh rate, Sony says that it can range between 90Hz or 120Hz depending on the game. In terms of built-in sensors, each headset has an accelerometer and gyroscope. However, the Rift has a magnetometer with 360-degree positional tracking while the PS VR relies on its Sony's Sixasis motion-sensing tech for tracking. In order to achieve walkable room-scaling, the Vive relies on a laser-position sensor and front-facing camera. But before you get to the fun and games, you'll have to mark out a certain amount of space for your new virtual playland. The Vive requires at least 15 x 15 feet, while the Rift needs 5 x 11 feet. The PS VR is in the middle at 9.8 x 6.2 feet. Winner: HTC Vive. The Vive requires a lot more space than its competitors, but it's worth it when you're taking a literal stroll through your virtual landscape. What's Included Out of the box, the Rift features the headset, sensor, remote, cables and an Xbox One controller. It's almost no-frills when compared to the competition. In addition to the headset, the base configuration of the PlayStation VR has the PlayStation Camera, processing unit, a pair of earbuds and the requisite cables. A few components of the HTC Vive. Credit: HTCBut the Vive is the motherlode with the headset, two controllers, two base stations, and HTC Link -- each with its own charging cable. Winner: HTC Vive. HTC provides everything you need for a complete VR experience. Hardware Requirements Virtual reality is more than just a headset. It also needs a PC/laptop or console to power everything. The PS VR can work with either the PlayStation 4 ($288), Slim ($299) or Pro ($399). If you want to use a gaming laptop with your Rift or Vive, it will need with at least an Intel Core i7-6700HK processor, 8GB of RAM and Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 GPU, two USB 3.0 ports, HDMI 1.4, a 1920 x 1080 display and Windows 7 or above. Oculus has recently lowered the bar for entry for the Rift, requiring at minimum an Intel Core i3-6100 or AMD FX 3450 CPU, 8GB of RAM and either an Nvidia GeForce GTX 960 GPU or AMD Radeon RX 470 GPU. There is a caveat in the fact that Oculus is no longer supporting Windows 7. However, the lower-tier specs means that you can snag a compatible system starting as low as $499. MORE: Best Gear VR Games The Vive needs a more powerful system, one outfitted with at least an Intel Core i5 4590 or AMD FX 8350 or greater, 4GB of RAM with either HDMI 1.4 or DisplayPort 1.2 and at least one USB 2.0 with Windows 7. Winner: PlayStation VR. Every iteration of the PlayStation is cheaper than the most cost-effective Oculus-friendly PC. Motion Tracking Three headsets -- three ways to track motion. HTC Vive in motion. Credit: Jeremy Lips / Tom's GuideThe Vive's "Lighthouse" base stations bounce lasers off the light sensors located on the headset and controllers. It's sort of like echolocation, but with lasers. Just keep in mind that the base stations have to be a minimum 6 feet apart. Neither the Rift or the PS VR are that complex. The Rift Constellation system relies on the lone optical sensor, which is fine for the seated experience. However, with the Touch controllers on the way, you'll be getting an extra sensor so you can move around in a limited amount of space. Oculus recently announced that Rift can also do room tracking if you add a third sensor into the mix. PlayStation VR motion camera. Credit: Jeremy Lips / Tom's GuideAs for the PS VR, it's just you, the headset and the PS camera. Sony uses Sixaxis tech (comprised of a three-axis gyroscope and a three-axis accelerometer) that’s built into the headset, which is accented by the glowing blue lights. Although the setup does allow for seated and standing experiences, you can't walk around the room as you can with the Vive or Rift.. Winner: HTC Vive. Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, I have yet to test the Rift's room-scaling capabilities. That means that for now, the Vive has the best motion-tracking setup. Touch Controllers It's time to reach out and touch someone or something. Oculus Rift controllers. Credit: Tom's GuideAs of December 6, when Oculus' Touch controllers start shipping, each of the high-end headsets will have its own set of devices designed to mimic your hands (or whatever the developer programs them to be). HTC Vive controllers. Credit: Jeremy Lips / Tom's GuideUsing the Vive controllers, I've found that they are the heaviest of the bunch, but also the most versatile, thanks to the built-in touchpads, trigger and side-mounted buttons. In games that call for teleportation, the Vive controllers deliver a better experience. I also like using the side buttons during shooting games, since it makes me feel like I'm actually holding a weapon. However, it can take you a little while to adjust to the placement of the buttons and feel of the touchpad. PlayStation VR move controllers. Credit: Jeremy Lips / Tom's GuideThe PlayStation Move controllers are the same devices that worked PlayStation 3, down to the white tracking globe on the top. While lighter than the Vive controllers, Move does have some heft to it. Move does a solid job of acting as my surrogate hands, weapons or mode of transportation. In terms of battery, the Move seems to have a shorter battery life than the Vive controllers. I found that I would get the low battery indicator after three hours of use. I had a more difficult time getting adjusted to the tiny face buttons surrounding the large move button. MORE: Best Gear VR Apps Like their headset, the Oculus Touch controllers are featherlight. Comprised of a pair of back-mounted triggers, three face buttons and an analog stick, the Touch controllers are ergonomically efficient. In action, I found the controllers delivered accurate response with no noticeable latency. My only complaint so far is that in games where the analog sticks were used for teleporting, I'd accidently nudge one of them, making me miss important shots. Winner: Oculus Rift. Outside the initial learning curve, the Touch controllers provide a lightweight, intuitive way to get your hands into the game. Boundary System When you're wearing a VR headset over the majority of your face. It pays to have something to make sure you don't go crashing into a wall or tripping over a piece of furniture. HTC Vive room tracking set up.The Vive has the grid-based Chaperone system, which layers a colored grid when you get too close to an obstacle during your adventures in VR. And just in case a pet or a person wanders in your play area, the headset will show an infrared outline of the outside world, or what I like to call "Predator Vision.” Oculus recently announced its Guardian system, which is currently only available to developers. However, when it comes out of beta, it will be similar to the Vive's Chaperone system. Since PS VR isn't designed for room scale, Sony hasn't made a built-in boundary system. However, Nyko is making a third-party peripheral that will create a boundary system using strategically-placed sensors that will beep when you come too close. Winner: HTC Vive. The Vive's camera, with its pass-through ability, gives the headset a distinct advantage over the competition. Games and Apps As cool each of these headsets are, they're only as good as their software. To date, Valve claims that the Steam store has over 600 games and apps for the Vive. However, many of those titles are short demo experiences, leaving the actual numbers of full-fledged games and apps a lot lower. EVE: Valkyrie, a game for the Oculus Rift.The Rift might not have as many games as Vive, but Oculus' continued investment in developers has yielded some great titles. These include Chronos, Insomniac Games' Edge of Nowhere and Feral Rites, as well as the upcoming The Unspoken. You also have popular games such as Eve: Valkyrie, Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes and Elite Dangerous. Since it launched, Oculus has been busy at work seeding its library with a fund for developers to create unique experiences for the Rift. To date, the company has 100 titles in its library and projected to hit 150 by the end of the year. The company recently pledged a whopping $250 million for the next round of diverse apps, games and experiences. To date, Oculus just earned its first Emmy Award for the animated short "Henry." MORE: Best VR-Ready Gaming PCs PS VR launched with 30 titles, including Batman: Arkham VR and Until Dawn: Rush of Blood. Several well known developers and publishers have signed on to create games for the nascent system, such as Double Fine and Capcom. Winner: Oculus Rift. So far the Rift offers the best selection of titles. Price and Value The PS VR is priced at $399, which includes the headset, processing unit and all of the cables, minus one HDMI port. That means if you don't already have the Move controllers or a PlayStation camera, you're going to have to shell out $35 per controller and $59 for the camera, upping the price to $528. That's still cheaper than the HTC Vive, which costs $799. The Rift is priced at $599, but if you want the Touch Controllers you’ll have to fork over $798. If you want your Rift to do room-scale, you'll have to fork over another $79, which brings the total up to $874. Winner: PlayStation VR. PlayStation VR is by far the cheapest option for consumers interesting in getting into virtual reality. Bottom Line To date, the HTC Vive remains my top choice for a high-end virtual reality experience, due in large part to its room-scaling capabilities. Despite the inordinate amount of space and setup required, when it's all said and done, the Vive consistently delivers those Wow! Moments. HTC Vive $799 NewEgg However, the Oculus Rift is right on its heels with a laughably easy setup, lightweight and easy-to-use Touch controllers and an ever-expanding library of grade-A games and apps funded by the company. Oculus Rift $599 Oculus However, if you're looking for a lower-cost entry into virtual reality, the PlayStation VR can deliver a good VR experience with a library that's totally focused on gaming.

The Vensmile K8 Foldable Keyboard Mini PC features a rolling-up rubber mat keyboard attached to the left side of a rectangular mini-PC which itself hosts a touchpad surface. You might sense I am struggling to describe this thing, but luckily a picture says a thousand words. Please see below. The K8 is powered by an Intel Atom X5 Z8300 'Cherry Trail' quad-core processor. This 14nm 2W SDP processor has a base/boost frequency of 1.44GHz/1.84GHz. It sports Intel HD graphics with a max resolution of 1980 x 1080, Full HD. To accompany the processor at the heart of its machine, Vensmile has equipped 4GB of RAM and 64GB of eMMC storage. Other key specs are Wi-Fi 2.4-5.8g/b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.0 support, plus an array of ports which include an HDMI out, VGA out, 1x USB 3.0 port, 1x USB 2.0 port, a TF card slot, and a 3.5mm audio jack. This rather light (277g) machine runs off a 5V 3A power input. When rolled open the K8 measures 385 x 120 x 15mm. From the pictures it looks like the keyboard is splash resistant but I notice the splash isn't big enough to envelope the electronic heart of the PC to the right... The above hardware specs are standard fare for many an HDMI stick, tablet, or similar portable PC, so let's have a look at the Vensmile K8's particular attraction: having a full sized keyboard and decent sized multi-touch touchpad built-in/on. The keyboard looks like one of the common-or-garden flexible silicone keyboards that you can pick up for as little as a fiver but very few of which receive accolades for typing comfort. To the right of this is the attached computer 'chassis' which provides a touchpad surface over most of its upper surface area. The only other thing you need to get computing on the go is a monitor/TV. As headlined, this Mini-PC is up for pre-order now, price cut from $249 to $199. That price includes Microsoft Windows 10 installed but I'd still bet on the 'pre-order introductory price cut' going even deeper in a matter of a few months. I think I would prefer the Pipo KB2 and a wireless mouse if priced similarly, but that Vensmile K8 rival still seems to be unavailable.

This just feels gimmicky… Posted by wazzickle - Fri 14 Oct 2016 19:52 I think it's a great idea. To have everything bar a monitor in a small package like this would be very convenient, a better idea than having, for a example, a separate compute stick, mouse and keyboard to carry round. I suppose it comes with a power brick which would be a drawback, at this point I would say the specs seem good value and if there were a battery-powered version I would probably spring for one.

Surely a stick PC with slim bluetooth keyboard is more practical? This just feels gimmicky… Looks gimmicky too. Nice that it folds into a wallet sized thing, but how big is the power brick you have to cart around too ? Posted by preter_s - Wed 26 Oct 2016 12:36 If one is assuming that there is a monitor lying around at some desk where you intend to bring this thing to, you would think that there would be a proper mouse/keyboard there too? A compute stick would make more sense (& cheaper).

The gang has come up with an open specification that can boost datacentre server performance by up to ten times.  Dubbed the Open Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface (OpenCAPI), this is an open forum to provide a high bandwidth, low latency open interface design specification. The open interface will help corporate and cloud data centres to speed up big data, machine learning, analytics and other emerging workloads. The consortium plans to make the OpenCAPI specification available to the public before the end of the year and expects servers and related products based on the new standard in the second half of 2017, it said in a statement. Chipzilla is not signing up to the forum, but them it has stayed away from other open standards  and technology groups such as CCIX and Gen-Z.  It prefers to keep all its technology to itself. However Doug Balog, general manager for IBM Power, said that with all the AI, machine learning and advanced analytics kicking around,  datacentres can no longer rely on one company alone to drive innovation.   Tags: Google, IBM, intel Search for: Recent Articles NHS email system borked by one idiot and 120 pedants The NHS’s email system is under pressure after one idiot decided to send an email to everyone.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Oct 13, 2016 at 3:23PM Memory chipmaker Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and mobile chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) have respectively rallied 19% and 31% this year, easily outperforming the Nasdaq's 4% gain. Those gains were surprising, since both chipmakers faced major headwinds last year -- Micron was hit by plummeting memory prices, and Qualcomm was losing market share in mobile chips. Let's discuss why both chipmakers bounced back, and whether or not either chipmaker is a worthy buy at current prices. Image source: Pixabay. Understanding Micron and Qualcomm's challenges Micron ranks fourth in the global NAND market after Samsung, Toshiba, and Western Digital's SanDisk -- in that order. It ranks third in the mobile DRAM market after Samsung and SK Hynix. This ongoing competition from larger rivals has traditionally been tough on Micron's margins. Meanwhile, an oversupply of flash memory has reduced average selling prices, and the integration costs of its manufacturing processes at its combined Elpida and Micron fabs has further weighed on its bottom line. Qualcomm is the world's largest maker of mobile system on chips (SoCs), which bundle application processors, baseband modems, GPUs, and other features onto a single chip. Qualcomm generates most of its revenue from this business, but cheaper rivals like MediaTek and first-party chipmakers like Samsung and Huawei have reduced its market share. Qualcomm generates most of its earnings from its higher-margin patent licensing business, which takes a 3% to 5% cut of the wholesale price of every smartphone sold worldwide. However, that business has been under pressure due to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and regulators demanding lower fees to compensate for the plunging margins on mobile device sales. Image source: Qualcomm. Evaluating the potential catalysts Micron is trying to widen its competitive moat by developing faster memory technologies, like 3D NAND and 3DXPoint, with its longtime partner Intel. Intel, which abandoned its own DRAM efforts in 1985 amid tough competition, is frequently cited as a potential suitor for Micron, which has an enterprise value of $23 billion. The main near-term catalyst for Micron would be the tightening of DRAM and NAND supplies across the market, which would boost average selling prices. Recent comments from HP CEO Dion Weisler about component shortages and a DigiTimes article -- which claimed that DRAM spot prices had hit a seven-month high in September -- support that bullish thesis. As a result, analysts expect Micron's revenue to rise 21% this year and another 6% next year. Qualcomm is diversifying its chipmaking business into adjacent markets like connected cars, drones, wearables, smart home appliances and other Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets. To achieve that, it acquired IoT chipmaker CSR for $2.4 billion last year, launched custom SoCs for specific devices like wearables and drones, and might even buy NXP Semiconductors -- the biggest automotive chipmaker in the world -- for over $30 billion. As for the licensing business, Qualcomm has been securing new licensing contracts with deadbeat OEMs (mainly in China), which underreported shipments to pay lower fees. The acquisition of CSR, potential purchase of NXP, and its own research and development should also expand its patent portfolio to cover adjacent markets, thus reducing the segment's overall dependence on smartphones. These moves are encouraging, but analysts still believe that Qualcomm's revenue will fall 8% this year before rebounding 2% next year. Profit growth and valuations Micron has posted negative earnings for three consecutive quarters, but rising memory prices are expected to lift it back to profitability, with earnings of $0.19 per share this quarter. Micron's annual earnings are expected to rise from $0.06 in 2015 to $1.17 in 2016, and rise another 50% in 2017. Those growth estimates make Micron's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 15 look fairly cheap. Qualcomm remains highly profitable, but the pricing pressures at its chipmaking business and its licensing woes could cause its earnings to fall 8% this year. However, Qualcomm's new flagship chipsets, its expansion into adjacent markets, broadening patent portfolio, and resolved licensing conflicts are expected to boost earnings by 10% in 2017. That rebound is encouraging, but the growth rate remains lower than its forward P/E of 14 -- indicating that the stock isn't that cheap. But if Qualcomm buys NXP, its chipmaking margins could improve as it scales up. Micron doesn't pay a dividend, but Qualcomm pays a forward yield of 3.2%, which is easily supported by its trailing-12-month payout ratio of 57%. That dividend, which has been hiked for 13 consecutive years, should limit the stock's downside during market downturns. The winner: Micron I own shares of Qualcomm and believe that it's a solid long-term investment, but Micron looks better at current prices. Its top and bottom lines could grow much faster, thanks to tightening NAND and DRAM supplies and rising prices, and its valuation indicates its potential growth hasn't been fully priced in yet. Qualcomm is a reliable income play, but it could take a much longer time for its expansion into adjacent markets to pay off. Leo Sun owns shares of Qualcomm.

Trying Out Ubuntu GNOME 16.10, Wayland Session Not So Great Written by Michael Larabel in Ubuntu on 13 October 2016 at 12:04 PM EDT. 22 Comments With today's Ubuntu 16.10 release one of the exciting spins we've been looking forward to is Ubuntu GNOME 16.10, which has an experimental Wayland session available but is not the default. I spent a few minutes trying out Ubuntu GNOME 16.10 this morning. Ubuntu GNOME 16.10 ships with gnome-session-wayland installed by default so you can easily log-in to the Wayland-based session from the login manager, but it's not used by default -- Ubuntu GNOME 16.10 still defaults to the X.Org Server session. Of Phoronix readers, there's been a few reports of not being able to login to the GNOME Wayland session. On a clean install of Ubuntu GNOME 16.10 with an Intel Skylake system, I ran into no problems logging into the session, seems users are having a problem with LightDM/SSDM. While I was able to start the GNOME Wayland session, right away I realized my mouse cursor wasn't working... Keyboard input was working fine, but no cursor. Strange as I've used this same exact Intel Skylake desktop on Fedora with Wayland and other Wayland test scenarios before, even with the Mir Unity 8 experimental testing too. I can navigate to benchmarking via the Phoronix Test Suite with just the keyboard, but unfortunately, none of the graphics tests would run. They wouldn't work either over XWayland or for the SDL2 tests when setting SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland. So I wasn't able to run any GNOME Wayland vs. X.Org benchmarks on Ubuntu GNOME 16.10. So long story short, the Wayland session on Ubuntu GNOME 16.10 isn't as well-baked as what can be found on the upcoming Fedora 25 where it's using Wayland by default or even with the current Fedora 24 release when opting to use the GNOME Wayland session. But outside of the Wayland session, the GNOME 3.20~3.22 stack on Ubuntu GNOME 16.10 has been working out fairly well: Those wishing to try out the latest Ubuntu GNOME spin can download it from UbuntuGNOME.org or specifically here. 22 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Speaking at the event, which held in Lagos, Head, Emerging Businesses at Diamond Bank, Mrs. Njideka Esomeju, described technology as a catalyst for driving Small and Medium Enterprises in the country. She said that though there were challenges being faced in the course of operating small businesses, technology has played a key role in ensuring small businesses thrive, especially during the current economic recession. According to her “With the Diamond Mobile POS, you can conveniently make payments for goods and services using your debit, credit or prepaid cards. We are pleased to introduce to you the latest innovation in electronic payment-Diamond Mobile POS. A miniature version of the conventional POS terminal, the Diamond Mobile POS works on any internet enabled smart phone or tablet.” She added that with mPOS, merchants are guaranteed speed, increased safety and reliability in payment settlement when they use their debit, credit and prepaid cards. “The device is offered at no cost to merchants, stronger network connectivity, even in remote areas, accept all cards, generate e-receipts and provide inventory management services because we have realised that with our solution, technology is the way to go,” she said. The Lead, SME Customers Marketing, Microsoft Nigeria, Mr. Adeniyi Adebote, said technology would help accelerate small businesses in the country, adding that business owners do not need to have an office before using technology to grow their businesses. He said that Microsoft’s Cloud connectivity would enable customers to have their information secured, stressing that no customer’s information could be given out without his/her prior consent. “Technology can be a major differentiator for your business but it can seem daunting when you look across your IT-from server to the cloud, PCs to mobile devices-to know where you should start and how you can transition from what you have now to your new version. This is where Microsoft and its ecosystem of partner experts provide something different-offering a unique approach for making the benefits of modern technology a reality. “With Microsoft, you can choose your own PTH to modern with flexible, familiar and trusted solutions for your business- whether by growing with greater efficiency, protecting your data or empowering your mobile workforce,” Adebote said. Intel’s Business Development Manager, Mrs. Folake Oyekanmi, said differentiation was the key to accelerate businesses through technology. According to her, “Differentiation is the key to acceleration your businesses and this can be done through technology. We want to ensure that every SMEs in Nigeria can compete with others throughout the world. You must pick a right PC.

If only the authorities had connected the dots. That challenge — mining billions of bits of information and crunching the data to find crucial clues — is behind a push by U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies to harness “big data” to predict crimes, terrorist acts and social upheaval before they happen. The market for such “predictive analytics” technology is estimated to reach $9.2 billion by 2020, up from $3 billion in 2015, according to research firm MarketsandMarkets. It’s the stuff of a science-fiction movie like “Minority Report,” in which Tom Cruise played a Washington cop who used technology to arrest people before they carried out crimes. It’s also a red flag for privacy advocates already fighting U.S. spy programs exposed by Edward Snowden and the FBI’s demands that Apple Inc. help it hack into encrypted mobile phones. The idea is to make sense of the vast and disparate streams of data from sources including social media, GPS devices, video feeds from street cameras and license-plate readers, travel and credit-card records and the news media, as well as government and propriety systems. ‘Fundamental Fuel’ “Data is going to be the fundamental fuel for national security in this century,” William Roper, director of the Defense Department’s strategic capabilities office, said at a conference in Washington last month. For the first time, the White House released a strategic plan on Wednesday to advance research and development of artificial intelligence technology, including to predict incidents that may be dangerous to public safety. Weeks before Rahami allegedly carried out the attacks in September, he bought circuit boards, electric igniters and ball bearings — all of which are known bomb-making materials, according to charging documents from the FBI. In previous years, he was flagged by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the FBI after he made trips to Pakistan and after his father told police he was a terrorist, before recanting the remark. Law enforcement agents could have been tipped off that Rahami was moving toward an attack had all of those data points been culled together in one place, said Mark Testoni, chief executive officer and president of SAP National Security Services Inc., a U.S.-based subsidiary of German software company SAP SE. “This is a big data world now,” said Testoni. He said his company has developed a computer platform for doing predictive analytics that is being used in a limited way by a Defense Department agency and by a national security agency. He declined to name the government customers or specify what they are doing. The technology to predict events is only in its infancy, Testoni said. National security and law enforcement agencies also have different rules when it comes to obtaining and using data, meaning there are walls between what can be accessed and shared, he said. U.S. law enforcement agencies, for example, need a court warrant to access most data. Big Brother Privacy advocates express concern about the “Big Brother” implications of such massive data-gathering, calling for more information and public debate about how predictive technology will be used. “There’s often very little transparency into what’s being brought into the systems or how it’s being crunched and used,” said Rachel Levinson-Waldman, senior counsel to the National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law. “That also makes it very hard to go back and challenge information that might be incorrect.” Computer algorithms also fail to understand the context of data, such as whether someone commenting on social media is joking or serious, Levinson-Waldman said. Testoni’s company and others such as Intel Corp. and PredPol Inc. are among a handful of firms pioneering the use of predictive analytics and artificial intelligence for clients from local police departments to U.S. national security agencies. More than 60 local police departments in the U.S. have started making use of a service sold by PredPol, which calls itself “The Predictive Policing Company,” to forecast where crimes might occur based on past patterns, said co-founder Jeff Brantingham. What, Where, When Its system, developed in collaboration with the Los Angeles Police Department, uses only three types of data: what type of crime occurred, when and where, Brantingham said. Then, a software algorithm generates the probability of crime occurring in different locations, presented as 500-foot-by-500-foot squares on a computer display or a printed map. With that insight, police departments then can make decisions about how best to apply their resources, such as sending cops to a high-risk area, or which security cameras to monitor, Brantingham said. PrePol’s system doesn’t make predictions about who will commit a crime, so it stops short of a system that might identify a terrorist in the making. “Interdicting places is, by and large, an approach that is more in line with protecting civil liberties than interdicting people,” Brantingham said. Even with such limits, privacy and civil liberties groups oppose the use of predicting policing technology as a threat to the Constitution’s promises of equal protection and due process. ‘Fortune-Teller Policing’ “This is fortune-teller policing that uses deeply flawed and biased data and relies on vendors that shroud their products in secrecy,” Wade Henderson, president and chief executive officer of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. “Instead of using predictive technology to correct dysfunctional law enforcement, departments are using these tools to supercharge discrimination and exacerbate the worst problems in our criminal justice system.” eBay, Amazon Vast databases that companies have created for online commerce and communications could help law enforcement and national security agencies build predictive systems if they are allowed to tap into them. Technology companies have terms of service that set out how much personal information can be kept and sold to outside companies such as advertisers, and most resist handing over such data to the government unless a court orders them to do so. Predictive analytics are already being used by companies like eBay Inc., Amazon.com Inc., and Netflix Inc. to crunch their users’ Internet activity to forecast what they might be interested in. Companies like Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. have access to over a billion social-media accounts. The storehouse of data on Americans will only grow with digital feeds from Internet-connected appliances and wearable devices. Social media, in particular, is a valuable tool in tracking potential terrorist attacks, said Eric Feinberg, founding member of the Global Intellectual Property Enforcement Center, which is a private company. His firm has patented technology that can scan for hashtags across different social media platforms and in different languages for communications that indicate terrorist planning. “Our software is about pattern analysis,” Feinberg said. “We focus on the communications stream.” ‘Open Source Indicators’ The U.S. government is working on initial efforts to gain insight into global social and political trends. A program under the intelligence community’s research arm called Mercury seeks to develop methods for continuous and automated analysis of intercepted electronic communications “in order to anticipate and/or detect political crises, disease outbreaks, terrorist activity and military actions,” said Charles Carithers, spokesman for the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity. The agency also previously funded the Open Source Indicators program, which “developed methods for continuous, automated analysis of publicly available data in order to anticipate and/or detect significant societal events,” such as mass violence and riots, mass migrations, disease outbreaks and economic instability, Carithers said. CIA Forecasts The CIA draws a distinction between using technology to anticipate events, versus predict them. The agency is using sophisticated algorithms and advanced analytics, along with publicly available data, to forecast events. The initial coverage focuses on the Middle East and Latin America. “We have, in some instances, been able to improve our forecast to the point of being able to anticipate the development of social unrest and societal instability to within three to five days out,” said Andrew Hallman, the agency’s deputy director for digital innovation. In its annual report in June, the Defense Science Board said, “Imagine if national leaders had sufficient time to act in emerging regional hot spots to safeguard U.S. interests using interpretation of massive data including social media and rapidly generate strategic options.” “Such a capability may soon be achievable,” the board said. “Massive data sets are increasingly abundant and could contain predictive clues — especially social media and open-source intelligence.” Poindexter’s Legacy If U.S. intelligence agencies develop an advanced system to predict terrorist acts they might call it “Total Information Awareness.” Except that name has already been used, with unhappy results. Retired Admiral John Poindexter created the “Total Information Awareness” program for the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in 2002 to find and monitor terrorists and other national security threats using data and technology. The program became so controversial, especially over concerns that privacy rights would be violated, that Congress canceled funding for Poindexter’s office in 2003. Having been there and done that, Poindexter now says predicting terrorism is possible but would require a lot of data, such as banking information, analysis of social media, travel records and classified material. The system also has to include strong privacy protections that the public can review, said Poindexter, who said he was working on such a “privacy protection application” when his program was canceled. “You have to develop public trust in the way this is going to work,” said Poindexter, who continued developing the technology after leaving government through Saffron Technology Inc., a cognitive computing company that Intel bought in 2015 for an undisclosed price. Intel declined to comment. “The government’s priorities should be to solve the privacy issue and start ingesting massive amounts of data into memory bases,” Poindexter said. “You have to get the public on board with the idea that we can collect and search information on terrorist planning that doesn’t have an adverse impact on innocent people.” Related: FBI Warns of More Terrorist Attacks in U.S. as ISIS Is Defeated in Syria Judge Claims Facebook Not Taking Terrorism Threat Seriously RMS Updates Cat Models for Terrorism, Europe Windstorm & US Flood AIR Worldwide Expands Global Terrorism Risk Model Characteristics of ‘Charlie Hebdo’ Attack Thwarted Counter-Terrorism Efforts: RMS Copyright 2016 Bloomberg.

The Aurora is Alienware’s mid-range gaming PC, slotting neatly between the Alpha living room PC and the completely over-the-top Area 51. Don’t expect mid-range performance from the Aurora range, though: Alienware has kitted it out with high-end components, adding that Alienware price premium, too. The Aurora is replacing the x51, so if you're after a more compact gaming PC then act quickly as x51s won't be around for much longer. Video: Alienware Aurora review Alienware Aurora – Buying Options Depending on where you buy the Aurora, you’ll have a whole range of specifications from which to choose. This means that while the performance figures in this review will likely differ to the PC you end up buying, comments about build quality, noise and value for money still apply. The cheapest model in the Aurora range gets an Intel Core i3-6100 processor and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 950 for £649. This will be a relatively capable Full HD gaming machine but, frankly, I’d wait until the GTX 1050 and 1050 Ti appear on the market before shelling out for hardware that’s soon to be out of date. Further up the range, there are various options including a Core i5-6400, Core i5-6600K and Core i7-6700 and 6700K. For more on what these different processor model numbers mean, click the link below. Related: Intel Core processors explained Every major graphics card from 2016 is represented, from AMD’s Radeon RX 480 and R9 370 to the Nvidia GeForce GTX 950 and GTX 960 at the cheaper end of the scale. At the top end, you get the choice of either a new GTX 1070 or GTX 1080. The model on review here is closer to the top-end of the range, costing £1,278 on Alienware’s configuration webpage. I think this is the best-value option available, but if your budget won't stretch to that, there are plenty of options from which to choose. Alienware Aurora – Design and Build The Aurora is a mid-tower PC, meaning it’s substantially smaller than what most people are used to seeing in a gaming PC. It’s pretty stylish, too. The front of the PC is dominated by ventilation slits and a matte black cover for the optical drive bays. The top of the PC is slightly curved, with a crease in the middle that sweeps around to the rear of the PC. Here you'll find a thin plastic handle; it isn't strong enough from which to carry the Aurora, more an adornment on the case. The top of the Aurora rather discourages the placing of objects on it, so a rethink may be in order if your current desktop forms part of your paper filing system. There are two side panels made from gun-metal grey plastic, each with either two or three LED strips. The right-side panel includes extra vents for airflow. The sides are creased in three places and are slightly awkward to take on and off because of their shape and the fact that they require power in order to light up, meaning you have power cables to deal with. It isn't too difficult a process, though, and since you won’t spend much time inside the Aurora, this shouldn't be a huge issue. Video: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 review The lighting on the exterior of the Aurora can be modified using Alienware’s preinstalled software. You can pick from a huge selection of colours, and a variety of pulsing options, too. Conversely, if you hate flashing lights then you can turn them off completely. Note that a dozen or so games support AlienFX, which changes the colour of the lights when action is taking place in a game – which is a nice, albeit niche, touch. It’s the internal layout of this PC that’s most curious, however. The exterior dimensions of 212 x 360 x 472mm would have you believe this is a conventional mid-sized PC. But it turns out that the overall size of the case is a result of the plastic flab that Alienware has added to the exterior of what is a much smaller metal chassis. This means the firm has had to make some interesting design decisions inside. The power supply is mounted in a cage that can swivel in and out of the case when the left-side panel is taken off. This allows room for a second graphics card to be added, if you so choose. On the floor of the case are two 2.5-inch bays for additional SSDs and hard disks, with a further two slots mounted on the inside-front of the case. Behind the swinging PSU mount are four RAM slots, two of which were occupied on this machine with 8GB of 2,133MHz DDR4 memory. Depending on your specification, you’ll also find either a liquid-cooling system or a more run-of-the-mill air cooler. My model came with an air cooler, but if you pick one of the overclockable i5-6600K or i7-6700K systems, you’ll probably want to shell out a rather steep £210 for liquid cooling and a higher-capacity power supply. The Aurora includes a generous helping of four USB 3.0 ports on the front and four more at the rear, which are accompanied by six USB 2.0 connectors. Finally, there’s a USB 3.1 Type-C connector for high-end, high-performance peripherals. All of this is more than enough for even the most crowded desks, and leaves plenty of room for an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive if you fancy a bit of VR action. The AMD Radeon RX 480 model, alongside the GTX 1070 and 1080 editions, are all VR-ready. The Aurora is also suited to high-end audio systems, sporting both an optical SPDIF connector and a coaxial port as well. Six 3.5mm audio jacks give the Aurora enough oomph to power a full surround-sound system. Three DisplayPort connectors, an HDMI and a DVI port round off the connectors at the rear. Intel 802.11ac Wi-Fi is included, which will be handy for homes without readily accessible wired internet access. Alienware Aurora – Performance Spending over £1,200 on a PC, you’d expect nothing less than great performance, and I’m pleased to say you won’t be disappointed. The Intel Core i7-6700 is a great processor, and while it doesn’t benefit from a liquid cooler, it performed admirably in our suite of benchmarks. Its result in the PCMark Home test was a competitive 4,174, putting it in the region of the overclockable i7-6700K. It’s a quad-core chip running at 3.4GHz, boosting to 4GHz when it’s cool enough. There’s Intel Hyper-Threading, too, which means it’s extremely adept at running high-end processing workloads such as video rendering and strategy games with lots of AI opponents. In terms of graphics, the supplied Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 is the business when it comes to Full HD and 1440p gaming. The card that Alienware supplies is the Founders Edition model, which is one of the better-looking versions of the GTX 1070 on the market. But since it’s hidden inside the case, there’s little to justify the outlay, especially when there are similar-performing GTX 1070s from other manufacturers that would probably have been cheaper. Related: Best graphics card Either way, the GTX 1070 has a meaty 8GB of GGDR5 video memory and a 1,683MHz boost clock speed, managing to power through every game we threw at it in our original review. In our smaller suite of benchmarks for desktop PCs, the results were similar; slightly slower than the performance in the open-air test bench we use for GPU testing. It managed 123fps in the Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and 110fps in Dirt Showdown at Full HD and Ultra settings, pointing towards performance that will easily handle the latest games at this resolution. 1440p gameplay will also be possible, as our GTX 1070 review attests to. The SSD on board is ridiculously fast, posting 2000MB/sec read speeds in the AS SSD benchmark. My unit only had a 256GB SSD alongside a 1TB hard disk, but I’d recommend specifying a single 512GB SSD instead for £60 extra and forget about the 1TB hard disk altogether. The Aurora is cool and quiet, even when running games. I never saw component temperatures rise beyond 60oC, and with the system sat under my desk, I couldn’t hear any of the fans whirring. Should I buy the Alienware Aurora? The Alienware Aurora is a great-looking desktop PC that offers decent value. When you consider that you get a fast SSD along with decent graphics and processing components, it’s hard to fault. Included in the base price of the Aurora is Dell’s excellent one-year on-site warranty, too, which if needed will see a Dell engineer come to your home and perform diagnostics and repairs to your PC. Most custom PC manufacturers offer this as an extra, so Dell has stolen a march on them here. My only complaints concern the rather steep optional extras: doubling your RAM to 16GB costs an outrageous £110. For context, you can buy a perfectly decent 16GB set of RAM for less than £80 online – and 8GB for half that – so how Dell has managed to charge nearly three times the market rate is hard to understand. The £210 for liquid cooling and an unnecessary 850W power supply is also puzzling, especially given that the liquid-cooling loop looks easy to install, so additional labour costs here should have been minimal. While it does look stylish, I do wish Alienware had trimmed the fat on the chassis design. This could be a much smaller PC if the company had chosen to keep things simple – and I think it would be a more attractive buy as a result.

This will mark the second consecutive year of decline. The global devices market fell by 0.75 percent in 2015. “The global devices market is not on pace to return to single-digit growth soon,” says Ranjit Atwal, research director at Gartner. Growth is on pace to remain flat during the next five years. All segments are expected to decline in 2016, except for premium ultramobiles and utility mobile phones (entry level phones), which are expected to show single-digit growth this year. “We expect premium ultramobiles will start benefiting from the collective performance and integration of the latest Intel CPU platform and Windows 10,” says Atwal. Table 1.

This follows four consecutive quarters of decline. If this situation prevails it means that PC sales will bottom out in 2016. However, the PC market in Western Europe remains difficult following the Brexit vote. “Device vendors are mitigating the currency depreciation of the pound in two ways — first, they are taking advantage of the likelihood of a single-digit decline in PC component costs in 2016,” says Atwal. “Second, they will “de-feature” their PCs to keep prices down. With these changes, Gartner expects PC prices in the UK to increase by less than 10 percent in 2017.” For the PC market to stay on pace for flat growth in 2017, business spending needs to flourish. “The inventory of Windows 8 PCs should have been cleared, and large businesses in mature markets are now looking to move to Windows 10 through 2018,” adds Atwal. “In addition, more affordable hardware and increasingly available virtual reality content (such as games, stories and other entertainment) will enable consumer PC buyers to upgrade in order to experience immersive offerings. Smartphone Growth to Continue Slowing Down in 2016 Total mobile phone shipments are on pace to decline 1.6 percent in 2016. The smartphone segment continues to grow, albeit more slowly than in previous years, and is expected to reach 1.5 billion units in 2016. “This is no surprise; the smartphone market is maturing, and reaching global saturation with phones that are increasingly capable and remain good enough for longer,” saidRoberta Cozza, research director at Gartner. In 2016, the Android market will continue to be bolstered by Chinese vendors offering more affordable premium devices. Despite the availability of the iPhone 7, Gartner expects a weaker year-over-year volume performance from Apple in 2016, as volumes stabilize after a very strong 2015. As a result, Gartner expects total smartphone market to only increase 4.5 percent with premium smartphones declining 1.1 percent in 2016. “We expect the market for premium smartphones to return to 3.5 per cent growth in 2017, as stronger replacement cycles kick in and in anticipation of a new iPhone next year, which is expected to offer a new design and new features that are attractive enough to convince more replacement buyers,” Cozza says.     Print this page Tweet Related Worldwide device shipments to grow 1.5% Spending on tech devices forecast to drop Worldwide PC shipments decline Worldwide semi sales expected to reach $358-billion Have your say: Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The Taiwanese manufacturer has previously attempted to shoehorn dedicated Nvidia graphics into a NUC-like form factor with reasonable success, and there's obviously sufficient demand for such systems as Gigabyte is at it once again with a new offering that has grown taller to accommodate meatier innards. Dubbed the Brix Gaming UHD and priced at around £875 for a barebone unit, this is the largest Brix system we've ever tested, yet also the most powerful. Measuring 220mm (H) x 110mm (D) x 110mm (W) in size, the machine's footprint remains tiny compared to traditional PCs, and the extra height has allowed Gigabyte to include a potent Intel Core i7 processor and dedicated Nvidia GeForce graphics. It's a neat-looking thing, too. The brushed aluminium effect around the sides works well, the white LED surround on the lid is subtle enough not to be jarring, while a rubber base keeps everything planted. Connectivity options have been limited on previous Brix solutions, but with the extra available space, the Gaming UHD box makes available five USB ports (3x USB 3.0, 1x USB 3.1 Type-A, 1x USB 3.1 Type-C) as well as Gigabit Ethernet, audio jacks, HDMI, a trio of mini-DisplayPort and a connector for the 180W external power supply. An integrated Intel Wireless-AC 8260 adapter provides dual-band WiFi connectivity, and the only obvious snag with regards to connectivity is the positioning of the ports. The power button is tucked around back alongside all the USB ports, while the display outputs, on the side of the unit, look ungainly when cables are attached. We'd like to see Gigabyte relocate the power button and have at least one front-facing USB port on future models, but given the internal layout and size constraints, we can understand why the ports are where they are. Opening the Brix Gaming UHD is surprisingly simple, with the user having to undo just four screws on the underside to remove the fan cover. Doing so allows half of the system's metal shell to slide up and away. It's an important process as every buyer will need to make their way inside the machine at some point. Remember, this is a barebone unit, meaning memory, storage and operating system must be added in order for it to function. Gigabyte has done well to ensure accessibility isn't an issue, and getting everything up and running can be achieved with a minimal number of screws and very little effort. With the shroud removed, we can see two empty 2.5in slots positioned either side of the central column, and both can be populated using the combined data-plus-power SATA 6Gbps cables. What's clever is how the Brix Gaming UHD provides access to memory - unclip a few cables (three, to be precise) and the top board, housing the GPU, flips up and out. Would-be buyers should note that Gigabyte's installation tutorial video is easier to follow than the manual, though we suspect the target audience will have no trouble during the disassembly process. Get the graphics board out and you can reach the two SO-DIMM DDR4 memory slots as well as a pair of M.2 storage bays. Helping us along with our review, Gigabyte has pre-populated our sample with 16GB of dual-channel Crucial DDR4-2400 memory (out of a maximum of 32GB) and a 512GB Samsung 950 Pro SSD, but do note that these aren't included as standard with the retail product. How about the core components that are included? Well, the CPU is an Intel Core i7-6700HQ processor. Aimed primarily at high-end laptops, the quad-core chip offers hyper-threading and a 3.5GHz Turbo frequency in a 45W package that's well suited to a machine of this ilk. It's in the graphics department that the Brix Gaming UHD raises an eyebrow as the system is outfitted with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 950 served in an MXM form factor. Dating back to August 2015, the GTX 950 isn't what we'd hoped to see in an £875 barebone and unless a compatible MXM upgrade is made available, gaming performance in today's latest titles will be limited. And yes, Gigabyte's branding is playing fast and loose with what this box can achieve - the Brix Gaming UHD can output to a 4K display, but don't expect to play games at such lofty resolutions. The combination of CPU and GPU isn't befitting a modern gaming PC that is likely to end up costing over £1,000 when fully configured, but Gigabyte is only too aware and tells us that a Pascal-based (i.e. GTX 10-series) successor is already in the works. With that in mind, the current Brix Gaming UHD serves as a showcase as to what the form factor could achieve. The internal layout holds promise, with only one bottom-mounted fan pulling in air and pushing it up through the chassis and out the top. The obvious caveat is that fan noise is bothersome - the PC is clearly audible when idle, then even noisier when under load - and we wonder if a slightly roomier chassis with a larger, slow-spinning fan would make more sense. Intrigued to see how the literally pint-sized system will fare in our benchmarks? Then turn the page.

Ronald Reagan trailed Jimmy Carter by 15 points in February-March of 1980. Then Reagan came back and won in a 44 state landslide. One thing is for sure, the U.S. dollar is expected to weaken regardless of the final outcome, and for companies that thrive on a weaker greenback, 2017 could be a great year. We screened the Merrill Lynch database for stocks that were rated Buy, that also did a significant amount of their sales and business overseas. We found four that look very attractive, and could make good sense as we head to 2017. General Electric This iconic blue chip industrial was on a roll but has sold off 15% since July and is giving investors a nice entry point. General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) is a highly diversified, global industrial corporation. Its businesses are organized broadly under six segments: GE Capital, Energy Infrastructure, Aviation, Healthcare, Transportation and Home & Business Solutions. Its products and services include power generation equipment, aircraft engines, locomotives, medical equipment, appliances, commercial leasing and personal finance. Wall Street analysts feel that the American giant will be a large player in the efficient energy field. While the analysts recently lowered earnings expectations for the quarter slightly, they remain positive as expectations for orders and free cash flow already seem very low. They also note that the industrial giant has a massive $25 billion in cash, which could be put to use to drive earnings toward $2 a share by 2018. GE shareholders are paid a 3.16% dividend. The Merrill Lynch price target for the stock is $37, and the Wall Street consensus target is $33.13. The shares closed last Friday at $29.08. Intel This leader in semiconductors is working hard to scale away from dependence on personal computers. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) designs, manufactures and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide. The company’s platforms are used in various computing applications comprising notebooks, two-in-one systems, desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, wireless and wired connectivity products, wearables, retail devices and manufacturing devices, as well as for retail, transportation, industrial, buildings, home use and other market segments. The company also provides communication and connectivity offerings, such as baseband processors, radio frequency transceivers and power management integrated circuits, and tablet, phone and Internet of Things solutions, which include multimode 4G LTE modems, Bluetooth technology and GPS receivers, software solutions and interoperability tests, as well as home gateway and set-top box components. Intel reported an inline second quarter, but data center sales came in way below expectations. However, a new partnership with Microsoft for virtual reality, and a consistent shift away for reliance on chips for personal computers, keeps the stock a compelling buy. Intel does a stunning 82.4% of its sales overseas, the lion’s share of it in Asia, where the chips that it produces are used in personal computers, tablets and other personal electronic devices. Intel investors are paid a solid 2.73% dividend. The Merrill Lynch price target is $45, while the consensus target is lower at $40.38. The shares closed Friday at $38.10.

Photographer: Karam Al-Masri/AFP via Getty Images Before Ahmad Khan Rahami planted bombs in New York and New Jersey, he bought bomb-making materials on eBay, linked to jihad-related videos from his public social-media account and was looked into by law enforcement agents, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. If only the authorities had connected the dots. That challenge -- mining billions of bits of information and crunching the data to find crucial clues -- is behind a push by U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies to harness “big data” to predict crimes, terrorist acts and social upheaval before they happen. The market for such “predictive analytics” technology is estimated to reach $9.2 billion by 2020, up from $3 billion in 2015, according to research firm MarketsandMarkets. It’s the stuff of a science-fiction movie like “Minority Report,” in which Tom Cruise played a Washington cop who used technology to arrest people before they carried out crimes. It’s also a red flag for privacy advocates already fighting U.S. spy programs exposed by Edward Snowden and the FBI’s demands that Apple Inc. help it hack into encrypted mobile phones. The idea is to make sense of the vast and disparate streams of data from sources including social media, GPS devices, video feeds from street cameras and license-plate readers, travel and credit-card records and the news media, as well as government and propriety systems. ‘Fundamental Fuel’ "Data is going to be the fundamental fuel for national security in this century," William Roper, director of the Defense Department’s strategic capabilities office, said at a conference in Washington last month. For the first time, the White House released a strategic plan on Wednesday to advance research and development of artificial intelligence technology, including to predict incidents that may be dangerous to public safety. Weeks before Rahami allegedly carried out the attacks in September, he bought circuit boards, electric igniters and ball bearings -- all of which are known bomb-making materials, according to charging documents from the FBI. In previous years, he was flagged by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the FBI after he made trips to Pakistan and after his father told police he was a terrorist, before recanting the remark. Previous Story: FBI Check Found No Terrorist Ties in ’14 Law enforcement agents could have been tipped off that Rahami was moving toward an attack had all of those data points been culled together in one place, said Mark Testoni, chief executive officer and president of SAP National Security Services Inc., a U.S.-based subsidiary of German software company SAP SE. "This is a big data world now," said Testoni. He said his company has developed a computer platform for doing predictive analytics that is being used in a limited way by a Defense Department agency and by a national security agency. He declined to name the government customers or specify what they are doing. The technology to predict events is only in its infancy, Testoni said. National security and law enforcement agencies also have different rules when it comes to obtaining and using data, meaning there are walls between what can be accessed and shared, he said. U.S. law enforcement agencies, for example, need a court warrant to access most data. Big Brother Privacy advocates express concern about the “Big Brother” implications of such massive data-gathering, calling for more information and public debate about how predictive technology will be used. "There’s often very little transparency into what’s being brought into the systems or how it’s being crunched and used," said Rachel Levinson-Waldman, senior counsel to the National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law. "That also makes it very hard to go back and challenge information that might be incorrect." Computer algorithms also fail to understand the context of data, such as whether someone commenting on social media is joking or serious, Levinson-Waldman said. Testoni’s company and others such as Intel Corp. and PredPol Inc. are among a handful of firms pioneering the use of predictive analytics and artificial intelligence for clients from local police departments to U.S. national security agencies. More than 60 local police departments in the U.S. have started making use of a service sold by PredPol, which calls itself “The Predictive Policing Company,” to forecast where crimes might occur based on past patterns, said co-founder Jeff Brantingham. What, Where, When Its system, developed in collaboration with the Los Angeles Police Department, uses only three types of data: what type of crime occurred, when and where, Brantingham said. Then, a software algorithm generates the probability of crime occurring in different locations, presented as 500-foot-by-500-foot squares on a computer display or a printed map. With that insight, police departments then can make decisions about how best to apply their resources, such as sending cops to a high-risk area, or which security cameras to monitor, Brantingham said. PrePol’s system doesn’t make predictions about who will commit a crime, so it stops short of a system that might identify a terrorist in the making. "Interdicting places is, by and large, an approach that is more in line with protecting civil liberties than interdicting people," Brantingham said. Even with such limits, privacy and civil liberties groups oppose the use of predicting policing technology as a threat to the Constitution’s promises of equal protection and due process. ‘Fortune-Teller Policing’ "This is fortune-teller policing that uses deeply flawed and biased data and relies on vendors that shroud their products in secrecy," Wade Henderson, president and chief executive officer of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. "Instead of using predictive technology to correct dysfunctional law enforcement, departments are using these tools to supercharge discrimination and exacerbate the worst problems in our criminal justice system." eBay, Amazon Vast databases that companies have created for online commerce and communications could help law enforcement and national security agencies build predictive systems if they are allowed to tap into them. Technology companies have terms of service that set out how much personal information can be kept and sold to outside companies such as advertisers, and most resist handing over such data to the government unless a court orders them to do so.

Companies like Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. have access to over a billion social-media accounts. The storehouse of data on Americans will only grow with digital feeds from Internet-connected appliances and wearable devices. Social media, in particular, is a valuable tool in tracking potential terrorist attacks, said Eric Feinberg, founding member of the Global Intellectual Property Enforcement Center, which is a private company. His firm has patented technology that can scan for hashtags across different social media platforms and in different languages for communications that indicate terrorist planning. "Our software is about pattern analysis," Feinberg said. "We focus on the communications stream." ‘Open Source Indicators’ The U.S. government is working on initial efforts to gain insight into global social and political trends. A program under the intelligence community’s research arm called Mercury seeks to develop methods for continuous and automated analysis of intercepted electronic communications "in order to anticipate and/or detect political crises, disease outbreaks, terrorist activity and military actions," said Charles Carithers, spokesman for the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity. The agency also previously funded the Open Source Indicators program, which “developed methods for continuous, automated analysis of publicly available data in order to anticipate and/or detect significant societal events,” such as mass violence and riots, mass migrations, disease outbreaks and economic instability, Carithers said. CIA Forecasts The CIA draws a distinction between using technology to anticipate events, versus predict them. The agency is using sophisticated algorithms and advanced analytics, along with publicly available data, to forecast events. The initial coverage focuses on the Middle East and Latin America. "We have, in some instances, been able to improve our forecast to the point of being able to anticipate the development of social unrest and societal instability to within three to five days out," said Andrew Hallman, the agency’s deputy director for digital innovation. In its annual report in June, the Defense Science Board said, "Imagine if national leaders had sufficient time to act in emerging regional hot spots to safeguard U.S. interests using interpretation of massive data including social media and rapidly generate strategic options.” "Such a capability may soon be achievable," the board said. "Massive data sets are increasingly abundant and could contain predictive clues -- especially social media and open-source intelligence." Poindexter’s Legacy If U.S. intelligence agencies develop an advanced system to predict terrorist acts they might call it “Total Information Awareness.” Except that name has already been used, with unhappy results. Retired Admiral John Poindexter created the “Total Information Awareness” program for the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in 2002 to find and monitor terrorists and other national security threats using data and technology. The program became so controversial, especially over concerns that privacy rights would be violated, that Congress canceled funding for Poindexter’s office in 2003. Having been there and done that, Poindexter now says predicting terrorism is possible but would require a lot of data, such as banking information, analysis of social media, travel records and classified material. The system also has to include strong privacy protections that the public can review, said Poindexter, who said he was working on such a "privacy protection application" when his program was canceled. "You have to develop public trust in the way this is going to work," said Poindexter, who continued developing the technology after leaving government through Saffron Technology Inc., a cognitive computing company that Intel bought in 2015 for an undisclosed price. Intel declined to comment. "The government’s priorities should be to solve the privacy issue and start ingesting massive amounts of data into memory bases," Poindexter said. "You have to get the public on board with the idea that we can collect and search information on terrorist planning that doesn’t have an adverse impact on innocent people."

Jetzt gibts Kaby Lake und 4K für Rechner und Monitore. von Frank Rößler 13. Oktober 2016 06:00 Zwei Notebooks, ein All-in-One-Gerät und ein Monitor sollen denjenigen den Mund wässrig machen, die sich zum Jahresende ein bisschen mit schicker IT belohnen wollen. HP Spectre x360, HP Envy 13, HP Envy AIO 27 und HP Envy Display heißt das Quartett, das jetzt vorgestellt wurde und das in den kommenden Wochen nach und nach auf den Markt kommen wird. Start ist das Spectre x360 13, das mit den Kaby-Lake-Prozessoren Core i5-7200 und Core i7-7500U auf den Markt kommen soll. Es soll mit bis zu 16 Gigabyte RAM und einer bis ein Terabyte großen M.2-SSD erhältlich sein, die dank NVMe-Anschluss nicht viel Platz einnehmen. Das 13-Zoll-Notebook mit Full-HD-Touchscreen soll lediglich knapp 1,4 Zentimeter dick und ca. 1,3 Kilo schwer sein. Der Screen mit extra schlankem Rahmen lässt sich komplett umklappen, sodass sich das Spectre vom Notebook in ein Tablet verwandeln lässt. Die Akkulaufzeit soll mit nun 15 Stunden etwa 20 Prozent über der des Vorgängers liegen. Als einzige Anschlüsse für Peripherie hat HP zwei USB-Typ-C-Buchsen vorgesehen, über die zusätzlich auch Thunderbolt-3- und DisplayPort-1.2-Verbindungen realisiert werden können. Das 21,8 x 30,6 x 1,38 cm große Gerät soll zu Preisen ab 1050 US-Dollar in den Handel kommen. Core-i5- und -i7-Prozessoren der Kaby-Lake-Generation bekommt auch das Envy 13 spendiert. Bei dem Notebook ohne Tablet-Ambitionen stehen Panels mit Auflösungen von 1920 x 1080, 2560 x 1440 und 3840 x 2160 Pixeln zur Auswahl - also Full-HD, QHD und UHD. Auch hier gibt es bis zu 16 Gigabyte RAM und bis zu ein Terabyte SSD-Speicherplatz. Gegenüber dem Vorgänger ist das neue Modell wohl etwas größer und schwerer geworden. Es soll jetzt 24,9 x 32,6 x 1,4 cm messen und etwa 1,4 Kilo auf die Waage bringen. Dafür soll das neue Envy 13 aber auch bis zu 14 Stunden lang laufen (statt nur 10 wie der Vorläufer). Es soll ab Ende Oktober zu Preisen ab 850 US-Dollar erhältlich sein. Noch mit Skylake-Prozessoren bestückt, aber trotzdem komplett neu gestaltet soll der Premium-All-in-One Envy AIO 27 auf Schreibtischen eine gute Figur machen. Vor allem ein schlankerer Sockel und ein QHD-Screen im Micro-Edge-Design sollen ein "leichteres" Erscheinungsbild bieten. Neben Core-i5- und Core-i7-CPUs der Skylake-Generation sollen bis zu 16 Gigabyte RAM sowie zwei Laufwerke - 256-GByte-SSD und 2-TByte-HDD - verbaut werden. Für die notwendige Grafikleistung kann Intel iGDU HD Graphics 620 bei Bedarf auf eine Nvidia GeForce GTX 850M mit vier Gigabyte RAM zugreifen. Neben einem USB-C-Anschluss stehen zwei HDMI-Ports. Der HP Envy All-in-One 27 soll noch im Laufe des Monats zu Preisen ab 1300 US-Dollar auf den Markt kommen. Das günstigste Angebot ist das HP Envy Display 27, das Anfang Dezember für knapp 500 Dollar zu kaufen sein soll. Der 27-Zöller mit IPS-Panel stellt Bilder mit 4K/60p dar und soll 99 Prozent des sRGB-Farbraums abdecken. Er kann über HDMI 1.4, HDMI 2.0, DisplayPort 1.2 und USB C beschickt werden und kann über die letztgenannte Schnittstelle auch die Stromversorgung für ein mobiles Gerät realisieren.

According to McAfee Most Sensational Celebrities 2016, a search for Sonakshi Sinha + Torrent results in a 21 per cent chance of connecting to a malicious website. Searches for the actress overall had a risk percentage of 11.11 per cent. The global study, published by Intel Security, explores how hackers use pop culture icons like Bollywood celebrities to generate risky search results, exposing fans to viruses and malware. The report found that Gen-Y stars including Sonakshi Sinha, Tiger Shroff, Arjun Kapoor, Shraddha Kapoor, Kriti Sanon and Alia Bhatt comprised 50 per cent of the top 10 list for 2016. Priyanka Chopra, who was the most sensational celebrity for 2015, is down to No 7 spot this year with 7.56 per cent risk percentage. "This years list saw major changes as younger (Gen-Y) movie celebrities are making their presence felt in the top 10 list," the report said. Farhan Akhtar ranked second in the list (racing from No 11 in 2015) with 9.56 per cent risk percentage, followed by Kareena Kapoor at No 3 (from No 10 last year) (8.67 per cent) and Tiger Shroff and Arjun Kapoor jointly at No 4 and 8.44 per cent risk. Shraddha Kapoor ranked at the fifth spot, down from No 2 in 2015. With the increasing penetration of broadband, consumers rely on internet to find more information like award and TV shows as well as movie premieres, album releases, celebrity breakups and more, leaving them vulnerable. "...hackers can take advantage of consumer interest around several facets of Bollywood cinema news and entice unsuspecting fans to visit sites loaded with malware that can steal passwords and personal information," it added. Venkat Krishnapur, head of R&D operations for Intel Securitys India Development Centre, said cybercriminals are increasingly targeting consumers who access information on-the-go, without considering the potential security risks online around celebrity interest. "We at Intel Security remain committed to creating a positive online experience by educating and protecting the Indian consumers," he added. The report said users must be aware of clicking on third party links and ensure they use web protection that notifies them of risky sites or links before they visit them. Also, they should be cautious when searching for torrent as this term appeared to be, by far, the riskiest search term. "Cybercriminals can use torrents to embed malware within authentic files making it difficult to determine if a file is safe. It?s best to avoid using torrents especially when there are so many legitimate streaming options available," the report said.  (With agency input) X From Our Network SOPOSTED This White Part On Your Nail Tells A Lot About Your Health.

HP’s Envy 13 laptop and Spectre x360 laptops will now be available with the seventh-generation Intel Core i5 or i7 processors, while its 27-inch Envy all-in-one PC comes with redesigned speakers and a thinner display. The HP Spectre x360 convertible laptop now comes with a micro-edge bezel design, which removes the large bezels from its previous iteration. The display retains the 13.3-inch screen size as well as the touchscreen feature, but the highest screen resolution available is at 1080p full HD. The new Spectre x360 is also thinner at 13.7 millimeters from 16 millimeters and now weighs 2.85 pound down from 3.17 pounds, according to PCWorld. The new HP Spectre x360 Photo: Engadget The new Spectre x360 also comes with two USB Type-C ports that come with Thunderbolt 3 support and a new webcam with 12 percent wider field of view plus an infrared sensor for Windows Hello. The convertible laptop can be configured to have up to 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of SSD storage, according to The Verge. One of the best things about this refresh is that it comes with a bigger battery which can now last up to 15 hours on a single charge. The battery can also be charged up to 90 percent in just 90 minutes. The new Spectre x360 will sell for a starting price of $1,159. The HP Envy 13, on the other hand, isn’t as slim as the Spectre x360, but it’s a bit more affordable with a starting price of $849. The new Envy 13 is configurable with up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. HP says that this model also has a battery that’s 28 percent larger than its predecessor, making it last up to 14 hours on a single charge. The one thing that the Envy 13 that’s better than the Spectre x360 is that consumers have the choice of getting a full HD 1080 display or a quad-HD 1440p display. The new HP Envy 13. Photo: Engadget Lastly, the new 27-inch HP Envy all-in-one comes with a quad HD IPS touchscreen. HP says that it will also be releasing a 4K version at a later date. HP has refreshed the AIO by also adding a new four-speaker system sound bar on its base, while the display itself is suspended from the base to give it a “floating” design.

All of the refreshed HP computers will be available to buy later this month. The new HP Envy 27-Inch AIO comes with a Bang & Olufsen sound bar on its base.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 13 October 2016 | MYT 9:00 AM HP's new PCs raise the spectre of competition Slimmed down: The HP Spectre x360 can be used as a tablet or a notebook and is now even thinner and lighter. — AFP Relaxnews Putting a premium on premium, HP has overhauled its flagship Envy and Spectre devices just in time for the US holiday season. The HP Spectre x360 was already an aesthetically pleasing convertible PC – i.e., it can be used as a tablet or a notebook – but now it's even thinner and lighter for stylish on-the-go productivity. The old model weighed 1.45kg. The new one is 11% lighter and the 13.3in display is now more or less border free. Yet, thanks to new Intel processors and a new battery pack, it should deliver 15 hours' use between charges. HP claims that you will be able to recharge it again to 90% within 90 minutes. The final premium touch is four integrated Bang & Olufsen-tuned speakers. After ages in the doldrums, PC sales are beginning to pick up, particularly in the US, a region where HP is the most popular computer brand (29.9% market share), according to the latest IDC data. "Industry efforts to update products to leverage new processors and operating systems, to deliver a better computing experience encompassing more mobile, secure, and faster systems, and to accelerate PC replacements have been critical," said Loren Loverde, IDC vice president, Worldwide PC Trackers & Forecasting. And much of the updating HP is doing with its premium range is around boosting performance and speed. The new HP Envy laptop has 14 hours' battery life.   For those that don't need a convertible, the new HP Envy laptop now offers 14 hours' battery life and the same fast charging tech found in the Spectre. Its 13.3in display for US$200 (RM840) less (US$849.99/RM3,565 versus US$1,049.99/RM4,405) can also be specified as full HD, Quad HD or full UHD and like the Spectre, the screen runs edge-to-edge. As for performance, there are latest gen core 5 and Core 7 Intel processors available, space for 16GB of RAM and for a 1TB solid state hard drive. It gets two rather than four speakers but they are also of the Bang & Olufsen-tuned variety. The HP Envy AIO 27 has low blue light mode to make binge watching easier.   The final PC to get a makeover is the HP Envy AIO 27. It will cost from US$1,299.99 (RM5,455) but will boast a thinner 27in QHD display designed to reflect how consumers really use computers at home. It has a low blue light mode so that after an evening's binge watching, owners' eyes shouldn't be so sore that they can't sleep. And for the same reason the PC's base includes a four-speaker Bang & Olufsen-tuned soundbar. "We are strengthening our leadership in premium with our redesigned PC portfolio to deliver big power in thin and light designs to be even more portable and revolutionize our all-in-one to bring amazing sound into the home," said Kevin Frost, VP and general manager, consumer personal systems, HP Inc. —  AFP Relaxnews You May Be Interested Closure of 106 bank branches due to rationalisation plans, says Deputy Finance Minister Weak ringgit to impact 5 sectors Best smartphones for the holidays Alibaba's founder to support 'mini Jack Ma' until university graduation Private-public partnerships in a connected world Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Second half brilliance lifts Brazil over plucky Peru Philippines' Duterte says trusts Trump to be fair on immigration MRT fare starts at RM1 advertisement Latest News Photo Kit: Taking better photos of your pets (and kids) Make perfect copies of old photos with PhotoScan US trade panel eyes Qualcomm patent complaint against Chinese firms Google commits to post-Brexit UK with major London investment GE acquires two artificial intelligence startups Most Viewed in Tech GE acquires two artificial intelligence startups Best smartphones for the holidays Singapore to launch blockchain project for interbank payments Photo Kit: Taking better photos of your pets (and kids) Google commits to post-Brexit UK with major London investment Warning!

Researchers at the Cleveland Clinic's Heart and Vascular Institute tested four different wrist-worn heart rate monitors. "All worked pretty well at rest," said Dr. Marc Gillinov, the Cleveland Clinic cardiac surgeon who led the experiment. "But as people exercised, the accuracy diminished." None of the four devices achieved the accuracy of a chest strap monitor. In treadmill tests, the Apple Watch and Mio Fuse were the most accurate. The other two devices fell short: Basis Peak, which is no longer being manufactured, overestimated heart rate during moderate exercise, and Fitbit Charge HR underestimated heart rate during more vigorous exercise, the study found. Intel Corp. issued a safety recall last summer due to incidents of the Basis Peak overheating, causing burns or blisters on the skin. Intel and its Basis Science Inc. unit urge people to stop using the device and return it for a full refund. In a statement, Fitbit defended its "PurePulse" technology, saying it performs to industry standards for wrist-based optical heart rate monitors, with an average absolute error of less than 6 beats per minute (bpm) and an average error of less than 6 percent. "Fitbit devices were tested against properly calibrated industry devices like an EKG chest strap across the most popular activities performed worldwide, including walking, running, biking, elliptical and more," the company said. For Fitbit, the findings follow other disappointing reports on its products. Earlier this month, a report in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology found that fitness trackers, including one marketed by Fitbit, fail to boost activity levels enough to improve health. Fitbit said its trackers "are not intended to be medical devices." But, the Cleveland Clinic team noted that cardiac patients increasingly rely on wrist-worn monitors to gauge heart rate during rehabilitation and exercise. These watch-like devices retail from roughly $70 to several hundred dollars, based on prices quoted online. Dr. Mitesh Patel is an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia. He studies the impact of technology-based interventions on behavior but was not involved in the new analysis. Continued Despite growing interest in so-called wearables to measure heart rate, there has not been much evaluation of their accuracy, he noted. "For the general consumer, wearable devices may still be able to give them a general sense of their heart rate trends," Patel said. "However, further study is needed to determine which devices are more reliable for use in clinical care." An adult's average resting heart rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute; maximum heart rate is about 220 bpm minus the person's age, according to the American Heart Association. An electrocardiogram records the heart's electrical activity. It's the "gold standard" for measuring heart rate, Gillinov said. A chest strap, which also monitors electrical activity, is just as accurate, he added. Wrist-worn heart monitors use optical sensing technology to detect heart rate. They emit LED light to measure blood flow in and out of tissue, and a sensor picks up that data and converts it into heart rate readings using proprietary algorithms, Gillinov explained. In the study, published online Oct. 12 in the journal JAMA Cardiology, the Cleveland Clinic team recruited 50 healthy men and women, with an average age of 37. Participants wore a Polar H7 chest-strap monitor and were randomly assigned to wear two different wrist-worn monitors during 3-minute intervals of exercise on a treadmill. Heart rate readings were recorded when participants were at rest and at the 3-minute mark of each exercise. Participants exercised at increasing levels of intensity, from 2 to 6 miles per hour (mph), with rests between each exercise. The researchers also measured people's heart rates at three points during their recovery. Compared with electrocardiogram, the optical heart rate monitors varied in accuracy, the investigators found. At 2 and 3 mph, median differences of roughly 9 and 7 bpm, respectively, were recorded between the Basis Peak. With Fitbit, researchers recorded median differences of approximately 7 and 6 bpm at 4 and 6 mph, respectively. "We're not being nitpicky because as people moved, we had readings that could be off by 30 and 40 bpm, so it's not a small difference," Gillinov said. Continued His advice? "If you're an elite athlete and you're using your heart rate to guide training, or you're a cardiac patient who's been given specific heart rate targets or ranges, use a chest strap," he advised.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Eurocom updates Sky MX5 R2 laptop with Pascal cards by Eric Frederiksen  4:53 PM on October 14, 2016 Looking at the Sky MX5 R2, one has to wonder if the designers at Eurocom understands what "laptop" means to most people. They're definitely stretching the definition. The company released the original Sky MX5 last fall with a Nvidia GTX 970M card and Intel's Core i7-6700HQ CPU on board. This revision adds Nvidia's 10-series graphics cards to keep the lineup fresh. The R2 revision updates little aside from the graphics card, which is now Nvidia's GTX 1070 with 8GB of GDDR5 VRAM. The GTX 1070 powers what looks to be the same 15.6" display, which is available either as a G-Sync-compatible 1920x1080 IPS panel or a 4K 3840x2160 screen with a 48Hz refresh rate. The system also sports an RGB LED backlit keyboard this time around. Despite packing the same-size battery as the previous model, the Sky MX5 R2 also promises about 60 percent more battery life over its predecessor. While the original MX5 weighed in at 5.51 pounds, its replacement adds a bit of bulk for a total weight of 5.72 lbs (or 2.6kg). The MX5 R2 is also about 10% thicker at 1.13" (2.9cm), while keeping the same 15.16" width and 10.66" depth (38.5 cm x 27.1 cm) of the original. The highly-configurable system is available starting at $1499 on Eurocom's site.

NEW YORK: US stocks opened higher on Friday as a trio of leading banks beat analyst third quarter earnings forecasts despite the tough low interest rate environment. The three -- Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup -- all saw net profits fall as low rates pared lending margins, but they beat forecasts from analysts, driving their shares higher in early trade. About 30 minutes into trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7 percent to 18,229.53. The broad-based S&P 500 added 0.6 percent at 2,146.22, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.7 percent to 5,251.99. Citigroup shares led the three reporting banks with a 2.5 percent gain, Wells Fargo rose 0.5 percent and JPMorgan 1.3 percent. Other banks yet to report for the quarter rode the wave higher: Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley both jumped more than 3 percent while Bank of America rose 2.2 percent. Also helping the market were fresh economic indicators pointing to a resilient economy; both retail sales and producer prices picked up in September. Underpinning that was a jump in key consumer and producer price indexes in China, with the producer price index showing the first year-on-year gain in almost five years. Among other stocks, two partially China plays. Intel gained 1.6 percent and Caterpillar 1.4 percent. Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices surged 7.5 percent, helped by a trading upgrade from Credit Suisse. US retail sales rose in September after a decline in August, turning the corner after a summer in which consumers had shown a slackening appetite, according to the Commerce Department. Advance estimates for the month were $459.8 billion, representing an increase of 0.6 percent over August and 2.7 percent over the same month last year. The result matched analyst expectations. Sales were down for the month in department stores, electronics and appliance retailers. Spending rose on furniture, building materials, and gasoline. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said that on closer inspection the results were cause for concern. "A rebound in US retail sales in September masks worrying signs of a slacking-off in the underlying trend in consumer spending to the worst for over three years, suggesting the economy is struggling to pull out of the malaise seen in the first half of the year," he wrote in a client note. "The September upturn leaves total sales 0.7 percent higher in the third quarter, less than half of the 1.5 percent expansion seen in the second quarter."  Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus E-Paper Aaj Kal Sunday Magazine Facebook Daily Times Instagram Twitter Tweets by @DailyTimes_DT SoundCloud sunday magazine aaj kal Business Plus TGIF Zaiqa TV Company Financials Contact us Privacy Policy TERMS AND CONDITIONS © 2016 Dailytimes - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Powered By opustech.co

"I stay focused, since this is when the fundamentals really come to the fore and direct the overall direction of the market," the "Mad Money" host said. With this in mind, Cramer outlined the stocks and events on his radar next week: Monday: Fed's Stanley Fischer Speaks, Bank of America, IBM, Netflix Fed's vice chairman Fischer: As Fischer has been a proponent for a rate hike in the past, every time he opens his mouth the market gets hit. Cramer will be prepared for Fischer's speech on Monday to take stocks down. Bank of America: Even though the stock is cheap, Cramer worries that the company may have gotten ahead of itself, thanks to the earnings of JPMorgan and Citigroup. Netflix: At this point, the expectations for Netflix are so low Cramer thinks it may be able to beat them. "Longer-term I remain a believer in Netflix, but I accept there can be hiccups along the way," Cramer said. Tuesday: Domino's, Goldman Sachs, Johnson & Johnson, Intel Domino's: Cramer expects the company to deliver, but he is concerned that it might not rally too much on a good number because it has had such a run going into earnings. Goldman Sachs: With trading and corporate finance right in Goldman's sweet spot, Cramer sees the value in Goldman. If the Fed ultimately decides to raise rates, this could unlock further value, too. Wednesday: Abbott Laboratories, Morgan Stanley, American Express, Lam Research Abbott: The company is in the process of closing its acquisition with St. Jude Medical, a move Cramer interpreted as meaning it is planning to dominate the medical space. He expects the company to have good things to say. Lam Research: Lam attempted to merge with KLA-Tencor, but the deal was blocked by the government. Cramer is interested to see how Samsung's woes will affect the company, given that Samsung is the largest buyer of semiconductor equipment. "It's a fabulous company, but I do worry that Samsung will have to cut back on orders," Cramer said. Thursday: American Airlines, Illinois Tool Works, Walgreens, Verizon, Microsoft, Schlumberger American Airlines: This stock could continue to rally if the company pledges not to expand its fleet to add capacity. Cramer will be watching. Microsoft: As margin expansion is a possibility, Cramer wants to know how much of the business is based on the cloud now that it has purchased LinkedIn. The more investors learn about it, the more they may want to buy the stock. Schlumberger: Cramer expects Schlumberger to provide clarity on how real the recent oil rally to $50 is. He wants to know if it is bullish long term. If so, oil could break out, otherwise the inverse could occur. Friday: McDonald's, General Electric, Honeywell McDonald's: "We know that McDonald's has become a 'what have you done for me lately' stock, and the answer is not very much," Cramer said. Even with these challenges, Cramer sticks by the stock because of its strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. General Electric: With both the aerospace and the oil and gas businesses challenged lately, Cramer hopes GE decides to focus more on returning capital, and less on the weaknesses of those businesses. Unfortunately, he would not be surprised if GE's forecast causes analysts to cut numbers. He's in it for the long term, though. Questions for Cramer?

While smartphones technically fall into this category, I’m more referring to tiny PCs like Intel’s Compute Stick or the Kangaroo Plus from InFocus. One of the problems with such computers is that you need to also carry around input devices like a keyboard and mouse (assuming there aren’t any where you plan to use the system). This shortcoming has led to some creative experimentation among device manufacturers. Acooo’s oneBoard PRO+ is a perfect example. Stuffed into an otherwise unassuming mechanical keyboard is a quad-core Android PC. It’s a clever concept but what if you’re extremely pressed for real estate? That’s where something like the Vensmile K8 mini PC comes into play. As Liliputing notes, the device hardly looks any different than the flexible, rubber-style keyboards that have been available for years. But upon closer inspection, you’ll see that there’s a solid section on the right that serves as a touchpad. The dual-purpose touchpad is also the chassis for a tiny desktop computer consisting of a quad-core Intel Atom x5-Z8300 (Cherry Trail) processor clocked at 1.44GHz (Burst to 1.84GHz), 4GB of DDR3 RAM and 64GB of eMMC flash memory. You also get dual-band Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 as well as HDMI out, VGA out, a USB 3.0 port, a USB 2.0 port, an expansion card slot and a 3.5mm headphone jack – all running Windows 10 Home. GeekBuying is now accepting pre-orders with plans to ship later this month. Expect to pay $199.99 or the opportunity.

Banks and technology companies traded higher, while stocks that pay large dividends fell thanks to a jump in bond yields. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments Stocks were on track for large gains early in the day as reports showed consumers in both the US and China appeared to be spending more. Banks rose after JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup disclosed solid quarterly results. But the gains faded as the day wore on. Drug company stocks continued to fall and energy companies slipped. "The retail sales numbers on the surface looked pretty good but when you dig into them they were not that great," said Mike Baele, managing director at US Bank's Private Client Reserve. "It seems like every good report we get, we get an offsetting weaker report." The Dow Jones industrial average, which had jumped as much as 162 points in the morning, finished up 39.44 points, or 0.2 % , at 18,138.38. The Standard & Poor's 500 inched up 0.43 points to 2,132.98. The Nasdaq composite gained 0.83 points to 5,214.16. Goldman Sachs was responsible for most of the Dow's gains. It rose 3.10 dollars, or 1.9 % , to 170.52 dollars after the High Court in London threw out a one billion dollar lawsuit against the company. Libya's sovereign wealth fund had accused Goldman Sachs of duping the fund into making risky deals. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.80 % from 1.75 % . Higher bond yields also help banks because they lead to higher interest rates on loans, and that allows banks to make bigger profits from lending. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup reported results were better than investors expected. The reports may have raised investor hopes for companies that will report their results next week, like Morgan Stanley, Charles Schwab, and BlackRock. "It was a good kickoff to earnings season" for banks, said Baele. "It was actually some decent revenue as well with both investment banking and trading." Rising bond yields attracted investors' attention, and they sold utilities, real estate investment trusts, and other stocks that pay large dividends as a result. Those payments are more appealing to investors seeking income when bond yields are low. PG&E Corp. fell 57 cents to 59.80 dollars and Duke Energy slid 73 cents to 77.21 dollars. The Commerce Department said retail sales bounced back in September as spending on restaurants, cars and gas improved. The agency also said business stockpiles and sales grew in August, which is a sign that economic growth could get stronger. Reports suggested consumers in China are starting to spend more, which helped technology companies recover some of Thursday's losses. Microsoft climbed 50 cents to 57.42 dollars while Intel rose 48 cents, or 1.3 % , to 37.45 dollars and Apple picked up 68 cents to 117.66 dollars. Computer and printer maker HP said it will cut between 3,000 and 4,000 jobs over the next three years as demand for those products continues to fall. HP stock lost 67 cents, or 4.4 % , to 14.48 dollars. Twitter fell 91 cents, or 5.1 % , to 16.88 dollars after Salesforce.com told the Financial Times it is not interested in buying the company. Twitter has lost 32 % of its value since October 5 on reports that potential buyers were not going to make offers. Salesforce investors were not enthusiastic about the potential offer, and its stock jumped 3.64 dollars, or 5.2 % , to 74.27 dollars. Health care stocks, which are by far the worst-performing industry on the S&P 500 this year, continued to slip.

The listing comes less than a month after he was arrested on charges he attacked a man and his elderly father. He was cut by the team shortly thereafter. Listed on Oct. 10, the home is already in pending status. It has four bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms and sits on a 4,100-square-foot lot in the city's Rivermark neighborhood. The neighborhood is near the headquarters of major Silicon Valley employers such as Cisco, Intel, and Nvidia. It's also less than 2 miles away from Levi's Stadium, home of the 49ers. Built in 2003, the two-story, Contemporary Spanish -- style home features hardwood flooring, new carpeting, and custom paint. The living room has a surround-sound speaker system, a gas fireplace, and light-filtering window shades. The master bedroom has a walk-in closet and a master bathroom with dual sinks, marble flooring, and a frameless shower. The kitchen includes granite countertops, white cabinets, stainless-steel appliances, and an island. Miller bought the home in mid-2014 for $1.4 million. Miller, 29, was drafted in 2011 by the 49ers for a fullback position. He recorded 62 rushing yards on 28 carries and 734 receiving yards on 76 catches, for a total of four career touchdowns. He was set to switch positions and become a tight end in 2016, under new head coach Chip Kelly. Miller was arrested in early September on multiple counts of assault and battery, after he allegedly tried to barge into an elderly couple's hotel room in San Francisco and got in a fight with a 70-year-old man and his son, who was staying next door. The team released him from his contract later that day. In 2015, Miller pleaded no contest to charges he pushed his then-girlfriend into a wall and smashed her cellphone.

Previously, 10G networks – offering data transfer speeds up to 10 gigabits per second – have been the domain of the enterprise. Despite the 10GBASE-T standard emerging back in 2006, the price of compatible switches and adapters meant that anyone seeking to upgrade their Gigabit kit would be facing at least a $2000 bill. However, affordable 10G kit is now trickling down into the consumer realm. It’s still an investment – make no mistake – but we’re now at the point that gamers and data hoarders considering a networking refresh should take a serious look at 10G. If you’re in that group, here’s a rundown of ten excellent prospects to get your 10G network up and running. 1. ASUS XG-U2008 10G Network Switch With the cheapest business-class network switch weighing in around $800, connecting PCs, NAS devices and storage servers to a 10G network is an expensive business. Until now. The ASUS XG-U2008 10G network switch is priced for prosumers at just $249. At that price, there are compromises for sure – the device is unmanaged (so is plug and play, without any fancy network management features) and offers just two 10G ports alongside a further eight that run at Gigabit speeds. With the cheapest business-class network switch weighing in around $800, connecting PCs, NAS devices and storage servers to a 10G network is an expensive business. Until now. The ASUS XG-U2008 10G network switch is priced for prosumers at just $249. At that price, there are compromises for sure – the device is unmanaged (so is plug and play, without any fancy network management features) and offers just two 10G ports alongside a further eight that run at Gigabit speeds.   Handily, the switch automatically configures each port depending on the device connected and the twin 10G ports include LED indicators that tells you what speed the connected cable supports. An optional 10″ rack mount kit allows you to co-locate the switch in an AV or server cabinet. At $249, the ASUS XG-U2008 offers incredible value, ensuring 10G networking is a realistic prospect for consumers. 2. NETGEAR ProSAFE 8-Port 10-Gigabit Ethernet Smart Managed Switch (XS708T-100NES) If two ports aren’t going to cut it in your home network, then you’ll need to invest in a higher end switch that will offer 8 ports. The NETGEAR ProSAFE 8-Port 10-Gigabit Ethernet Smart Managed Switch (XS708T-100NES) is possibly your best option, priced at $949.99 (now you see why that ASUS switch is such good value). Alongside those 8 10G ports, you’ll also benefit from a swathe of business-class features that you’ll find on managed switches. They include VLAN, QoS, IGMP and MLD snooping, IPv4 & IPv6 Static Routing, Link Aggregation and ACLs that allow you to segment and secure your network.Alongside those 8 10G ports, you’ll also benefit from a swathe of business-class features that you’ll find on managed switches. They include VLAN, QoS, IGMP and MLD snooping, IPv4 & IPv6 Static Routing, Link Aggregation and ACLs that allow you to segment and secure your network.   3. Startech Cat 6a Ethernet Cables Of course, laying out a 10G network isn’t just about network switches and PCIe adapters. You’re going to need to ensure your network cabling is also up to scratch and for most, that’ll mean replacing Cat 5e Ethernet cables with the faster Cat 6a standard. Cat 5e works really well for Gigabit speeds, but for anything faster, Cat 6a (or Cat 7, see below) is where it’s at.You may be aware that between Cat 5e and Cat 6a, there’s another standard – Cat 6. This will support 10G speeds but note that maximum speeds are only supported up to 55 meters. Cat 6a doubles data transmission bandwidth, from 250 to 500 MHz, meaning that you’ll be able to run cable up to 100 meters or so. They’re also usually shielded, so should perform well. On the flipside, you’ll find Cat 6a cables are a little more expensive than Cat 6 cables (a premium of around 20% or so) but I think they’re worth the investment unless you’re on a strict budget.You may well have a favourite cable manufacturer – I’ve picked out Startech as their kit is usually great quality and won’t break the bank. They offer Cat 6a cables in lengths of 0.3m (a foot) up to 10.7m (35 feet) in black, blue or grey. They’re snagless and shielded with a wire gauge of 25 AWG.No doubt, if you did around Amazon or eBay, you’ll find cheaper unbranded or generic options. Your mileage here, with regard to quality, may vary – be sure to go with a product that has a good amount of positive reviews. 4. Cable Matters Cat6a Ethernet Cable (100 foot reel) If you’re wiring up a whole house, or part of your house, then buying longer reels of Ethernet cable is going to be more cost efficient than using shorter, pre-made cables. Of course, that means you’ll have all of the fun of terminating the cable with wall plates and RJ-45 connectors (see below) but once you get the hang of it, terminating Ethernet cables is really straightforward. A quick search on Amazon finds this 100 foot reel of Cat 6a cable from Cable Matters that is reviewed really well. It’s priced at just $24.99 (at the time of writing) with a 200 foot reel priced at just $44.99. Again, the cable is shielded with a guage of 26 AWG. Need more? Well the same company offers a 1000 ft reel for $249.99. 5. AmazonBasics Cat 7 Cable While you’ll readily find Cat 7 cables available on the market today, you probably find that Cat 6a is more than sufficient to meet the needs and speeds of 10G networks. The Cat 7 “standard” is not officially recognised by the TIA/EIA but is designed with even stricter specifications for crosstalk and system noise, via enhanced cable shielding and other methods. As you’d expect, Cat 7 cables are pricier than Cat 6a but with minimal additional benefits in terms of speed or drop length. However, those wiring up a whole house for Ethernet may well be happy investing in the “best” cable available. Before splashing too much cash, however, you can check out the difference with Amazon’s reasonably cheap CAT 7 cables. They’re available in runs of 3 feet ($6.99) up to 25 feet ($16.99) which isn’t a lot to spend on an experiment. 6. Startech 10G PCIe Network Card (ST10000SPEX)You have your switch and your cables sorted out. You now need something to plug them into! Startech’s ST10000SPEX 10G Network Card adapter slots into a spare PCIe slot on your PC’s motherboard. Priced at $248.99 (at the time of writing) it’s certainly a good value option. It’s built on a Tehuti Networks controller, which may not please every network admin out there (I generally lean towards Intel chipsets, personally) but in terms of bang for the buck, it’s hard to complain. 7. Intel X540-T2 Converged Network Adapter If you’re a stickler for Intel chipsets driving the bits around your network, you’ll need to spend a fair amount more than the Startech model on the Intel X540-T2 Converged Network Adapter (or one of the OEM variants rocking the same chipset).   Expect at pay at least $400 or so for the adapter card from a mainstream vendor, or once again, if you dig around you can find marketplace vendors on eBay and Amazon selling OEM cards for much less – again be wary and check those seller reviews.The additional outlay will get you twin Ethernet ports – great for failover support and, reportedly, a little less latency than experienced with Realtek-powered cards. 8. QNAP TS-831X 8-Bay NAS One of the most useful tasks for a 10G network is moving data to or from a centralised storage device, such as a NAS. Higher-end NAS devices with 10G adapters are becoming increasingly common and the QNAP TS-831X is a great example.It’s an 8-bay NAS supporting 8 or 16 GB RAM ($899 or $999 respectively) and is powered by an ARM Cortex-A15 processor – not the highest spec CPU in the QNAP NAS range, but good enough.With a swathe of first and third-party apps available from QNAP’s app respository, the TS-831X makes for a fabulous prosumer or small business NAS. 9. ASUSTOR AS7008TNAS Those of the Synology NAS persuasion have a little less choice overall, with regard to 10G – options are available but, at the time of writing, they’re either due a replacement model or are very expensive. So, we turn to ASUSTOR’s AS7008T for competition with QNAP. This 8-bay NAS doesn’t ship with an integrated 10G adapter, but can be upgraded during installation (see below). Priced around $1400, it’s definitely not a budget model, but it’s powered by an Intel Core i3 CPU which provides plenty of horsepower for media transcoding and other advanced NAS features. 10. ASUSTOR 10 Gb Dual Port Network Expansion Card/QNAP 10G Network Cards Upgrading an ASUSTOR or QNAP NAS for 10G networking is very straightforward (as long as it’s a compatible model). ASUSTOR’s 10 Gb Dual Port Network Expansion Card is priced at $499 and provides twin 10G capable Ethernet sockets. It’s supported on a number of ASUSTOR NAS models, including the AS7008T / AS7010T / AS7009RD / AS7012RD / AS7009RDX and AS7012RDX.Over in the QNAP camp, the choice is even more comprehensive. QNAP offers a range of 10G networking accessories that start at just $138 for the single port 10 Gigabit SFP+ Network PCIe Expansion Card, up to $399 for the dual port variant.As always, be sure to check the manufacturer’s website to ensure the card you select is compatible with your NAS. As you can see, while 10G networking still requires somewhat of an investment to elevate your data transfer speeds to the next level, manufacturers are introducing an increasing amount of kit with prosumer-level performance and pricing to match. If you’re wiring up you home with Ethernet cables, it’s well worth ensuring that you select cabling that will future-proof your network. For media, photography and video enthusiasts and other creative types, the time is right to start thinking about at your next network upgrade. shares Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Reddit Email Subscribe Join the mailing list Sign up to our mailing list and you will receive the latest news, reviews and how to guides delivered directly to your inbox.

The new standard, called Open Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface (OpenCAPI), is an open forum to provide a high bandwidth, low latency open interface design specification. The open interface will help corporate and cloud data centres to speed up big data, machine learning, analytics and other emerging workloads. The consortium plans to make the OpenCAPI specification available to the public before the end of the year and expects servers and related products based on the new standard in the second half of 2017, it said in a statement. Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, is known to protect its server technologies and has chosen to sit out of the new consortium. In the past also, it had stayed away from prominent open standards technology groups such as CCIX and Gen-Z. “As artificial intelligence, machine learning and advanced analytics become the price of doing business in today’s digital era, huge volumes of data are now the norm,” Doug Balog, general manager for IBM Power, told Reuters. “It’s clear that today’s data centres can no longer rely on one company alone to drive innovation,” Balog said. Advanced Micro Devices, Dell EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co, Mellanox Technologies, Micron Technology, NVIDIA and Xilinx are also members of the OpenCAPI consortium.

In the past also, it had stayed away from prominent open standards technology groups such as CCIX and Gen-Z. “As artificial intelligence, machine learning and advanced analytics become the price of doing business in today’s digital era, huge volumes of data are now the norm,” Doug Balog, general manager for IBM Power, told Reuters. “It’s clear that today’s data centres can no longer rely on one company alone to drive innovation,” Balog said. Advanced Micro Devices, Dell EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co, Mellanox Technologies, Micron Technology, NVIDIA and Xilinx are also members of the OpenCAPI consortium.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries ePaper Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive US stocks rise as banks and tech companies lead the way Friday Oct 14, 2016 at 2:21 PM Oct 14, 2016 at 2:21 PM Marley Jay The Associated Press NEW YORK — U.S. stocks are slightly higher Friday. Technology stocks are rising as investors were pleased with economic reports from the U.S. and China. Financial stocks are up after several major U.S. banks reported strong third-quarter results, while energy companies are down as the price of oil falls.  KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average rose 80 points, or 0.4 percent, to 18,179 as of 1:10 p.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 5 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,138. The Nasdaq composite edged up 11 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,224. The Dow was up as much as 162 points earlier. US ECONOMY HOPES: The Commerce Department said retail sales bounced back in September as spending on restaurants, cars and gas improved. The agency also said business stockpiles and sales grew in August, which is a sign that economic growth could get stronger.   FindTheCompany | Graphiq The Labor Department said producer prices rose in September as the cost of energy and food increased, but inflation appeared to remain limited. CHINA INFLATION: Reports suggested consumers in China are starting to spend more, while the national producer price index, which measures inflation, rose for the first time since 2012. That could result in factories in China starting to pass rising costs to their consumers. Stocks fell Thursday as a report on imports and exports caused investors to worry that China's economic is weakening. Some of the largest losses went to tech companies, as China is a major market for them. Microsoft climbed 50 cents to $57.43 while Intel rose 50 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $37.47 and Apple picked up 52 cents to $117.50. BANKS MAKE IT COUNT: JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup's results were better than investors expected. JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, set aside more money to cover loans that could go bad, but it reported a big gain in deposits and originated more mortgages. Citigroup reported better results from its consumer banking business. Their stocks did not move much, but the reports may have raised investor hopes for the banks that will report their results next week. Citigroup added 9 cents to $48.57. Elsewhere, Goldman Sachs gained $2.67, or 1.6 percent, to $170.09 and Morgan Stanley gained 32 cents, or 1 percent, to $32.06. DEPARTMENT STORE BLUES: While retail spending rose, the Commerce Department's report also showed that spending at department stores decreased in September as consumers continued to do more of their shopping online. Kohl's lost $1.42, or 3.1 percent, to $43.70 and Macy's fell $1.30, or 3.5 percent, to $35.50. BONDS: Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note edged up to 1.76 percent from 1.75 percent. Higher bond yields also help banks because they lead to higher interest rates on loans, which lets banks make bigger profits from lending. PRINTER JAM: Computer and printer maker HP said it will cut between 3,000 and 4,000 jobs over the next three years as demand for those products continues to fall. The company is trying to sell more high-end PCs, office printers and 3D printing systems as more people use smartphones and store documents and photos online. HP stock lost 48 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $14.67. INFOSYS IN TROBLE: Business consulting services company Infosys again cut its annual revenue projections after its second-quarter sales fell short of estimates. The stock shed 91 cents, or 5.5 percent, to $15.74. QUEASY: Health care stocks, which are by far the worst-performing industry on the S&P 500 this year, continued to slip. EpiPen maker Mylan lost $1.13, or 3 percent, to $36.75 and drug and generic ingredient maker Perrigo fell $1.76, or 2 percent, to $86.14. ENERGY: U.S. crude oil gave up 36 cents to $50.08 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 38 cents to $51.65 a barrel in London. That sent energy companies lower. EOG Resources sank 71 cents to $94.79 and Devon Energy declined 48 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $43.42. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 103.91 yen from 103.60 yen. The euro rose to $1.10995 from $1.1053. OVERSEAS: France's CAC 40 jumped 1.5 percent and Germany's DAX rose 1.6 percent. In Britain the FTSE 100 advanced 0.5 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.5 percent and South Korea's Kospi advanced 0.4 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.9 percent. Thailand's SET index climbed 4.7 percent in the second day of trading after the death of Thailand's king. The SET fell 4 percent in September as investors worried about the monarch's health and even with the rally Friday the index fell 1.8 percent this week.

Banks and technology companies traded higher, while stocks that pay large dividends fell thanks to a jump in bond yields. Stocks were on track for large gains early in the day as reports showed consumers in both the U.S. and China appeared to be spending more. Banks rose after JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup disclosed solid quarterly results. But the gains faded as the day wore on. Drug company stocks continued to fall and energy companies slipped. "The retail sales numbers on the surface looked pretty good but when you dig into them they were not that great," said Mike Baele, managing director at U.S. Bank's Private Client Reserve. "It seems like every good report we get, we get an offsetting weaker report." The Dow Jones industrial average, which had jumped as much as 162 points in the morning, finished up 39.44 points, or 0.2 percent, at 18,138.38. The Standard & Poor's 500 inched up 0.43 points to 2,132.98. The Nasdaq composite gained 0.83 points to 5,214.16. Goldman Sachs was responsible for most of the Dow's gains. It rose $3.10, or 1.9 percent, to $170.52 after Britain's High Court threw out a $1 billion lawsuit against the company. Libya's sovereign wealth fund had accused Goldman Sachs of duping the fund into making risky deals. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.80 percent from 1.75 percent. Higher bond yields also help banks because they lead to higher interest rates on loans, and that allows banks to make bigger profits from lending. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup reported results were better than investors expected. The reports may have raised investor hopes for companies that will report their results next week, like Morgan Stanley, Charles Schwab, and BlackRock. "It was a good kickoff to earnings season" for banks, said Baele. "It was actually some decent revenue as well with both investment banking and trading." Rising bond yields attracted investors' attention, and they sold utilities, real estate investment trusts, and other stocks that pay large dividends as a result. Those payments are more appealing to investors seeking income when bond yields are low. PG&E Corp. fell 57 cents to $59.80 and Duke Energy slid 73 cents to $77.21. The Commerce Department said retail sales bounced back in September as spending on restaurants, cars and gas improved. The agency also said business stockpiles and sales grew in August, which is a sign that economic growth could get stronger. Reports suggested consumers in China are starting to spend more, which helped technology companies recover some of Thursday's losses. Microsoft climbed 50 cents to $57.42 while Intel rose 48 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $37.45 and Apple picked up 68 cents to $117.66. While retail spending rose, the Commerce Department's report also showed that spending at department stores decreased in September as consumers continued to do more of their shopping online. Kohl's lost $1.44, or 3.2 percent, to $43.68 and Macy's fell $1.23, or 3.3 percent, to $35.57. Computer and printer maker HP said it will cut between 3,000 and 4,000 jobs over the next three years as demand for those products continues to fall. HP stock lost 67 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $14.48. Twitter fell 91 cents, or 5.1 percent, to $16.88 after Salesforce.com told the Financial Times it isn't interested in buying the company. Twitter has lost 32 percent of its value since October 5th on reports that potential buyers were not going to make offers. Salesforce investors were not enthusiastic about the potential offer, and its stock jumped $3.64, or 5.2 percent, to $74.27. U.S. crude oil gave up 9 cents to $50.35 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 8 cents to $51.95 a barrel in London. That sent energy companies lower. Health care stocks, which are by far the worst-performing industry on the S&P 500 this year, continued to slip. EpiPen maker Mylan lost $1.39, or 3.7 percent, and closed at a three-year low of $36.49. Cancer drug maker Celgene sank $2.13, or 2.1 percent, to $98.50. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline added 1 cent to $1.49 a gallon. Heating oil lost 1 cent to $1.57 a gallon. Natural gas slumped 6 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $3.29 per 1,000 cubic feet. The price of gold fell $2.10 to $1,255.50 an ounce. Silver lost 2 cents to $17.44 an ounce. Copper slipped 1 cent to $2.11 a pound. The dollar rose to 104.18 yen from 103.60 yen. The euro rose to $1.0983 from $1.1053. France's CAC 40 jumped 1.5 percent and Germany's DAX rose 1.6 percent. In Britain the FTSE 100 advanced 0.5 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.5 percent and South Korea's Kospi advanced 0.4 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.9 percent. Thailand's SET index climbed 4.7 percent in the second day of trading after the death of Thailand's king. The SET fell 4 percent in September as investors worried about the monarch's health and even with the rally Friday the index fell 1.8 percent this week. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The bottom image is a reflection on a glass surface. (REUTERS/Albert Gea) Apple’s MacBook line is in dire need of a refresh. But the update should satisfy the Mac faithful when it finally arrives. How dire has it become? "They should have done it a long time ago,” Ryan Smith, editor in chief of tech site Anandtech, told FoxNews.com in an email, referring to the MacBook Pro line. “Most models are full price yet years out of date, and that makes buying old models bad investments for consumers,” he added.   Which is what most product review sites have been telling readers for months. Laptopmag.com is just one example: “5 Reasons You'd Be a Fool to Buy a MacBook Now,” is the headline of an article that lists reason No.1 as: “The current MacBooks are extremely outdated.” Related: Is Samsung's loss a win for Apple and Google phones? Google takes aim at Apple and Samsung with Pixel phones iPhone 7 slammed as having 'worst' battery life compared to rivals The most decrepit of the aging MacBooks is the Pro line, which hasn’t seen a major redesign in almost five years. The tardiness of the updates is not just impacting consumers. “I'm hearing of developers considering abandoning the platform because it interferes with their [development] tools,” Roger Kay, president of Endpoint Technologies Associates, told FoxNews.com. MacBook Pro owners are particularly sensitive to performance, another area where Apple is falling behind. “A new MacBook Pro is very much needed to catch up on GPU [graphics processing unit] performance and efficiency,” Daniel Matte, an analyst at market research Canalys, told FoxNews.com. The 15-inch MacBook Pro needs a new Intel CPU chip too: it’s still saddled with an Intel processor that’s two generations behind the chipmaker’s newest “Kaby Lake” processors. When? The most pressing question is, of course, when will the new MacBooks arrive. "Production started in the second calendar quarter on refreshes of the 13.3-inch and 15.4-inch MacBook Pro [and] the 13.3-inch MacBook Air," Rhoda Alexander, director, tablet and notebook PCs at IHS Markit Technology, told FoxNews.com Alexander expects the new MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs to launch by the end of this month. That, however, doesn’t leave much time as we’re about halfway through October now. Lots of new features expected The refreshed MacBook Air line should include new USB-C connector technology (now found on the ultra-thin 12-inch MacBook), according to a report from Bloomberg in August. The redesigned MacBook Pro, meanwhile, will be thinner and have a flatter keyboard, Bloomberg said. The most widely cited (and speculated) MacBook Pro feature is a new-fangled, OLED display-based "dynamic" set of function keys that shows a virtual representation of the keys based on the task the user is doing. Other likely features for the MacBook Pros are the addition of USB-C ports and Touch ID fingerprint identity sensors, possibly next to the new function key display. Also, a new rumor – deemed “questionable” by MacRumors – cites a keyboard that uses an e-ink display underneath the keys that changes dynamically to fit the needs of the user. If the technology appears at all in MacBooks or in Mac keyboards it wouldn’t happen until later, possibly 2018. Questionable rumors aside, don’t hold your breath for Intel’s latest and greatest processor in the new MacBooks. "Given the timing of the start of production, inclusion of [Intel's] Kaby Lake chip appears unlikely," IHS Markit’s Alexander said, adding that it's possible that Apple opts for previous-generation Skylake chips. Canalys’ Daniel Matte adds that Apple is likely to include an option for AMD's latest "Polaris" graphics processors in the new MacBook Pros. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.  Advertisement Trending in Tech 1 Tech CEO who vowed to murder Donald Trump with a sniper rifle resigns 2 Microsoft rolls out Black Friday deals 3 Smartphone residue says a lot about you, including your secrets 4 US Navy denies software piracy in $596 million lawsuit 5 Secret software in some Android phones sent data to China, experts warn See all Trends Scitech Connect Subscribe to the daily Geek Sheet for the top science and technology stories.

The researchers said Europe can no longer ignore the growing threats of Islamist terror, as well as border security issues influenced by Europe's migrant crisis. © Photo: Pixabay 'Costly Affair': Europe 'Has No Money to Create Common Army'Western European nations are to increase their military investment by over 1 percent in 2016. That's according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), an influential global think tank researching political & military conflict, based in London. It marks a significant break from the past. EU member states spending on the military in 2015 totalled US$223 billion, almost 15 percent smaller than in 2007. The researchers point to the very public fallout in the wake of terrorist attacks such as the bombings and shootings in Paris last November and the Brussels airport bombing in March. European leaders like French President François Hollande faced angry accusations that he had not done enough to prevent the recurrence of such attacks. In the IISS report on military strategy and spending in Europe, the think tank noted that not since the Cold War, has European security become such a priority for European policy makers. "Across the continent, policymakers were in 2015 preoccupied with the uncomfortable reality that while the threats and risks to European security had increased during recent years, the means to address them had not recovered from the long cycle of defense cuts that began after the Cold War and accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis." © Photo: Pixabay More 'Lone Wolf' Attacks Likely in Europe Amid Intel Chaos - ExpertThe report added that the proliferation of Daesh, also known as IS/ISIL, and so-called "lone wolf" terror attacks has "brought conflict and a disregard for the established principles of peace and security back to a continent where it was thought that such issues were a feature of the past." "The Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) counts among its personnel many foreign fighters, thousands of whom hold Western passports. Returnees, now trained and experienced, constitute a terrorism threat to Europe." Another key dilemma influencing the recent increase in military and security spending, is Europe's ongoing migrant crisis. More than 1.5 million people arrived in Europe in 2015 alone, many being refugees fleeing death and persecution in conflict zones such as Iraq and Syria. "Continuing conflict in Africa and the Middle East has led to significant refugee flows, as countries in the region edge towards failure and collapse," the IISS report noted. Indeed, as Federica Mogherini, the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, argued in May 2015: "The security situation in the EU's direct neighborhood has deteriorated significantly: the concurrency, intensity, frequency and complexity of conflicts and crises in the neighborhood have increased'. Bastian Giegerich: Share guns and sovereignty — armaments cooperation in Europe https://t.co/EIaFn3iEg8 — Adam Ward (@AdamWardIISS) August 26, 2016​ 2016 has also brought the challenge of the UK's impending exit from the EU. Currently, the UK and France are Europe's only nuclear states. Without the UK, France will have to shoulder the burden of being the EU's only full-spectrum military power. The UK's exit also robs the bloc of its biggest-spending military force. Three months after the UK voted for Brexit, EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, indicated he wants to press ahead with proposals for an EU Army, supported by the defense ministers of Spain, Germany, Italy and France. However, it is deeply controversial to many members, including the UK. There are concerns an EU Army may undermine and take away resources from NATO, which the UK remains a member of. EU defense ministers are expected to hold talks on the defense plans in Brussels in November, before presenting a more detailed strategy to EU leaders at a summit in December. ...

Comments Computerworld | Oct 14, 2016 7:34 AM PT Like this article? thumbsup 0 thumbsdown RELATED TOPICS Windows PCs Windows 10 Windows 10 Comments Glitches, hiccups, drivers, software incompatibilities -- these are not the things you want to deal with when you fire up a gaming desktop. Your goal is to jump into the seat of a BMW 5 series or a Nissan GT-R and blast off over the sand dunes in the game Forza Horizon 3. You don’t want to deal with technical problems. Fortunately, in a test of several new Windows 10 games on an Acer Predator G1, none of the usual snafus happened, unless you count my ability to drive a GT-R on tight corners. The smaller form factor of the G1 -- which included a wheeled carrying case and Tom Clancy’s The Division on disc when it first came out this summer-- makes it easy to lug around. It’s about the size of an Xbox One. I only had to update the NVIDIA GTZ 1080 graphics card to the latest driver before testing out several new games. I used a Viewsonic 4K display, the included Acer mechanical keyboard and laser mouse, and my own set of Phiaton BT 220 NC wireless earbuds for pristine audio. The last time I tested 4K gaming, I had mixed results. Everything worked for the most part, but there was still the occasional stuttering problem, especially in Just Cause 3, and a slim selection of 4K games. That was back in May, and even this summer when the Predator G1 launched, there weren’t that many 4K options compared to the typical console games in HD. This month, I had my pick. I tried both Gears of War 4 and Forza Horizon 3 as my go-to games to test system performance. Smooth as butter. That was my main finding using the G1. In Horizon 3, the 4K resolution means you can see the thin lines of the rear window defogger on a Nissan GT-R and spot rain droplets on the windshield. On an Xbox One at 1080p, you can’t see the details as distinctly. I also noticed the shine from the car looked more pronounced in a way that convinces you that you’re really behind the wheel. In Gears of War 4, my first realization was that, even at 4K, the game was smoother than expected, especially in terms of the load times -- it was almost instant. Having all of this power -- an Intel Core i7-6700 processor, 32GB DDR4 of memory, plus a 512GB SSD and a 2TB 7200 RPM disk drive -- really helped. After a few levels, the blood-soaked behemoths never seemed to lag even when there was a massive cinematic death animation in full 4K glory. It's worth the investment in PC power. Next, I tested a few new games using the HTC Vive. Even the new Everest VR climbing game, which stresses the performance of many Windows desktops (even the higher-end models) never had any slowdowns, likely due to the GTX 1080 graphics card and the fast Intel processor. It looked and ran more convincingly. It's important to note here that, when I last tested 4K games and VR, there were slowdowns. Star Wars Battlefront in particular lagged a bit, like a super high-res photo on an iPad at times -- brilliant in color and clarity, not so much in speed. On the G1, a driving game like Forza in 4K is something to behold, a return to form for PC gaming. What’s really happening here? Obviously, the fast Intel CPU and the 32GB of RAM helps. The 1080 card from NVIDIA using the new Pascal architecture are dramatic improvements, up to 2x the performance from previous generation cards. More memory, more cores -- the 1080 card is the one you want for 4K gaming and virtual reality games. The Predator also offers some extra perks like Killer DoubleShot Pro, which dedicates the Ethernet port to gaming and allocates the Wi-Fi signal to other activities like web browsing or watching Twitch feeds. Really, it's the whole package working together to remove any performance glitches. I also liked having four USB ports on the back and one USB port on the front, which made it easier to connect an Xbox One controller. There’s also an SD Card reader for your camera files and an optical disc -- it’s for standard-def DVDs and games, not for Blu-Ray or 4K movies, which is a minor ding. I still tested a few YouTube streams in 4K and they looked smooth on my 200 Mbps connection. The G1 costs $2,300 which is a hair more than an Xbox One or a PlayStation 4 (ahem) but this is the top of the line in gaming. It’s a major plus that Microsoft now lets you play many newer Xbox games on Windows 10 for free (due to Xbox Play Anywhere) -- and it’s a simple download. The system worked perfectly for the HTC Vive as well, something you won’t be using on a lower-end laptop anytime soon. I’m impressed with the speed, the small size, and the design. It’s a Forza and GOW4 monster. This article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network. Want to Join?

Information and communications technology (ICT) have hailed in the fourth industrial revolution setting a new benchmark for business. However, this era of the Internet of Things (IoT) is also challenging and “disrupting” conventional government service delivery models. As Dr. Setumo Mohapi, chief executive officer of the South African Information Technology Agency (SITA), points out, the facilitation of increased contribution to government activities by citizenry providing multi-modal public-service delivery. “New and more efficient state models that are built upon on these technologies are being established worldwide, and South Africa is following suit with ample examples that set the scene for our ‘e-government’ of the future,” says Dr. Mohapi. Many of these, such as eHomeAffairs, will be presented at this year’s Government Technology Conference (GovTech) by high-ranking representatives of departments and organs of state, and will be a major highlight of the event at the Gallagher Convention Centre in Midrand, Gauteng, from 30 October to 02 November. SITA is proud to be partnering with a number of prominent players in the ICT industry all with the common aim of enabling service delivery through ICT for citizen empowerment. This year’s sponsors include Vodacom, MTN, Microsoft, Gijima, Accenture, Business Connexion, Huawei, Pinnacle, Intel and CEOS. This year’s conference theme is ICT for Development, Access and Growth, and the role that technologies play in meeting these three critical goals enshrined in the National Development Plan will be unpacked during the four tracks of the conference. The first track, Access, will delve into how ICTs are helping government bridge the digital divide so that citizens can enjoy improved basic services, especially healthcare. A sound example is the role ICT is playing in ensuring equitable access to affordable medicines via initiatives, such as the Open Medicine Project. Government is already adopting new technologies and integrating them across its departments and agencies, to enhance these amenities, including education, and the Development track of the event will complement this discussion. This “disruption” for the better is evident by digital classrooms and mobile education training that is being facilitated by ICT technologies, and drivers of new thinking around tutelage, which will be brought to during this track. The third track, Growth, has on its agenda “smart” procurement practices in an “e-government” environment, with the SITA’s own “smart” buying initiatives to serve as one of many examples of the streamlining of state functions by effectively deploying ICTs. GovTech 2016 will conclude with the important Innovation track, which Dr. Mohapi says will emphasise the “T” in ICT. It points to the future of public-service delivery “where governments will eventually provide services without owning any hard assets”, motivating his views on efficient “decentralised” government organs that have transformed into “one-stop-shops” for all matters relating to service delivery. Existing business models, such as Uber, are already stimulating such thinking, and further motivated by models like Bitcoin and Blockchain that bring a strong element of trust to the IoT.

The consortium plans to make the OpenCAPI specification available to the public before the end of the year and expects servers and related products based on the new standard in the second half of 2017, it said in a statement. Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, is known to protect its server technologies and has chosen to sit out of the new consortium. In the past also, it had stayed away from prominent open standards technology groups such as CCIX and Gen-Z. “As artificial intelligence, machine learning and advanced analytics become the price of doing business in today’s digital era, huge volumes of data are now the norm,” Doug Balog, general manager for IBM Power, told Reuters. “It’s clear that today’s datacenters can no longer rely on one company alone to drive innovation,” Balog said.

John Pike Science Date of Publication: 10.14.16. 10.14.16 Time of Publication: 10:12 am. 10:12 am Elon Musk Is Treating Mars Like It’s a Moore’s Law Problem. It’s Not Elon Musk speaking at the 67th International Astronautical Congress (IAC) in Guadalajara, Mexico, on Sept. 27, 2016. Susana Gonzalez/Bloomberg/Getty Images Hats off to Elon Musk. He gave us Paypal, Solar City, and Tesla Motors. If only some of his other, more ambitious ideas warranted the same praise. Take his latest plan, to shoot people off to Mars. Though details remain a bit confused, the key takeaway is tickets to Mars would sell for the modicum price of $200,000 apiece by 2024. Of course, Musk’s plan assumes someone is willing to front $10 billion or more to pay for all that gee-whiz rocketry and infrastructure he described at the International Astronautical Congress. (It also assumes $10 billion is enough, but more on that later.) When SpaceX debuted, Musk claimed his rockets would be 10 times cheaper, 10 times more reliable, and provide 10 times the flight rate of existing rockets—at least a 1,000-fold improvement that never came true. Musk’s ambitions seem to rely on that old Silicon Valley magical thinking, of an exponential growth curve predicting cheaper access to space. But he offers neither sufficient technology improvements nor evidence of demand to add up to a $200,000 trip to Mars. Musk is coming from a Moore’s Law world of computers and cars. Mars is not a Moore’s Law world. WIRED OPINION About John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, is an expert in space, defense, and intelligence policy, and is frequently called upon to testify in front of congress on these issues. Concerning technology, two types of problems exist: engineering problems that can be solved and physics problems that cannot be solved, only accepted and worked around. Solutions to engineering problems generally have a key performance parameter that embodies the essence of the solution. Take Moore’s Law. Around 1965, Intel co-founder Gordon Moore observed that overall processing power for computers—the number of transistors on an equal-cost CPU—would double every two years or so. Moore’s Law was born, with a pretty amazing S-curve with persistent exponential growth that is responsible for the technological vastness of the future. A Moore’s-like growth curve requires an infinitesimal number of intermediate steps of improvement. Each year’s CPU, airplane, or automobile is slightly better than last year’s. As economies of scale lower costs, the market expands. In contrast to computers and cars, technologies with which Musk is familiar, rockets cannot be systematically improved. Specific impulse—the number of pounds of thrust produced per pound of propellant—is the key parameter capable of producing significant cost reductions in access to space. Technological solutions to improving specific impulse include building lighter rockets or finding better fuels. And rocket scientists optimized both of those when Eisenhower was president. That leaves the physics problem: Mass versus gravity. The only way to work around it is through economies of scale, driving down operational costs through an increased launch tempo. The problem with economy of scale is it relies on demand. SpaceX’s current launch tempo owes a lot to commercial satellite launches. Information is space’s biggest market. Naively, one might have hoped that the growth in satellite communications would have increased demand, and thus launch tempo, driving down prices. But the capacity increase was, ironically, eaten up by Moore’s Law—which allows satellites to transmit more information. Communications satellites have not significantly increased the demand for mass to orbit. Crewed spaceflight, in order to incur demand without cost, must go from the Wright brothers to the Concorde with no intermediate steps. But putting people into the equation makes the continuous improvements harder to meet. There are a handful of “islands of stability”—discrete objectives for piloted missions—100 km hop for tourists, low Earth orbit, the Moon, and Mars. Similarly, there was an X-Prize for a 100-kilometer altitude flight, but none for 200 km. But the increments between those are huge, in terms of cost. No one remembers the first astronaut to go halfway to the Moon, because nobody cares what’s between the two. There was nothing between Neil Armstrong’s small step for a man and his giant leap for mankind. The very nature of space makes incremental steps moot. One of the fundamental problems with a grand visionary projects such as shooting people to Mars is they do nothing to solve the underlying problem of physics, laws of thermodynamics, and the most grand, visionary aspect of all: How to pay for them. Musk ignores the fact that NASA and others have outlined similar roadmaps to Mars for more than 50 years. He waves away the risks and technical limits of current technology to make it happen reliably, cheaply and safely, as if Moore’s law is easily applied. He shies away from discussing the infrastructure and work required to make it happen, letting others spell it out. Moore’s Law is a product of Silicon Valley, as is the tendency to misapply—with overreaching drama—it to various capital-P Problems. The September, 2013, issue of Time featured a cover story raising the tantalizing question “Can Google Solve Death?” And yet people are still turning up dead. Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, announced a $3 billion effort “to rid world of major diseases by end of century.” Contrast that with the National Institutes of Health’s annual budget of more than $30 billion (about 2.5 trillion through 2099), with no such promise of ending ailments for all. Musk estimates that it will cost $10 billion to reach Mars. Every time NASA has pondered manned missions to the planet, the price has been several times the $150 billion (more or less) spent on the Apollo program to the moon and back. Not every problem has convenient engineering solutions. Vision without funding is hallucination. Mars is not a how problem, it is a why problem. I grow weary of pretty pictures of rockets. Musk has done the easy part of sketching the obvious destination. The hard part is why—why pay for it? And that has been on hold for decades. Musk’s rocket blueprints put us no closer today than we were half a century ago. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Elon Musk John Pike Mars Moore's Law opinion SpaceX Skip Social.

The mobile operator said it is joining the 5G Automotive Association (5GAA) as the first network operator to participate. The group was formed in September by automakers Audi, BMW and Daimler and telecommunications equipment and IT companies Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Nokia and Qualcomm. The association aims to speed up the commercial availability of 5G mobile connectivity so it can help automakers reachh their eventual goal of putting driverless cars on the road sometime in the next decade. Autonomous vehicles need to be able to send and receive large amounts of data almost instantly, which is impossible with the current 4G or LTE standard. Vodafone said it is already providing connectivity to around 10 million cars built by 19 different carmakers. The 5G association needs broad acceptance of the new communication standard across all industries, as the so-called Internet of things takes shape. Said Dino Flore, director general of the automotive group: “Vodafone’s industrial leadership and its perspective as a network operator is an enrichment of 5GAA and will contribute to the successful development of a networked mobility ecosystem.” The 5G association, which is open to additional members, expects, among other things, to run joint projects that can result in integrated solutions and large-scale pilots and trial deployments.

Maintaining cover: A guide to business insurance Let's have a meeting in the echo chamber Download Current Issue The consolidation in the distribution world continues with Exertis snapping up storage and server specialist Hammer for £38.3m. Last month Tech Data moved to acquire Avnet Technology Solutions and the world of the two-tier channel continues to shrink with this latest development. The Exertis deal has to get the thumbs up from the European Commission because of Hammer's European footprint in France, Germany, Belgium, Sweden and the Netherlands. For its money Exertis gets a distributor with a strong pedigree in the storage and server market with a turnover of £155m last year and relationships with Dell, NetApp, Seagate, Intel and WD amongst others. Hammer also comes with a trading reseller base of around 1,000 and will continue as a standalone business after the deal closes by the end of the year. For Exertis this is not the first acquisition of a fellow distributor and in April it bought Siracom and last May it picked up Computers Unlimited for £24m. Niall Ennis, managing director of DCC Technology, said that Hammer had a strong reputation as a value added player and had developed a number of solutions aimed at vertical markets. "The acquisition has significant benefits for both companies increasing Exertis’ expertise and solutions in the storage market, complementary to our existing server and enterprise business, and providing Hammer customers and vendors with a platform for growth within a diverse and financially strong technology distribution company," he said. He added that it also gave Exertis the chance to expand its presence in those European countries where Hammer operated. In response, Hammer's managing director James Ward said that there would be opportunities for growth as a result of the acquisition. “By leveraging the complementary strengths of both companies we can only add value to what is an exciting proposition for all our stakeholders. We look forward to working with Exertis management teams and building on the success of both companies," he said. MicroScope+ Content Find more MicroScope+ content and other member only offers, here.

Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia, Intel, and Qualcomm created the 5G car club clique (AKA 5G Automotive Association) a couple of weeks ago, but someone forgot to put telcos on the invite list. That’s particularly funny, given it’ll be the telcos that actually deploy 5G – bit of an oversight that. So they took down the ‘no telcos allowed’ sign from the club house and opened the door for Vodafone to come skipping in. The telco says it’s bringing something extra to the gang, given it has already started testing cellular vehicle to everything connectivity – ‘C-V2X’. It also reckons it is the world leader **shudder** in IoT connectivity because it provides more connected car services for more models from more manufacturers in more countries than any other company. Bit of a brag, that. On top of this Vodafone also found the time to hold hands with Huawei over a lot of messing around with high and low frequency bands for dense urban city scenarios – claiming that to be in aid of 5G advancements. In keeping with any announcement of partnerships or trials and all that jazz, Huawei made a lot of claims about “firsts” and records and stuff like that. “The communication between vehicles, infrastructure and pedestrians using C-V2X will be fundamental to the creation of intelligent transport systems,” said Vodafone’s Group head of R&D and tech strategy, Luke Ibbetson. “The technology that the 5GAA develops can lead to major improvements in driving and road safety.” Huawei did, to be fair, claim some pretty hefty performance results from the field test, which used lots of technology cleverness like multi-user MIMO, Sparse Coding Multiple Access and Filtered-OFDM. Obviously you’d use MU-MIMO, SCMA and F-OFDM in a 5G trial, who wouldn’t? Anyway, Huawei says the trial managed a peak cell throughput of 18 Gbps under 200 MHz bandwidth in the sub-6 GHz band, while also achieving sub-millisecond latency.

Hunt Transport was one of the last holdouts. The Arkansas-based trucking company hadn’t gotten any reports of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, officials told shareholder activist Brianna Murphy. And after her firm, Trillium Asset Management, filed a resolution asking Hunt to adopt policies explicitly protecting LGBT workers from bias, the company’s board recommended voting against the proposal. It was unnecessary, the company said. At Hunt’s annual meeting in April, however, an unprecedented 54 percent of investors voted in favor of Murphy’s resolution. The company revised its policy this summer. Although it manages only about $2 billion, Boston-based Trillium is one of a handful of activist investors that punch way above their weight when it comes to pushing diversity. These activists have prodded some of the largest public companies in the world to add women and minorities to their boards, to disclose data about the race and gender of their workforces, and to protect LGBTQ employees. Trillium's Brianna Murphy   Arjuna Capital's Natasha Lamb   This year, these David-size firms zeroed in on some tech Goliaths to get them to close the gap between what men and women make. While only a small number of the diversity proposals go to a vote and even fewer pass, they put companies on notice that diversity matters. “This is not only a social justice issue, it’s a business issue,” says Natasha Lamb, director for equity research and shareholder engagement at Boston-based Arjuna Capital. “More diverse teams lead to better financial outcomes.” She says she targeted tech because of the “enormous gaps” between its numbers of men and women. Women make up only 25  percent of the tech workforce and hold just 11 percent of management positions, she says. Lamb filed resolutions this year at nine tech companies, including Apple and Intel. Pax World Management, which is based in Portsmouth, N.H., and oversees about $4 billion, also filed an Apple proposal. At Apple’s shareholders meeting in February, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said the company was paying women 99.6 percent of what it pays men in the U.S., and he added that it would take steps to address the remaining gap in its total compensation. In August, Apple announced it had closed it for U.S. employees.  EBay announced today that its study found the gender pay gap effectively closed, with women employees in the U.S. earning 99.8 percent of the total compensation of men.   Go to {ESG <GO>} to explore a selected company's environmental, social, and governance data. In all, seven of the nine companies agreed to make their pay gap public and take steps to close it. “I’d say that this was a pretty successful campaign,” says Heidi Welsh, executive director of the Sustainable Investments Institute, a Washington nonprofit that tracks socially responsible investing.  Small firms such as Arjuna, Pax, and Trillium wield so much clout because a growing number of investors care deeply about diversity. Filing a resolution doesn’t require a lot of assets. A shareholder needs to own only $2,000 of a company’s stock for a year to do so. In most cases, activists withdraw a proposal if a company agrees to discuss the subject. That was the case with Apple. “We’d much prefer to have a dialog,” says Heather Smith, lead sustainability research analyst at Pax. According to data from ISS Governance, proposals asking companies to share and close their gender pay gap rose to 13 this year from just one in 2015 and none before that. Eight were withdrawn after companies agreed to talk with activists. While pay proposals are relatively new, actions seeking more diversity on boards remained roughly steady at 30, reflecting the continued underrepresentation of women and minorities. Such proposals have an impact even if they don’t get majority support, according to research by Carol Marquardt, a professor of accountancy at Baruch College in New York, and Christine Wiedman at the University of Waterloo. They tracked proposals at 136 companies from 1997 to 2011 and found that targeted companies increased their female board representation from 3  percent to 8 percent on average in the two years following the proposal.     As they begin working on their agenda for the 2017 proxy season this fall, these crusaders for diversity say pay equity remains a main focus as it gains national attention. Massachusetts and California have passed legislation aimed at closing the gender pay gap. And President Obama in January proposed a rule that would require all companies to include salary data along with their annual filings with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) about the race and gender of their workforces. Arjuna’s Lamb says she’ll be looking at about eight companies in the coming year, including four of the big banks and two other financial services firms. Women in finance sometimes make up a majority of employees, but few hold top spots. Lamb has filed a resolution asking Starbucks to prepare a report on the company's policies and goals for reducing the gender pay gap and will also refile her proposals at Google and Facebook. Trillium’s Murphy is also looking at financial companies and plans to file resolutions at nine of them to get more disclosure of data on race, gender, and pay. She says she's filing resolutions at Aflac and Fifth Third Bancorp asking the companies to issue reports on workforce diversity. In addition, a Trillium proposal asks Visa to disclose its EEOC data and give details of its programs designed to boost diversity. Visa spokeswoman Connie Kim says the company has received the proposal and is evaluating it. Pax, too, is aiming to expand its pay equity campaign, and it’s petitioned the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to require all companies to disclose their pay data as material to performance. “Pay equity is no longer aspirational,” Lamb says. “It’s being implemented.”    Colby is a senior reporter at Bloomberg News in New York.   Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Ceres’ Veena Ramani offers some practical advice. Research has shown that corporate directors at most major U.S. companies are not engaging on environmental and social issues in a meaningful way. Image:Pixabay By Veena Ramani Friday 14 October 2016 Share this story Despite growing evidence that environmental and social issues affect corporate bottom lines, Ceres research has shown that corporate directors at most major U.S. companies are not engaging on these issues in ways that are effective and meaningful. While many of these companies have sustainability programs, only a few companies consider these issues to be “board relevant.” I’m not suggesting that every sustainability challenge merits board attention, but when an issue materially could affect corporate performance or value, it belongs on the table. Sustainability officers at companies have a key role to play in driving the understanding of what should rise to the top. When an issue materially could affect corporate performance or value, it belongs on the table. So how can sustainability officers do a better job of elevating relevant issues to their boards? Here are a few ideas based on my 10 years of work on integrating sustainability into corporate strategies and bottom-line performance. 1. Engage corporate secretaries Corporate secretaries act as intermediaries to corporate boards and work closely with the CEO and the board chair to decide when and how issues get on the board agenda. A key role of the corporate secretary is advising the board on how they can discharge their responsibilities towards shareholders, which is why the CS and investor relations departments work closely together. Sustainability officers could engage the CS and IR by demonstrating that the company’s ownership is starting to pay attention. In fact, companies such as EMC and Intel have explicit board sustainability oversight systems in part because of engagements with shareholders. We’ve seen record-breaking growth in investors caring about sustainability (PDF) writ large, as well as investors specifically focused on the role of the board for sustainability (PDF). Large institutional investors such as CalPERS, CalSTRS and State Street Global Advisors (PDF) even have set public expectations on how corporate boards should be elevating their focus on climate change. 2. Build on existing priorities Kathrin Winkler, former chief sustainability officer at EMC, said, “It is important to do one’s homework on how governance is structured at the board level.” That means understanding the board committees, including their composition and charters. It also means knowing what issues the committees are already focused on. Given time constraints on a board’s agenda, rather than trying to add a new item for the board to consider, consider how sustainability can be folded into a discussion the board is already focused on such as evaluating the business model and supply chain risks or workforce retention. For instance, investors are looking to engage with the boards of energy companies on climate-related issues given the major impacts on their business models from carbon-reducing regulations and other carbon-reducing trends. “ When an issue materially could affect corporate performance or value, it belongs on the table. 3. Make the business case Ceres recently updated its Ceres Roadmap for Sustainability to call on boards to integrate sustainability into discussions on strategy, risk and revenue. In fact, as my recent View from the Top report points out, risk and revenue are the most direct routes for getting the board to focus on a sustainability issue. Dan Henkle, senior VP of global sustainability at Gap, suggests that in some cases, sustainability officers can use “points of pain” to frame sustainability from the risk perspective and engage the board and the CS on how these risks can be mitigated. This also could be a way to translate sometimes theoretical ideas into practical impact. Whether and how sustainability should be elevated as a material issue is a subject of intense investor focus. “They need to touch and feel what you are talking about,” he noted. For instance, many companies recognize the need to conserve water for environmental reasons. But where water scarcity is linked to cotton production, the impacts become much more tangible to an apparel company. Partnering with colleagues from the business side in this process also can be helpful. For instance, Nike’s Board Sustainability Committee is jointly staffed by the company’s chief sustainability officer and chief operating officer. Executives often appear before the committee to discuss how sustainability and business strategies are aligned and how this is reflected in the work of the teams that they lead. 4. Don’t overreach As noted earlier, it all comes down to materiality. In View from the Top, we underline that rather than engaging boards on sustainability writ large, it is most effective to get them to focus on specific environmental and social issues that materially could affect the company’s short and long term value. Most companies that publish sustainability reports have a process to determine material sustainability issues. But these efforts rarely inform board level discussions because they are not considered to meet pre-determined financial and regulatory thresholds. Whether and how sustainability should be elevated as a material issue is a subject of intense investor focus, with many investor groups, including Ceres, filing input to ratchet up the Securities and Exchange Commission’s attention to this issue. One way sustainability officers could bring these worlds together is to explore opportunities to emphasize the focus on “impact on corporate value” as a part of the materiality process. Given that sustainability officers typically lead the reporting function at companies, one tactical option is to advocate to have the board chair include a message in the sustainability reports. For instance, EMC systematically maps its material sustainability issues to the company’s major strategic themes, allowing for more integration into business priorities. The company also includes its board in materiality exercises, and revises key issues identified based on board feedback. Prudential Financial emphasizes the importance of getting material sustainability issues included in financial filings as a way to get sustainability issues in front of the board, which reviews such disclosures. Its annual financial proxy includes details (PDF) about the company’s environmental and sustainability efforts and features a board qualifications matrix that specifically pulls out board member expertise in sustainability and social responsibility. 5. Be more transparent Companies could do a much better job of telling the story of when their boards have been engaged in thoughtful oversight and decision making on key sustainability issues. Interest is growing in an initiative led by Harvard professor Robert Eccles calling for boards to release an annual Statement of Significant Audiences and Materiality, laying out whom the board considers to be a company’s primary stakeholders and corresponding matters that the company prioritizes. Given that sustainability officers typically lead the reporting function at companies, one tactical option is to advocate to have the board chair include a message in the sustainability reports. Many European companies routinely have their CEO and board chair sign off on the leadership message in these reports. The bottom line is that the sustainability officers have a big task in front of them in getting their boards on board — especially at U.S. companies — to focus on sustainability challenges with the urgency that these issues deserve. Companies such as EMC, Gap Inc., Nike and Prudential are showing strong leadership in elevating these issues and I hope more companies will learn from them.   Veena Ramani is a Senior Director in Ceres’ Corporate Programs. This post is republished from Corporate Citizenship.  Share this story Topics CSR Regions Global United States Tags governance reporting Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Advertisement Most popular Carbon & Climate Collect Earth: Google and FAO launch new forest tool Collect Earth: Google and FAO launch new forest tool Policy & Finance Trumped: Ten immediate impacts on energy and climate Trumped: Ten immediate impacts on energy and climate Transport Why the bottom of the pyramid needs electric cars...now Why the bottom of the pyramid needs electric cars...now View all news Industry Spotlight Policy & Finance Eaton: Innovating to stay ahead of the game Eaton: Innovating to stay ahead of the game Energy The European way to green energy in Southeast Asia The European way to green energy in Southeast Asia CSR Why sustainability standards are important for India’s growth Why sustainability standards are important for India’s growth View all Feature Series Smart homes for the future Future-proofing Asian cities the smart way Future-proofing Asian cities the smart way Powering Asia Pacific's Solar Revolution Conergy: Sparking the Philippines' solar power revolution Conergy: Sparking the Philippines' solar power revolution International Green Building Conference 2016 7 ideas for greener, healthier living 7 ideas for greener, healthier living View all Featured Events nov 22 Philippines ADB Green Business Forum for Asia and the Pacific 2016 nov 22 Singapore Responsible Business Forum on Sustainable Development 2016 nov 24 China WasteMET Asia 2016 nov 27 Israel Eilat-Eilot Renewable and Clean Energy 2016 nov 29 Thailand Solar Finance & Investment | Solar & Off-Grid Renewables Southeast Asia feb 21 United Kingdom Energy from Waste feb 22 Australia Australian Waste to Energy Forum 2017 Add an Event View all Subscribe Subscribe to our newsletters The best Eco-Business stories, jobs and events delivered to your inbox – daily or weekly.

NAND flash drought hits Texan monster – sources DCC Technology today confirmed its subsidiary, Exertis, has gobbled specialist storage and lesser known server distie Hammer for an undisclosed sum, which should help ease recent top line pressures. Hammer trades with “almost” 1,000 reseller, system integrator and cloud service provider punters, selling infrastructure gear from vendors including Dell, Intel, NetApp, Seagate and Western Digital. London Stock Exchange listed DCC Technology said it will use the buy to cross-sell the expanded portfolio of servers, storage, networking, security and UC kit to existing customers and the ones it is hoping to inherit. Niall Ennis, DCC Technology managing director, claimed Hammer had carved a niche in enterprise services and “bespoke” stuff for vertical markets. He said the buy fitted well with its relatively small existing server and enterprise lines and gave Hammer’s traders “a platform for growth with a diverse and financially strong technology distribution company”. The deal also widens DCC’s reach into mainland Europe, beefing up sales in France and the Benelux countries and giving it a foothold in Germany and Sweden. Hammer employs 165 staff and in the year ended 31 January 2016 it turned over £154.7m compared to £133m in the prior financial year. It reported operating profit of £6.9m versus £5.29m. By contrast, DCC Tech’s fiscal ’16 ended 31 March was less good; revenue dropped four per cent to £2.44bn caused by slumping tab and smartphone sales. Operating profit was squeezed, falling nearly 29 per cent due to Samsung cutting out distribution to sell direct to large retailers. The Hammer buy is subject to approval from the European Commission but completion is expected for the end of 2016. No channel press release would be complete without the use of the word “synergy” - this is the IT industry, one that is renowned for corporate bull shit - and Hammer boss James Ward shoe-horned it into a sentence. “We see great synergy and opportunities for our customers, vendors and employees in joining Exertis. By leveraging the complementary strengths... blah, blah, blah,” said Ward. In truth, for both vendors, resellers, SIs and CSPs, distributor consolidation means one less source of supply, credit, and less bartering power. But it’ll mean DCC shareholders will get to see the right kind of top line movement, while the duplication of personnel in some departments no doubts means that costs can be trimmed to improve profits. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 1 Comment More from The Register US giant Ingram Micro snaps up little Brit Comms-care Regulator mulls Ingram's acquisition by China's HNA 2 Comments Ingram Micro $6bn sale to Chinese logistics biz delayed Bumps on road ahead?

We’ve also seen all sorts of foldable, flexible, even rollable keyboards that maximize mobility. But a flexible keyboard that hides a computer? That’s definitely a first. And that is exactly what a company by the name of Vensmile is attempting to sell. Simply called the K8, the product packages productivity in a more portable form. Too bad it doesn’t have package a display with it as well. The idea of a PC you can slip into your pocket isn’t exactly new. From the Intel Compute Stick to the InFocus Kangaroo, there have been numerous attempts to deliver a portable computer that isn’t “just” a smartpone. The problem with all of these is that, while portable, they do require you to have a display, keyboard, and mouse wherever you connect. If there’s only a TV or monitor, you’re out of luck. Unless you happen to purchase this Vensmile K8, which is a PC, keyboard, and mouse combo in one. Yes, mouse, because that shiny surface on top of the box is actually a 10-point touch pad. That bulky box itself is, as you might have guessed, is the PC. But don’t judge it by its diminutive size. It actually packs an Intel Atom x5-Z8300, 4GB of RAM, and 64 GB of storage expandable up to 32 GB more. There’s HDMI out capable of 4K resolutions and even VGA out but only for 1080p. There’s one USB 2.0 port and another USB 3.0 slot. Of course, there’s Wi-Fi and Bluetooth inside as well. As for the keyboard, it’s actually the least interesting here. It’s flexible, foldable, and waterproof, pretty much like all of its kin. Which is to say, it’s not going to sell with keyboard lovers. Speaking of selling, the Vensmile K8 is currently on pre-order from Geekbuying, with shipping set later this month. At only $200, it might be a tempting backup computer to have. How it holds up in practice, however, is yet to be seen.

X DCC spends €42.5m on digital storage specialist Hammer UK-based server distribution business seen as complementing DCC’s Exertis unit Fri, Oct 14, 2016, 08:43 Updated: Fri, Oct 14, 2016, 08:49 Joe Brennan DCC chief executive Tommy Breen said Hammer’s expertise would better enable the company to take advantage of positive industry trends. Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons         DCC’s technology division has agreed to acquire UK-based Hammer, a specialist distributor of server and storage solutions, in a deal initially valued at £38.3 million (€42.5 million). Hammer, which employs 165 people, is a distributor for a number of suppliers, including Dell, Intel, and NetApp, to almost 1,000 resellers, cloud service providers and system integrators in the UK and much of western Europe. DCC said the business is complementary to its own unit Exertis’s existing server and storage business. Tommy Breen: the puppetmaster pulling the strings at DCC DCC chief Tommy Breen’s pay package falls slightly to €4.5m Weak sterling helps DCC as first-quarter profit soars “Hammer’s expertise will better enable us to take advantage of positive industry trends, including growth in cloud data centres and demand for big data analytics,” said DCC chief executive Tommy Breen. In the year to the end of January, Hammer earned an operating profit of £6.3 million on revenue of £155 million. DCC has agreed to pay the purchase price entirely in cash and is structured as an initial payment at completion, followed by earn-out payments over three years based on Hammer’s future trading results.       Topics: Tommy Breen DCC Dell Computer Exertis Hammer Intel Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Transport & Tourism Easyjet may apply for Irish licence to ensure EU access Personal Finance The bond rout and Irish pension savers: what you need to be aware of International Gordon D’Arcy: All Blacks will be bitter, Ireland must be better Business Sensors help police curb gang violence in Cape Town Sponsored World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ Ten things to consider when buying a new sofa ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Hines emerges as top bidder for student residence beside UCD 06:45 Bank of Ireland ‘will utilise any relaxation of mortgage rules’ 06:34 €700 per sq m rent for top D2 offices 06:30 Tourist industry urged to shift focus from UK to EU 06:08 London Briefing: Carney takes chance to get own back on MPs 06:06 ADVERTISEMENT Tech Tools Could sleep problems be a thing of the past with Sense?

The acquisition, should it be approved by the European Commission, will see the Basingstoke distributor acquire all of Hammer, who is based in the same area. Hammer specialises in distributing server and storage services, offering products from Dell and Intel, amongst many others, It will add more than £155 million to Exertis’ existing turnover of £3 billion. Exertis staff numbers will be boosted from 1,150 to 1,315, whilst reseller numbers will also increase by 1,000. The deal is expected for completion by the end of this year. Exertis claims the purchase will strengthen its current enterprise portfolio and enhance its range of products in the server and storage market. It would be Exertis’ second major acquisition in over a year. The firm had acquired IT specialist Computers Unlimited in May last year for £24 million, adding £140 million to its annual turnover. DCC Technology managing director Niall Ennis said: “Hammer has enjoyed considerable success in providing value-added services and bespoke solutions in a number of vertical markets for their customers and has a well-earned reputation as a storage specialist. “The acquisition has significant benefits for both companies increasing Exertis’ expertise and solutions in the storage market, complementary to our existing server and enterprise business, and providing Hammer customers and vendors with a platform for growth within a diverse and financially strong technology distribution company. In addition, this deepens Exertis’ presence across several European countries.”     TAGS Dell Exertis Hammer Consolidated Holdings Intel SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleMore than 77 per cent of UK students without insured smartphone, claims giffgaff Next articleSamsung forecasts £4.4bn hit to profits from Note7 saga Alex Yau http://www.mobilenewscwp.co.uk RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Bruno Duarte to depart as EE head of operations and strategy EE becomes first TV platform to partner with Twitter Vodafone Group H1 revenue declines 3.9pc to £23 billion NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply The leading news source for the mobile communications industry 8-10 Godson Street Islington London N1 9GZ Editorial Team Telephone: 020 7278 0795 Email: editorial@mobilenewscwp.co.uk Advertising Business Development Manager: Garry Wybourn – 0203 122 0872 / 07747 632 553 POPULAR POSTS Reaction: Can Huawei really overtake Apple and Samsung?

Asus Transformer Mini Goes on Sales as an Affordable Microsoft Surface Clone GO The 2-in-1 can be yours for just $399 with 128 GB of storage Oct 14, 2016 09:45 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  There are plenty of Microsoft Surface clones out there, but the majority of them are manufactured by Chinese companies that are looking to benefit from the success of the original model with their own cheap knockoffs. In the case of Asus, however, the Transformer Mini is quite a premium device, and although it comes with a design that clearly reminds of Microsoft’s Surface tablet, it’s definitely worth a look at given the combination of powerful hardware and affordable price. The Transformer Mini is now on sale at Amazon for only $399 - this is the US pricing, and those who’ll want to buy it in other markets might have to pay more or less, depending on taxes. As far as the hardware is concerned, the Transformer Mini comes with an Intel Cherry Trail Quad-Core processor with integrated Intel HD Graphics and 4 GB of RAM. The device features 128 GB of storage space, but thanks to microSD card support, you can expand it with an additional of 200 GB. Super lightweight The 10.1-inch screen has a resolution of 1280x800 pixels, but also very important is that Asus used a design available on the Surface and the device integrates a kickstand that makes it possible to be used just like a laptop when a keyboard is attached. Furthermore, at 530 grams it’s quite light thanks to the magnesium-aluminum alloy body, and this brings it in line with the Surface, whose weight does not exceed 600 grams, no matter the model. On the other hand, the Transformer Mini also comes with a fingerprint reader for Windows Hello, but also with a USB Type-C port and microHDMI for easy connection to an external screen. Without a doubt, this is one very interesting machine, so if you’re looking for a Surface clone, but you’re not willing to go for a Chinese clone, this is at least worth a chance.

China’s largest e-commerce company is working on expanding the range of services it offers over the internet and will work with Advanced Micro Devices to use the chipmaker’s Radeon Pro graphics, the companies said Friday in a statement. For AMD, which is the second-largest maker of graphics chips used in high-end computers behind Nvidia Corp., the deal is the chance to kick start a return to the lucrative data center market dominated by Intel Corp. Graphics chips are playing an increasing role in data centers where their ability to process information in parallel makes them useful in certain work loads such as image recognition. Nvidia has pioneered this more general use of the chips, which had mainly been used by computer gamers to get a more realistic experience from their hardware. AMD, based in Sunnyvale, California, has begun its fight back from market share losses to Nvidia in graphics and Intel in general purpose processors with new products that have closed the gap in performance. AMD’s stock has more than doubled this year, making it the best performer on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index, spurred by improving sales and progress in its attempt to return to profitability.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 14 October 2016 | MYT 3:47 PM Amazon and VMware form alliance in the cloud Mighty match: The powerful cloud computing arm of online retail giant Amazon will be able to handle VMware software and tools. — Reuters Cloud computing rivals VMware and Amazon Web Services announced an alliance that will let them play off each other's strengths. The powerful cloud computing arm of online retail giant Amazon will be able to handle VMware software and tools popular with businesses, according to the companies. The move was described as being tailored to integrate the world's leading private cloud (VMware) with the world's leading public cloud (AWS). "VMware Cloud on AWS offers our customers the best of both worlds," said VMware chief executive Pat Gelsinger. "This new service will make it easier for customers to preserve their investment in existing applications and processes while taking advantage of the global footprint, advanced capabilities, and scale of the AWS public cloud." The new service was said to represent a significant investment in engineering, operations, support and sales resources from Amazon and VMware. "Our customers continue to ask us to make it easier for them to run their existing data center investments alongside AWS," said Amazon Web Services chief executive Andy Jassy. "With VMware Cloud on AWS, for the first time, it will be easy for customers to operate a consistent and seamless hybrid IT environment using their existing VMware tools on AWS." AWS lets businesses such as Netflix access computing power for websites or apps on networks typically open to the public. Such "public cloud" services are offered by Amazon, Google and Microsoft.

X DCC spends €42.5m on digital storage specialist Hammer UK-based server distribution business seen as complementing DCC’s Exertis unit Fri, Oct 14, 2016, 08:43 Updated: Fri, Oct 14, 2016, 08:49 Joe Brennan DCC chief executive Tommy Breen said Hammer’s expertise would better enable the company to take advantage of positive industry trends. Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons         DCC’s technology division has agreed to acquire UK-based Hammer, a specialist distributor of server and storage solutions, in a deal initially valued at £38.3 million (€42.5 million). Hammer, which employs 165 people, is a distributor for a number of suppliers, including Dell, Intel, and NetApp, to almost 1,000 resellers, cloud service providers and system integrators in the UK and much of western Europe. DCC said the business is complementary to its own unit Exertis’s existing server and storage business. Tommy Breen: the puppetmaster pulling the strings at DCC DCC chief Tommy Breen’s pay package falls slightly to €4.5m Weak sterling helps DCC as first-quarter profit soars “Hammer’s expertise will better enable us to take advantage of positive industry trends, including growth in cloud data centres and demand for big data analytics,” said DCC chief executive Tommy Breen. In the year to the end of January, Hammer earned an operating profit of £6.3 million on revenue of £155 million. DCC has agreed to pay the purchase price entirely in cash and is structured as an initial payment at completion, followed by earn-out payments over three years based on Hammer’s future trading results.       Topics: Tommy Breen DCC Dell Computer Exertis Hammer Intel Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Transport & Tourism Easyjet may apply for Irish licence to ensure EU access Personal Finance The bond rout and Irish pension savers: what you need to be aware of International Gordon D’Arcy: All Blacks will be bitter, Ireland must be better Business Sensors help police curb gang violence in Cape Town Sponsored World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ Ten things to consider when buying a new sofa ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Hines emerges as top bidder for student residence beside UCD 06:45 Bank of Ireland ‘will utilise any relaxation of mortgage rules’ 06:34 €700 per sq m rent for top D2 offices 06:30 Tourist industry urged to shift focus from UK to EU 06:08 London Briefing: Carney takes chance to get own back on MPs 06:06 ADVERTISEMENT Tech Tools Could sleep problems be a thing of the past with Sense?

HP Inc. is powering up and slimming down its high-end PC lineup. Company officials this week unveiled the latest iterations of the company's premium consumer systems, putting the new 7th Generation Core "Kaby Lake" processors from Intel into the second generation of its Spectre x360 convertible notebook (pictured) and putting more battery life and 4K resolution into some of the systems in its Envy lineup. The new systems—most of which are scheduled to be available this month—come in time for the important holiday buying season. They were announced the same week that analysts from IDC and Gartner noted that HP was closing in on global PC market leader Lenovo. The new systems were designed to get more performance and be even easier to take on the move than their predecessors, according to Kevin Frost, vice president and general manager of consumer personal systems at HP. "Premium customers have high expectations around device performance and quality for consuming media and productivity, whether at home, work or on the go," Frost said in a statement, adding that HP redesigned its PC lineup "to deliver big power in thin and light designs to be even more portable and revolutionize our all-in-one to bring amazing sound into the home." The latest Spectre x360 is powered by Intel's latest 14-nanometer Core i5 or i7 processors, which were launched in August. The new chips—which feature performance and power efficiency gains over their Skylake predecessors—helped HP's newest system gain 25 percent better battery life, which means up to 15 hours. In addition, HP was able to fit a larger, 57.8-watt battery into a design that is 13 percent thinner and 11 percent lighter than the first-generation Spectre x360. In addition, the system features a 13.3-inch display that has almost no borders, offers four speakers rather than two and comes with Thunderbolt 3 support and a USB-Type A 3.0 port. There is a dual-fan design for better thermals and the option of up to 1TB PCIe solid-state drive (SSD) storage capability. With HP's Fast Charge feature, users can recharge the battery to 90 percent in 90 minutes. With the latest 13.3-inch Envy laptop, users can get 14 hours of battery life—four more than the previous model. It's actually slightly larger than the previous model—coming in at 14mm and 3.15 pounds—but it also is more powerful, with a larger battery and the latest Intel Core i5 and i7 chips. There are two USB 3.0 ports and a USB Type-C port, the same SSD storage capabilities as the new Spectre x360, up to 16GB of RAM and the Fast Charge feature. With the Envy All-in-One (AIO) 27, HP engineers moved the systems compute capabilities into the base, which enabled them to reduce the 27-inch display's thickness by 44 percent, to 15mm, HP officials said. It comes with theater-like sound qualities, a 3.6 million-pixel screen and a low-blue light mode for more eye comfort and a better night's sleep. The AIO also includes an optional GTX 950M discrete graphics card from Nvidia with 4GB GDDR5 video, hybrid storage options up to a 256GB SSD and 2TB hard-disk drive (HDD) and HDMI-out and in ports. The Envy 27 Display include a 4K IPS display with a micro-edge bezel design that customers can use to create dual-display setups, support for Advanced Micro Devices' FreeSync for better game playing and such connectivity capabilities as Display Port, HDMI and USB-C. The Spectre x360, Envy laptop and AIO are slated to be available this month, with prices starting at $1,049.99, $849.99 and $1,299.99, respectively. The Envy 27 Display is scheduled for availability Dec. 4 starting at $499.99. HP, which in 2013 was dislodged as the world's top PC vendor by Lenovo, is pushing its way back to the top of contracting market, according to Gartner and IDC analysts. According to Gartner, Lenovo had 20.9 percent of the market, while HP had 20.4 percent. IDC analysts said it was even tighter, with Lenovo having 21.3 percent of the market and HP 21.2. Lenovo was hindered by slow growth in China, which is where the company has its largest share, and saw the number of its PC shipments decline year over year, while both HP and Dell grew shipments.           LATEST PC HARDWARE ARTICLES   Factors You Need to Consider When Replacing Aging Laptops New Microsoft Surface Books, Surface Dial Go on Sale Microsoft Nixes Xbox Streaming Stick AMD Targets Gaming, VR Content Creators With New Radeon Graphics Cards Microsoft Surface Devices Challenge Apple in Enterprise Strongholds                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Follow TechnoBuffalo We’re closing in on the end of the year at a pretty rapid pace. Before we know it we’ll be knee-deep in holiday shopping season. While we’ve seen plenty of exciting gadgets launch this year, a few more are coming. Here are a several we’re most excited about. 1. New MacBook Pro laptops We still think Apple will launch new a MacBook Pro by the end of the year. Thanks to reporting from 9to5Mac, we’re expecting new processors (finally), a special OLED bar above the keyboard and a new design. Earlier rumors suggested it might arrive as soon as October, but Apple hasn’t sent out invites for any sort of event. The computers may launch in tandem with a new MacBook Air, a computer that’s also expected to get a refresh. This is particularly important given Apple hasn’t refreshed the MacBook Pro in ages. The computers still run on older Intel processors and are generally getting long in the tooth. It’s important for Apple to get these computers out, given that its competitors are already using new Kaby lake chips. 2. Microsoft Surface all-in-one computer Microsoft is hosting an event on October 26. All signs point to the company’s first Surface-branded all-in-one computer. According to ZDNets Mary Jo Foley, it’s code named “Cardinal” inside Microsoft. We expect the Surface all-in-one to ship in several sizes with touchscreen displays. Our bet is it will run Windows 10 Anniversary and offer Surface Pen support, too. This will be the first Microsoft Surface all-in-one. Until now, the Surface branding has only appeared on the company’s Surface Pro tablets and Surface Book laptop computers. One question we have: is there that much demand for this sort of product? 3. Oculus Touch The Xbox One controller, while wonderful, doesn’t meet the demands of virtual reality entirely. The medium needs motion control. This December, Oculus will have motion control for sale when Oculus Touch launches. The input pair will sell for $199 starting on December 6. We’ve used them at conventions and events before, and the $199 price tag is worth it. The Oculus Touch is a fine piece of hardware. 4. Surface Pro, Surface Book refreshes The Surface Pro and Surface Book are ready for new hardware. Word on the street is Microsoft isn’t going to offer full-on refreshes. Expect a smaller update. We’re betting on new processors in both computers but not complete design swaps. Most reports have suggested Microsoft isn’t going to make a big deal out of these computers, which means we might not hear them discussed much (if at all) during Microsoft’s event. We’re huge fans of these computers, though, so even a marginal update is exciting. 5. Huawei Mate 9 Huawei has an event on November 3 where we expect the Chinese smartphone maker to unveil the new Mate 9 flagship. Pictures leaked earlier this week point to two models, including one that looks eerily similar to the recalled Galaxy Note 7. Look for a curved Quad HD display, gobs of RAM, plenty of storage, a Kirin 960 processor and Android 7.0 Nougat. The Huawei Mate 9 is unlikely to launch immediately on U.S. carriers. Instead, we expect it to make its debut in Asia and Europe. If we’re lucky, we’ll get an unlocked model here, too. 6. HTC Bolt This one might not launch before the end of the year. The HTC Bolt has been circling around the rumor mill recently. It’s expected to make its debut on Sprint, at least according to a leaked press image. Other features should include Android 7.0 Nougat and HTC Sense 8.0 software. Given that HTC introduced the HTC 10 this spring, it’s possible the HTC Bolt won’t launch until 2017. Given the increase in leaks, however, anything seems possible. 7. PlayStation VR Call us for cheating if you want. PlayStation VR is officially out today. Fine. You win. Sony’s virtual reality headset marks the third major effort for the medium this year. It presents the lowest cost option, not counting mobile variants like Gear VR, and it earned attention from gamers everywhere. We’re excited for another source of VR gaming. Oculus and Vive are great inputs, but we’re hoping Sony’s clout as a game maker and publisher pushes PSVR to new heights. 8. Made by Google Gadgets We’ll bundle these all together. We’re excited for all of the new “Made by Google” products that are launching soon. That includes the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL on October 20, followed by the Chromecast Ultra, Google Wifi, Google Home and Google Daydream View VR. Each of these is exciting in its own right, but we’re most excited about the phones. They’ll introduce Google Assistant in Android 7.1 Nougat, Google’s smartest-ever voice-controller artificial intelligence. Assistant will also be accessible through Google Home, the company’s take on the Amazon Echo. And, even more exciting, the smartphones will power Google Daydream View VR, a new headset that’ll compete with Samsung’s Gear VR. All of these products are slated to launch by the end of this year. 9. LG V20 Last but not least, the LG V20 will launch by the end of this month. It’s the very first Android Nougat phone (at least it was the first announced with Nougat) and features LG’s unique secondary display. It’s one of the few flagships with a removable battery and expandable storage, plus it offers top-notch audio and visual features including a powerful DAC and a Quad HD screen. With the Galaxy Note 7 out of commission, this is LG’s time to shine.

Photo: Getty Images See more photos of: Chanel’s robots might have stolen the show at Karl Lagerfeld’s Back to the Future–style show this season, but the accessory of the moment will no doubt be Chanel’s LED-adorned bags. Clutches, cross-body styles, and the label’s infamously cool Boy bag were updated with LED dot matrices that flashed a trompe l’oeil quilted pattern and double-C logos. Clever? Yes, and quite salable considering the modern girl is as obsessed with capturing an Instagram-worthy moment on her iPhone as she is addicted with her phone itself. We’re betting Dolce & Gabbana’s light-up tiaras and shoes are popular, too. Chanel and Dolce & Gabbana are far from the first designers to light up clothing with some artificial glow. Way back in 1999, Alexander McQueen crafted an LED-embellished bustier for Givenchy’s Fall show, inspired by the looming prospect of the technological horror that Y2K was predicted to bring. Several years later, Hussein Chalayan took up the LED mantle, showing dresses that flashed cityscapes meant to convey an environmentalist message. LED shoes at Ashish followed, as did a glitzy frock form Richard Nicoll. The most resounding endorsement of glowing gowns, however, came at 2016’s Met Gala where both Claire Danes and Karolina Kurkova sported LED-dotted numbers that took the event’s tech theme to heart.

Almost all parties to the conflict, and even China, are searching for compromise, historical expert Dmitry Mosyakov noted during a recent conference on the issue that took place at the Russian Academy of Sciences. The expert stressed that the countries directly involved in the conflict are showing great restraint and trying to resolve the dispute by diplomatic means, while some states that are not directly involved in the dispute, in particular the United States, Japan and Australia, have come out with much more decisive and provocative statements regarding the implementation of the court's decision. © REUTERS/ U.S. Navy/Handout via Reuters US Intel: Beijing Deployed Military Equipment on Artificial Islands in South China SeaBeijing claims the entire territory of the sea, rich in mineral resources and crossed by important trade routes. China's claims have been contested by Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Taiwan, as well as Brunei. Earlier this year, The Hague Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled that China has no historic rights to the South China Sea, in a trial brought by the Philippines. China says the court has no jurisdiction in the matter. In general, participants of the conference came to the conclusion that the court's decision has had a much lesser negative impact on the security situation in the region than might have been expected. China's willingness to engage in dialogue, statements of the new Philippine president about the possibility of a compromise with Beijing as well as recent talks in Hong Kong between Chinese and Philippine representatives have given rise to cautious optimism, Mosyakov noted. At the same time, the expert stressed that the resolution of the territorial dispute in the South China Sea might be hindered by the US, as it will seek to maintain its influence and military presence in the region. The US' activities can be viewed as a destabilizing factor, Mosyakov said, adding that the rapid US military buildup in the region currently taking place is unacceptable. Earlier, US Secretary of Defense Ash Carter reiterated the Pentagon's "Asia Pivot" plans, to deploy 60% of America's overseas naval and air military assets to the Asia-Pacific region by 2020. To complicate matters further, he also announced that the Pentagon would beef up its military presence in the South China Sea. ...

Mr. Podesta is an almost fanatical party enforcer for the Democrats, he has long been a confidant of Secretary Clinton. Talking Points believe that if the Intel is correct and Russian hackers working for Putin did indeed intrude on the American election, President Obama must take action. First, he must speak directly to the American people about the evidence and second he must apply sanctions against the Putin government. These cyber-attacks are just that. Attacks. So let's get on it, Mr. President. Now, for the fallout. By hacking into Podesta's e-mail, we know beyond any doubt that the American press is corrupt. At least to some extent. For example, "New York Times" political reporter Mark Leibovich appears to have given Hillary Clinton's spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri editorial control over a major news story in "The Times." Reporter asked Miss Palmieri if he could use certain quotes that Hillary Clinton gave him in a private off the record meeting. That's against journalistic procedure. You don't write a political article okayed by a campaign. Another example, working for CNN at the time, now Democratic Chairwoman Donna Brazile apparently fed the Clinton campaign a question that CNN was going to ask doing a town hall meeting featuring Mrs. Clinton. Again, that's corruption and that should never happen. Sample three, John Harwood, he is a Washington correspondent for CNBC and you remember him as a former debate moderator in the Republican primary. According to hacked e-mails, he was e-mailing Podesta suggesting things Hillary Clinton could do to become more successful. That's outrageous. Example four, "The New York Times" reporter Maggie Haberman, then working at Politico was described by the Clinton campaign in an email as quote, "a friendly journalist who teed up stories that never disappointed them. To be fair, that's hearsay. Miss Haberman did not do what Mr. Leibovich did directly interacting with the Clinton campaign as far as we know. So, the email might be unfair to her and both is troubling. Also, another hearsay situation, report today out of TMZ says that NBC had that "Access Hollywood" tape for months and purposely released it to damage Trump before the debate. Anonymous sources, so impossible to verify. Finally, the talk show host Steve Harvey provided Hillary Clinton's campaign with the exact questions he was going to ask Secretary Clinton. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEVE HARVEY, TALK SHOW HOST: She's been breaking ground in her personal and professional life since she was a kid. So let's go back to when you were just a kid. HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Oh boy! Oh my goodness. HARVEY: You wanted to be an astronaut. CLINTON: I did. (END VIDEO CLIP) O'REILLY: Mrs. Clinton knew exactly that that was coming. Including the use of her picture as a child. Talking Points has long asserted that the American press is essentially an arm of the left. This proves it. There's no doubt. So, let's sum up. Any journalists colluding with the political campaign should resign immediately, before she resigned. Period. And that's "The Memo". Bill O'Reilly currently serves as the host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The O'Reilly Factor (weekdays 8PM/ET), the most watched cable news show for the past 13 years. He joined the network in 1996 and is based in New York.

Some of the biggest improvements include a more sleek design for the Spectre x360, extended battery life and seventh-gen Intel processors for both laptops.  ( HP ) Advertisement HP is updating its lineup of premium laptops, including the Spectre x360 and the Envy 13. The company has put both devices under cosmetic refreshes while extending their battery life. Not to be left behind, the HP Envy all-in-one 27 will also get an updated design and Intel's latest processors. The trifecta is HP's more high-end offering that has powerful specs and sophisticated design. HP Spectre x360 The update carries the namesake but is in fact much more powerful and sleek. HP was able to design the updated Spectre x360 to be much more thinner and more slender. The folding hinge stays in the updated Spectre x360 but now sports a 13.3-inch 1080p edge-to-edge display, allowing for a much narrower design than the previous iteration. HP claims 15 hours of total battery life for the Spectre x360 between charges, a 25 percent bump from the previous one. There are two configurations: either a seventh-generation Intel Core i5 or Core i7 with up to 16 GB of RAM and an internal storage of 1 TB SSD. It's available now for $1,159. Expect to shell out more for the Core i7 option. The most affordable configuration will set you back $1,049. You get a Core i5 processor with 8 GB of RAM and a 256 GB SSD. HP Envy 13 The HP Envy 13 doesn't get an edge-to-edge display, but HP packed it with a host of updates under the hood. HP loaded the Envy 13 with the same battery inside the Spectre x360, which HP claims can last up to 14 hours. In comparison, the previous model only offered a maximum 10-hour battery life, a far cry from 14 hours in this one, that is, if HP delivers. The updated HP Envy 13 will offer either a 1080p display or a 2,560 x 1,440 panel, an option absent in the Spectre x360. It will feature front-firing speakers for improved audio quality in real-world situations. Like the Spectre x360, the Envy 13 will also get seventh-generation Intel processors. It will come with up to 16 GB of RAM and up to 1 TB of SSD. A smaller 128 GB SSD is also available as a less expensive option. The most basic model will start at $849. You get an Intel Core i5 processor, 8 GB of RAM, 128 GB SSD and a 1080p display. Pricing for other configurations are still unavailable. It will show up on HP's online store starting Oct. 26. HP Envy All-In-One 27 Along with the redesign, HP has shifted the hardware powering the Envy all-in-one 27 from behind the screen to the base, allowing for a much thinner display that comes with a 2,560 x 1,440 resolution. Since Intel hasn't released seventh-generation Desktop processors yet, the Envy all-in-one will be loaded with Intel Core i7-6700T. It will come with 16 GB of RAM, 128 GB SSD, 1TB HDD and Nvidia GeForce GTX 950M graphics with 4 GB of GDDR5 memory. The Envy all-in-one 27 will come with four USB 3.0 ports, one USB 3.1 Type-C port and an HDMI port. It will be available starting Oct. 16 for $1,599. A cheaper configuration will retail for $1,249 starting Nov. 2. You get an Intel Core i5 processor, no SSD and Nvidia graphics chip. A more expensive model will also be available for $1,699, which doubles the SSD to 256 GB and the HDD to 2 TB.
