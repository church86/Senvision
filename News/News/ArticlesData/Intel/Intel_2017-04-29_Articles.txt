Recent News Asus Maximus IX Apex Motherboard Review Asus ROG Swift PG258Q Launched in Singapore at S$1,099 New Beoplay P2 Wireless Speaker Wants To Rock Your Pocket Social Media and the Stockholm attack Google adds more locations to Street View in Singapore Sunday, April 30, 2017 Latest News Smartphones Gaming Reviews Virtual Reality Prosumer Reviews for 22 million Enthusiasts Forums SGCafe Search for: Home > Intel > Asus Maximus IX Apex Motherboard Review IntelMotherboardsOverclockingReviews Asus Maximus IX Apex Motherboard Review James Seaton April 29, 2017April 29, 20170129 Right from the very first glance you get the impression that ASUS has done something different in the form of the Maximus IX Apex. As part of the Republic Of Gamers range, the Apex is expected to be a feature filled motherboard, but rarely do we see a motherboard that’s as innovative and unusual as this one. The ASUS Maximus IX Apex is one of the most exciting motherboards we’ve seen in a long time. The Apex draws on many of the signature ROG elements with a heavy focus on overclocking, cooling, modding and innovative features, some of which are truly eye catching. The most obvious thing that jumps out is the PCB shape, which somewhat resembles a X, but it doesn’t stop there with a very unusual DIMM slot designed to accept M.2 drives on an add-in card. Then there’s the twin DDR4 memory slots which differs from most motherboards which have four. Check out the massive array of headers, switches and buttons which is typical of a high end ROG board, but this is on another level. The Apex is geared as ‘one board to rule them all’  Obviously extreme overclockers will be right at home here with the fully featured BIOS and ln2 centric features, but there’s also plenty of options for water coolers with no less than 10(!) fan headers including dedicated pump headers and full speed options.  Modders are also catered to with a full RGB lighting setup, customizable face plate and a neutral color scheme designed to fit a wide range of themed systems.  All these markets and we didn’t even mention the gaming market. This is a ROG motherboard so gaming is a part of its DNA too. A quick Z270 & Kaby Lake overview Firstly, lets take a look at an overview of the Z270 platform. There are really only two improvements found with Z270 over Z170. The first of which is an extra 4 PCIe 3.0 lanes coming from the chipset itself. Z170 motherboards often had quite messy scenarios where if you used x M.2 slot, then y SATA port would become unavailable, or z PCIe slot would not function. The extra 4 lanes go a long way to alleviating these issues, allowing more devices to function without compromise. There are limits however, with some motherboards equipped with up to 3x M.2 slots or U.2 ports all requiring PCIe lanes, so careful attention will need to be paid to the individual motherboards’ specification and lane allocation to ensure it fits your desired needs, especially with multi GPU setups. The other significant new feature is support for Intel’s Optane technology. The ultimate market implementations of Optane are still to be made known at this point, with unexciting small cache type devices being the the first to market. The technology does have potential, especially if the outrageous performance gains seen in the public teasers hold true. Overall, there really is no need to select a Z170 board over a Z270 board if you are buying new, but on the flip side there is little need to upgrade to Z270 from Z170 unless you require an updated storage feature set. Z270 brings the latest motherboard options right up to date, with M.2, U.2 and some things like updated Realtek ALC 1220 audio. While were talking platform comparisons, lets talk a little about Skylake vs Kaby Lake. The most notable improvement for Kaby Lake over Skylake lies with the improved 14nm+ FinFET process. This has allowed Intel to obtain higher clock frequencies without increasing power. Compared to the 6700K, the 7700K brings a gain of 200MHz on the base clock and an impressive 300MHz max turbo frequency whilst keeping the TDP at the same 91W. It’s clear that the 14nm+ process is a very good thing. For Intel to deliver the clock speed improvements with the 7700K whilst maintaining the 91w TDP is significant given the gradual TDP increases we’ve seen from previous generations. These benefits don’t just apply to the top chip. Kaby Lake replacement CPUs bring a clock speed bumps across the range whilst keeping the power usage at the same level. With a clock speed improvement getting most of the attention, there is a significant architectural change found in Kaby Lake; The addition of a new media engine that includes fixed function HEVC 10bit and VP9 decoding. In this era of 4K and the increasing prevalence of H.265 encoded media, along with Google’s choice of VP9 for YouTube, this is significant for something like a small form factor HTPC, lowering CPU usage and improving power efficiency. Notebooks too will see battery life benefits from this.   Unboxing & Overview Back to the main event, The ASUS Maximus IX Apex! The list of specifications is extensive. Far too many to reproduce here. The box is a very solid with a great design. The board itself is kept secure in its own chamber, with the accessories in another. The attention to detail of the box is notable. We like how ROG’s branding tends to maintain a bit of subtlety over some brands’ tendency to go a bit over the top with their branding.   As you’d expect, the rear of the box shows off the boards’ features and key specs so the consumer knows what they are getting before they buy.   We have quite a significant bundle. Usually we can fit this into one picture, but the bundle with the Apex needs two pictures! Firstly we see a large sheet of ROG stickers, the users manual, driver and utility disk, a nicely made drink coaster, a cable mod discount card and finally some cable labels.   Moving onto the accessories, we have the standard four SATA cables, I/O plate, M.2 screws and a Q connector for easy connection of the case connectors. Then we have some of the cooler things. including a High Bandwidth SLI bridge which is worth more than a few pennies on its own. Theres a CPU insertion tool for the butterfingers among us, RGB extension cable, a customizable plate which can be placed over one of the RBG lights for a unique touch and finally the DIMM.2 daughter-board which is used for adding M.2 drives to the unique memory slot.     Perhaps you might have noticed the additional ‘memory slot’ next to the two main slots? ASUS calls this the DIMM.2 slot. It is actually a DDR3 slot, but with a difference. It is designed to accept a riser board (seen below). You can install one M.2 SSD on each side M.2 SSD. At first you may think this concept is slightly gimmicky, and maybe it is, but the truth is some of today’s high speed M.2 drives can get very hot, especially if they are sandwiched under hot graphics cards where they can get very little airflow. This can lead to throttling, lower performance and possible reduced lifetime. We’ve seen MSI introduce a cooling shield to address this problem, but ASUS have gone a couple of steps further and put a major engineering effort to place M.2 drives adjacent to any CPU or memory cooling, keep them away from hot components and have them running on a very fast interface. Innovative indeed! Now we move onto the board itself. We mentioned several of the key standout features in the introduction, including the ‘X’ shaped PCB, dual memory slots and massive numbers of headers and switches. The board uses the Extended ATX Form Factor at 12 inch x 10.7 inch ( 30.5 cm x 27.2 cm ). This means it will not fit in many compact cases. Do note this. The PCB really does look cool. There’s nothing like it on the market really. The heatsink design looks great, ASUS mentions they used a military plane as the inspiration for the design. The gun metal grey heatsinks look subtle and neutral, as we’d expect to see on a fully RGB featured motherboard. We’re glad that motherboard manufacturers are slowly moving to neutral color schemes for choosing your own RGB themes. ASUS includes a set of customizable plates that can be placed on the board instead of the ROG one, so you can add your own personal touch to the motherboard. There are a total of 10(!) fan headers. Seven of these are PWM controllable and another 3 are full speed options. If you want to get rid of ln2 vapor, these are what you would use. There’s also dedicated water pump headers providing extra power. Perdect for everything from a small all in one to a full custom loop. (which would look pretty sexy on this board!)   Where do we start with this section of the board?! In addition to a top quality 8+2 phase VRM configuration, the Apex has the kitchen sink, plus more OC features, buttons, headers and bells and whistles than you thought possible. Firstly, there are the obvious ones, like get the power and reset buttons, voltage read points, and POST display. Then we get to some of the cool ones. There are switches for disabling the each of the PCI-E slots and RAM slots, then there are switches for LN2 mode, cold boot bug, and a pause switch, which is really cool and does exactly that, pauses the whole system. There’s also a ReTry button which tries previously good CMOS settings, and a safe boot button, which defaults to a known good profile for a safe and sure boot. There’s also a RGB header, condensation detection LED’s and a basic POST set of LED’s.. whew!     The PCIe layout is pretty standard for a high end multi GPU capable board. There is no bridge chip, so you’re looking at 8x/8x for dual GPU. Like most of the decent Z270 motherboards, audio has been upgraded to the Realtek ALC1220 codec. While onboard audio will never match DACs costing hundreds of $$ or more, it has come a long way. We now have a 120dB SNR output, which is a lot better than some of the low end stuff that’s been around for years. Since this is an OC focused board, the implementation isn’t as crazy as you’ll see on some boards. ASUS has added Nichicon Gold capacitors and PCB isolation to improve audio quality.   On this part of the board, we see only four SATA6Gb/s ports, a single USB 3.0 internal header, and a MOLEX plug that is designed to provide additional power to the PCIe slots when using multiple GPU’s. Why only four SATA? if we had to nitpick, we’d like to see 6, but don’t forget there are options for two M.2 drives. If you must have more SATA you’ll need to look elsewhere.   Lastly, lets take a look at the rear I/O of the board. On the left we have BIOS Flashback and clear CMOS buttons, PS/2 keyboard and mouse ports, DisplayPort & HDMI ports, then six USB 3.0 ports, USB 3.1 type-A & USB 3.1 type-C, Intel LAN and finally the analogue audio ports and S/PDIF optical output. Why two PS/2 ports on a 2017 motherboard? Actually, overclockers prefer these ports as they use less CPU overhead compared to USB, which polls the CPU. With PS/2, overclockers can disable the USB entirely, improving benchmark efficiency that tiny little bit.. every bit counts. The single network controller is a Intel i219V. They have added what appears to be an additional ESD protection controller of some sort. Good to know if you live in an area with frequent storms.   UEFI Overview Upon entering the Maximus IX Apex UEFI for the first time, we go straight to the default ‘EZ Mode’ which shows the most commonly accessed settings and basic information. We have XMP profiles, boot device selection and fan speed controls.   Pressing F7 takes the user to the default page of the main BIOS, called ‘My Favorites’. Here you can add the settings you frequently access rather than have to navigate to them in the different sub menu’s all the time. A memory tweaker might add the DRAM timings menu here for example.   Moving over to the next menu brings us the ‘Main’ page Here is where you can see basic system information.   Here we have the ‘Extreme Tweaker’ menu. There are a massive amount of overclocking settings to be found here. Pretty much every feasible OC setting relating to the CPU, memory, voltages, features. It’s all found here.   There is a sub menu called ‘Tweaker’s Paradise’ where you can find further esoteric settings.   Asus’ ROG motherboards have always been overclockers favorites, and several overclockers have provided profiles that the end user can try out. There’s also profiles for various DRAM speeds and types. For example, the 4000Mhz memory setting results in 15-15-15-36 at 1.5V which we’re happy to to say, our memory was able to do.   Further memory presets are available for different common memory IC’s. Hynix, Samsung & Micron all have presets to try. The Apex is full of memory subtiming settings. To get an idea, have a look at the scale represented by the page slider towards the right. There are dozens and dozens of timings available, something that overclockers will love.   Moving away from the Extreme Tweaker page, we come to the ‘Advanced’ page. Most of these settings relate to the onboard devices and peripherals. including the USB, storage, networking and a whole lot more.   The ‘Monitor’ tab is where you will find real time reporting of voltages, temperatures and fan speeds. Quite a lot of these can be configured, for example, a warning when a temperature goes above a desired level, The boards’ extensive watercooling options can be set here along with the QFan control which sets your fan speed and temperature targets.   The ‘Boot’ tab is fairly self explanatory. The boot order, overrides and startup settings are found here.   Next up is the ‘Tools’ tab.  Here you can set OC profiles and update the UEFI. Note that the graphics card information selection only shows the information of ASUS graphics cards.   Finally there is the ‘Exit’ menu.   Overall, ASUS continues to provide an intuitive and well laid out UEFI that will appeal to the average user all the way to ln2 overclockers. ASUS hasn’t really changed their layout for a few generations, so users of ASUS boards will feel right at home. Software ASUS’ software, and in particular the ROG software is one of the strong additions to the overall product. There is a vast range of software available with many apps dedicated to overclocking, monitoring, utilities and extras. The core utility is the Asus AI suite. Here you can control just about every UEFI setting that is possible to control from within Windows. As we see here, the TPU settings allow for CPU and cache OC and voltage control   There’s total fan control with presets available or temperature hysteresis.   Next up is the AURA software that controls the RGB lighting of the motherboard. It seems every high end motherboard has RGB lighting these days, and so the control software is of vital importance. For the most part the software works well, but we did have the odd strange experience where applying a color didn’t work the way it should, but trying again made it work. Perhaps there are a few niggles to work out. With the Aura software, you can control other company’s RGB solutions, such as cases, RGB strips and even keyboards and mice. One of the things we really liked was the option to link the RGB lighting to the motherboards temperatures. Green for cool and red for hot. Simple, but effective!     The apps are really just scratching the surface. ASUS also offers apps for cloud storage, a ROG skinned CPUZ, ROG Connect for controlling settings via a laptop, a RAMdisk app, a drive clone utility, fast charge app and even a windows system cleaning app.   Test Setup & Benchmarks Our test setup configuration can be seen below. Comparing different CPU’s and platforms can get a bit tricky. Our method is to apply the highest turbo modes, set them to all cores and disable SpeedStep to keep frequencies constant. In this case the 7700K is at a flat 4.5Ghz, the i7 6700K at 4.2Ghz and the i7 5960x at 3.5Ghz. All compatible parts are identical between systems, except the X99/5960X system which is running 4x8Gb of DDR4 at 2666Mhz 15-15-15-35 2T.           We expect every benchmark run with a 7700K to be within a fraction of each other and this is what we see across our tests. The 7700K is king in single threaded performance, with the 6700K behind only due to its lower clock speed. There are no architectural reasons. the 5960x rules multithreaded benchmarks with its eight cores despite its clock disadvantage.  Note that the MSI board clocks itself a few Mhz higher via a tiny bclk increase, which is a little cheeky. Despite this few Mhz clock disadvantage, the Apex shows itself to be very capable and is bang on leading the Z70 motherboards, or very close to it. Oh yeah, how does the DIMM.2 design work? The Samsung 960 Pro M.2 drive is the fastest SSD you can buy and it shows. Overclocking ROG motherboards are especially known for their overclocking prowess. The Apex, as a very much OC themed motherboard sits at the top of the stack, so obviously our expectations were very high. We were not disappointed. The Maximus IX Apex, with its dual slot design, is aimed at providing the simplest and cleanest signalling possible. By keeping the memory slots as close as possible to the socket, the trace lengths are minimized, and of course there are only half as many traces compared to a four slot board. This means the Apex, similar to what we’ve seen with other dual slot boards such as the ITX Maximus Impact series, should have best in class memory overclocking capability. Special thanks to G.Skill for providing one of their amazing high speed kits. Prior to testing the Maximus IX Apex, we were not able to hit DDR4-4000 on any motherboard, but with the Apex, the kit of G.Skill Trident X 3866-18-19-19 was able to truly fly. DDR4-4000 12-12-12-28 1T. Thank you very much! Let’s just say this is probably the best memory overclocking motherboard we’ve ever tested. Memory OC abilities are a true separator of the wheat from the chaff. Of course this is not a setting you’d run 24/7. It’s strictly benchmarking only. Due to the many built n memory OC profiles, you don’t need to be an elite overclocker to hit these kinds of numbers.   Benchmarking above 5Ghz is certainly possible if your CPU is good enough and thermals allow it. As always, your mileage will vary depending on your CPU core quality, memory controller quality and ambient temperatures. If you have a good sample, we are positive the Apex will run it to its maximum on air and water cooling. You will run into thermal limitations long before the board even breaks a sweat. Our CPU hits a bit of a voltage wall at 5.2Ghz under a triple fan AiO watercooler. Beyond this, diminishing returns set in and it is difficult to run multithreaded benchmarks without temps really spiking. 5.2Ghz with DDR4-4000 is pretty cool though! If your CPU is capable, The Maximus IX Apex will deliver 5Ghz+ 24/7 and be a walk in the park if your cooling is good enough.   Conclusion The ASUS Maximus IX Apex is one of the few truly innovative motherboards we’ve seen in some time. It is the current motherboard of choice for overclocking Kaby Lake CPU’s and pushing DDR4 memory to the limits. It’s not exactly cheap, and its missing some otherwise typical high end features, but this board is anything but typical. If you want the best performing Z270 motherboard, here it is. We love it. At around $559 SGD it isn’t cheap, but we think its acceptable and there are boards that are quite a bit more. That doesn’t mean its limited to extreme overclockers. The array of watercooling headers and features will appeal to all types of overclockers. If we had to nitpick, we’d say its lacking some of the ‘regular’ features that a high end motherboard might otherwise have, The audio could be beefed up a bit, we could use some extra SATA ports, but that’s what the other ROG boards are for, so we don’t view this as a negative. OC has always been a part of ROG DNA, and we’re thrilled to see ASUS has not abandoned this part of the market in favor of top to bottom ‘gaming’ boards. Some folks may complain at the limitation of dual slots, however, those who understand how high end memory works will be thankful for this. As DDR4 memory speeds get ever higher, it becomes apparent that quad slot motherboards are simply not able to match their dual slot brethren. The best DDR4 memory OC motherboards (and those you see the most on QVL lists of high end memory kits) are dual slot boards. Think ASRock Z170M OC Formula, Asus Maximus XIII Impact and now the Maximus IX Apex. If you are thinking of buying some very fast DDR4-4000+ memory, you’ll likely need a dual slot board. It seems like RGB and more RGB has become a meme among the PC enthusiast crowd, and while the Apex is not immune to this trend, it does offer some very attractive features for the modders. Consider the X shaped PCB or the subtle but stylish heatsinks, dual RGB LED headers, the customizable nameplates, and the surround glow of the RGB’s around the back of the PCB. Chuck in the class leading water cooling features and how awesome the Apex looks on display and its clear we have a board that modders should have a lot of affection for. The bottom line: We’ve found our new Z270 reference motherboard.       Pros: Probably the best DDR4 overclocking motherboard available BIOS refinement OC ability with wide range of functional presets RGB setup looks cool. One for the modders DIMM.2 works well Tons of fan headers and watercooling options Top shelf build quality – designed to be punished Customization options   Cons: Consider the Maximus IX Formula if you want more SATA, memory or super audio etc   James Seaton Post navigation Previous Article Asus ROG Swift PG258Q Launched in Singapore at S$1,099 Related Articles OverclockingReviews NVIDIA GeForce GTX 470 Voltage Modifications TeamVR April 6, 2010 MemoryReviews Corsair Dominator TWIN3X2048-1800C7DF G 2GB Kit First Look TeamVR September 17, 2007 Reviews Razer Lachesis – Mousey Insanity?

Harsh Chauhan (TechJunk13) Apr 29, 2017 at 5:35PM Goldman Sachs believes that Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is going to face fierce competition from rivals NVIDIA and Intel, which will discount their products to defend their market share in graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs). As a result, Goldman rates AMD a sell with an $11 price target. There's no denying that NVIDIA and Intel dominate the GPU and CPU markets hands down, with market shares of 70% and 99%, respectively, giving them the luxury to cut pricing and keep AMD away. As it turns out, Intel has already responded to AMD's latest Ryzen CPU with a price cut, with NVIDIA following suit. Not surprisingly, AMD is looking at nascent opportunities where it can take a lead over its rivals to ensure long-term growth, and virtual reality (VR) is one such space. Image source: Getty Images. AMD's latest VR move AMD has just spent an undisclosed amount to acquire technology start-up Nitero, which manufactures chips to enable wireless connectivity between VR headsets and computers for content streaming. The semiconductor specialist's latest acquisition is going to solve one major problem that's holding back VR headset adoption -- tethering. Image source: Nitero. High-end VR headsets are currently dependent on bulky cables to stream content and draw power from desktop computers, limiting the user's mobility and tarnishing the VR experience. Nitero is trying to address this problem as it specializes in the 60 GHz millimeter wave radio technology that enables wireless device communication over short ranges. As it turns out, a few companies are already working to make VR headsets wireless. TPCast, which is backed by HTC, believes that it can get wireless HTC Vive accessory to the market in the second quarter of the year. However, the bolt-on accessory could cost $249, adding to the price of an already expensive headset. Nitero, however, could bring down the cost of making a wireless VR headset, since it's designing chips exclusively for this purpose, allowing it to deliver high-bandwidth data transfer with low latency (delays and time-lags). By comparison, other companies are tweaking existing solutions to fit this scenario, which is increasing the cost in the process. AMD, therefore, aims to become the chip supplier of choice for next-generation VR headsets to enable wireless connectivity, which could substantially boost its revenue. How big is the opportunity? IDC estimates that VR headset sales could grow sixfold to 61 million units in 2020 from a projected 10 million units this year. AMD can take advantage of this opportunity by either making an add-on accessory that it can sell as an upgrade, or by making custom chips that are embedded in the headset itself. A typical add-on adapter costs $250 at present, indicating that AMD's total addressable market could grow to $15 billion by 2020, according to the 61 million-headset sale forecast. But this isn't what AMD probably intends to do with Nitero's technology. It might either create its own chips or license the design to headset makers for a royalty, though it's difficult to gauge the size of this opportunity. But AMD investors shouldn't forget that it will run into stiff competition from Qualcomm, which recently announced a VR development kit that's focused on providing an "un-tethered" experience. Qualcomm is looking to reduce the go-to-market time of headset manufacturers through its VR development kit and the head-mounted display accelerator program by giving them access to all the important hardware tools. The kit consists of a Snapdragon 835-powered headset that also includes memory chips, audio chips, and connectivity chips, indicating that it's trying to corner a greater share of the market for itself. But the VR opportunity is a huge one, and it can definitely accommodate more than two players, as different companies are trying to attack different aspects of the market. AMD, for its part, is doing the right thing by focusing on the wireless-chip opportunity, as the gradual move toward cordless VR headsets can give its business a nice boost.    Harsh Chauhan has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Designed to strike a balance between features and weight, the laptop features a quad-core Intel CPU, a yet unspecified NVIDIA GPU, 16 GB of memory, as well as a mechanical keyboard. Meanwhile the laptop measures in at just 18.9 mm thick and weighs around 2.6 kilograms, or roughly about the size of a mainstream notebook from a decade ago. The Acer Predator Triton 700 comes with a 15.6” FHD display and is based on Intel’s Core i5-7300HQ or Core i7-7700HQ processor, depending on exact model. The laptop is equipped with 16 GB of DDR4-2400, up to two 512 GB SSDs, Rivet Networks Killer DoubleShot Pro network solution (featuring a 2×2 802.11ac Wi-Fi and a GbE controller), Thunderbolt 3 connectivity, and other features one would expect from a high-end laptop. Acer Predator Triton 700   i7-7700HQ i5-7300HQ Display 15.6" IPS panel with 1920×1080 resolution CPU Core i7-7700HQ (4C/8T, 6 MB, 2.8/3.8GHz) Core i5-7300HQ (4C/4T, 6 MB, 2.5/3.5GHz) Graphics NVIDIA GeForce GTX 10-series with G-Sync support for external displays RAM 16 GB DDR4-2400 (upgradeable to 32 GB) Storage Up to two 512 GB SSDs with PCIe 3.0 x4 or SATA interface Wi-Fi Rivet Killer Wireless-AC 2×2 802.11ac Wi-Fi Bluetooth Bluetooth 4.1 Ethernet Rivet Killer E2x00 GbE controller USB 2 × USB 3.0 Type-A 1 × USB 2.0 Type-A Thunderbolt 1 × USB Type-C Thunderbolt 3 connector Display Outputs 1 × DisplayPort 1 × HDMI 2.0 Keyboard Mechanical backlit keyboard with programmable keys Other I/O Microphone, stereo speakers, audio jacks, webcam (with HDR imaging) Dimensions Width: 393 mm/15.47" Depth: 263 mm/10.35" Thickness: 18.9 mm/0.744" Weight 2.6 kilograms Price Starts at $2999 or €3399, depending on configuration and market In terms of overall design, the Predator Triton 700 is one of a number of recent thinner-and-lighter high-end gaming laptops to hit the market in recent years. As the popularity of gaming notebooks has continued to rise, various makers of such PCs started to diversify their lineups with thinner machines aimed at gamers, essentially splitting these niche products to classes that differ by performance and weight/dimensions. With the Predator Triton 700, Acer is looking to bring the performance of a gaming desktop to the “thin-class” gaming laptops, and gives us an idea what to expect from next-gen gaming notebooks in general. A feature of the Predator Triton 700 that Acer is especially proud of - and is a major component of allowing the laptop to be as small as it is - is its cooling system, which has five heatpipes and two thin AeroBlade 3D fans with curved metal blades that create increased airflow. A large Corning Gorilla Glass plate that acts like a touchpad covers the cooling system and the innards of the laptop, whereas the backlit mechanical keyboard resides towards the user, giving the system a very distinctive look. Meanwhile, one of the things that Acer is not disclosing are the graphics processors options available: the only thing we know is that the system runs an undisclosed GeForce GTX 10-series processor, and that the high-end configuration scores ~17,000 points in 3DMark11 (based on Acer’s presentation). Such a performance level is common for the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 GPU (when working with the i7-7700HQ), but this GPU consumes 110 W of power, so it's not clear whether a 15.6”/18.9mm chassis with two blowers offers enough cooling capacity to prevent significant throttling. Typically, relatively thin gaming notebooks use GeForce GTX 1060 graphics chips with around 80 W TDP, but such GPUs hit around 12,000 – 13,000 in 3DMark11 (with the same CPU). It's highly probable that Acer will be offering a GTX 1060 version as a mid-range configuration anyhow, so the real question is what exact GPU will go into the high-end configuration. NotebookCheck.net speculates that the Predator Triton 700 is equipped with a yet unannounced version of NVIDIA’s GP104 GPU with a considerably reduced TDP. Wrapping things up, the Acer Predator Triton 700 gaming laptop will be available in Europe and North America this August. MSRPs will start from €3399 and $2999, depending on configuration, with exact specs and prices varying from market to market.

The idea is that purchasing a Surface Pro 4 or any of the devices that resembles it means you don’t have to purchase both a notebook and a tablet. Since Microsoft announced its first tablet that can be a notebook, all we’ve heard about are those types of 2-in-1s. We’ve all ignored another benefit of purchasing a Surface Pro 4. The Surface Pro 4 doesn’t just make a great  tablet and notebook. It also makes a pretty great Windows 10 desktop PC. As a Surface Pro 3 and Surface Pro 4 user, I’ve spent some time with the form factor at my desk. The way I see it, there are couple of different scenarios to get Surface Pro 4 users the best desktop experience. Pick The Right Surface Pro 4 Desktops are powerful, bulky beasts. They’re big because transporting them isn’t really that much of a concern. The Surface Pro 4 is a mobile powerhouse, a machine that was designed to be portable. At first, one might assume that it wouldn’t be that great at doing the things that desktops do: playing video games and editing video. Read: Which Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Should You Buy? That’s absolutely true of the entry-level Surface Pro 4 for $899. It’s not really great at playing the latest games at all since it doesn’t have a fan and uses less powerful internals. The Surface Pro 4s with Intel Core i7 and Intel Core i5 processors are better at those activities. Any Surface Pro 4 plan that involves the device doubling as a powerful desktop Windows 10 PC starts with those two models. The Surface Pro 4 with Intel Core i5 Processor and 4GB of RAM starts at $999. If you really want the best performance possible, investigate purchasing a Surface Pro 4 with at least 8GB of RAM. The Microsoft Store sells all versions of the Surface Pro 4, including a model with 16GB of storage. Buy a Surface Pro 4 Dock Once you’ve acquired a Surface Pro 4, you need a way to charge the device and connect to accessories. Microsoft makes two docks for this task, both of which have advantages and disadvantages. The Surface Pro 3 Docking Station is a typical dock. There are no cables to connect. Instead, its two arms encapsulate the Surface Pro 4, on three sides. Built into it are three USB 3.0 ports, two USB 2.0 ports, Ethernet out and a Mini DisplayPort. The Surface Pro 4 Dock isn’t built specifically for the Surface Pro 4, which is why users need a free spacer from Microsoft to enjoy the $199 accessory. The Microsoft Surface Dock is this year’s docking option for the Surface Pro 4, Surface Pro 3 and Surface Book. It too costs $199. There are two front-facing USB 3.0 ports, a power port, Gigabit Ethernet, two more USB 3.0 ports and 2 Mini DisplayPorts on its rear. With this dock, you need to physically plug in a cable, but just the one. The dock itself does the rest. Other companies make compatible port replicators, but in those cases you’d need to plug your Surface Pro 4 into a charger, then have a separate USB cable running from the Surface Pro 4. Microsoft’s solutions are expensive, but simplistic. Use A Bluetooth Keyboard and Mouse The next thing you’ll need are the typical accessories that desktops require. The Surface Pro 4 has two pretty loud speakers, but don’t hesitate to pick up external speakers if you feel like you need to. The Surface Pro 4 and Windows 10 support Bluetooth audio profiles. The docks and device itself all have 3.5mm headphone ports built-in. Bluetooth headphones work too, that’s what I use at my desk when playing music late at night and early in the day. Microsoft used to make a Bluetooth keyboard accessory for its Type Covers. It’s long since killed that device, betting that users would rather purchase separate keyboards and mice that offer better battery life and bigger keys. For the best results, go with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. Microsoft makes the, entry-level Wireless Keyboard 850 for Bluetooth users. I personally use the Wedge Wireless Mobile Keyboard. It’s $79.95 – not cheap – but does have a thin profile. For a mouse, I recommend the $69.95 Surface Arc Mouse because it becomes very portable when you need it to be. That being said, anything you have around the house works fine too. You can go with USB mice and keyboards, but if you do you’ll need a USB hub or a Surface Dock. Remember, the Surface Pro 4 only has a single USB port.   I actually skipped the mini adapters, displays and docks in the early days. Instead, I purchased a Surface Pro Power Supply for $79.99 and a tablet stand that held up my Surface Pro 4. This method does hinder viewing angles somewhat, but it’s cost effective and keeps me from being surrounded by screens and accessories I don’t need. The stand I purchased from Amazon is long gone, but there are more available from other makers. Disable Tablet Mode Finally, remember to set your device to either ask you before switching in and out of Tablet Mode or turn off switching entirely. Read: How to Use Tablet Mode in Windows 10 Windows 10 is able to detect physical keyboards and make the switch, but not with Bluetooth accessories. My solution to this has been to manually toggle Tablet Mode on and off when I’m done with work using the Action Center. The Action Center is always a left swipe from the right edge of your display. Optional: Get a Monitor, Maybe With Touch On its own, your Surface Pro 4 is a great all-in-one PC in its own right. At least, it is if you’re comfortable with using a 12-inch display. If you aren’t, consider adding a widescreen monitor to your desktop setup to get more screen real estate. Which display you get really does depend on your tastes as a user. Some people like to get large monitors, then hide the Surface Pro 4 somewhere in their setup because they don’t need to monitors. Others prefer to keep the Surface Pro 4 and external monitor sitting side by side. If you’re going to hide the Surface somewhere in your setup, like a desk drawer, be sure that it has plenty of ventilation. Be sure that whatever monitor you do go with has matching connections for whatever dock you use too. Stay away from any monitor that has a VGA cable. For consistency, it might be better to with a monitor that supports touch. The Surface Pro 4 can be connected to a monitor even without a docking accessory. For this you will need a MiniDisplay Port adapter for whatever plug the display features. Microsoft makes a line of Surface Mini DisplayPort Adapters and a Wireless Display Adapter. Two monitors connect through the Surface Dock, but you can add a third running straight from the Surface pro 4’s body too. Microsoft frequently runs specials on Surface Docks and monitors at the Microsoft Store. Read: The Best Surface Pro 4 Deals Available The Surface Pro 4 gained a reputation for being a great tablet and a decent notebook. I’d make the argument that it’s also a terrific Windows 10 all-in-one with the right accessories. 19 Responses 02/13/2016 Robert Armstrong Reply I understood that the pro 4 could handle 3 external monitors – 2 from the dock and 1 from the tablet. You say it is restricted to 2 monitors. Will it not handle a third monitor from the tablet’s mini DP port? 02/29/2016 Leander Reply Yeah it does, 2 monitors from the docking station. One from the surface it self. So 3 screens at the same time. I got the configuration running at this very moment. Two normal monitor’s and big presentation screen. 02/29/2016 Robert Armstrong Reply Thanks. I’m going to give the SP4 i7 16gb a try with three 27″ monitors. 03/05/2016 Robert Armstrong Reply I bought the SP4 with dock and cables. Win 10 shows 4 displays, but will only use three, one of which is always the tablet. So I can get two of my three externals, but not three at once. Surface support told me I have to use a video hub to go to three. Is this what you have done? Or is a splitter enough? 03/22/2016 Matt Smith Reply What’s the recommended settings for the larger monitor, I’ve currently got it connected to another screen and the icons are massive and there’s black banding down the sides. 04/19/2016 Molly Hampel Reply This is a question not reply – i have a surface pro 4 with the docking station. The surface will go to sleep and when we wake it backup the external large monitor will not work. We thought it was the docking station but after trying two others it’s not. Any suggestions? Could the monitor not be compatible? 04/19/2016 Robert Armstrong Reply I now run two ASUS 27″ monitors and the Surface tablet screen. The primary display is set as one of the 27″. When my Surface wakes up, the two large monitors also come alive – usually, but not always. Very occasionally, I have to go to display settings on the tablet screen and “extend the desktop” to the two large monitors. This does not happen often. Sorry I can’t be more help. 04/24/2016 Jenniferdpearman Reply This is very wonderful new jobs..!Super and Easiest 0nl!nee Home opportunity for all. make 87 Dollars per hour and Make 52512 Dollars per month.All you just Need an Internet Connection and aComputer To Make Some Extra cash.

However, it has an HDMI ‘in’ and can alternately be used as an external monitor – is there a way to enable/utilize the touchscreen on this computer when connected to my Surface Pro 4 as an external monitor?

How can I get a setting to use the total real estate? 04/10/2017 Jenelle Reply The top left port is listed as being a headset jack, but I get nothing but static (no sound from anything) when I plug in my iSound speaker or my headset. Device manager doesn’t recognize anything is plugged in and all I get is static from this wired connection. 04/29/2017 Peter Hamlin Reply This is excellent! Recently, Win10 added a virtual touchpad — a small touchpad that appears on the Surface screen and is used as a mouse on an external monitor. It’s a fantastic solution if you use the Surface with an external non-touch monitor but don’t want to drag your mouse back and forth across the whole width of two screens. Great write-up! At the moment I’m deciding whether to go with a “desktop” setup like you describe, or a Surface Studio. (I’m waiting to see if the next iteration of the Studio has better internals, and also if I can save up that much money!) Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

But the mass of Americans are barely getting by Hamish McRae @TheIndyBusiness Saturday 29 April 2017 09:45 BST Click to follow Wall Street investors are benefitting from the boom in the US tech industry Getty The first 100 days of the Trump presidency may have been lacklustre, and the first three months of the year certainly showed disappointing GDP growth – only 0.7 per cent annual rate. For high-tech America, this quarter has been a scorcher. So what matters more? This week saw the share price of Amazon, the Google parent Alphabet, Facebook, and Microsoft hit all-time highs. This was on the back of very strong results, with Amazon profits up 41 per cent and Google 29 per cent, and both Microsoft and Intel producing fundamentally strong, if less spectacular earnings. We will see what Facebook achieves when it publishes its results next Wednesday but the market expects another stunner, to judge by the surge in the share price in the past few days. Intel also traded within a whisker of its all-time high. This contrast between apparently slow growth and a booming high tech business is not new. It has been evident right through the recovery, and may in some measure be associated with the swing of voters towards their new president. The elite, either on the high-tech West Coast or among the Wall Street investors who have profited from them, are doing just fine. But the mass of Americans are barely getting by, for the figures suggest that this has been the slowest economic recovery since the Second World War. The business of America may indeed still be business, but it seems to be big business, not small.    Donald Trump's first 100 days: in cartoons 33 show all Donald Trump's first 100 days: in cartoons 1/33 Donald Trump's first 100 days in office were marred by a string of scandals, many of which caught the eye of the Independent's cartoonists 2/33 Trump's first 100 days have seen him aggressively ramp up tensions with his nuclear rivals in North Korea 3/33 Mr Trump has warned of a "major, major conflict" with the pariah nation lead by Kim Jong Un 4/33 Mr Trump dropped the "mother of all bombs" on alleged ISIS-linked militants in Afghanistan, amid an escalation of US military intervention around the globe 5/33 Mr Trump has been accused of falling short of the standards set by his predecessors in the Oval Office, including Franklin D Roosevelt 6/33 The tycoon's ascension to the White House came at a time when the balance of power is shifting away from Western nations like those in the G7 group 7/33 Western politicians, including the British Conservative party, have been accused of falling in line behind Mr Trump's proposals 8/33 Brexit is seen to have weakened Britain, reducing still further any political will to resist American leadership 9/33 Mr Trump's leadership has been marked by sudden and unexpected shifts in global policy 10/33 Trump's controversial missile strike on Syria, which killed several citizens, was seen by some analysts as an attempt to distract from his policy elsewhere 11/33 The President has also spent a large majority of his weekends golfing, rather than attending to matters of state 12/33 Though free of gaffes, a visit from Chinese president Xi Jinping spotlighted trade tensions between the two states 13/33 One major and unexpected setback came when Mr Trump's Healthcare Bill was struck down by members of his own party 14/33 Mr Trump has been a figure of fun in the media, with his approval at record lows 15/33 A string of revelations about Mr Trump's financial indiscretions did not mar his surge to the White House 16/33 Outgoing President Barack Obama was accused of wiretapping Trump Tower by his successor in America's highest office 17/33 The alleged involvement of Russian intelligence operatives in securing Mr Trump the presidency prompted harsh criticism 18/33 The explosive resignation of Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who lied about his links to the Russian ambassador, was just one scandal to hit the President 19/33 Many scandals, such as the accusation Barack Obama was implicated in phone-hacking, first broke on Mr Trump's Twitter feed 20/33 Donald Trump's election provoked mass protests in the UK, with millions signing a petition to ban him from the country 21/33 Donald Trump cited a non-existent terror attack in Sweden during a campaign rally 22/33 Donald Trump stands accused of stoking regional tensions in Eastern Asia 23/33 North Korea has launched a number of failed nuclear tests since Mr Trump took power 24/33 Theresa May formally rejected the petition calling for Mr Trump to be banned from the UK 25/33 When Mr Trump's initial so-called Muslim ban was struck down by a federal justice, the President mocked the 69-year-old as a "ridiculous", "so-called judge" 26/33 A week after his inauguration, Theresa May met with Mr Trump at the White House 27/33 Donald Trump's first days in office were marked by a hasty attempt to follow through on many of his campaign promises, including the so-called Muslim ban 28/33 Donald Trump's decision to ban citizens of many majority-Muslim countries from the US sparked mass protests 29/33 Revelations about Donald Trump's sexual improprieties were not enough to keep him from being elected President 30/33 British PM Theresa May was criticised by many in the press for cosying up to the new President 31/33 One of Mr Trump's top aides, Kelly Anne Conway, was mocked for describing mistruths as "alternative facts" 32/33 British PM Theresa May was quick to demonstrate that her political aims did not hugely differ from Mr Trump's 33/33 Donald Trump's inauguration, on 20 January 2017, sparked protests both at home and abroad There is no easy explanation, except to acknowledge that in part, at least, this evident dissonance between winners and losers is indeed valid. If you have a stock market boom, and the Dow Jones is up 21 per cent on last year, people who own stock will do very well. The more they own the better they will have done. That leads to another debate as to whether present share values, particularly of these high-tech companies that dominate the market, are justified. At some stage there will be a market “correction” – I love that euphemistic description of what the rest of us would call a share crash – but while these companies’ earnings continue to soar you can make a decent case to support these record market levels. But the “print shedloads of money and it has to go somewhere” argument, while probably correct, is only part of it. There are, I think, two other elements at work. The first is that we are mis-measuring GDP. This is a familiar theme, the argument being that the impact of Google, Facebook and the like have greatly increased people’s real living standards in a way that isn’t captured in the statistics partly because so many of the new services are for free, and partly because the benefits are often in saving people time and we find it difficult to put a cost on that. Trump's first 100 days in numbers The other is more general. We are in the early stages of a revolution, which has been dubbed the Fourth Industrial Revolution because its impact may be as big as the three preceding ones – that of steam and the railways, of electricity and mass-production, and of computers and telecommunications. In the early stages of any such revolution there are some obvious losers (think of blacksmiths) but many more, less obvious gainers (anyone travels in a car). So now we can see the losers, people who lose their jobs from automation, but are less aware of the gainers, who comprise nearly all of us. There is a further twist. In the early stages of any such revolution there are people who become vastly wealthy – the steel and oil barons in the US 100 and more years ago, the high-tech princes now – and the widening of differentials leads to social tension. Eventually societies adapt and that will happen again now. Meanwhile, set alongside such a gigantic economic force as US high-tech industry politics seem almost irrelevant. Barring some catastrophe that does not bear thinking about, our lives will be changed more by Facebook, Google and Apple, than by any incumbent of the White House.

Investors including chip company Intel Corp (INTC.O) piled into Cloudera several years ago when a flood of money into private technology companies pushed valuations skyward. Cloudera said it priced its shares at $15, above its indicated range of $12 to $14, but still a far cry from the $30.92 a share that Intel paid in 2014. Cloudera will begin trading tomorrow on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “CLDR.” The source asked not to be named because the negotiations are confidential. Cloudera and Intel did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Palo Alto, Califoria-based Cloudera, like rival HortonWorks Inc (HDP.O), focuses on helping corporate customers manage data through “Hadoop,” an open-source software system that can sort and handle the increasingly massive amounts of data generated through the Internet and mobile devices. Intel, which took a 18 percent stake in Cloudera in its initial $740 million investment and subsequently bought more shares, will hold a 19.4 percent stake in Cloudera after its IPO. Cloudera’s data business is meant to help Intel diversify away from its core business of making chips for data centers. Since Intel’s investment, Cloudera has had to invest heavily in marketing to help grow its revenue and has had to discount its products due to increased competition. In its fiscal year that ended January 31, Cloudera had $261 million in revenue and spent $203 million on sales and marketing. It posted a loss of $187 million for the year. Cloudera is not the first company in recent years to have gone public at a lower valuation than its private market level — known in investment parlance as a down-round IPO. Mobile payments company Square Inc (SQ.N) had a down round IPO in 2015 with a market capitalization of $2.9 billion, a steep discount from its private valuation of $6 billion. Its market capitalization now sits at $6.7 billion. Still, a down round IPO can be a disappointment for employees with expectations of big payouts. Morgan Stanley, J.P.

[img]http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/weirdalfoil_2322.jpg[/img] You do understand that if Intel and Nvidia formed a monopoly by working with eachother, that might make a little sense, aside from the fact that Nvidia competes with Intel on many, many computing fronts. However, microsoft? Microsoft would love it more then anything if hardware costs much less. There would be no reason for microsoft to work with Intel and Nvidia to make their products more expensive, as all that does is make it less likely someone might buy a system for Windows.

Also AMD have lots of closed off stuff they don't let others use, sure they have more open stuff but business is a business. All this post goes to show is Intel is not panicking, it is not worrying and it is doing just fine as it was a couple of months ago, they have gone up in revenue. what this does show however is how little of a change AMD ryzen has made on the mainstream front, which i'm sure for AMD is very worrying as of right now Going by the Steam stats ( i know not the best data in the world) it shows that less users have AMD cpus than Intels over the past two years, and users are using Nvidia cards more than AMD cards CPU by users: AMD 23.9% March 2015 - 20.32% March 2017 Intel 76.1% March 2015 - 79.68% March 2017 GPU by users AMD 26.6% March 2015 - 22.14% March 2017 Nivida 54.1% March 2015 - 61.21% March 2017 Intel 18.8% March 2015 - 16.27% March 2017 Noisiv Ancient Guru Posts: 5547 Joined: 2010-11-16 #5425612 Posted on: 04/28/2017 12:54 PM Quote: Originally Posted by Silva You know, fanboys will always buy i7 7700k because it's faster in today's games, even if a R7 1700 is close and has allot more horsepower under the hood and costs the same.

Yeah well... you are calling them Intel fanboys for buying CPU that's hassle free, and does not require any special attention or future expectation, and which is also the fastest in pretty much the only area where they really need it to be fast aka GAMING! OTOH maybe they don't fret much whether LAME or VirtualDub or kernel compilation ends up 10 seconds of 10 minutes earlier, because they don't use that sh1t at all?

Edition: Global   One News Page “Probably the fastest-access news portal in the world” HOME WORLD SPORTS POLITICS BUSINESS PEOPLE SCITECH Science Technology  • Computer Industry •  Internet Automotive One News Page > Computer Industry > iPhone 7 Plus Qualcomm LTE Modem Outperforms Intel LTE Modem by Significant Margin iPhone 7 Plus Qualcomm LTE Modem Outperforms Intel LTE Modem by Significant Margin Thursday, 20 October 2016 With the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple elected to use LTE modems from two different sources, Qualcomm and Intel. The A1778 and A1784 iPhone models use a GSM-only Intel XMM7360 modem while the A1660 and 1661 iPhone models use a GSM/CDMA-compatible Qualcomm MDM9645M modem. Apple's decision has already caused some disappointment among customers because the GSM-only Intel modem is not compatible with as many carrier networks as the GSM/CDMA Qualcomm modem, and now independent testing conducted by Cellular Insights suggests there are some significant performance differences between the two modems, with the Qualcomm modem outperforming the Intel modem. Using an R&S TS7124 RF Shielded Box, two R&S CMW500, one R&S CMWC controller, and four Vivaldi antennas, Cellular Insights created a setup to simulate LTE performance at different distances from a cellular tower using two iPhone 7 Plus devices, one with an Intel modem and one with a Qualcomm modem. The goal of the test was to measure the highest achievable LTE throughput starting at a Reference Signal Received Quality of -85dBm (a strong signal) and gradually reducing the power level to simulate moving away from a cellular tower where signal is weaker. Three LTE bands were tested: Band 12, Band 4 (the most common band in North America), and Band 7. In all three tests, both the iPhone 7 Plus models offered similar performance in ideal conditions, but as power levels decreased, Cellular Insights saw "unexplainable sharp dips in performance" in the Intel modem, finding a gap "north of 30%" in favor of the Qualcomm iPhone 7 Plus. In the charts, the Qualcomm modem maintains noticeably higher throughput speeds than the Intel modem as signal strength decreases. In real world conditions, this would suggest the Qualcomm modem does better in areas where the cellular connection is weak, with faster throughput speeds. Cellular Insights describes the Band 12 test below: Both iPhone 7 Plus variants perform similarly in ideal conditions. At -96dBm the Intel variant needed to have Transport Block Size adjusted as BLER well exceeded the 2% threshold. At -105dBm the gap widened to 20%, and at -108dBm to a whopping 75%. As a result of such a huge performance delta between the Intel and Qualcomm powered devices, we purchased another A1784 (AT&T) iPhone 7 Plus, in order to eliminate any possibility of a faulty device. The end result was virtually identical. [...] At -121dBm, the Intel variant performed more in line with its Qualcomm counterpart. Overall, the average performance delta between the two is in the 30% range in favor of the Qualcomm Cellular Insights also created a chart that compares the edge of cell performance of several different smartphones. The increasing numbers on the X-axis below represent increasingly poor signal strength, while on the Y-axis, a higher throughput number indicates better performance. The iPhone 7 Plus with an Intel modem demonstrates the poorest performance of all phones tested. According to Cellular Insights, in every single test, the iPhone 7 Plus with a Qualcomm modem "had a significant performance edge" over the iPhone 7 Plus with an Intel modem. For more information on the testing methodology and greater technical detail on the results, make sure to check out Cellular Insights' full comparison article.Related Roundup: iPhone 7 Discuss this article in our forums » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Buzz60 - on October 27, 2016< > Embed The iPhone 7 Secret: Is One Model Much Slower? 01:10 Reports show the newest versions of the iPhone 7 are powered by different modems and one is slower.

(AMD) Traders are reacting to GOOGL and INTC earnings results differently, while the charts are already hinting at how AMD will trade on Monday Apr 28, 2017, 2:00 pm EDT  |  By Johnson Research Group Get GOOGL alerts: Submit     View All   The market got a deluge of earnings reports from technology giants last night. Companies like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) all provided their quarterly results. In general, the numbers were great, but the market’s reaction to the numbers haven’t been completely consistent. Today’s three big stock charts takes a look at the reaction to Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Intel Corporation’s (NASDAQ:INTC) results while looking forward to Monday’s earnings release from Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). Intel Corporation (INTC) Intel gave some good numbers to Wall Street yesterday as the company beat on the top and bottom line. The color on the quarter after the release gave investors a reason to sell as PC demand and a few other metrics weren’t up to par. INTC stock is finding itself trading at a strong foundation of technical support that is likely to cause the chart watchers to step in and start buying. Outside of the simple round numbered support provided by $36, there are three major trendlines trading within a few cents of $36. This fortifies this price for Intel as short-term support. The critical 50- and 200-day moving averages are currently sitting at $35.90. The double-barreled support of these two indicators should be considerable as INTC stock works out the post-earnings selling. In addition, the 100-day moving average is just above $36, trading at 36.22. A move back above this trendline will confirm a hold of the 50- and 200-day and strengthen the intermediate-term outlook for the stock, drawing in more technical buyers. Shares of Intel have continued to lag the market; however, the 3% dividend is starting to make it more attractive as the interest rate environment has become hazy. For now, the chart is still friendly for bullish traders. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) In a perfect segue, Advanced Micro Devices announces their earnings on Monday after the market’s close. AMD is trading 1.5% lower in sympathy to Intel’s earnings results, but the stock may actually have more to lose given the chart. Unlike Intel, Advanced Micro Devices shares just got rejected by their 50-day moving average, which is rolling over. This transition alone puts AMD at risk as a the declining 50-day usually results in an increased probability that the stock will continue its decline. Support for AMD shares resides at an even $12 from the initial look at the chart. This is obviously from the round numbered nature of that price, but also a look back shows definite support and resistance from the technical activity over the last year. If $12 were to give way next week, which we are expecting to be the case, then technical traders will begin to eye $10 as the next level of solid support worthy of buying Advanced Micro Devices on a dip.  This price will have the stock deep in oversold territory as well as pressing against the stock’s 200-day moving average. The move to this price would represent an incredible 35% decline from its highs for the year, another number that would get the technical traders excited as AMD stock would represent a heavy discount against other peer companies.

The company’s first-quarter results came in close to expectations, but relatively slow growth in its vital data center business shocked investors and sent the stock down as much as 4 percent in after-hours trading Thursday. Notable numbers from first-quarter results issued Thursday: • Sales of $14.8 billion, in line with forecasts and up 8 percent from a year ago. • Profits of $3.0 billion, or 61 cents a share. That’s up from 27 cents a share last year. • Second-quarter forecast: $14.4 billion in revenue, up 6.4 percent from 2016. Earnings projected at 53 cents a share, up from 27 cents last year. • Full-year sales forecast raised by $500 million, to $60 billion, which would be a 1 percent increase from 2016. Intel expects 2017 earnings per share of $2.56. Intel is managing a difficult transition — demand for PCs and laptops is in decline, and the chipmaker still relies on that segment for more than half of its sales. In Thursday’s quarterly results, Intel reiterated that it views the PC market even more dismally than third-party analysts. Growth in Intel’s data center business has offset that decline thus far, with the chipmaker supplying nearly all the high-powered microprocessors behind the explosion in cloud computing. Intel’s data center business expanded by just 6 percent last quarter, though, held back by a decline in sales to large companies that run their own computer systems. That’s below Intel’s target of near 10 percent for the year, though the company said it still believes it will meet that goal. Late Thursday afternoon, Intel shares were down $3.63 at $36.07 in after-hours trading. When it announced first-quarter results a year ago, Intel began the biggest restructuring in its history. It ultimately eliminated 15,000 jobs through layoffs and buyouts. The company now employs 107,000 worldwide, down from 112,000 this time last year. Intel is Oregon’s largest private employer, with 19,300 workers in Washington County. That’s down just 200 from the company’s peak last year, indicating that Intel has hired for new jobs even as it eliminated positions through the restructuring. But within Intel, business groups including its sales and finance divisions continue to feel extreme pressure to reduce employment and cut costs. On Thursday, Intel said it expects to get overall corporate spending down to 30 percent of revenue by 2020. Spending was 36 percent of revenue in the first quarter, so the cuts Intel outlined Thursday suggest the company will continue making severe changes to its operations. “Hitting this goal requires spending discipline and an intense focus on our strategic priorities,” Krzanich said. He didn’t specify just how Intel will ratchet down spending, but pledged that Intel will continue to invest in markets where the company sees profitable opportunities.

In today’s tutorial, I’ll step through the entire install process in full unabridged detail. While it might seem a bit daunting to go through the Hackintosh setup process for the first time, once you understand the basics, it’s not so difficult. Have a look at our hands-on video for more details. The best wireless keyboard for the Mac? Hackintosh build hardware: Corsair Carbide Series 330R Case EVGA SuperNOVA 750W PSU GA-Z170X-Gaming 7 Motherboard Intel Core i7 6700K 4.00 GHz CPU Noctua Quiet CPU Cooler EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Founders Edition Corsair Vengeance 16GB DDR4 DRAM 802.11AC Desktop Wifi Card SanDisk Ultra II 960 GB SSD (others) Additional hardware: Mac running macOS Prepared Hackintosh-friendly hardware USB drive (8 GB minimum) Software: macOS Sierra Installer Clover EFI bootloader FakeSMC.kext AppleIntelE1000e.kext VoodooHDA Nvidia Web Driver I’ve personally built a working Hackintosh with all of the parts listed above, as I showcased in the previous post in this series. Be sure to read that post and watch the video for an explainer as to why I selected the hardware I did. Keep in mind that you don’t have to use the same hardware, but this step-by-step guide was made using these particular hardware components. Although we have included a written walkthrough as a compliment to the video, I highly recommend watching the entire 16-minute install video if this is your first Hackintosh build. In this video I walk through the entire process, including UEFI BIOS steps, all recorded using direct-feed methods. That makes for a high quality tutorial from start to finish. Video walkthrough Subscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more videos Step 1: Download macOS Sierra (10.12) from the Mac App Store The macOS Sierra Installer can be had free of charge from the Mac App Store, but you will need a Mac to download it. Once the download is completed, close the installer window that appears. Step 2: Connect and format the USB flash drive Warning: Be sure that the flash drive is free of any files that you need. Connect your flash drive to a USB port on your Mac, and launch Disk Utility. Select your USB flash drive. Be careful to select the correct drive before proceeding, or else you risk formatting the wrong disk. Select your USB flash drive and click the Erase button at the top of the Disk Utility interface. Use the following parameters: Name: Installer Format: Mac OS Extended (Journaled) Scheme: GUID Partition Map Click the Erase button to proceed. Once the drive is formatted, click Done and close Disk Utility. Step 3: Create the macOS Sierra USB install drive Launch Terminal, and use the following Terminal command to create the macOS Sierra Installer drive: sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Installer --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sierra.app --nointeraction Keep in mind that if you choose another name for the USB flash drive when performing the erase procedure in Step 2, you’ll need to modify the Terminal command to reflect those changes. Here is what the Terminal window should look like It will take some time for the macOS Installer process to finish. Be patient and let the command run to completion. Step 4: Download additional files Download the following items to your Desktop, and place them into a newly created folder called ‘Hackintosh Files’ for safe keeping: Clover EFI bootloader FakeSMC.kext AppleIntelE1000e.kext VoodooHDA Nvidia Web Driver Step 5: Install Clover EFI bootloader Extract the Clover EFI bootloader installer package and right click on the .pkg file and select Open. Click Continue. Click Continue. Click Change Install Location. Select the Install macOS Sierra flash drive and click Continue. Click Customize. Ensure the following options are checked, and click Install. You’ll next be asked to enter your Mac’s password. After doing so, click Install Software. The install process is extremely brief. Once the install is completed, you should see the Installation Complete! screen. Click Close to exit the Clover EFI bootloader tool. Once the Clover EFI bootloader is successfully installed, the EFI partition should be mounted and available to browse in Finder. If, for some reason, the EFI partition isn’t mounted, or you need to remount the partition, you can do so using Step 13 below. Step 6: Copy FakeSMC.kext and AppleIntelE1000e.kext In order to install macOS on your Hackintosh hardware successfully, you must add the FakeSMC.kext kernel extension to the EFI partition that is created and mounted upon completing the install of the Clover EFI bootloader in Step 5. You should also copy AppleIntelE1000e.kext for Ethernet support. Move both FakeSMC.kext and AppleIntelE1000e.kext (downloaded in Step 4) to /EFI/CLOVER/kexts/10.12/ Step 8: Save ‘Hackintosh Files’ folder to the Install macOS Sierra partition This is not a required step, but I recommend saving the ‘Hackintosh Files’ folder (created in Step 4) to the Install macOS Sierra partition on the USB drive. By doing so, you keep the files in an easy-to-access place for future usage. Step 8: Eject the USB drive from your Mac and connect it to your Hackintosh All of the required files are now on the USB drive. Eject the drive from your Mac, and place the drive into one of the USB ports on your Hackintosh machine. Step 7: Prepare UEFI BIOS on your Hackintosh Now that your USB drive is prepared with the macOS Installer, Clover bootloader, and supporting kexts, it’s time to install macOS on your Hackintosh machine. This is assuming that you’ve already built your Hackintosh and it has a drive, preferably an SSD, waiting to be used. But before we get to the installation, the first thing that you’ll need to do is to prepare the UEFI BIOS. This can usually be done by powering on the machine, and pressing the Delete key on a connected keyboard prior to boot. (You should see an on screen prompt asking you to do so.) Once inside, you can go through the UEFI BIOS configuration process to prepare for your Hackintosh installation. In this example, I’m going to use the GA-Z170X-Gaming 7 Motherboard that I used for my Hackintosh build. The first step is to navigate to the Save & Exit section, and select Load Optimized Defaults. Next, go to the Peripherals section, and enable XHCI handoff. Next, go to BIOS Features, and enable the UEFI USB drive as the first boot option. Lastly, go to Save & Exit, and save your changes and exit setup. Step 8: Install macOS The Clover Boot Manager will load next. Select the Boot OS X Install from Install macOS Sierra option and press the space bar to select boot options. Select the Verbose option using the space bar, and choose Boot macOS with selected options. You will see a lot of text appear on the screen since we selected Verbose mode. This allows us to see and troubleshoot any errors, if any, during the boot process. After selecting your language, the macOS Utilities window will appear. Select Disk Utility, and Erase the SSD or Hard Drive installed inside your Hackintosh. Give it a name like ‘Hackintosh HD’ for easy identification. Exit Disk Utility and select Install macOS and click Continue. Proceed through the initial macOS Sierra installer prompts. Select Hackintosh HD, or whatever you named your disk, and click Install. The Install process will take a while, so be patient. Eventually your machine will reboot. When the Clover Boot Manager appears again, select Boot macOS Install from Hackintosh HD, and press the space bar to select the Verbose boot option, and boot with the selected options. The macOS Sierra install process will continue, and after some time, your machine will reboot. Once the Clover Boot Manager appears, select Boot macOS from Hackintosh HD, and again, select Verbose mode and boot with the selected options. Work your way through the initial macOS setup process, which involves choosing your location, connecting to Wi-Fi, etc. Once you complete the setup, the macOS desktop will appear. Step 9: Install the Clover EFI bootloader on the internal drive So we don’t have to rely on the USB drive to boot into macOS, we’re going to install the Clover EFI bootloader on the internal ‘Hackintosh HD’ drive. Open the Install macOS Sierra USB drive via Finder, and navigate to the Hackintosh Files folder that you created in Step 4. Launch the Clover EFI bootloader again, and go through the same install process that we covered in Step 5. This time around, however, change the Install Location to the Hackintosh HD internal drive. Don’t forget to customize the install, and make sure the options you select match the screenshot below. Once the install is completed, the EFI partition on your internal Hackintosh HD drive should automatically be mounted. Navigate to/EFI/CLOVER/kexts/10.12 and move FakeSMC.kext and AppleIntelE1000e.kext (found in the Hackintosh Files folder) to that location. Step 10: Install the VoodooHDA audio drivers and the Nvidia Web Driver The install process for both the VoodooHDA audio drivers and the Nvidia Web Driver are extremely straightforward. Just open the packages, and proceed through the install of each. Once both are installed, reboot your machine. Step 11: Change the boot option in UEFI BIOS to the internal Hackintosh drive Press the delete key after rebooting to load the UEFI BIOS. Navigate to BIOS Features, and change the first boot option to the UEFI OS internal drive instead of the USB drive. This will force the system to invoke the bootloader stored on the internal drive so that it can work independently of the USB drive. Save the changes and exit the UEFI BIOS. Step 12: Configure Clover options Select the Options button in the Clover Boot Manager and navigate to SMBIOS. Change the Product Name and Board Version to iMac 14,2 Return to the main Clover screen, select Boot macOS from Hackintosh HD, and press the space bar to choose boot options. For boot options, select both Verbose and Use Nvidia WEB drivers (nvda_drv=1). Once these are selected, choose Boot macOS with selected options. If everything is configured correctly, macOS Sierra should load with both sound and Nvidia graphics working properly. Step 13: Manually mount the EFI partition So that you don’t have to manually change boot options upon each reboot, we’re going to modify the Clover configuration to keep those options persistent upon each reboot. To do this, we will need to mount the EFI partition manually. This can be accomplished via Terminal. To find out where the EFI partition for the internal drive resides, we can use the Terminal command: diskutil list This command will provide a list of all of the drives on your system. Thereafter, you can easily identify the device and slice (partition) of the location you wish to mount and make it available to Finder. In this example, disk0 is where the EFI partition resides on the Hackintosh internal drive. The EFI partition is located on slice 1, so the name to target is disk0s1. Before mounting this drive location, you’ll need to set a mount point. You can do so by utilizing the following Terminal command: sudo mkdir /Volumes/efi Next, it’s just a matter of mounting the EFI partition. In my case, the command will be: sudo mount -t msdos /dev/disk0s1 /Volumes/efi Keep in mind that your disk and slice location for the EFI partition may differ. Be sure to utilize the diskutil list command to pinpoint its accurate location. Step 14: Edit Clover’s Config.plist file Once the EFI partition is mounted successfully, you should see it in Finder. Open the EFI folder followed by the Clover folder. Open the Config.plist file with TextEdit, and search for the word boot. Add the key and string values highlighted in yellow. Search for BoardVersion and uncomment the BoardVersion key. Replace the string with iMac14,2 Search for ProductName and uncomment the ProductName key. Replace the string with iMac14,2 Save the Config.plist file, and exit out of the file. If you see a message about the lack of permanent version storage, just click OK. Step 15: Restart your Hackintosh! Since the Clover bootloader is installed on the internal drive, and the required configuration values were changed, you should no longer have to select boot options to boot correctly into macOS. If everything worked, macOS will boot normally when choosing Hackintosh HD from the Clover Boot Manager. For the most part, everything should work. Sound, Wi-Fi, AirDrop, App Store, GPU, Bluetooth, etc. As mentioned, it’s a Hackintosh, so not everything will work perfectly, but I find that this machine works well enough to be largely usable. Not just that, but it’s more powerful, quieter, and more expandable than many of Apple’s very own product solutions. How did you enjoy this guide?

The new Acer Predator Triton 700 is powered by a 7th Generation Intel Core processor that has been paired with an NVIDIA GeForce 10-Series discrete graphics card for the best gaming performance possible on the 15.6-inch 1080p FHD IPS display with NVIDIA G-SYNC technology. Not bad considering this gaming notebook is just 18.9 mm (.74 inch) thick and weighs in at a mere 2.6kg (5.7 pound) thanks to the aluminum chassis design. Inside you’ll also find room for two NVMe PCIe SSDs in a RAID 0 array, up to 32GB of DDR4 2400MHz memory and Killer DoubleShot Pro networking. No wonder the cooling system consists of an AeroBlade 3D Fan along with five heat pipes as you need good cooling to keep all that high-end hardware nice and cool. To top all that fancy hardware off you have an RGB backlit gaming keyboard that has a Corning Gorilla Glass plate coating. When it comes to connectivity there is a single Thunderbolt 3 port, two USB 3.0 ports, one USB 2.0 port, Gigabit wired LAN, standard sized HDMI 2.0 video out and DisplayPort 1.2 video out. “Acer is driving some incredible new products for the gaming and VR-ready category and Intel is excited to work together to push what’s possible on the PC platform,” said Frank Soqui, General Manager of the Virtual Reality and Gaming Group at Intel Corporation. “It’s amazing what can be done with the mobile form factor these days not just at the high end but also for emerging VR in the mainstream—powered by our 7th generation Intel Core high performance processors.” The Predator Triton 700 gaming notebook will be available in North America in August starting at $2,999 and in EMEA for €3,399. This model is configurable, so the price might increase if you want more expensive hardware components than the base model. That makes is one of the higher priced gaming notebooks around, but that is a steal compared to the $9,999 that Acer is looking to get for the Predator 21X.

Not content with the way that Redmond was updating its software, he decided to patch Microsoft’s patch. Zeffy is irritated with Microsoft’s decision to stop updating Windows 7 and 8.1 on newer CPUs. The company, which worked hard to push users to upgrade to Windows 10, announced in January last year that it would not update versions of these older operating systems running on seventh-generation processors (that’s Kaby Lake silicon from Intel, and Bristol Ridge silicon from AMD). A select set of products using sixth-generation Skylake processors would continue to get support until the middle of this year, it said. On April’s patch Tuesday, the policy finally took effect. Microsoft’s update messages told users of older operating systems using seventh-gen chips that their combinations of Windows version and CPU were not supported. Windows 7 and 8.1 users running Intel seventh-generation Core processors, along with AMD “Bristol Ridge/Ryzen/Zen,” and Qualcomm 8996 chips are being locked out of updates, according to Bleeping Computer. “A giant middle finger” In the Readme.md file on his Github repo, Zeffy calls this “a giant middle finger to anyone who dare not ‘upgrade’ to the steaming pile of garbage known as Windows 10”. He took matters into his own hands, expanding the Microsoft update file so that he could see all the update files it contained. Then, he excluded all the binaries that were related to Windows Update, leaving him with 14 files. He compared those with the ones already on his system, and found one file containing two functions: IsDeviceServiceable and IsCPUSupported. He patched the file to bypass those functions, preventing Windows Update from checking to see whether it liked the host CPU or not. This isn’t the first time that one person has patched another’s software. Naked Security has already written about Operation Rosehub, a volunteer effort by 50 engineers patching open source projects that used a flawed version of the Apache Common Collections library. Many projects used this code, including WebLogic, WebSphere, JBoss, and Jenkins. No one came to patch many open-source projects relying on the Apache library, so Google stepped up. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More Another example of guerrilla patching is 0patch, a project from Slovenian consulting firm Acros Security. This approach uses what the firm calls “micro-patching“, in which the binary isn’t modified at all. Instead, the patches are in-memory changes, typically shorter than a tweet, that block malware trying to exploit a particular vulnerability. The idea is to quickly patch binaries against specific exploits before the vendor can. In many cases, it can be easier to install a targeted in-memory patch than to try and test a bundle of different patches that will affect binaries directly, explained Acros co-founder Mitja Kolsek. Working around inadequate patching policies These different approaches to guerrilla patching highlight existing problems with software updates. 0patch has appeal because it’s an easier way for enterprise admins to protect their software without relying on binary patches that may break the systems. The project has now issued more than 300 patches for various products, many of which were not zero-days. Like 0patch, Operation Rosehub has appeal because in some cases, vendors simply don’t patch vulnerabilities quickly enough. In Google’s case, the problem lay with open-source projects for which no single person has responsibility. This highlights one of the key problems with open source: many eyes may eventually start a problem, but no one may step up to fix it. Zeffy’s case highlights something different altogether: selective patching, designed to support a vendor’s own agenda at the expense of its users. Microsoft’s decision to stop updating Windows 7 and 8.1 on current-generation processors furthers its own agenda, which has always been to force as many Windows users to upgrade to Windows 10 as possible. Microsoft explains this by arguing that developers would have to work too hard to support “Windows 7’s expectations” when running on newer silicon. Nevertheless, it in effect holds users of older versions to ransom, which is what irked Zeffy so much. This is unfortunate, because fighting the security battle is already hard enough. We should be able to rely on software vendors to support their products on all platforms until their official end of life. Microsoft has vowed to offer extended support for Windows 7 – which includes security updates at no extra charge – until January 2020. Windows 8 gets extended support until January 2023. If patches themselves become a battleground, and users who don’t want to upgrade their OS must begin hunting around for tools that let them patch vendors’s own patches, then system protection – already a complicated and uncertain process – becomes even more daunting for that vast majority of users that simply wants to feel safe when using their operating system. Zeffy’s irascible fix might not be the last.

If all our parents followed this dorks advice and use his patch, we will be expected to fix the issues. Everyone knows that eventually you must upgrade your hardware. Hey, where is my patch I want Windows NT back? Geeeeeese come on. Reply Andrew says: April 24, 2017 at 7:25 pm If Microsoft didn’t want to update Windows 7 until 2020 and Windows 8 until 2023, they shouldn’t have said that. Zeffy going around the “older CPU” block to get patches for his system is irrelevant. This is an issue with Microsoft not updating older operating systems, as they said they would, using hardware as the deciding factor. I personally don’t find Windows 10 the “steaming pile” that Zeffy thinks it is, however if I had a 7th gen CPU and wanted to continue using Windows 7 or 8, I shouldn’t require a special process to do so. Microsoft is advancing their agenda to get people to upgrade to Windows 10 if on newer hardware or risk being vulnerable to security deficiencies on their operating system. Bottom line is that Windows 7 and 8 are not at their End Of Life dates and as such, should continue to receive security patches. Reply Andrew says: April 24, 2017 at 7:27 pm Correction: I meant to say “older OS” in the second sentence, not “older CPU”.

Reply Mahhn says: April 24, 2017 at 8:12 pm I’d be glad to update our companies OS, if there was a proper option. W10 is junk bloatware for a business. For gaming the same thing. Every time MS releases something new/rehash, it becomes more bloated, more complicated to use, more risk issues. Business (and gamers) want a stripped down OS, efficient. MS is more like a dictator than a product. Oh sure they make a crippled version for home users, that just adds commands to limit things, but its still the same crap, not better performing. Back when,,,, we hacked XP down under 70mb in memory and it rocked for gaming (would have been good for work too if we hadn’t taken all print function out) If MS doesn’t make a better product, someone else will, and will take their market (fingers crossed sooner than later).

Reply Don Funkhouser says: April 25, 2017 at 1:10 am Not a chance. Linux still doesn’t allow users to run the software that they need. No Adobe, no real Presentation software (like for churches, concerts, etc.), poor multi-monitor support beyond 2 screens, lack of fully featured office apps (no macros in the linux alternatives), lack of top games, I could go on and on. Reply Pingu says: April 25, 2017 at 11:57 pm Linux still doesn’t allow users to run the software that they need Well if you need to run a Windows program you have to use (the correct version of) Windows or emulation – like when you need to run a Mac (or DOS) programme under Windows. If however your needs are expressed as “general functionality” there are numerous Linux options (the problem if anything is too many options) So – if you “need Adobe” as in reading and writing pdf’s there are alternatives to Acrobat that run under Linux (and Windows). – if you “need “Adobe” as in photo-editing, why aren’t you using a Mac – which is probably better than Windows or Linux (which does have photo editing software) – if you need presentation software (like Powerpoint), Open Office has Impress which certainly meets my needs for projected slides. – Open Office or Libre Office are both fully featured office suites – albeit they use options other than MS VBA for programming (Open Basic, Javascript, BeanShell, Python). – I have never gone beyond two screens but would expect there to be solutions out there (Search “Linux Multi-screen”) – Games? Yeah, Linux isn’t intended for the “top games”. But is Windows best for games or is a dedicated games system a better bet? Some Linux users curse Windows for not providing the functionality they need! Reply Jim says: April 29, 2017 at 12:15 am I sure wish there was a real alternative to Windows and Office. Until then, we’re stuck with it, and that’s not a pretty picture (with the way Windows is going.) Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. Intel’s data center chips have been a bright spot for the company over the last few years as PC demand slowed, but a weaker-than-expected performance from that group in the first quarter left investors disappointed Thursday. The Data Center Group posted quarterly revenue of $4.2 billion, up six percent from the previous year, but financial analysts were expecting the group to record $4.4 billion in revenue, according to Reuters. Investors dinged the stock in after-hours trading, despite Intel matching analyst estimates with overall revenue of $14.8 billion and net income of $2.96 billion. It’s a little surprising that cloud computing businesses continue to thrive — both Amazon Web Services and Microsoft reported strong cloud numbers Thursday — yet Intel’s enterprise computing business fell flat. The company controls nearly the entire market for modern data center processors, as would-be challengers from AMD and ARM-based chip makers have made no traction. Still, Intel did warn investors last year that growth would be slowing in this business over the next several years. Intel’s other two major processor divisions, the Client Computing Group and the Internet of Things Group, posted revenue increases of 6 percent and 11 percent, respectively.

From staff and wire reports Investors balk at GNC’s bid to extend loan Bloomberg News is reporting that investors are balking at GNC’s bid to extend the maturity on a $1.13 billion loan for another three years to 2022, saying the investors believe the Pittsburgh-based health and wellness retailer isn’t offering enough compensation in return, as well as better protections in the loan documents. The Bloomberg report was based on two unidentified people “with knowledge of the matter.” GNC shares closed Friday at $7.70, down 2 percent. CMU and Intel collaborate on $4 million video data project Intel will harness Carnegie Mellon University’s expertise in computer vision and storage systems through a three-year, $4.125 million project aimed at processing gargantuan volumes of video data. The research will allow cloud-based services to analyze video streams at scale, indexing and storing videos for future applications. Results of this work is expected to be made available to the public. Settlement would have companies pay millions for spill Residential customers and small businesses could receive thousands of dollars under a proposed settlement with the companies sued for a chemical spill and resulting water crisis in West Virginia’s capital area three years ago. If the federal court approves, the settlement filing shows West Virginia American Water would pay up to $126 million and Eastman Chemical $25 million. Thousands of gallons of a coal-cleaning agent leaked from now defunct Freedom Industries’ storage tank into the Elk River in January 2014, leaving about 300,000 people without water for up to nine days. The proposed settlement specifies that neither West Virginia American Water nor Eastman Chemical admit any liability for the spill. Apple ceases iPhone payments to Qualcomm, escalating feud Apple is refusing to pay any royalties owed to mobile chip maker Qualcomm for some of the features in the iPhone, escalating a patent feud that has turned the former partners into bitter adversaries. Apple’s decision to withhold royalties will cost Qualcomm up to $500 million in the current quarter alone, based on revised revenue estimates that Qualcomm. As retaliation, Qualcomm could seek a court order halting iPhone sales until Apple pays the royalties that Qualcomm contends it’s owed, said technology analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights and Strategy. Qualcomm hasn’t threatened to go to that extreme yet, but its top lawyer made it clear that the San Diego company is girding for a fierce fight with its Cupertino, California-based Apple, the world’s most valuable company.

Micron’s board chose Sanjay Mehrotra, most recently the president and CEO of SanDisk, to succeed Mark Durcan, who announced plans to retire in February once a successor was in place. Mehrotra will take over May 8. “Sanjay has an outstanding track record of business success and exceptional knowledge of the memory and storage industry,” said Robert E. Switz, the chairman of Micron’s board. Shareholders greeted the news favorably, sending Micron’s stock up more than 3 percent to close at $26.63 in Thursday trading. We're excited to welcome Sanjay Mehrotra as the next CEO of Micron Technology! Read more here, https://t.co/Xw60A7PVEr. pic.twitter.com/Votd5ByZUi— MicronTech (@MicronTech) April 27, 2017 Micron is Idaho’s largest publicly traded company. It employs about 6,000 people in Boise, more than any other for-profit enterprise. Mehrotra, 58, was one of three immigrants who co-founded SanDisk in the Silicon Valley in 1988, a decade after Micron’s founding in Boise. SanDisk makes flash memory chips, which Micron also makes. Flash memory is used in solid-state drives that have replaced many hard drives, and in smartphones and tablets. It is slower but cheaper than dynamic random-access memory, which Micron manufactures but SanDisk does not. Flash retains data when the device’s power is shut off, while DRAM does not. SanDisk and the larger Micron rivaled one another for years in the global flash-memory market. In the early 2000s, SanDisk sued Micron alleging patent infringement. The companies settled. In 2005, on the day Micron and Intel announced a $5.2 billion in a joint venture to make memory products in Micron plants in Utah and Virginia, SanDisk’s stock price plunged 17 percent. After Micron announced in 2015 that it and Intel Corp. had developed a new, more powerful data-storage technology that the companies named 3D XPoint, SanDisk announced that it had teamed up with Hewlett-Packard Co. to develop new technology as well. But when SanDisk put itself up for sale, Micron took interest. Around the time of the SanDisk-HP announcement, Bloomberg News reported that Micron and Western Digital Corp., which makes hard drives, were in talks with SanDisk about possibly acquiring it. Western Digital eventually bought SanDisk for $19 billion, and Mehrotra stepped down. His arrival at Micron comes as the company enjoys strong revenues and profits. Micron’s most recent quarter was one of its best ever, with revenues up 58 percent from a year earlier. “Micron is proud to initiate this change in leadership from a position of strength,” the board’s announcement said. Born in India, Mehrotra earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in electrical engineering and computer sciences from the University of California, Berkeley. He helped pioneer flash storage solutions, and he guided a 17-year joint venture with Toshiba in NAND flash memory technology. He holds more than 70 patents.   Under Mehrotra, the Micron board does not anticipate major changes in direction, but instead aims to “ensure we continue to invest in areas of the business that will accelerate Micron’s market and technology position and enable timely delivery of new and innovative products,” a company statement said. SanDisk is based in Milpitas, Calif., bordering San Jose in Silicon Valley. Micron has an office there. Mehrotra will work there and in the Boise headquarters. Durcan, who announced his retirement after 32 years with the company, will stay on as an adviser until August. He leaves a legacy as a strong CEO, especially for someone who never planned to have the job. In early 2012, Durcan announced he was leaving his post as Micron’s president and chief operating officer to spend time with his family. Then on Feb. 3, 2012, CEO and board chairman Steve Appleton was killed in a crash of an experimental aircraft near Boise Airport. “I don’t think there is any question he rescued Micron at a moment when no one knew what was going to happen next,” Boise State University President Bob Kustra said after Durcan’s retirement announcement. Durcan plans to stay in Boise. He has accepted a position on the St. Luke’s Health System board of directors. “We deeply appreciate the immense contributions that Mark has made to our company,” Micron said.

Capable of handling over 90,000 IOPS in 4K random writing, FS2017 is perfect for big data analysis, video post-production, virtualization, and handling any demanding database application. FS2017 is powered by an 8-core Intel® Xeon® D processor together with 16 Gigabytes of DDR4 ECC RDIMM that is expandable up to 128GB. The cutting-edge hardware delivers high performance and throughput even with multitasking and multiple virtual machines hosted. Four Gigabit ports allow simple plug-and-play into existing RJ45 based networks, ensuring continual network uptime. For higher bandwidth applications, the dual 10GBASE-T ports with the option of an additional 10GbE / 25GbE / 40GbE NIC can maximize throughput and meet data-intensive requirements. "A common challenge for RAID on SSDs is how to prevent multiple drives from failing at the same time," said Vic Hsu, CEO at Synology Inc. "RAID F1 is designed precisely to address this pain point. With a special algorithm for workload distribution among SSDs, RAID-F1 enhances the resilience of your flash storage pool to ensure data safety." "Businesses need reliable and easy-to-use storage solutions that give them immediate access to their most critical data," said Ran Senderovitz, vice president and general manager of Intel's Wireless Consumer and Commercial Infrastructure Group. "The Intel® Xeon® D processor family delivers exceptional efficiency, performance, and I/O options, offering a strong foundation for storage solutions." FS2017 runs on Synology's award-winning NAS operating system DSM, with built-in Snapshot Replication which creates up to 65,000 backup copies to offsite servers, and a virtualization solution that incorporates VMware, Citrix, Hyper-V, and OpenStack integration. Together with Windows ACL, Windows® AD and LDAP integration support, FS2017 is an exceptionally capable NAS for any large-scale businesses. FS2017 is available worldwide immediately.

You should mention it's a 24-bay Uh, it's at 90k IOPS 4k random write. The m.2 NVMe 950 Pro does about half that on StorageReview, so I'm not sure what single SSD you're referring to. I mean sure, a few SSDs in a RAID 0 would probably outperform this thing but have no reliability. Adding on some redundancy for keeping data a bit safer and your overall IOPS will drop as you have to then run parity calculations on the data you're writing. Homebrew solutions can always be made cheaper and faster than business/enterprise grade stuff, but lack the one thing that a lot of businesses need: support. But I mean hey, no one is stopping anyone else from building their own solution cheaper and faster and selling it with support, which would happen if this was such a terrible offering.

The Nasdaq Composite pushed further above the 6,000 level at the open, setting a new intra-day high after a batch of big-tech earnings overnight. But the results were mixed, with Microsoft (MSFT) and Intel (INTC) disappointing. Quotes in the article Intel Corp INTC ▼ 36.15 -1.28 -3.42% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▲ 68.46 +0.19 +0.28% Facebook Inc FB ▲ 150.25 +2.55 +1.73% Time Inc TIME ▼ 15.20 -3.10 -16.94% AdChoices Also, weighing on sentiment is lingering disappointment with President Trump’s tax proposal on Wednesday (light on details and set to add trillions to the national debt), a lack of progress on healthcare reform, and ongoing concerns about a potential government shutdown (despite a one-week stopgap bill moving through Congress). But above all, investors were unhappy with a very weak Q1 U.S. GDP growth report: Coming in at just 0.7% as consumer spending posted its weakest result since the end of 2009. In the end, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2% as it bonked on overhead resistance from its early March highs, the S&P 500 lost 0.2%, the Nasdaq Composite lost a fraction and the Russell 2000 finished 1.2% lower. Treasury bonds were unchanged, the dollar was little change, gold gained 0.2% and crude oil gained 0.7% but was unable to recover the 1.3% loss from Thursday. Related: 7 Tech Stocks That Will Bruise Your Portfolio The gains in T-bonds boosted the ProShares Ultra Treasury Bond (UBT) to a 0.9% gain so far this month for Edge subscribers. © Provided by InvestorPlace Breadth was negative, with 1.6 decliners for every advancer on the NYSE on heavy volume, at 122% of the 30-day average. Technology stocks led the way with a 0.3% gain thanks mainly to Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) and Facebook (FB). The vertical surge in GOOG looks a lot like the 1999/2000 dot-com craziness as investors piled in following the reporting of better-than-expected results on strong advertising revenue on Thursday night. © Provided by InvestorPlace On the downside, Time (TIME) fell 16.9% after announcing it had rejected a number of expressions of buyout interest — fueling fears of fiefdom on the part of management. Synchrony Financial (SYF) fell 15.9% after a big Q1 earnings miss on higher loan loss reserves. Intel (INTC) fell 3.5% despite reporting solid results amid a focus on weakness in its data center group. And Starbucks (SBUX) fell 2% after reporting weaker-than-expected comp-store sales growth and issued lowered earnings guidance. Returning to the economy, GDP growth slowed from the 2.1% pace set in 4Q16 to its slowest pace in three years. Personal consumption increased just 0.3% following a 3.5% expansion in Q4; which is exceedingly odd given off-the-charts survey-based measures of consumer confidence in recent months. Bright spots included non-residential fixed investments (businesses are ramping up spending). Inventories were a drag. Still, the weakness doesn’t appear set to slow the Federal Reserve rate hike pace. Inflation picked up, rising at a 2.4% annual rate for the biggest jump since 2011. The labor market remains strong. Confidence levels are high. And Wall Street anticipates a Q2 rebound in GDP growth. We’ll know more when the Federal Reserve holds its policy meeting next Wednesday and when the latest jobs numbers are released on Friday. We’ll also get updates on personal income and consumption, motor vehicle sales (a recent worry), and fresh data on labor costs and productivity. It’s a busy schedule, made worse by the ongoing need for Congress and the White House to pass a long-term budget deal.© Provided by InvestorPlace Expect market volatility to intensify. In anticipation, Edge Pro subscribers added a new put option position against Bank of America (BAC) as the bank looks ready to drop out of a large head-and-shoulders reversal pattern that traces a price target below its 200-day moving average.

The intel compute sticks with the m5 cpu is up to the job, but are out of my price range. Totally different price bracket than the Atom based units.   Anyone know of a similar type device, with more CPU and perhaps at a more reasonable price from our friends in China?

If your smart TVs with Plex it's probably only needing to change container format or audio format, and not having to down sample the resolution.

The event could see the firm reveal new hardware and software solutions aimed specifically at students. In terms of hardware, the tech world is still waiting for Microsoft to present its new generation tablet, the Surface Pro 5. The Redmond-based firm could use its education-themed event to do that — so long as the device has something specific to offer students. In any case, rumours are heating up on specialist websites, suggesting that the tablet could feature the latest-generation Intel processors (Kaby Lake), boosting performance and battery life. However, Microsoft is unlikely to unveil the eagerly awaited new range of Surface Phone smartphones or a Surface Book 2 PC at the May 2 event. Above all, Microsoft could present a Surface 4 — a low-cost device tailored to users on tight budgets. This new tablet could also be the first device to run Windows 10 Cloud, a pared-down and partially cloud-based version of Microsoft’s famous operating system. The concept is similar to Chrome OS, used in Google’s low-cost Chromebook PCs popular with students. The Cloud OS aims to provide a lightweight operating system for the least powerful computers on the market. As the name suggests, the system is focused on cloud computing, which is useful for PCs that don’t have much storage space. Users can, for example, use Microsoft programs already available in the cloud, such as MS Office, rather than installing them directly on their computer. Microsoft has more than the May 2 event in store this spring, as the Microsoft Build developers’ conference opens a few days later, running May 10 to 12 in Seattle.

Follow Us On Facebook Follow Us On Twitter Most Viewed on the Web Popular on Twitter Receive Our Daily Headlines   HOME | USA Pentagon Investigating Foreign Payments to Ex-Trump Adviser WASHINGTON  The Pentagon is investigating whether former US National Security Adviser Michael Flynn failed to fulfill his obligation to report payments he received from foreign governments after a visit to Moscow in 2015. US lawmakers reported Thursday that the internal auditing department of the Defense Intelligence Agency notified them two weeks ago that it is investigating whether the retired general failed to receive the required authorization prior to being paid some $45,000 in 2015 by Russia. Flynn allegedly received the money in exchange for his participation that year in a gala for the 10th anniversary of Russias RT television, a dinner at which he shared a table with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In addition, Flynns company  Flynn Intel Group  last year received $530,000 from a Turkish interest group, something that should have been reported to the Justice Department every six months and which he did not do. The DIA, which Flynn headed until 2014, warned him upon his departure that he could not receive money in the form of donations or payments for services from foreign governments and assured Congress that it has no evidence to date that the retired official reported or requested permission to receive money from Moscow. Flynn, who resigned as national security adviser in February after it emerged that he had hidden his Russian contacts from Vice President Mike Pence, is being investigated by a special legislative commission about his links to Russia. The Defense Department investigation could freeze the payment of Flynns pension as a retired army general, as well as provide evidence in the probe Congress is conducting to determine if there was any Russian attempt to influence the result of the November election to favor Trump. Flynns attorney, Robert Kelner, said that the former Trump adviser, one of the most hawkish voices against Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton during the election campaign, did report his payments from Russia.   Enter your email address to subscribe to free headlines (and great cartoons so every email has a happy ending!) from the Latin American Herald Tribune:   RSS Feed [ Home ] [ About Us ] [ Who's Who ] [ Contacts ] [ Help ] Copyright Latin American Herald Tribune - 2005-2015 © All rights reserved
TechRadar pro IT insights for business Search RSS US Edition News Reviews Insights TechRadar Laptops/PCs Printers Hardware Software Mobile Working Security Networks VPN Data Centre News Here comes the most secure smartphone in the world Here comes the most secure smartphone in the world By Darren Allan Mobile phones   John McAfee’s Privacy Phone won’t be cheap, though Shares Later this year, John McAfee plans to launch a smartphone which boasts such tight levels of security that it’s streets ahead of the likes of the Blackphone. The security expert (who founded the eponymous antivirus company – which is now a standalone firm separate from Intel, incidentally) talked to Newsweek about the handset, which he said was the result of ‘enormous investment’. The John McAfee Privacy Phone – someone certainly likes using their own name in their creations – is an Android handset which will not just sport software security features, but also hardware measures. The latter will include a bank of switches on the rear of the device which allow the user to actually physically disconnect components such as the antennas for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS, and also the battery, camera, and microphone. McAfee also noted that the phone would be prevented from connecting to a Stingray or other IMSI-catcher device (used for surveillance and tapping into nearby mobile phones), and that it would contain “a web search anonymiser”. Further security features weren’t detailed, and neither were any specs – these won’t be revealed until the week before its launch, which is expected to be later this year, as mentioned. Light years ahead McAfee told Newsweek that: “[The phone] is not hack proof but it does give the user enormous power over his or her privacy and it is light years ahead of the Blackphone or any other phone claiming to be secure.” The bad news? The John McAfee Privacy Phone (which will be released by McAfee’s firm MGT) will be priced at $1,100 (around £850, AU$1,470), which makes even Apple’s prices look cheap. That’s mainly because this is a phone aimed at business users who really need that extra-tight security – although well-off consumers who truly value privacy may also be interested, of course. A second incarnation of the phone will apparently be out in the summer of 2018, with McAfee claiming this will be as “hack proof as humanly possible”. The sequel probably won’t be called the John McAfee Even More Privacy Phone.

The publication, titled “5G Spectrum Recommendations” is available for download here. Key recommendations include: Collaborative regulatory decisions regarding spectrum in the 700 MHz, 24 GHz and above, and the 3 GHz bands; Leverage harmonization to facilitates global economies of scale for mobile broadband and roaming; Flexibility in licensure so particular bands aren’t “tied to a particular technology, a generation of mobile technology, or a particular use case.” Reza Arefi, Intel’s Director of Spectrum Strategy, said, “Widespread harmonization of adequate spectrum could have a very positive effect in providing an important foundation for the timely deployment of 5G systems.” He encouraged “key stakeholders to embrace appropriate harmonized spectrum allocations to accommodate the variety of emerging 5G applications that together build the connected societies of the future.” Chris Pearson, president of the industry association, called spectrum “the lifeblood of our mobile wireless ecosystem. As we heard toward 5G deployments, it is expected that low-, mid- and high-band spectrum–including licensed spectrum, bands shared with other services and unlicensed spectrum, will play a critical role in the healthy future of the mobile wireless industry.” While the next-generation mobile standard is still going through the 3GPP process, the primary use cases are enhanced mobile broadband, massive machine-type communications and mission critical services that require ultra low latency and ultra high capacity, like remote industrial control, for instance. While some carriers have already launched services including the “5G” designation, that’s widely regarded as marketing hype and based on technologies including 4×4 MIMO, 256 QAM and three-channel carrier aggregation, which are LTE-Advanced technologies.   Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) 5G 5G Americas millimeter wave Spectrum unlicensed spectrum About Author Sean Kinney Managing EditorSean Kinney focuses on multiple subject areas including DAS, small cells, cloud computing, 5G and Internet of Things vertical applications.

Follow us: Release dates: every game confirmed for 2017 Mass Effect Andromeda guide, tips and walkthrough PC PS4 Xbox One Destiny GTA 5 Battlefield Pokemon Overwatch Guides Ticker Call of Duty: WW2 teaser site goes live with enough cryptic information to keep you busy for a while Saturday, 29 April 2017 13:00 GMT By Stephany Nunneley Share on: Facebook Twitter Reddit Google+ A teaser site for Call of Duty: WW2 has gone online, and Sledgehammer wants those visiting the site to have a bit of fun figuring out the mysteries locked behind an ARG. We’re going to continue updating this post as more information is cracked. As the different steps to the puzzle are solved, we will update this page accordingly. Part One – Zombies Earlier this week when Call of Duty: WW2 was revealed, a teaser image for Nazi Zombies was released showing a typical, rotting, undead fella wearing a German military helmet. When the image is brightened, on the inside rim of the zombie’s helmet you can see some letters. These letters, per reddit are: IUFDJ BHLOP JMUBA. Upon entering these numbers on the typewriter, the three lights go green and a message pops up: “A New Horror Rises” before three images appear: a document folder with signatures and letters and numbers on the side of it; a worn image of Holy Roman Emperor and King of Burgundy and Germany, Frederick Barbarossa (Frederick I); and an image of Raphael’s famous painting, Portrait of a Young Man. Between reddit and Charlie Intel, a few things have been figured out. First up, the numbers on the typewriter’s serial plate, or Enigma Machine, are coordinates to Dunkirk, France where the Battle and Siege of Dunkirk took place in 1944. The image of Frederick Barbarossa likely points Operation Barbarossa, which was the codename of the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. There is an interesting theory regarding Frederick I on the Call of Duty Zombies subreddit regarding an Arthurian “sleeping hero” legend tied to the ruler. According to this the legend, Frederick is asleep with his knights in a cave located in the Kyffhauser mountain range, and when the “ravens cease to fly around the mountain, he will awake and restore Germany to its ancient greatness,” according to Wikipedia. There’s more to the story, so just click the Wiki link. The theory on the reddit page, is that the “horror” which rises may pertain to Barbarossa’s knights. That’s rather interesting, to be honest. Raphael’s painting seen in the fifth image, was one of many works of art stolen by the Nazi’s during World War 2. The painting was stolen from the Czartoryski Museum in Krakow, Poland in 1945 and its whereabouts are still unknown. The numbers and letters on the side of the folder, which can be seen much better when viewing the Call of Duty: WW2 website on mobile, show the following: FORM – YMF – 212514 – 12123 – 131. Some state these are more coordinates pointing to the Battle of Dunkirk, others seem to think the numbers are the next set of inputs needed for Stage 2 of the ARG. When plugging the numbers into the Enigma Machine on the website, and succeeding on to the next page with the images, you can click “go back to decoder” and it machine will once again be on the screen. At this point, it appears you’ll need to enter another code again at some point to continue finding out more information. Part Two – The Characters It appears more information has come out of the Call of Duty: WW2 teaser site, thanks to some finagling by users over on reddit. Leave it to folks who know how to use Java, html and other website scripts that make our heads hurt. We thank them for that. While the next list of codes to enter on the Enigma Machine weren’t posted, it seems the inputs were figured out by using “brute force” using various url entries. I’m not sure how such sorcery works, but whatever gets the job done. Once users got past what was locked, four new file folders were unlocked, each the subject of a specified character with their current status and backgrounds. Three of these characters will be playable in game, according to a Games Radar chat with Sledgehammer’s Michael Condrey. The main story follows two members of the 1st Infantry, which you saw in the reveal stream, and a woman in the French Resistance. Alex also gleaned this information when he attended the Call of Duty: WW2 reveal in London. Artwork for the characters along with a British solider are posted below. Major Edgar Crowley: Special Operatives Executive (SOE). The SOE was a British WW2 organization which was formed to aid resistance movements against Germany. He is listed in the file as once of the “Agents in France” and it shows a map with what appears to be a route marked in red. I can’t see it very well, but it looks to start in Orleans with an arrow pointing to what appears to be Dijon. During WW2, Dijon was occupied by German forces before it was liberated by the French Army and the French Resistance, in 1944. It seems a bit too far up on the map to be Lyon, a major place of Resistance during WW2. But, again, it’s hard to tell and I have looked at many maps of France and still can’t be quite sure. The document in the file is in French and quite blurry so I can’t make it out. The page shows a STEN Submachine gun, which I assume he prefers to use. There is another map which looks to be France, with a red, half circle. Private Ronald “Red” Daniels: 1st Infantry Division, 16th Infantry Regiment. The 1st Infantry Division fought in various part of Europe during the war, with the last push in Germany. The 16th regiment fought in many a battle during WW2, and also stormed the beaches of Normandy on D-Day. Daniels hails from Texas and is recently engaged. His service weapon is the M1 Garand, and a diary entry next to the rifle states he and the others are practicing their French accents. Rosseau: First name unknown. She is the leader of the Maquis, which were one of the bands of French Resistance fighters. She is part of the French Forces of the Interior, which was the formal name French president Charles de Gaulle gave the Resistance toward the end of World War 2. The second part of her file shows her sitting with two men, and another part of the file shows her Deutsches Reich Reisepass, which was issued to German citizens who intended to travel to foreign countries. Her photo ID is torn in the middle. The next image shows a letter, again in French, and a picture of German occupied Paris. Private Robert Zuassman: 1st Infantry Division, 16th Infantry Regiment. Zussman is from Chicago, his best friend is Daniels, and there is memo attached to his file. I can’t make it out, but in the upper right corner of it, there are five stars and the initials E.J. or E.S. His weapon is a M1A1 Carbine, and there’s a letter he wrote attached made out to a girl back home named Susie. There’s also a booklet titled: First in First to Win with the following printed on it: “Well done, solider. Now claim your calling card,” and it’s dated February 3, 1944. So there’s that. None of this new information seems to be about zombies, but at least now you know a bit more information on who you will be playing in the game. Again, we’ll update this with more information as it comes out of the teaser site. Give it all a go yourself through the official website, and keep checking back with it, because we expect more ARG type of fun in the coming days and weeks leading up to the Zombie and multiplayer reveal at E3 2017.

By Daniel Rubino Friday, Apr 28, 2017 at 11:21 am EDT 52 Comments Daniel Rubino is executive editor of Windows Central. He has been covering Microsoft since 2009 back when this site was called WMExperts (and later Windows Phone Central). His interests include Windows, Surface, HoloLens, Xbox, and future computing visions. Follow him on Twitter: @daniel_rubino. "Mixed Reality," or MR, is coming soon to a PC near you. How does it differ from Microsoft's HoloLens, and what's so cool about it? We just tried it out for the first time, and we have some answers. Yesterday, Acer held a large press conference in New York City. The company announced half a dozen new and exciting Windows 10 PCs. But I was there for another reason: Windows Mixed Reality. Acer had its Mixed Reality headset available for the media to try (and not just look at). Honestly, I did not know exactly what Mixed Reality was in relation to Windows 10 on your PC, especially because most PCs now support it after the Creators Update. Here is what I learned about Windows 10 Mixed Reality, how it differs from HoloLens, when you can get it, and what it'll cost. What is Mixed Reality? There are many related terms these days, including Virtual Reality (VR), Holographic, Augmented Reality (AR), and now Mixed Reality. Microsoft used to refer to the whole venture as Windows Holographic VR, but evidently it now calls it Windows Mixed Reality. Microsoft calls this Mixed Reality because it uses components from all of these terms, depending on the hardware and application in use. Some apps you may run could be truly immersive, like any standard VR game on Oculus Rift or the HTC Vive. Other apps may make use of your real-world surroundings, which get mapped into the system. In other words, Mixed Reality is a spectrum of experiences that includes holographic (HoloLens) all the way to an Acer MR headset. It's all powered by Windows 10 and the Universal Windows Platform (UWP). It's a very flexible system that can scale to all types of hardware. This is akin to answering the question, "What is a PC?" Do you mean a compute stick, a 17-inch gaming laptop, or a full desktop PC with multiple monitors? They all are PCs. The Windows Mixed Reality platform was announced in June 2016 at Computex. The hardware is just now coming online, but there is still some time before they'll reach consumers' hands. Mixed Reality is NOT HoloLens ... but still kind of is Microsoft HoloLens is a self-contained Windows 10 PC that you wear on your head. Powered by an Intel Atom processor, it can run the Windows 10 Holographic platform on its own, untethered for a few hours at a time. Just as importantly, you always see the real-world environment around you. HoloLens also costs $3,000, a price that "regular people" will never pay. Mixed Reality headsets, at least some that are initially coming to consumers, differ in substantive ways from HoloLens. Here are a few examples: Pricing starts at $349. You are tethered via a single cable to your Windows 10 PC. Your view is occluded like a traditional VR headset. Your PC powers the headset, meaning instead of an Intel Atom processor you could be using a brand-new quad-core Core i7 with a NVIDIA GTX 1080ti. Microsoft plans to knock down the specification requirements this year so that even integrated Intel HD graphics will be enough to power it. Acer Mixed Reality Head-Mounted Display: features and specifications Here is exactly what the Acer headset features: Category Acer Mixed Reality HMD Operating System Windows 10 Creators Update Display Liquid crystal display Resolution 2880 x 1440 (1440 x 1440 per eye) Refresh rate Up to 90 Hz Audio Audio out and microphone support through 3.5mm jack Tracking system Inside-out tracking Dimensions 94.8 (W) x 195.8 (D) x 106.59 (H) mm Weight 350 g (cable not included) Color options Clear Blue Connection HDMI 2.0 and USB 3.0 in one 4m cable Sensors Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer, Proximity Sensor It's like Samsung's Gear VR with Windows 10 Windows 10 Mixed Reality is like Samsung Gear VR but with higher quality graphics. While wearing the headset you have full access to the power of your Windows 10 PC, including all its UWP apps even if they are only 2D. You could launch Microsoft Edge with a dozen tabs, watch a flick on Movies & TV, play Minecraft, or launch the Xbox app to stream a game from your Xbox One. What do you actually see? What is like when you wear a Mixed Reality headset? Microsoft created a virtual world that's like a modern and expensive home. You have an office, living room space, very open windows with light coming in, and you move around with the virtual cursor. It's called "Cliff's house." Microsoft will likely have more environments once it all launches. But yesterday, we all hung out at Cliff's house. Like HoloLens, you can pin UWP apps in your world around you and access them with a glance and a controller. How do you control things? You use an Xbox One controller. The Xbox button acts as a Start key for the menu, and the A button is the Enter key. The Windows 10 UI and shell are very much like HoloLens but a little more polished. Using your gaze, you have a focal point to know where you are looking. Point it at an area across the virtual room and hit the Y button, and you "teleport" there. It's smart, intuitive and easy to use. Using an Xbox controller is logical, too, because Microsoft announced plans to bring the Mixed Reality experience to the Xbox One family of devices, including the new "Project Scorpio:" Xbox in 2018. Does it run HoloLens apps? Yes and no. Like all things UWP, there are usage restrictions on some apps. For instance, HoloLens is geared towards professionals, like on an assembly line where they need to overlay a virtual turbine onto the real one for a quick check, for example. Something like that, where things interact with the real world, may not be in Windows 10 Mixed Reality, because it doesn't make sense. RoboRaid on HoloLens can be used in Windows Mixed Reality. That does not mean games like RoboRaid, where alien baddies pop out of your wall, cannot work. On the contrary, the Mixed Reality headset can map your room and still have things come out of your virtual walls like standard VR. So, games that use your environment can work here too. That's up to the developer. Is it comfortable to wear? And can you wear glasses? Yes to both. The Acer headset weighs only 350g, which is just over a half a pound. In a real-world sense, it felt like putting on a Scuba mask. There is also space to wear corrective lenses, so no worries if you need to wear them during your time in MR. Is it a good experience? Yes! As someone who uses a HoloLens, the first thing I noticed was the improved app performance. The difference between running UWP apps on an Intel Atom processor versus an Intel Core i7 for PC is the same experience in MR. Apps opened instantly, were very smooth, and it all felt natural. My hunch is that manufacturers will create various tiers of MR headsets some with basic resolution and others adding more for resolution, and features. Just like buying a new PC display. But what do you do with it? The usage scenarios for Windows 10 Mixed Reality can range from gaming to watching movies, TV (Sling), browsing the web, or whatever you want, really. The key takeaway is that Windows 10 Mixed Reality is just another screen. It takes your Windows 10 laptop with its 2D display and makes a 360-degree immersive environment, and you get to run all your Windows 10 UWP apps. It's another form of Continuum. You're taking one experience and powering a different one. If you like having multiple desktop views on your PC, think of having a whole Mixed Reality world where you can put all your work around you. Go ahead and pin a browser to your right, your Word document in front of you, and have a video playing to the right. It's all very "Minority Report," just without the holograms projected into your real world. When can you get it? The bad news is that these headsets are not expected to ship until later this year, specifically during the 2017 holiday season. While Windows 10 is now ready for Mixed Reality with the Creators Update, there is still work to do, including getting the devices into the hands of developers. Microsoft wants a long ramp-up time so that when you pick one up, you will have a catalog of experiences, games, and apps readily available to make it more than just a gimmick. How to use the Windows Mixed Reality simulator in Windows 10 Creators Update I think this is the right approach even if it's frustrating. Mixed Reality is going to take a few years to become mainstream, and this is the beginning. For $349, I think this add-on device is going to be a ton of fun for people. There's no hardware to set up, the investment is minimal, and a whole generation of users will be able to jump into the experience. It's also evident that Microsoft is planning for a future without physical displays. While it's hard to envision computing being holographic, or even using Mixed Reality daily, Microsoft is now steadfastly headed in that direction. And I'm excited about the journey.

Me too. 4 1 day ago Reply Danial Hilow Seems very cool and fun. This is the stuff that will probably be popular with consumers. 2 1 day ago Reply OMG55 Don't get to excited, we always see cool MS stuff in Tech websites from MS but never see any televised marketing until Apple or Samsung copies it and markets it; MS is dependent on Windows Central only, because most other sites tend to bash MS constantly. Their first to the party behind the scenes but last to market in the real world. -1 1 day ago Reply pessimistic observer uploadvr also gave the dev kit a worl and came away impressed. 0 1 day ago Reply xiForza5 So, if MS lower the specs required and can run on an intel iGPU then it can run on Xbox One (S) obviously with few sacrifices and have a taste of the VR without having to buy Project Scorpio, so this one will be the one who get the more graphic intensive VR games. 0 1 day ago Reply KickAssLumia They really need to make this work for gaming! If that picks up fast and the experience is better than say PS-VR, then people will start focussing on finding other use cases for it. I really hope they make gaming and entertainment the prime focus of this version 1 of the product. 0 1 day ago Reply pessimistic observer the rift and vive are better at gaming than psvr so that doesn't really bode well for ms 0 1 day ago Reply Manus Imperceptus At a completely different price point... 0 1 day ago Reply DoctorSaline I'm actually a bit disappointed since I thought it would be similar to HoloLens in that it will have semi transparent glass capable of VR, AR (augmenting real world virtually) AND Holographic Reality (with virtual environment on top of real environment) and I thought Mixed Reality would mean putting virtual world on top of real world first and foremost. Apparently not. Which makes me think mixed reality is a very misleading name until OEMs can come up with a HoloLens clone under $400 and windows support all these scenarios natively. For now I've to agree with Tom's hardware on this. This is a poor mans VR headset albeit with better technology and native OS and ecosystem support. 1 1 day ago Reply Daniel Rubino So, I don't believe anything precludes that from happening i.e. a company could make that and sell it. But holographic abilities are a bit different than just VR/Mixed reality, so the price would still go up. All of those prisms, etc. needed for holograms is still super tricky. 2 1 day ago Reply Remy_S Couldn't they have made a hybrid system, when I heard Mixed reality I expected this to be fully enclosed but with cameras in front so you'd see your surroundings on screen and then have the VR/holograms laid on top of that. 1 1 day ago Reply Kimmo Toivanen I also thought, that the real environment could be taken from the cameras and alternate reality rendered over that in AR mode. Since there is some sort of depth mapping, things could be on, over and through walls and tables, similar to Hololens. If the cameras are purely for depth mapping and avoiding objects, it's really disappointing and just another VR. 1 21 hours ago Reply Manus Imperceptus I'm hoping for something like this too, down the line. I guess this is simply Microsoft's answer to PlayStation VR. The differentiator is the UWP concept, that'll allow us to use it with PC's as well as Xbox and Scorpio. Hopefully they'll have it running on standard graphics cards before launch! And they better hit the ground running with some great games, programs and accessories; an Xbox controller will not be enough for a real VR experience... Let's see a pair of full on gloves with pressure pads for true immersion! B-) 1 1 day ago Reply Tom Westrick How viable would it be to just use this as a "dumb" display? Preferably for full screen gaming, both UWP games from the Store and traditional games from Steam.  0 1 day ago Reply Daniel Rubino Very viable. Like, I could totally see just putting this on and running your PC that way. It's kind of awesome especially for game streaming (Xbox app) or watching movies. People do that with Samsung Gear VR now, but this is much more powerful (and looks better). It's like HTV Vive but now you can run your PC thru it instead of just games. It's like Gear VR in the lightness/ease of use, but you can do productivity with it. 3 1 day ago Reply Tom Westrick That sounds perfect for me. I may get this (or another version) when it hits retail 0 1 day ago Reply Spectrum90 Resolution must suck. This headset is not enough to replicate 1 monitor with 1920 resolution. For a 3 monitor environment you need more than 4k per eye. Maybe in a couple of years it could be posible to replace real world multi-monitor environment.. 0 1 day ago Reply Daniel Rubino It's $329 and Device #1 of what are to be many more from OEMs with differing features and price points. Honestly, let's go for your 4K model. What's the cost, grand or two? Now make that your first device into a new market and see where it goes. Also, having tried it, no, it did not "suck". Could it be better?

For the week, the blue-chip Dow rose 1.9 percent, and the broader S&P 500 gained 1.5 percent, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq increased 2.3 percent. A slew of tech companies reported first quarter earnings on Thursday after the closing bell. Google's parent company Alphabet reported first-quarter revenue of 24.75 billion U.S. dollars, up 22 percent year on year. Shares of Alphabet rose more than 4 percent by noon. Shares of Amazon rose nearly 2 percent at midday after the company reported diluted earnings per share of 1.48 dollars in the first quarter. Intel reported earnings per share of 0.61 dollar, up 45 percent year on year. The company's first-quarter revenue stood at 14.8 billion dollars, up 8 percent compared to the same period last year. Microsoft's first-quarter revenue stood at 22.1 billion dollars, while the company's net income reached 4.8 billion dollars. The Dow component Exxon Mobil announced Friday the estimated first quarter earnings of 4 billion dollars, or 0.95 dollar per diluted share, compared with 1.8 billion dollars a year earlier, exceeding market expectations. Chevron, also a Dow component, reported earnings of 2.7 billion dollars or 1.41 dollars per diluted share on Friday. Ford reported Thursday first quarter total company revenue was 39.1 billion U.S. dollars, up 4 percent year on year, driven by favorable mix. However, profit fell year-on-year due to higher costs, lower volume and unfavorable exchange rates. American Airlines reported first-quarter earnings of 0.46 dollar per diluted share, and a 2-percent increase in total revenue, to 9.6 billion dollars. Dow component Boeing reported its first-quarter earnings before the Wednesday's opening bell. The company's earnings per share increased to 2.34 U.S. dollars while the revenue decreased to 21.0 billion dollars. Shares of Twitter ended at 15.82 dollars per share on Wednesday, soared 7.91 percent, after it reported better-than-expected earnings after several quarters of disappointing results. Caterpillar reported first-quarter earnings and revenue on Tuesday that far exceeded Wall Street's expectations, sending shares 7 percent higher in early trading. Excluding restructuring costs, the company reported first-quarter profit of 1.28 dollars per share, doubling that of the first quarter last year. Shares of DuPont rallied over three percent in early trading, Tuesday after it reported a better-than-expected profit for the seventh straight quarter, helped by a rise in seed sales. The company's first-quarter earnings per share increased 9 percent to 1.52 dollars from 1.39 dollars in prior year. McDonald's also reported higher first-quarter earnings Tuesday with net income of 1.2 billion dollars, up eight percent from a year ago. On the economic front, the U.S. real gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of 0.7 percent in the first quarter, the weakest pace in three years, according to the "advance" estimate released by the Commerce Department Friday. U.S. new orders for manufactured durable goods in March increased 1.6 billion dollars, or 0.7 percent, to 238.7 billion dollars, the U.S. Census Bureau announced Thursday. In a separate report, the bureau said the international trade deficit was 64.8 billion dollars in March, up 0.9 billion dollars from 63.9 billion dollars in February. In the week ending April 22, the advance figure for seasonally adjusted initial claims was 257,000, an increase of 14,000 from the previous week's revised level, according to the country's Department of Labor. The four-week moving average was 242,250, a decrease of 500 from the previous week's revised average. The previous week's average was revised down by 250 from 243,000 to 242,750. Sales of new single-family houses in March 2017 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 621,000, according to estimates released jointly by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development on Tuesday. That was 5.8 percent above the revised February sales pace, and 15.6 percent higher than a year ago. The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index came in at 120.3 in April, down from 124.9 in March, below economists' expectations. Meanwhile, investors also kept a close eye on Trump administration's tax plan. The Trump administration on Wednesday unveiled the principles of the long-awaited tax reform plan that will significantly cut income taxes for Americans and corporates, ahead of the administration's first 100 days in office. The plan would reduce the number of personal income tax brackets to three from seven, and it would cut the top individual income tax rate to 35 percent from 39.6 percent, Gary Cohn, director of the White House National Economic Council (NEC), said at a press briefing at the White House. "We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to do something really big," Cohn said, noting President Donald Trump has made tax reform a priority and the Republican-controlled Congress also wants to get it done. At the same time, the plan would cut the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent, and it would also impose a one-time tax on overseas profits of U.S. companies, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

Samsung Gear Fit2 Band Issues: Is There a Serious Problem with Today’s Wearables? April 29, 2017 by Staff   Filed under Opinion, Tech/Internet, Weekly Columns 1 Comment Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 1 Tweet (ThyBlackMan.com) Samsung Gear Fit2 is one of the greatest fitness bands available in market. If the price tags are something to go by, Samsung has undoubtedly gone beyond Fitbit’s offerings. But a smartwatch that claims to keep users healthy and fit is reportedly damaging their health by causing burn issues. The Problems The Korean company Samsung is not alone, recently, Fitbit also got the same complaints from a lady who apparently suffered 2nd-degree burn after wearing the band. This is not the first time when users are complaining about burn injuries and skin irritation from wearables. Last year, Intel had to recall its smartwatch line Basis Peak due to an overheating issue. Everyone who is interested in trying different wearables that include normal fitness bands and smart devices like Gear Fit2, considers the device’s specifications, price, features and design as the most important aspects. But now when the burn issue related complaints are unstoppable, should you add skin sensitivity to your watch list? Finding The Reason No one can forget the fate of Samsung Galaxy Note 7 when the overheating issues started to surface online. But consumers easily forget to consider their own safety when they look for new smart products. Overheating and burning issues are obviously driven by sudden rise in temperature. So when it comes to a device like Samsung Gear Fit2 band, there can be two reasons. The overheating can either be a result of faulty components (possibly with manufacturing defect) inside the fitness band or something that transfers heat to the battery. One more thing that makes these wearables suspicious is the battery. If the battery itself is faulty, then you can’t expect safe operation. It will cause burn issues and if the overheating remains the same, the chances of explosion can’t be denied. Samsung Says “There are No Issues” When multiple complaints started to appear, Samsung finally released a statement. The company’s spokesperson said “There are no known safety issues with the Gear Fit2.” So, if this is what Samsung thinks then the customers reporting the issues and even sharing the photographs as proofs are probably lying. Well, you can visit Samsung’s official forum filled with such complaints. But since the company has already sold the product, and fortunately, no one has reported their Gear Fit2 bursting into flames, there are chances that the issues will be overlooked. What Customers Don’t See The long-term health effects of fitness trackers like Samsung Gear Fit2 and Fitbit are still unknown. We have no concrete information on how wireless technologies such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, infrared are damaging our health. But lack of report is not an evidence of safety. Customers need to decide whether the risk is worth taking or not. The World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer suggests that the waves emitted by fitness trackers are similar to the waves emitted by mobile phones. These non-ionizing waves are classified as “possibly carcinogenic to humans.” Limiting direct phone- to-head contact for cell-phone calls is recommended by The National Cancer Institute. It is very obvious because we have almost every feature of smartphone in today’s smartwatches and fitness trackers. Even if these products are a risky investment, how can you avoid trackers which are meant to be on your wrist for days and weeks? Now when the smartphone features and most importantly the water resistant technology is there, companies are trying their best to keep the device with you. You have no other excuse than wearing their products. No matter whether they are really designed to give you perfect health or you are just tying explosives on your wrist. Samsung Gear Fit2 Features, Specifications, Price & Review The Gear Fit2 reviews are good. It is obvious because at the same price tag, other leading brands are offering very less features. Samsung’s smartwatch features a 1.5-inch Super AMOLED display and unlike its predecessor, Samsung’s Gear Fit2 brings a better design idea and looks more flexible. When compared with Apple Watch, you’ll feel that almost 100g of weight is reduced by Samsung. What makes the smartwatch more appealing is the built-in GPS, the ability to track a lot of types of exercise, its screen and notification support which is extended in this watch. One of the unique features you find in Samsung Gear Fit2 is the social connectivity. You can compete against your friends through S Health app. Beating your friends and winning trophies is one of the features of this app that is bound to keep you motivated. The good thing is that your friends don’t need to own a Gear Fit2 as they can simply download S Health app on their phones to monitor progress. Here again the issue comes when a group of people is trying to make everyone aware about the potential risks of IOT invading in privacy. Bottom Line No matter how many claims wearable manufacturers make, the devices people wearing on their wrist are not completely safe. The radiation, chances of faulty components and malfunctioning will keep customers at risk. Why can’t we rely on ourselves to follow a healthy lifestyle? Do we really need such smart gadgets to push ourselves to live a healthy lifestyle? Or if they are really very necessary in tracking and measuring our progress in achieving health goals, why can’t we push these companies to deliver a product only when they find it completely safe and test it for some time before putting their customers at risk?

Benchmarking Various Linux Distributions With Amazon's EC2 Cloud In 2017 Written by Michael Larabel in Operating Systems on 29 April 2017. Page 1 of 3. 4 Comments After carrying out the recent Amazon EC2 Cloud benchmarks vs. Intel/AMD CPUs I also decided to run some Linux distribution tests in the Elastic Compute Cloud with not having done any such comparisons in a long time. So for those wondering how different Linux distributions compare in Amazon's cloud, this article is for you. The distributions tested for this Amazon EC2 comparison were Amazon Linux AMI 2017.03, CentOS 6.7, Debian Linux 8.7, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP2, and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Each Linux distribution was tested out-of-the-box with its default EC2 image. The instance type used for benchmarking was the c4.4xlarge that offers 16 vCPU, 30GiB of memory, and EBS storage. For all of the c4.4xlarge instances created, they were backed by Intel Xeon E5-2666 v3 Haswell CPUs. All of the Linux distribution benchmarks on EC2 were carried out in a fully-automated and reproducible manner using the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software.

We'll Find Out Monday With Ryzen launched and Vega and Naples coming soon, AMD's numbers need to start getting better. Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Apr 29, 2017 at 10:00AM With the launch of high-end and mainstream Ryzen CPUs in the rearview mirror, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) will report its first-quarter results after the market closes on May 1. Ryzen 7, AMD's attempt to compete with the best of Intel, became available on March 2, while the mainstream Ryzen 5 launched after the close of the first quarter. AMD's first-quarter numbers will provide investors the first glimpse of how well Ryzen 7 is selling, but the guidance for the second quarter will be the most telling. Investors will be looking for an optimistic outlook given the flurry of product launches. Beyond CPUs, AMD refreshed its mainstream Polaris GPU line in April, and it plans to roll out its high-end Vega GPUs and Naples server CPUs sometime during the second quarter. The stock has surged over the past year on anticipation that all of these new products would drive growth and return the company to profitability. It's now time for the company to prove those optimistic investors right or wrong. Image source: AMD. The headline numbers The only piece of guidance AMD provided for the first quarter called for an 11% sequential decrease in revenue, plus or minus 3%, which comes out to an 18% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. That's about $988 million, right around the average analyst estimate of $984 million. AMD's original line of Polaris graphics cards didn't launch until June of last year, so much of this growth will likely be driven by stronger GPU sales. Ryzen 7 will also contribute, but a shortage of compatible motherboards soon after launch may have put a damper on sales. Turning to the bottom line, analysts are expecting AMD to post an adjusted loss of $0.04 per share during the first quarter. The average analyst estimate calls for just $0.08 in adjusted EPS this year and $0.29 in adjusted EPS next year. These estimates could be off the mark by a wide margin if AMD's new products perform better than expected, but they do raise some questions about the valuation. Trading around $13.50 per share, AMD stock is priced for something close to the best-case scenario. Looking forward to the second-quarter report AMD needs a lot to go right this year for the surge in the stock price to be justified. Ryzen will have to pick up considerable market share, and both Vega and Naples must live up to expectations. The second-quarter report will include contributions from those two product lines, assuming AMD launches them on time. Vega is AMD's reentry into the high-end GPU market. Its last attempt was in 2015 with its Radeon Fury cards, but those were unable to compete with NVIDIA's high-end offerings. AMD has fallen into a pattern of playing catch-up instead of leapfrogging the competition, and it will need to break free from that trend with Vega if it wants any chance of winning considerable market share. NVIDIA won't be sitting on its hands. A rumor recently emerged that NVIDIA was prepping its next-generation Volta architecture for launch during the third quarter, a move that could undercut AMD if Vega manages to beat out NVIDIA's current lineup. Naples is AMD's reentry into the server chip market, where it has essentially no presence at all. Intel enjoys a near-100% market share, so Naples is all upside for AMD. Even small market-share gains will provide a revenue boost, although the chips will need to be competitive with Intel's offerings. Benchmarks from AMD suggest that Naples is the real deal, but we'll need to wait for launch before it's clear how competitive the new products truly are. 2017 is a big year for AMD, and the first-quarter report will be the company's first test. Investors will be looking for revenue growth and a move toward profitability, as well as positive commentary from management regarding the performance of Ryzen. Guidance needs to be strong with both Vega and Naples launching in the second quarter. Otherwise, the stock may not hold onto the gains from the past year.

At the time no PCs could access the service; due to the tighter DRM requirements imposed by Netflix and its content providers, PCs that wanted to stream 4K Netflix would need to support HDCP 2.2 and Microsoft’s PlayReady 3.0 DRM. Pascal in turn was the first GPU that was released to support the new DRM standards, and while NVIDIA didn’t know exactly when support would launch, the expectation was that it would be sooner than later. However as the months have ticked by, we never did see any further progress from NVIDIA and Netflix on enabling 4K support. And rather unexpectedly, NVIDIA even ended up being surpassed in the PC space by Intel, who became the first vendor to actually launch 4K Netflix support when it was enabled on their Kaby Lake CPUs back in November. Now just shy of a year later, NVIDIA and Netflix have finally taken the next step towards launching 4K Netflix support on Pascal. In an article posted on NVIDIA’s customer support portal, the company has (quietly) announced a 4K Netflix technology preview, allowing customers with the right hardware and software configurations to access Netflix’s 4K streams via both Microsoft Edge and the Netflix app. While the article itself doesn’t offer any real explanation for the delay, the system requirements end up giving us a pretty good hint about what’s going on. Along with the expected hardware requirements – a Pascal-based video card and an HDCP 2.2 monitor – the Netflix preview also requires that users are on a Windows Insider build of Windows 10. The NVIDIA article notes in particular that receiving Insider builds is necessary to get the specific NVIDIA driver version supported – 381.74 – as it’s only being distributed as part of the Insider program. NVIDIA doesn’t make much mention of the OS itself, but the situation is especially interesting since this comes just weeks after Microsoft launched the Windows 10 Creators Update, their latest major update to the OS. According to Microsoft’s API documentation, several new calls were added to PlayReady in this update. This strongly hints that Windows 10 itself was the piece of the puzzle holding back 4K Netflix support. Further complicating matters however, with the release of the Creators Update, the Windows Insider program is now in early testing of features that will be going into the next version of Windows 10, codenamed “Redstone 3”. So it’s not clear whether the recently-released Creators Update is even enough, or if support hinges on additional functionality intended for Redstone 3. In any case, for the moment NVIDIA is calling this a preview, presumably due to the Insider OS requirements. Despite this qualifier, 4K Netflix support should fully work on all Pascal GPUs with 3GB or more of VRAM, though this means that 2GB GTX 1050 cards are oddly excluded. NVIDIA does note however that support isn’t currently working with SLI configurations, and in that scenario the video cards need to be unlinked first. NVIDIA has also posted a helpful chart on HDCP 2.2 compliance, noting that 4K support is only available when all active displays support HDCP 2.2; any active HDCP 1.x displays will limit the stream quality to 1080p.

POST A COMMENT 28 Comments View All Comments surfnaround - Saturday, April 29, 2017 - link Funny, " Netflix streaming membership required" no, not just any Netflix streaming membership... The fancy four screen 4k membership that it is 11.99... The standard 2 screen membership will not do. Reply euskalzabe - Saturday, April 29, 2017 - link Yup, and this is the shameless part of the equation. I'm not paying Netflix anymore for 4K, I'll stay at 1080p until they bring it down to their regular 2 screen plan. Amazon Prime gives me 4K shows at no additional cost, so there's 0 reason for Netflix not to do the same. Reply usernametaken76 - Saturday, April 29, 2017 - link You act as though there's not a cost differential between 1080p and 4K streaming on the provider side. Reply SunnyNW - Saturday, April 29, 2017 - link Was going to post something similar. Yes Netflix could give 4k at no additional cost to you the subscriber but at what cost to them. Amazon has racks and racks of servers, enough to stretch all the way to the moon lol. But seriously, I'm sure it costs Amazon a lot less for the additional bandwidth versus Netflix when looking at the respective bottom line. Reply celestialgrave - Saturday, April 29, 2017 - link When will content providers realize all this complicated DRM is what drives consumers to less legit sources for its content? Even just playing blurays tends to be a pain. Reply dstarr3 - Saturday, April 29, 2017 - link That's why it's called DRM. Digital Rights Management. Nothing about consumer rights. There's nothing about DRM that's meant to benefit consumers in any way. DRM is just a legalized way for media industries to treat all legitimate consumers like criminals. Reply Azune - Saturday, April 29, 2017 - link And they will keep losing money because of it. Reply philehidiot - Saturday, April 29, 2017 - link I STILL can not get Blu Rays to play on my PC. I don't want to be downloading illegally (possibility of losing my career if caught) but it's getting ridiculous. I finally went and got a new monitor as my old one was dying and had the old HDCP and I thought that was causing the issue (it was) but now the bloody software starts whinging about how its integrity can't be assured and it's closing. It's maddening and when you have a decent media set up which would make Blu Ray pretty awesome and you're basically shafted by overzealous DRM you just end up not buying any Blu Ray content. It just pushes people into downloading, especially as when you do get the bloody things working they force you to watch loads of trailers and adverts. If only I could get VLC to work properly with Blu Rays. Frankly I can see why people download illegally. It's easier. If it wasn't for the serious potential impact on my career I'd be at it also. And yes, you can pay and download it but then you're often limited even more as to how you can use it - if I'm buying a film I want to be able to take it round to a friend's house or watch it on any player in the house. The prices of digital content (I hate that term, it's all bloody digital) don't reflect the limitations of the format. They will not stop piracy. It has happened since the days of VCRs and tapes. All they're doing is starting a war which they will not win (despite even getting the British Government to block access wholesale to certain websites, China styleee), spending massive amounts of money which then gets passed onto consumers in the price of the media, making tech more complex (I AM NOT buying a 10 series GeForce card just to watch 4K when there's no legitimate hardware requirement, only a manufactured one, that's diabolical) and making purchasing it harder. They need to totally reverse course and (like when tax rates are lowered, tax revenue increases, to a point), embrace the digital platform rather than resisting it and trying to lock it down and make buying and watching as easy as possible. Stop spending money on fancy hardware restrictions and huge legal operations and charge less for the damned content in the first place and people won't baulk at paying so much for it. Amazon have got it right - multiple platforms all linked with accessible pricing. You can link any telly with HDMI to their service and watch anything you have bought. You can watch it on a TV, phone, tablet or PC. Importantly here, the hardware required to work with a TV is cheap enough. They know you'll buy their content or have to sign up to Prime so they can afford to sell the hardware at a loss or at cost. Still can't take it round to a mates and pop it in the DVD player but it's getting there. Quite why the rest of the industry resist so hard I don't get. Reply HomeworldFound - Saturday, April 29, 2017 - link If you can't get Blu-Ray movies to play on your PC, then I wonder how you'd even be able to operate a VCR. Reply philehidiot - Saturday, April 29, 2017 - link And I call myself a nerd. :( Seriously, every time I've bothered trying it has been so much more effort to get around the problems imposed artificially by DRM that I've simply considered it not worth the time investment to overcome them. I have no doubt I could but I resent having to fart arse about for something that should just work. I get the same feeling when I have to go through multiple layers of piracy protection bullshit just to play a PC game that I've paid for.

Justin Loiseau (TMFJLo) Apr 29, 2017 at 8:55AM When it comes to upending the automaker's market, General Motors (NYSE:GM) has a lot to lose. But this car corporation isn't getting left in the dust on the race to self-driving success. Here are three ways General Motors is betting big on self-driving cars. 1. Start your start-ups Image source: General Motors. General Motors President Dan Ammann (right) with Cruise Automation co-founders Kyle Vogt (center) and Daniel Kan (left). What does a big corporation do when it wants to enter a lean, nimble, innovative space? It either upends its corporate culture to think like a start-up, or it acquires one. General Motors chose the latter. Last March, the company purchased San Francisco-based start-up Cruise Automation and its aftermarket autonomous-driving kit. In the announcement, General Motors Global Product Chief Mark Reuss noted, "Cruise provides our company with a unique technology advantage that is unmatched in our industry."  General Motors isn't the only mega-corporation to buy its way into a self-driving strategy. Uber acquired autonomous truck company Otto (and is currently embroiled in a lawsuit with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) because of it), and just last month, Intel Corporation coughed up $15 billion for Mobileye N.V. to get itself into the self-driving software and chip business. 2. Money on the table When it comes to self-driving cars, some companies will pay lip service to autonomous cars without putting money on the table -- not so for General Motors. According to Vox Media's recode, a tech news company, GM reportedly spent over $1 billion on its Cruise Automation acquisition and continues to put more money behind its push for self-driving cars. Last week, the company announced that it plans to add 1,100 employees to Cruise's workforce over the next five years. That's a nearly 30-fold increase over the 40-person staff Cruise boasted at the time of acquisition. Additionally, GM will invest $14 million into a new R&D facility, doubling its current space. "Expanding our team at Cruise Automation and linking them with our global engineering talent is another important step in our work to redefine the future of personal mobility," said GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra. "Self-driving technology holds enormous benefits to society in the form of increased safety and access to transportation."  3. Playing politics Image source: Alphabet. Waymo's self-driving car, which could be adversely affected by proposed legislation GM has supported. Companies create competitive moats in many ways. General Motors, a longtime player in the heavily regulated automotive space, is making inroads into self-driving politics. First, it's secured tax credits for its expansion. Under California Governor Jerry Brown's Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz), General Motors will enjoy an $8 billion tax credit on its R&D facility build-out, something no other publicly traded automaker has taken advantage of. Additionally, General Motors has hired lobbyists to try to influence regulation. According to investigative reporting by Car and Driver, a GM-hired lobbying firm urged Colorado lawmakers to propose an autonomous driving act that could make it illegal for non-traditional carmakers to deploy self-driving vehicles -- that would have a huge effect on more technology-based companies like Alphabet, Apple, and others that are experimenting with their own self-driving cars. In fact, some tech companies and other automakers have fought back with their own lobbying group and have been largely successful in stymying this sort of regulatory favoritism.   Will GM win the self-driving race? With a start-up acquisition, money on the table, and a strong understanding of regulatory opportunities, General Motors has made it clear that it does not want to be left behind in the self-driving car race. However, it remains to be seen whether this automaker will emerge ahead of the pack. Other companies such as Alphabet are following similar strategies, and those who believe that this is ultimately a technology race may be hesitant to bet their money on one of the biggest and oldest automakers in the world, regardless of the bets GM is placing on itself.

Peter Bright (US) - Apr 29, 2017 12:23 pm UTC reader comments 222 Share this story Microsoft's third-quarter financial results were published yesterday, and they had many high points: cloud revenue is growing well (though we have some misgivings about how the numbers are reported), Windows outperformed the PC market, and Office 365 passed 100 million corporate seats. But there were a couple of significant black marks: Phone revenue has dropped to effectively zero, and Surface revenue was down sharply year on year, with a 26-percent drop in revenue. The phone revenue is no big surprise: Microsoft has all but abandoned the market, and the last phones to sport a Microsoft logo—the Lumia 950 and 950 XL—are no longer sold. The company has been winding down its phone operation, writing off the entire value of the phone business it bought from Nokia and laying off thousands of former Nokia employees in the process. But the story with Surface is more unsettling. In its analyst call, Microsoft ascribed the drop in Surface revenue to "product end-of-lifecycle dynamics," whatever that means. The company's 10Q filing used rather clearer language: Microsoft simply didn't sell as many Surface systems. The Surface range has two main products: the Surface Pro 4, a tablet-style two-in-one, and the Surface Book, a laptop with a detachable screen. These systems were launched in November 2015. The Surface Pro 4 available today, about 18 months later, is unchanged. Surface Book has been slightly updated—a variant with a better GPU was added in November 2016. But it, too, is little altered. These portable systems were joined late last year by the Surface Studio, a fascinating but flawed desktop system. With its high price—it starts at a dollar shy of three thousand bucks—and niche utility—it's compelling if you're in the market for a Wacom digitiser, but otherwise something of a curate's egg—Surface Studio is not designed to be a big seller with mainstream appeal. Microsoft didn't offer numbers, but we'd imagine that the majority of Surface sales are of the portables. The march of technology Eighteen months is a long time to wait for systems to be refreshed. The Pro 4 and Book were early adopters of Intel's Skylake processors, but Skylake is now a generation old. Kaby Lake, which started shipping last autumn, is not a huge advance over Skylake, but it's a more power-efficient design that offers meaningful improvements in battery life, improved encoding and decoding support for 4K video, and, for the low-power Y-series parts, meaningful improvements in performance. Surface Pro 4 uses a Y-series part in the cheapest model, and it would stand to make big gains from a Kaby Lake upgrade. Microsoft wouldn't even have to do much work to make such a switch; Kaby Lake is pretty much a drop-in replacement for Skylake. Enlarge / Microsoft's Surface Book. Nathan Fitch The last 18 months have also seen significant growth in the adoption of USB Type-C and Thunderbolt 3, which offer standardised single-cable charging and docking. While Thunderbolt 3 is still young, hardware companies are experimenting with concepts such as Thunderbolt 3 monitors that charge laptops over the same cable used to carry the display signal, external GPUs, and docking stations that are no longer specific to particular hardware models (or even OEMs). Indeed, it feels like a natural fit for a revised version of the existing Surface Dock, or even, dare we dream, a standalone version of the mouth-wateringly beautiful touch screen of the Surface Studio. USB Type-C is rapidly gaining adoption; it has already become the norm for phone charging (for Android, at least) and increasingly is being favoured for laptop charging. The slimline ports enable thinner PCs, and the ability to use a single port for power, USB connectivity, and video output is compelling. No Surface product supports either technology. The Surface portable line-up, the bread and butter of the Surface brand, is looking very neglected. Further ReadingSurface Book with Performance Base: Finally arriving in the UK on April 20 At their release, the Pro 4 and Book were both arguably class-leading machines: 18 months later, they look sad and stale. Last November, we felt that we couldn't recommend the Surface Book's version with the updated GPU to most buyers—we couldn't justify buying a Skylake system with Nvidia 900-series graphics when the state of the art was Kaby Lake and 1000-series GPUs. Six months later, the machine looks even less appealing. With this stagnation, falling sales are inevitable. Until Microsoft shows the brand some love, the decline will only continue. We're not expecting to see that love any time soon, either; the company's guidance for the current quarter is that Surface sales will continue to fall. Microsoft is holding an event next week, and we expect there to be some hardware element, but we've also heard from sources close to the matter that there won't be updates to the Surface Pro or Surface Book. Either do hardware properly, or stop pretending If Microsoft wants to make PC hardware, it needs to do so properly and commit to the same kinds of updates as other PC OEMs. Almost every other PC OEM has refreshed its systems for Kaby Lake. Almost every other PC OEM has adopted, at least for machines in the premium space that Surface occupies, USB Type-C and Thunderbolt 3. Surface Pro—a machine which, in its early generations, arguably defined that particular style of two-in-one systems—is no longer unique. HP, Dell, Lenovo, Samsung, and others all have solid two-in-one offerings. These machines are modelled after the Surface Pro concept, but they now embody that concept better than Microsoft's own system. The Surface has been out-Surfaced. The failure to do anything with Surface for so long makes us wonder just what Microsoft is up to. If the company is serious about its hardware ambitions—and officially, at least, it still says that its intent is to produce market-leading systems under the Surface brand—then it has to take its hardware seriously. That means refreshing it to keep pace with the competition. Further ReadingImagining a new Mac Pro, the “iMac Pro,” and the future of Apple’s desktops One hardware company has a similarly lackadaisical approach to updating: Apple. In recent years, refreshes of Mac laptops and desktop systems across the lineup have slowed down. While the company has been quick to pick up Thunderbolt 3 and USB Type-C on at least some of its machines, the broader failure to keep pace with the state of the art is a continued source of frustration for Apple loyalists. But Apple's hardware sales remain robust, because Apple, in a very important way, is not like Microsoft or any other PC OEM: if you want to run macOS in a legal and supported way, you simply have no option but to buy Apple hardware. There's no corresponding necessity when it comes to buying Surface. Microsoft is but one Windows OEM of many, and if Microsoft's hardware isn't offering the right feature mix, a system from HP or Dell or Lenovo or Samsung or some other company probably will. It's fine for Microsoft to take inspiration from Apple's close cooperation between hardware and software development; it's not fine for Microsoft to mimic Apple's unpredictable and inconsistent system refresh policies. The PC market dynamics don't allow it. Enlarge / Instead of a full refresh, Microsoft released the Surface Book with Performance Base. The base is a little fatter, its battery is bigger, and its GPU is faster. Peter Bright When Microsoft first started making hardware, there was widespread uncertainty as to what the company was hoping to do. General consensus was that Redmond's aim was to serve as a kind of trailblazer, building the kinds of systems that the company wanted to see in the world while pushing the PC market in the direction it wanted. But this kind of hobby approach is a problem. Without assurances of a long-term commitment to hardware development, many would-be customers will avoid the systems. This is particularly acute in the corporate space: support lifecycles and extended system availability are essential when buying a fleet of systems. Microsoft recognised this concern and took action to address it. Surface systems were offered through the usual corporate channel partners like Ingram Micro and through cloud subscriptions, and the company promised that Surface Pro 3 peripherals would remain compatible with Surface Pro 4. The message was clear: Microsoft wasn't merely dabbling in hardware, it was investing in building a serious hardware brand. After some early missteps, the hardware was solid and well-received, revenue grew steadily, and Surface looked like it was becoming an integral part of Microsoft's ecosystem. That feels like it's now in jeopardy. Troubling precedent It doesn't help that Microsoft's hardware track record is more than a little shaky, and scepticism about its commitment and seriousness to hardware is well-earned. After a difficult start, Windows Phone was finally on an upward trajectory, especially in the EU where, in some countries, it had broken double-digit market share. But lackluster hardware—including a complete failure to offer a competitive new flagship phone in 2014—and lack of clear messaging saw a complete reversal of fortunes. The ultimate result was felt this quarter: Phone revenue is now essentially zero, even as work on the mobile version of Windows 10 continues. Enlarge / The last high-end phones Microsoft released were the Lumia 950 (pictured) and 950 XL, which came out in November 2015. Peter Bright Surface RT and Surface 2, Microsoft's ARM-based two-in-one machines, similarly raise questions about the company's commitment to hardware. Although Windows 10 itself has been built for ARM systems (and a version of Windows 10 for ARM is on the market in the Internet of Things guise), Microsoft opted not to offer a Windows 10 upgrade for Surface RT or Surface 2. This leaves the machines basically orphaned. Microsoft's inaction has taken a promising prestige PC brand and turned it into a borderline embarrassment. The question of whether Microsoft cares about hardware and is in it for the long haul is once again a live one. We've seen similar levels of neglect before. It was ruinous for the Nokia phone business and devastating for Windows Phone. Windows on the desktop is, of course, going to prove more robust—it doesn't live and die on the fortunes of Surface in the way that Windows Phone hinged on Nokia and Lumia. But everything invested in building the Surface brand is now in doubt. Further ReadingFull Windows 10 is coming to ARM, this time with 32-bit x86 compatibilityThat's bad for anyone who likes the machines, including those corporate buyers who have made the leap to Microsoft hardware. It's even worse for the software company's future ambitions: later this year, we're going to see a new generation of ARM machines running Windows. But with the way the company has treated its other hardware endeavors, who would want to take the gamble? Microsoft has developed a habit of ignoring and abandoning its niche hardware platforms; what reason is there to believe that Windows 10 for ARM will be any different?

Acer may not be the first name that comes to mind when thinking of performance gaming systems, but it's been growing its Predator gaming brand recently. At its next@Acer event yesterday, the company showed off a couple new families of high-end gaming laptops. We're starting with the spiciest of the bunch, the Predator Triton 700 series. Acer says these laptops sport Intel seventh-generation Core processors and Nvidia GeForce GTX 10-series graphics cards—though it doesn't specifically state which varieties are available. The press release mentions VR capability, suggesting the minimum spec might be a Core i5 coupled with a GeForce GTX 1060. The display is a 15.6" 1920x1080 IPS number with support for G-Sync. The machine's memory and storage are decidedly high-spec, with support for up to 32 GB of DDR4 memory and two NVMe PCIe SSDs in RAID 0. For peripheral connnectivity, users can count on Thunderbolt 3 ports, along with DisplayPort and HDMI 2.0 outputs. A Killer DoubleShot Pro adapter handles both wired and wireless networking duties. The laptops in the Triton 700 series have mechanical keyboards with RGB LED lighting mounted on the near side of the laptop's top. A glass touchpad between the screen and the keyboard shows off the machine's cooling system. Judging by the promo video, that's only pointing device in the system, so ergonomics freaks might feel their carpal tunnel syndrome flaring up from just looking at it. The machine's 5.7 lb. (2.6 kg) weight and 0.74" (1.9 cm) thickness shouldn't bother users too much when moving the machine around. The company's Helios 300 family has more mainstream specs and designs. Models with 15.6" and 17.3" IPS 1920x1080 screens will be available with Intel Kaby Lake Core i5-7300HQ and Core i7-7700HQ CPUs along with Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 and GTX 1060 graphics cards. The keyboards are standard membrane units with red backlighting. The standard opaque touchpad sits in front of the keyboard, where sensible laptop makers have been putting it since the mid-1990s. Helios 300 systems ship with up to 16 GB of DDR4 memory installed, upgradeable to 32 GB. Storage comes courtesy of a combo setup with a SATA SSD and a 1 TB hard drive. Peripheral connectivity options include a USB 3.0 Type-A port, one USB 3.1 Type-C port, two USB 2.0 connectors, and an HDMI 2.0 output. Gigabit Ethernet and 802.11ac Wi-Fi let the laptops talk to other computers.  Acer says the Predator Triton 700s will be available in August starting at around $3000. The Helios 300 laptops will start appearing on North American shelves in July. The 15.6" models are slated to start at $1300, while the 17.3" will go for at least $1400.

Fittingly, Silverstone's next Vital-series chassis is a bit different from its predecessor. The Vital VT02 is once again designed for motherboards in the Mini-STX form factor, but this time, the unit has room for a pair of 2.5" drives. Two 2.5" devices may not seem like a lot of storage, but in a device that's under two liters in total volume it's pretty impressive. The Vital VT02 can also fit Intel's standard boxed cooler, so builders don't have to worry about shelling out for a low-profile heatsink. The case has USB Type-A and Type-C ports on the front, as well as your standard 3.5-mm headphone and mic jacks. The actual dimensions of the case are 6.5" by 2.87" by 6.16" (16.5 by 7.3 by 15.6cm)—even smaller than a Nintendo Wii U. You won't be fitting a graphics card or a power supply in the VT02, but that's sort of missing the point anyway. Silverstone also includes a VESA mount for attaching the VT02 to a wall or the back of a monitor. Silverstone will sell the chassis for just $31.50, or 28.90€, when it goes on sale.  Mini-STX is an Intel-driven standard, and as of yet, the only boards in that size are for LGA 1151 CPUs. AMD's upcoming Raven Ridge processors seem like an ideal fit for small form-factor applications like this, however, so hopefully some enterprising motherboard vendor steps up to the plate.

President Donald Trump’s unorthodox style gets political pulses racing. Like him or not, people are paying attention. Even Trump voters found a few things on which they wished their golf-loving president would take a mulligan. Here is a sampling of how a few Nebraskans, in alphabetical order, score Trump at his 100-day milestone. Tim Anderson, 67 +7  Tim Anderson DAVID HENDEE/THE WORLD-HERALD » Holdrege » semiretired public relations adviser for the Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District » Republican » Trump voter Anderson said the president’s effort has been excellent. “He’s had some conflicts with the Senate and the House, but you can’t fault him for trying. Obamacare was a bit too much to bite off the first 100 days. I see why he had difficulty with that. The wall and tax cuts are certainly not easy. Overall, I’d give him a B+ and an A for effort.” Anderson said Trump has energized the electorate — supporters as well as those who are resisting or attempting to block the president’s agenda. “He’s made people pay attention. I’m pleased younger people are getting involved in civic life. I don’t agree with their disrespect (for the president), but they’re getting involved, and that’s a good thing. “Give him a chance. One hundred days is not very much time. Everyone wants to know what you’ve done for us in 100 days. That’s not enough time for the CEO of any corporation, let alone a country the size of the United States.” Anderson supports Trump’s attention to keeping jobs in the United States or bringing them back, and fighting terrorists. He likes the Cabinet Trump put together. “Whether you like him or hate him, he is our president. I know not everyone was tickled with Barack Obama, but he was our president. This is our country. It’s not Barack Obama’s or Donald Trump’s. It’s the people’s country.” Ron Convey, 56 +7  Buy Now Ron Convey DAVID HENDEE/THE WORLD-HERALD » Lincoln » facility maintenance manager for GlaxoSmithKline’s over-the-counter drug manufacturing plant in Lincoln » Republican » Trump voter Convey said he was very pleased with the president’s start. “It’s the first time I can remember that a president actually started doing what he said during the campaign that he would do once he took office.’’ Convey had one piece of advice for the president: “Keep off the damn Twitter.’’ “Some of the things he puts out, you just want to tell him ‘Dude, think about what you just said. Now it’s too late and it’s all over the world.’ Every time he does something like that, then everybody starts fact-checking. If the media can find anything to ding him on, they’re going to do it. I don’t think he needs to give them ammo.” Convey said Trump was wise to soften his aggressive campaign tone with China. “China is a country that plays the long-ball game. I think he can make some deals with them to help the North Korea crisis and help the economies of both China and the United States.” Bill Dziadosz, 31 +7  Buy Now Bill Dziadosz DAVID HENDEE/THE WORLD-HERALD » Bellevue » accountant for G4S » Republican » Trump voter Dziadosz said he is disappointed in the president, “(but) nobody’s going to do anything that effective in 100 days.’’ He was not impressed with Trump’s Cabinet appointments. “I was hoping he would treat it like a real business and get all the top people for it. He just surrounded himself with a bunch of people that make money. They’re not the best for some of those positions. Obviously, (Education Secretary) Betsy DeVos was pretty weak.” Dziadosz liked Trump’s proposed cuts in corporate and personal taxes in a move to boost national economic growth and bring jobs and prosperity to the middle class. “If they can follow through ...’’ Brad Feldmann, 55 +7  Brad Feldmann DAVID HENDEE/THE WORLD-HERALD » Meadow Grove » farmer » Republican » Trump voter Feldmann said he is disappointed with the Republicans’ stumble over their long-promised attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. “I wish they’d take what’s there now with Obamacare and tweak it. They’ve already done the hard part, now all they need to do is tweak it and get on with something else. There are things about it that are very good. Republicans (in Congress) disliked President Obama so much and they don’t want him to get any credit. The Democrats will never go along with a new health care bill.” Feldmann said he supports much of Trump’s agenda. “He’s trying to do a lot of things, but I don’t know how much will get done because it’s so negative there. They fight him one way or another.” Feldmann said he cringed at Trump’s talk of scuttling international trade agreements and was pleasantly surprised at his announcement this week not to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement. “He goes from one extreme to another. Maybe he has to do some bluffing in order to get them to play ball with us. We need Canada and Mexico as bad as they need us. Farmers are big exporters of corn, and with low (corn) prices now, we can’t afford to lose any corn exports.” Gina Hudson, 44 +7  Gina Hudson DAVID HENDEE/THE WORLD-HERALD » Belvidere » farmer and rancher » president, Nebraska Cattlewomen » Democrat » Trump voter Hudson and her husband, Bill, are commercial cow-calf producers who also grow irrigated corn, soybeans, wheat, alfalfa and oats. “We’re Democrats, but this year we voted for Donald Trump,’’ she said. “We needed change in our agricultural community (and) in health care. Change is good. It’s hard.” Hudson said it’s too early to judge Trump’s presidency, but said this week marked a significant success: the confirmation of Sonny Perdue as secretary of agriculture. “The big thing is that people are talking about agriculture. We haven’t had that for a long time. Farmers and ranchers make up only 2 percent of the population. We’re a really small voice, but we supply the world with food, fuel and fiber. We need to come to an understanding about trade. In agriculture, we are all concerned with global trade pacts that are important to America’s farmers and ranchers. It’s important to our state and to our small towns. “It’s a tough time now in agriculture. It’s a struggle. We need to bring commodity prices back. Trade can help that.’’ Sarah Johnson, 36 +7  Buy Now Sarah Johnson DAVID HENDEE/THE WORLD-HERALD » Omaha » owner of Omaha Bicycle Co. » Democrat » Hillary Clinton voter Johnson, who voted for Clinton as the “lesser of two evils,” credits Trump’s presidency for one thing: encouraging people who oppose his policies to become involved in civic affairs. “I appreciate that a lot more people are being so offended that they’re coming out of the woodwork and being driven to do something about it. I don’t know where to start on the rest of it. The irresponsible use of tax dollars for his Mar-a-Lago time. All the conflicts of interest. And his attitude. Just despicable. The utter disrespect for everyone he encounters. There are a million reasons why he should be or could be impeached. I just cannot believe that we are where we are. It’s pretty upsetting. It’s hard to watch on a daily basis.’’ Johnson credited Trump, a frequent Twitter user, for one more thing. “I’ve cut back my social media intake because it’s literally driving me to depression. It’s been tough.’’ Dominic Santiago, 32 +7  Buy Now Dominic Santiago DAVID HENDEE/THE WORLD-HERALD » Omaha » metalworker » independent » Trump voter Santiago said he was disappointed that Trump’s presidency has widened the political chasm in America. “It’s not good. That’s not anything on him. That’s just us as people.’’ He said he strongly supported the president’s “military moves’’ around the world. “I’d like to see Obamacare cleaned up a little bit. I’ve got a wife and three kids, and to get us covered under it is a lot of money. We’re better off going through my wife’s work, and it’s not that great of insurance.’’ Robert Stallworth, 24 +7  Buy Now Robert Stallworth DAVID HENDEE/THE WORLD-HERALD » Omaha » metalworker » Democrat » did not vote Stallworth said his biggest gripe was Trump’s executive order on immigration and refugees. “People who are U.S. citizens and live here have gone to visit family members and it hasn’t been easy for them to get back. They’re getting stuck there, which is putting them at risk of losing jobs.’’ He is disappointed that Obamacare reforms haven’t happened. “The idea of it when it first started was great, but what I didn’t like about it is I got fined heavily for not having insurance at all the first year. So here I am, a single male, and I went through my job and pick it (insurance) up the next year and used it for almost nothing.

AF nowadays can affect a lot the performance, because many times by now in some games, Tesslation or Parallax Occlusion Mapping is tied to the anisotropic filtering. So the more the anisotropic, the more the tesslation or POM at certain distance. Rise of the Tomb Raider is one of the games where it's very noticable the performance penalty while using tesslation and messing around with AF. Plus, you also have the laptop gamers, with their low end cards (which I have one) where AF takes a huge impact on the performance due to the lack of bandwidth in this cards (DDR 3 + 64 bits). so this setting needs to exist. Apart from this situations, it's true what you say, the AF have like a small impact on the performance. Cheers.     ObscureangelPT View Public Profile Find all posts by ObscureangelPT   (#9) Genova84 Newbie   Videocard: Dual Zotac 980tis Processor: 5960X Mainboard: Rampage V Extreme Memory: 64GB DDR4 2133K Soundcard: PSU: 1100 watt 04-28-2017, 13:14 | posts: 20 | Location: 'Merica I wish more devs would show exactly what recommended can run.

PC has had 4K tech since the 980TI and if all games werent console ported trash designed on what a console can or its limitations why should people like me buy their crap then? You game on PC to get away from limitations. Yet you jump down the throat of someone who doesn't want a game based on money grabbing companies who can't be botherd to make Pc games that are optimised for a PC... We know they don't do this because it costs more! And they won't have that!

The "Mad Money" host said that with the federal government funded through the next week, investors can finally relax and gear up for yet another earnings-filled agenda. With that in mind, here are the stocks and events on Cramer's radar this coming week: Monday: Advanced Micro Devices, Cardinal Health Advanced Micro Devices: After shares of competitor Intel slid on its earnings miss on Thursday, Cramer is unsure that even the best of earnings reports from this chipmaker will garner a positive market reaction. "As I have repeatedly said, there is nothing wrong with the company AMD," Cramer said. "What can I say? The market's fallen out of love with last year's darlings." Cardinal Health: Once the health care services company reports earnings, Cramer thinks investors will start to notice its monumental acquisition of part of Medtronic's business, which will make it a more streamlined hospital supplier. Tuesday: CVS Health, Mastercard, Apple CVS: The health care retailer's stock has been under pressure lately as even pharmacies are squeezed by the rise of Amazon, but Cramer says there could be a hidden upside to earnings. "All that said, it's hard to really dislike a well run company like this that sells at just 13 times earnings. I say wait and see. Maybe numbers come down, maybe that's your chance," the "Mad Money" host said. Mastercard: Other payment services names like Visa and PayPal have reported great numbers this quarter, so Cramer expects a good report from Mastercard as well. "Here's one where you might want to see if the stock gets hit after it reports so you can come in at a lower price," he said. "That's been the pattern with the stock of this amazing company. It might be a great way to get in on a trend that still has a lot of room to run: the paper to plastic secular growth story." Apple: Expectations are sky-high for the tech titan's after-the-bell earnings report, and Cramer thinks they are justified. "Apple's doing so many things right. It's making the best products, developing a deep ecosystem with a substantial service revenue stream," he said. Plus, Apple's upcoming iPhone release is rumored to have an array of new features that makes the smartphone more functional and easier to handle, which should boost sales and new customer numbers, Cramer said. The company also stands to massively benefit from repatriation if the administration is able to implement it. All said and done, Cramer says investors should own the stock, not trade it, and eager buyers should hope for a post-earnings dip so they can buy it at a discount. Wednesday: Sprint, Facebook, Kraft Heinz Sprint: Cramer likes the stock of this telecommunications player, which will report its quarterly earnings Wednesday morning, but the "Mad Money" host is concerned that it may just be pushing along instead of really growing. T-Mobile CEO John Legere told Cramer he may be open to buying Sprint, but antitrust issues may stand in the way of a merger or acquisition, Cramer warned. "Any merger would lessen the competition for something that's become a modern day necessity," he said. "You really have to own these for fundamentals, not potential deals, and if that's the case, T-Mobile remains best of breed." Facebook: The social media colossus reports earnings after the bell, and unless its numbers are substantially better, Cramer expects a slight sell-off. "I like how competitive Facebook is," the "Mad Money" host said. "If you don't own it now, I think you might as well wait to see if we get that kind of weird sell-off that we usually get even after it reports a great number." Kraft Heinz: Investors will be tuned into the consumer goods name when it reports because it always seems to be on the lookout for a takeover candidate despite botching its proposal to buy Unilever last quarter. Cramer prefers Unilever's stock, but said that if Kraft Heinz floats the idea of a deal, it could get a boost. "We know, though, it takes two to tango, and I'm hard pressed to see who would possibly want to sell in that consumer packaged goods industry as the remaining players seem to have no inclination to let go of the reins," Cramer said. Thursday: Dunkin' Donuts, Activision Blizzard Dunkin' Donuts: Cramer contended that this coffeemaker, which will report earnings Thursday, "has quietly become a better investment than Starbucks over the last year, going from $46 to $55, while Starbucks has only traveled up four points." The "Mad Money" host credited the company's execution for the rise, saying that it has outperformed Starbucks in terms of stemming the U.S. slowdown. Activision Blizzard: The gaming sector is one of Cramer's favorite secular growth stories in the stay-at-home economy, and Activision Blizzard's earnings reports have a tendency to spur selling. "I say the trend's your friend," Cramer said. "This franchise is worth buying if it gets hit." Friday: Non-farm payrolls The Labor Department will release its monthly non-farm payroll data. The hiring statistics could have a detrimental effect on bank stocks if they are low, but Cramer expects the opposite. "If April turns out to have been a robust hiring month, and I think it will be, that gives the Fed breathing room to raise interest rates twice, and therefore the bank stocks will soar," he said. So with Washington policymakers at bay for now and the market digesting this week's madness, Cramer said to focus on the stocks that get unjustly beaten down for chances to buy high quality names next week. "This week we have a couple of stocks that tend to act badly after they report. Those are your best bets for investments. Otherwise, get ready for still one more opportunity to buy some Apple stock as Wall Street's naysayers try to say its best days are behind it. But, of course, they say that to each other on their iPhones," the "Mad Money" host said.

Also I am on 8-cores + quad-channel memory and you on 4 + dual-channel, I assume with MP that does matter. Last but not least, FPS isn't a constant throughout the game. The actual scene can differ in scenery and thus FPS.

At first I figured nothing went wrong, but it likely got a micro-fracture. That moment when you power up the PC and the screen stays black.

AF nowadays can affect a lot the performance, because many times by now in some games, Tesslation or Parallax Occlusion Mapping is tied to the anisotropic filtering. So the more the anisotropic, the more the tesslation or POM at certain distance. Rise of the Tomb Raider is one of the games where it's very noticable the performance penalty while using tesslation and messing around with AF. Plus, you also have the laptop gamers, with their low end cards (which I have one) where AF takes a huge impact on the performance due to the lack of bandwidth in this cards (DDR 3 + 64 bits). so this setting needs to exist. Apart from this situations, it's true what you say, the AF have like a small impact on the performance. Cheers.

GFX wise the game looks like it was made 8 years ago. Super linear with very sub par gameplay. Doubt the PC version will improve much on this.

Ill be the first to admit I love great graphics, but it is not what makes a game either. Prey 1 had really nice graphics, but the atmosphere and story are what made it a bad ass game.

If you need a bit more power, there’s the Acer Swift 3 series. These 14 inch and 15.6 inch notebooks feature full HD displays, Intel Kaby Lake processor options, and relatively compact designs. They’re also available with optional NVIDIA GeForce graphics… although one thing you don’t get with these models is fanless cooling. The Acer Swift 3 laptops should be available starting in June for $599 and up. The 14 inch model measures 0.7 inches thick and weighs 3.9 pounds, while the 15.6 inch version is 0.74 inches thick and weighs 4.9 pounds. Both feature brushed-aluminum bodies, 1920 s 1080 pixel IPS display, support for up to 8GB Of RAM and up to a Core i7-7500U processor Storage options range from 128GB to 512GB SSDs or 500GB to 2TB hard drives. Acer says the Swift 3 notebooks should be able to get up to 10 hours of battery life, and each model features 802.11ac WiFi, and USB 3.1 Type-C ports. Unfortunately, while the Swift 1 has a matte display, all of the Swift 3 models I saw had glossy screens… which made me question why Acer decided to show them off in an outdoor setting.

It’s called the Acer Switch 3, and it’s a tablet with a 12.2 inch, 1920 x 1200 pixel display, a built-in kickstand, a keyboard cover, and a starting price of $399. The Switch 3 should be available for purchase starting in June. Acer Switch 3 specs include: Intel Celeron and Pentium Apollo Lake CPU options Up to 4GB of LPDDR3 RAM 32GB, 64GB, and 128GB eMMC storage options MicroSDXC card slot USB 3.1 Type-C port and USB 3.1 Type-A port 802.11c WiFi Bluetooth 4.0 The tablet measures 11.6″ x 7.9″ x 0.4″ and weighs about 2 pounds and Acer says you should get up to 8 hours of battery life from this model. The tablet has front-facing speakers, but lacks some of the premium features found on the Switch 5, such as the fingerprint sensor, retractable kickstand, LiquidLoop fanless cooling system, and backlit keyboard. So those are some of the reasons this model has a starting price of $399 while the Switch 5 is priced at $799 and up.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Acer Aspire U27 is a fanless all-in-one desktop PC with LiquidLoop cooling 04/28/2017 at 3:00 PM by Brad Linder Leave a Comment When you think of fanless computers, you probably think notebooks, tablets, and maybe a desktop or two. But Acer is going a bit bigger with its latest fanless computer. The Acer Aspire U27 is an all-in-one desktop PC with a 27 inch full HD display and a case that’s just 0.5 inches thick, thanks to its fanless design. Acer keeps the system cool by using a version of the LiquidLoop cooling system that the company first designed for tablets with passive cooling. The computer supports up to 32GB of DDR4-2400 memory, up to an Intel Core i7 Kaby Lake processor, and optional Intel Optane memory. It also has a 2.5″ drive bay and an M.2 slot for a solid state drive, stereo speakers with a subwoofer, integrated 802.11ac WiFi, an IR camera for Windows Hello facial recognition, a 1MP webcam, and a touchscreen with support for 10-finger input. The Aspire U27 should be available in North America in July for $1099 and up, but it will launch in the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) in May for €1,299.

Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 143.65 -0.14 -0.10% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 924.99 +6.61 +0.72% Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD ▼ 13.30 -0.32 -2.35% Intel Corp INTC ▼ 36.15 -1.28 -3.42% AdChoices "Apple's doing so many things right. It's making the best products, developing a deep ecosystem with a substantial service revenue stream," the "Mad Money" host said Plus, Apple's upcoming iPhone release is rumored to have an array of new features that makes the smartphone more functional and easier to handle, which should boost sales and new customer numbers, Cramer said. The company also stands to massively benefit from repatriation if the administration is able to implement it. All said and done, Cramer says investors should own the stock, not trade it, and eager buyers should hope for a post-earnings dip so they can buy it at a discount. As the busiest week of earnings season came to a close, Cramer breathed a sigh of relief despite Friday's mild pullback caused by a weaker-than-expected GDP number. Read more from CNBC's Jim Cramer The "Mad Money" host said that with the federal government funded through the next week, investors can finally relax and gear up for yet another earnings-filled agenda. On Monday, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reports earnings, and after shares of competitor Intel (INTC) slid on its earnings miss on Thursday, Cramer is unsure that even the best of earnings reports from this chipmaker will garner a positive market reaction. Aside from Apple, Tuesday will bring an earnings report from health-care retailer CVS (CVS), where Cramer says there could be a hidden upside to earnings. "It's hard to really dislike a well run company like this that sells at just 13 times earnings. I say wait and see. Maybe numbers come down, maybe that's your chance," the "Mad Money" host said. On Wednesday, the market will get Facebook (FB)'s results. The social media colossus reports earnings after the bell, and unless its numbers are substantially better, Cramer expects a slight sell-off. "I like how competitive Facebook is," Cramer said. "If you don't own it now, I think you might as well wait to see if we get that kind of weird sell-off that we usually get even after it reports a great number." The gaming sector is one of Cramer's favorite secular growth stories in the stay-at-home economy, and Activision Blizzard's earnings reports have a tendency to spur selling, which may happen when it releases numbers on Thursday. "I say the trend's your friend," Cramer said. "This franchise is worth buying if it gets hit." The Labor Department will release its monthly non-farm payroll data on Friday. The statistics could have a detrimental effect on bank stocks if they are low, but Cramer expects the opposite. "If April turns out to have been a robust hiring month, and I think it will be, that gives the Fed breathing room to raise interest rates twice, and therefore the bank stocks will soar," he said. © Provided by CNBC When Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) reported earnings at the same exact time Thursday night, Cramer found it difficult to compare the two and pick a winner. "The problem is that in some ways, this is a real apples-to-oranges situation," the "Mad Money" host said. Amazon, for example, chooses to promote faith-based investing, assuring shareholders that their India business will flourish and that robots will save time at their fulfillment centers. Alphabet went about energizing investors in a different way. They talked about how their search engines help local businesses and about their cloud operations, which compete with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft (MSFT) Azure. Cramer also spoke with Stephen Milligan, the CEO of Western Digital (WDC), a data storage player and one of the world's biggest hard disk drive manufacturers. Milligan said that the company's longtime partnership with troubled electronics giant Toshiba was worth preserving despite the Japanese giant's current difficulties. "The joint venture that we've had with Toshiba is 17 years running. I would contend that it's probably one of the most successful technology joint ventures in the history of our industry. And so our first goal is let's keep that joint venture healthy," Milligan told Cramer on Friday. While the CEO acknowledged that helping Toshiba could create a bit of an overhang in terms of how investors perceive Western Digital, his main focus remained on growing his own business. "Rest assured, we're going to do our very best to make sure that we protect our interests and advance not only our position, but the stakeholders that Toshiba has, and really come to a resolution that helps us to continue to be successful going forward," the CEO said. Upon the release of BioMarin's (BMRN) orphan drug Brineura, which made headlines for its $702,000-per-year price tag, chairman and CEO JJ Bienaimé said the system will have the final say on whether the sky-high price is fair. "Obviously, the system will have to determine that," he told Cramer on Friday. But I would say that CLN2, the disease that Brineura is being used for, is an absolutely devastating neurodegenerative disorder for which, unfortunately, the patients will lose their life, most of the time by [age] 12." And although Washington lawmakers have knocked pharmaceutical companies for high drug costs, Bienaimé said most policymakers understand the industry's inevitable trial-and-error aspects. "I think, hopefully, ... if there is any kind of regulations coming around health care, that they will make sure that those regulations protect innovation and protect innovative biotech companies," Bienaimé said. Finally, Cramer spoke with AGCO (AGCO) Chairman, President and CEO Martin Richenhagen to understand more about how President Donald Trump's protectionist slant might affect the agricultural landscape. AGCO manufactures agricultural equipment like tractors that require steel to produce. Richenhagen said that if the current administration were to follow through with placing high tariffs on non-U.S. steel, the effects would be felt industry-wide. "For us, of course, if steel's prices would go up because of this kind of protectionism, it wouldn't be so good because finally our customers would have to pay. So that's true for all of us, for the whole industry," the CEO told Cramer on Friday. Richenhagen added that while the move would benefit the steel industry, it was "not really a great strategy" to implement tariffs without explicitly informing consumers of their effects. "All kind of protectionism finally has to be paid for," he said. "And I think consumers should know that." In Cramer's lightning round, he rattled off his take on some caller favorite stocks, including: Bank of the Internet USA (BOFI): "I don't know. Too much risk there, my friend. I'd rather own JPMorgan (JPM). I think that's a little more, let's just say, strong." Agilent Technologies (A): "Oh my, I like Agilent so much. I like the quarter. You can win two ways here: you can win on an acquisition or you can win on earnings. That's how good that quarter was. Terrific." Questions for Cramer?

The Nasdaq Composite pushed further above the 6,000 level at the open, setting a new intraday high after a batch of Big Tech earnings overnight. But the results were mixed, with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) disappointing. Source: Shutterstock Moreover, President Trump’s “big league” tax plan announcement on Wednesday was a dud, another healthcare reform push has apparently died in the Congress, and Friday’s first-quarter U.S. GDP growth report came in at just 0.7% on the weakest consumer spending performance since 2009. That’s a lot of headwinds for the market to digest, especially since the gapped move higher this week came on very narrow breadth. Sentiment is extended. And the Dow Jones Industrial Average is contending with stiff overhead resistance from its early March high.

By the time the closing bell rang, the S&P 500 was off 0.19% for the day, ending the week at 2,384.2. Leading the tepidly bearish charge were Athenahealth, Inc (NASDAQ:ATHN), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF), all of which were sent lower in response to lackluster earnings news. Synchrony Financial (SYF) Synchrony Financial, the former financing arm of General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) that was spun off in 2015, was probably wishing its results were still buried with its former parent company’s numbers after they were posted early on Friday morning. SYF shares didn’t like what they heard, sending the stock to a loss of 15.9% for the day. The bearish response is understandable. For the quarter ending in March, Synchrony was expected to report earnings of 74 cents per share on revenue of $3.54 billion. Instead, the company reported a profit of 61 cents per share of SYF and a top line of $3.91 billion. Although the top line was better than expected, the earnings miss was not only wide, but the bottom line withered — a lot — compared to the year-ago profit figure. The bulk of the shortfall stemmed from a $403 million loan-loss provision Synchrony Financial was forced to factor in. SYF shareholders weren’t sympathetic though. Intel Corporation (INTC) Synchrony Financial wasn’t the only name to get beaten up … well, down on Friday following a mixed first-quarter earnings report. Technology giant Intel also hit a headwind following the release of its fiscal Q1 numbers, though not as harsh as the one SYF bumped into. Last quarter, Intel earned 66 cents per share versus expectations for a profit of only 65 cents. Revenue of $14.8 billion, however, came up just a little shy of estimates for a top line of $14.81 billion. The big letdown came from the company’s data center arm. Though its Data Center Group’s business was up 6% year-over-year, that was still short of the company’s target. It matters simply because that division is the centerpiece of the company’s growth plans. INTC ended the session down 3.4%. Athenahealth, Inc (ATHN) Last but not least, medical billing and management IT names athenahealth struggled with lower reimbursement rates as well as fewer reimbursable doctor visits last quarter, taking a bite out of the top and bottom line. For its first quarter of 2017, athenahealth earned an operating profit of 32 cents per share, missing estimates of 46 cents per share. Sales of $285.4 million missed the outlook for revenue of $296.6 million. The core of ATHN stock’s 19.3% setback today, however, was in response to the YOY decline in earnings for the first quarter, and an alarming contraction for its full-year outlook. The company now expects to only earn between $36 million and $46 million for 2017, down from previous guidance for a full-year profit of between $61 million and $81 million. As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The Nasdaq Composite pushed further above the 6,000 level at the open, setting a new intra-day high after a batch of big-tech earnings overnight. But the results were mixed, with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) disappointing. Also, weighing on sentiment is lingering disappointment with President Trump’s tax proposal on Wednesday (light on details and set to add trillions to the national debt), a lack of progress on healthcare reform, and ongoing concerns about a potential government shutdown (despite a one-week stopgap bill moving through Congress). But above all, investors were unhappy with a very weak Q1 U.S. GDP growth report: Coming in at just 0.7% as consumer spending posted its weakest result since the end of 2009. In the end, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2% as it bonked on overhead resistance from its early March highs, the S&P 500 lost 0.2%, the Nasdaq Composite lost a fraction and the Russell 2000 finished 1.2% lower. Treasury bonds were unchanged, the dollar was little change, gold gained 0.2% and crude oil gained 0.7% but was unable to recover the 1.3% loss from Thursday. The gains in T-bonds boosted the ProShares Ultra Treasury Bond (NYSEARCA:UBT) to a 0.9% gain so far this month for Edge subscribers. Breadth was negative, with 1.6 decliners for every advancer on the NYSE on heavy volume, at 122% of the 30-day average. Technology stocks led the way with a 0.3% gain thanks mainly to Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB). The vertical surge in GOOG looks a lot like the 1999/2000 dot-com craziness as investors piled in following the reporting of better-than-expected results on strong advertising revenue on Thursday night. On the downside, Time Inc (NYSE:TIME) fell 16.9% after announcing it had rejected a number of expressions of buyout interest — fueling fears of fiefdom on the part of management. Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) fell 15.9% after a big Q1 earnings miss on higher loan loss reserves. Intel Corporation (NYSE:INTC) fell 3.5% despite reporting solid results amid a focus on weakness in its data center group. And Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) fell 2% after reporting weaker-than-expected comp-store sales growth and issued lowered earnings guidance. Returning to the economy, GDP growth slowed from the 2.1% pace set in 4Q16 to its slowest pace in three years. Personal consumption increased just 0.3% following a 3.5% expansion in Q4; which is exceedingly odd given off-the-charts survey-based measures of consumer confidence in recent months. Bright spots included non-residential fixed investments (businesses are ramping up spending). Inventories were a drag. Still, the weakness doesn’t appear set to slow the Federal Reserve rate hike pace. Inflation picked up, rising at a 2.4% annual rate for the biggest jump since 2011. The labor market remains strong. Confidence levels are high. And Wall Street anticipates a Q2 rebound in GDP growth. We’ll know more when the Federal Reserve holds its policy meeting next Wednesday and when the latest jobs numbers are released on Friday. We’ll also get updates on personal income and consumption, motor vehicle sales (a recent worry), and fresh data on labor costs and productivity. It’s a busy schedule, made worse by the ongoing need for Congress and the White House to pass a long-term budget deal. Expect market volatility to intensify. In anticipation, Edge Pro subscribers added a new put option position against Bank of America (BAC) as the bank looks ready to drop out of a large head-and-shoulders reversal pattern that traces a price target below its 200-day moving average.

Having proposed a huge reform agenda, some have been left disappointed by Donald Trump’s first 100 days in office. Nevertheless, recent polling data suggests that a majority of Americans believe Trump is making good on his words. Here are Donald Trump’s successes since he took office in January: Supreme Court Nominee Donald Trump kept his promise to nominate a conservative judge to the supreme court, following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last year. Despite opposition from Democrats, on April 7th Neil Gorsuch was confirmed as the 113th justice of the U.S Supreme Court, which could help cement a conservative majority on the SCOTUS for decades. Congratulations to Justice Neil Gorsuch on his elevation to the United States Supreme Court. A great day for America! #SCOTUS pic.twitter.com/8KGFSk8BFj — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 10, 2017 Immigration Trump’s executive order guiding immigration enforcement agencies to apprehend illegal aliens as well as hire thousands of new staff has undoubtedly helped stem the tide of illegal immigration from Mexico into the United States. In the months of January and February alone, illegal border crossings dropped by 40 percent. Furthermore, the Trump administration is cracking down on sanctuary cities that protect illegal immigrants. Attorney General Jeff Sessions this week sent a letter to 10 cities failing to comply with federal immigration law, warning that they risk losing federal funding if they continue to do so. As part of the crackdown, the Department of Homeland Security is also publishing a weekly list of localities refusing to cooperate, as well as the crimes committed by illegal aliens within them. However, significant progress on Trump’s key promise to build a wall on the southern border has yet to be made. National Security Due to federal courts blocking Trump’s executive orders suspending Obama’s refugee program and introducing a temporary travel ban from a number of terror-prone countries, making progress on securing America’s borders from potential terror threats has been difficult.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 However, Trump appears to be making good on his promise to “destroy ISIS,” with a significant increase in the number of airstrikes targeting terrorists in the Middle East, North Africa, and Afghanistan. This has been made easier by Trump expanding commanders’ targeting authorities and rolling back restrictions on military strikes put into place by the Obama administration. The Trump administration has also signaled that it is ready to take action against the impending threat of North Korea. As tensions between both countries rise, Trump has positioned “an armada” in the Korean peninsula, while this week military officials began the installment of controversial Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in South Korea, designed to protect South Korea from incoming missiles. North Korea is looking for trouble. If China decides to help, that would be great. If not, we will solve the problem without them! U.S.A. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 11, 2017 Trump also appears to have secured greater support from China in tackling the North Korean problem. Last week, China positioned 150,000 troops along their the North Korean border, as well as sending a fleet of fully-loaded cargo ships destined for North Korea back home. This week, China warned North Korea not to “cross the point of no return” by conducting another nuclear test.

Having met with a range of business leaders, he has received assurances from companies such as Ford and Carrier Corporations to cancel their overseas plans and instead invest in America. Leading technology firms such as Apple, Amazon, Samsung, and Intel have also pledged to create thousands of new jobs in America over the coming years. JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! pic.twitter.com/wAkQMKdPXA — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 14, 2017 Furthermore, recent economic indicators have been overwhelmingly positive. The economy added nearly 300,000 private sector jobs in the first full month of Trump’s presidency, with the U.S. unemployment rate at 4.5 percent. In March, the Dow Jones industrial average also rose above 21,000 points for the first time in its history. Energy and climate change Trump has taken steps to roll back environmental regulations and revitalize the coal industry. In late March, Trump signed an executive order ending some of Barack Obama’s regulations, declaring that his administration was “putting an end to the war on coal,” a promise made to Americans reliant on the coal industry in rustbelt states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2017 In his first White House budget, Trump proposes cutting the budget of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by 31 percent, as well as approving the Keystone XL pipeline previously blocked by Barack Obama. The head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Scott Pruitt, also confirmed that America should “exit” the Paris Climate Agreement signed by Barack Obama last November, although no decisive action has yet been taken. Draining the swamp Trump has made steady inroads in his attempt to “drain the Washington swamp,” introducing a number of policies making it increasingly difficult for lobbyists and bureaucrats to leech off their proximity to power. Some of those policies include Trump signing an executive order cutting two regulations for every new regulation proposed, as well as introducing regulatory watchdogs that dissolve federal agencies’ power as rule makers. Furthermore, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney has warned federal agencies to prepare for massive cuts as part of Trump’s effort to streamline government. They include a 31 percent cut to the Environmental Protection Agency, a 28 percent cut to the State Department, and a 17.9 percent cut to the Department of Health and Human Services.

War on the media Since assuming the presidency, Trump has escalated his already hostile relationship with the mainstream media. Regularly referring to them as the “fake news media,” he has targeted networks such as ABC, NBC, and CNN for biased reporting, even describing them as the “enemy of the American people.” The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017 These assertions are backed up by data. A recent analysis found that 88 percent of mainstream media coverage is anti-Trump. Amid the rising tensions, Trump has confirmed he will not be attending this year’s White House Correspondents Dinner, becoming the first president to do so in 30 years. Diplomacy While in the Oval Office, Trump has held successful meetings with a range of foreign leaders, all of which appear to have been successful. British Prime Minister Theresa May — The pair discussed forging a potential trade deal as Britain prepares to leave the European Union. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — Trump said that although U.S and Canada’s strong trading relationship would continue, both countries need to “tweak” the current trade settlement. Japenese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe — Abe promised that future trade relations between American and Asia must be both “free and fair.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — Trump scrapped decades of U.S. policy urging a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, while Netanyahu argued there is “no greater supporter of the Jewish people” than Trump. German Chancellor Angela Merkel — Despite Trump previously describing Merkel’s migrant policy as “catastrophic,” the German Chancellor said that both leaders would “work together hand in hand” to solve global crises. Trump also reminded Merkel that “Nato allies [must] pay their fair share for the cost of defense.” Chinese President Xi Jinping — Trump claimed the pair made “tremendous progress” in improving the relationship between the two countries, adding that he had received assurances China would do more to solve the issue of North Korea. Abortion and Planned Parenthood On the whole, Donald Trump has kept his promise to govern as a pro-life president. Within days of his inauguration, Trump signed an executive order that reinstated the Mexico City Policy, a rule that bans non-governmental organizations (NGOs) receiving U.S. funds – including International Planned Parenthood – from providing or promoting abortions overseas.

(Reuters/Brendan McDermid) NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks edged lower on Wall Street on Friday after data showing the U.S. economy grew at its weakest pace in three years in the first quarter gave traders a reason to cash recent gains. Major indexes closed up for April, however, with the Nasdaq up for six consecutive months, the longest streak in nearly four years. Gross domestic product grew at a 0.7 percent annual rate, below the 1.2 percent rise estimated by economists, as consumer spending barely increased and businesses invested less in inventories. The economy grew at a 2.1 percent pace in the fourth quarter. “GDP was a little bit light and that may be the cause of some weakness today,” said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas. Citi Research’s gauge on U.S. economic data surprises turned negative for the first time since November. The soft growth data is bad news for the Trump administration after campaign promises to significantly boost growth and adds to concerns among some in the market that lower taxes, deregulation and increased government spending – the main reasons for a post-election rally – will be, at the least, delayed. “We saw the rally fade quite a bit into the last part of the first quarter,” said Bradshaw. “I think you’re going to have to see some [legislation] within the next couple of months, otherwise the market will become disenchanted. So far it’s been all talk, no show.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 40.82 points, or 0.19 percent, to close at 20,940.51, the S&P 500 lost 4.57 points, or 0.19 percent, to 2,384.2 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.33 points, or 0.02 percent, to 6,047.61. For the week, the Dow rose 1.9 percent, the S&P gained 1.5 percent and the Nasdaq rose 2.3 percent. During April, the Dow gained 1.3 percent, the S&P rose 0.9 percent and the Nasdaq jumped 2.3 percent. The Nasdaq was buoyed Friday by gains in Amazon and Google’s parent Alphabet. Amazon rose as much as 3.4 percent to a life high of $949.59, and ended up 0.7 percent at $924.99, while Alphabet gained as much as 5 percent to a record of $935.90 and closed up 3.7 percent at $924.52 after their quarterly results beat estimates. Combined earnings reports and expectations for S&P 500 companies show profits are estimated to have risen 13.6 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. While strong earnings have kept the market at or near record levels, persistent geopolitical tensions have weighed on investors’ minds. Intel fell 3.4 percent to $36.15 after the company reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue. Baidu ended down 4.1 percent at $180.23 after the Chinese internet company forecast second-quarter revenue largely below estimates. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.59-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.76-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 39 new 52-week highs and six new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 103 new highs and 44 new lows. About 6.94 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges on Friday, above the 6.55 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman ZEISS and ASML Strengthen Partnership for Next Generation of EUV Lithography Due in Early 2020s ASML buys 24.9% of ZEISS subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT for EUR 1 billion in cash Start of development of entirely new High NA optical system for the future generation of EUV ASML supports Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capex for approximately EUR 760 million over the next 6 years VELDHOVEN, the Netherlands/OBERKOCHEN, Germany – 3 November 2016 – Netherlands-based ASML Holding NV, one of the world’s leading chip industry equipment providers, and Germany-based Carl Zeiss SMT, a business group of Carl Zeiss AG (ZEISS), have agreed to strengthen their long-standing and successful partnership in the semiconductor lithography business. The main objective of this agreement is to facilitate the development of the future generation of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems due in the first few years of the next decade. This technology will enable the semiconductor industry to produce much higher performance microchips at lower costs. ZEISS and ASML jointly announce today, that they have agreed on a 24.9% minority stake of ASML in ZEISS’s subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT, for which ASML will pay ZEISS EUR 1 billion in cash. The companies stated that no further exchange of shares is planned or agreed. ASML is a key supplier of semiconductor patterning products and services used by the world`s top producers of microchips. With its high-performance optics Carl Zeiss SMT supplies an essential subsystem of ASML´s semiconductor lithography scanners and is ASML`s most important strategic partner. ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT have been in close partnership for more than 30 years. Both firms have grown strongly over the last decades benefiting from each other`s strengths. A new cycle of investments required for the development of an entirely new optical system for the future generation of EUV, expected to be provided to the chip making industry in the first few years of the next decade, has triggered the partners to take a further step in the collaboration. “In 2018 the first chips made on current technology EUV scanners are expected to roll off the production lines of our customers. A lot of work is still being done to ensure the introduction of EUV in volume manufacturing, in tight conjunction with our highly successful immersion scanners which we continue to improve. Yet ASML and ZEISS are looking beyond this important milestone. We see a long and successful future for EUV lithography in advanced chip manufacturing and with this agreement we set the right conditions for development of the next generation of EUV by ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT, so that our customers can reap the rewards of their EUV investments up to the end of the next decade,” said Peter Wennink, President and Chief Executive Officer of ASML. “With this agreement we clear the road for advanced lithography to support the new concepts and designs for future generations of advanced chips. After the many years of fruitful partnership, we see this agreement as a further strong endorsement of our long term cooperation which allows us to further expand our joint leadership that we have already accomplished together”, says Michael Kaschke, President and CEO of ZEISS. The next generation of EUV optics will offer a higher numerical aperture (NA), making it possible to further reduce critical dimensions in the lithography process. The current EUV systems have an optical system with NA of 0.33 whereas the new optics will have NA larger than 0.5, enabling several generations of geometric chip scaling. In addition to the agreement of the minority interest, the two companies have also agreed that ASML will support Carl Zeiss SMT`s research and development (R&D) for approximately EUR 220 million as well as capital expenditures and other supply chain investments for approximately EUR 540 million over the next 6 years. These investments will predominantly be allocated at Carl Zeiss SMT’s main location in Oberkochen, Germany, and will primarily be used for capacity and resource expansions, with positive effects on long-term employment at this location. Carl Zeiss SMT will remain fully integrated into the structure of the ZEISS Group as one of the major and important business groups. “High-NA is the logical next step for EUV, as it circumvents complex and expensive 0.33 NA EUV multiple patterning. High-NA EUV is a robust way for chips to scale all the way down to the sub-3 nanometer logic node in a single exposure with high productivity and reduced cost per feature. That is several generations from where we are today and underlines our commitment to propel Moore’s law,” said Martin van den Brink, President and Chief Technology Officer at ASML. Carl Zeiss SMT will pay an annual dividend to its shareholders Carl Zeiss AG and ASML. ASML expects that the minority share transaction will be accretive to its earnings before adjustments related to purchase price accounting and differences in accounting standards. Furthermore, ASML`s contribution to Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capital expenditures will be taken into account in the future pricing of SMT`s next generation EUV optics to ASML. The transaction has been approved by both companies’ supervisory boards. ASML will fund the transaction from available cash, potentially supplemented by new debt. The transaction is subject to regulatory clearance and is expected to be closed in the second quarter of 2017. Update ASML Share Buyback Program In light of the investments by ASML announced today, ASML will prolong the pause of its share buy back program for the time being. As a result, the 2016-2017 program may not be completed for the full amount. Otherwise, the current program will remain in place, yet it may be further suspended, modified or discontinued at any time. As part of ASML’s financial policy to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and regularly timed share buyback programs, ASML in January 2016 announced its intention to purchase up to EUR 1.5 billion of shares to be executed within the 2016-2017 time frame. About Moore`s law The phenomenal growth of the semiconductor industry has been driven by Moore’s Law, named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore. In 1965, Moore observed that the number of components on a chip that could be manufactured at optimum cost had doubled every year. He predicted that this trend would continue. It was an empirical observation, not a law of nature. In the five decades that followed, the “law” has been rewritten several times, but the principle continues: chip makers cram more transistors on ICs with every new generation, making computing power and storage capacity cheaper year after year. Today’s consumers carry more computing power in their pockets than a multi-million-dollar supercomputer could deliver in the 1970s. Moore’s Law has inspired generations of engineers to push technology forward. About ASML ASML is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of chip-making equipment. Our vision is to enable affordable microelectronics that improve the quality of life. To achieve this, our mission is to invent, develop, manufacture and service advanced technology for high-tech lithography, metrology and software solutions for the semiconductor industry.

Join For Free Discover how to protect your applications from known and unknown vulnerabilities. When we asked 25 IT security executives this question we heard two themes: 1) the threat landscape is expanding exponentially; and, 2) more sophisticated hackers are making a lot of money. Expanded Threat Landscape 1) Politically motivated attacks. Cyber warfare is driving regime change. We’ve moved from weapons to cyber warfare. 2) Ransomware. 3) IoT (e.g., Dyn attack). People don’t worry enough about security and end up keeping things on default values. Mobile is the most vulnerable because there’s no news about hacks; however, they are taking place. IoT and mobile will shift to cybercrime with ransomware on refrigerators. Need to test for mobile and IoT vulnerabilities. There will be watershed events on both in the coming year with ransomware being the big issue. IoT devices. Vendors are still deploying products with default passwords or vulnerabilities. Advanced phishing techniques download malicious apps. Google began rejecting all Symantec SSL certificates. Shift toward DevOps, Cloud, Mobile has changed how we monitor and respond. There are fewer system administrators and more software developers. This impacts the skillset of what’s needed. Criminals are opportunistic and will find the low hanging fruit. All the places where software is now that it didn’t used to be – smartphones and IoT devices as opposed to just websites, browsers, and operating systems. You need a strategy for servicing and patching bugs in the wild. Encrypt data in transit. We have webcams with default passwords and backdoors left in by intention or ignorance. Changes in the processing landscape have given hackers access to thousands of cores to conduct brute-force attacks. State actors are listening to everything. 15 years ago we worried about credit card data. Today it’s heart monitors, data streams of locations, and biometrics. The rise in the number of IoT devices has led to a more relaxed atmosphere with regards to secure coding. Companies want to get the devices out the door at a low cost, with a low coding expense. This results in using insecure coding calls that don’t track user bounds and leads to buffer overflows – a problem that was solved years ago. A lot of firmware development is being done overseas by self-taught developers that don’t emphasize security. Companies will take for granted that what they get is secure instead of checking the firmware for security once it’s in house. You can use Veracode or HP Verify; however, how do you know there are no vulnerabilities when you combine them with third-party applications and device drivers? You need to check the security of your devices after the compilation process. More cloud, IoT, open source, and open stack that lack security controls. Without standards or controls to rely on, there’s an increased risk of adoption. We are also dealing with shared security on clouds. Prevention, detection, and response alone are not enough. You need to worry about all three. You need to prevent hackers from coming back. There needs to be more sharing and automation for threat hunting so you can respond to modern hackers. A lot of attention is being paid to attribution, ransomware, compromise attacks, and IoT attacks. These are challenging operational capabilities since we’ll have 40 billion devices by 2020. We lack the talent and the capability to prevent breaches today. The biggest challenge is educating those who are not educated – people who don’t know what they don’t know and aren’t interested in learning. We expect vendors to take care of the security of the devices they’re selling us but they’re not. In the transportation (automobile) industry, three of four vendors are providing a key component with security controls; however, these controls are not being implemented during installation the way they were intended due to lack of CPU power or lack of LAN access. Taking old technology and bolting it on to new technology just opens us up to DDOS attacks that could stop all transportation the way BART was stopped. Tracks and trains can be hacked. Filters on flash and macros in Office 365 can be overridden and this can lead to significant unintended consequences. How do we see and act on these unintended consequences? The advent of cloud access security or cloud security as a service. More companies are using the cloud with Microsoft Office and Google’s G-Suite. We extend threat protection to the cloud including sandboxes and DLP. From attacks on endpoints to attacks on servers. In banking, we used to worry about malware and Trojan horses targeting PCs and mobile devices. Now hackers are attacking the core enterprise systems, including the ERP. They’ve moved from stealing credit card data to more valuable information like healthcare data. IoT devices are not being patched. Already in support and more are coming out. It's a very human-intensive process. And it's hard to sell people on patching webcams or refrigerators that need to run software updates. We need the ability to automatically update the firmware. Develop the strategy when supporting any device. Companies have been developing and deploying more and more apps to the cloud in the last two to three years providing new risks and new risk vectors. Security has been around for 20 years but app and IoT developers fail to follow best practices. It’s a mess that’s going to get worse. In the development and operations world, change is needed in application security. Application security is not keeping up with CI/CD. We have the same issues as we’ve had for the past 10 years – SQL injections and cross-eyed scripting continue to be big issues. There has not been a lot of innovation. We need new strategies with CI/CD to integrate security tools into CI. Perimeter defense is gone in light of mobile phones, web cameras, the internet, and Ethernet. Now you must complement the traditional perimeter defense. Design to be cloud-based first. You must be able to detect movement in space. IoT must be hardened – the security of the device and the gateway. 1) For the modern-day CISO, the proliferation of cloud-based mobile apps has dramatically increased the exposed surface area of the business. Each new app requires and enables access to organizational data and assets, and unless the security team was explicitly involved in the app’s creation, acquisition, and delivery, users inside and outside the organization may have access to data and the ability to expose it without the CISO even being aware. 2) This challenge of visibility is compounded by the lack of standards by which organizational data and assets are shared and exposed. Different business units may adopt their own approach to security, or perhaps not take one at all, making the CISO’s job of propagating security best practices unwieldy. The landscape has been changing for a while. We are seeing most attacks residing on the application level. The reasons are clear: peripheral security such as network security is already a commodity and hackers don’t need to struggle avoiding firewalls and IPS systems when they have applications that are a direct communication channel to the enterprise data. The same goes for endpoint protection; exploiting vulnerabilities in web and mobile applications is much less time consuming and achieves better and faster results. Therefore, the change we are seeing is that the hackers have figured out the code to be a weak spot in many cases because developers rarely have the skills or the proper tools to identify when they expose a vulnerability in the code. More Sophisticated Hackers The threat space has changed – there are new groups and new tools. The tech space has also changed with mobile and IoT. New monetization techniques like ransomware. Liquid, easy to use currency like bitcoin has enabled a new marketplace of tools to come into the market the last two years. While black hats still go after individual users, they’re more likely to go after big money from larger organizations like hospitals, governments, and businesses, including law firms. A lot of attacks are taking place and payments being made with no reports since they are not required. It’s hard to know what’s really going on. Companies are making six figure settlements without reporting the breach because they don’t want their image tarnished. Most of these are endpoint and application security vulnerabilities. Based on a study from Accenture, 70% of threats are from internal sources (i.e., disgruntled employees). Cyber threats have become more organized whether they’re corporate espionage or state-sponsored threats. Attacks are more sophisticated. According to an Intel study, there’s been a 170% increase in ransomware with malicious code put on the database. There has also been a growth in advanced persistent threats. Hackers quietly siphon passwords and encryption keys maintaining a low profile with no indications of compromise. This type of activity is harder to detect. No network is 100% impenetrable. It helps to track behavior and correlate it versus threat data to proactively shut down the attack before significant damage is done. Also, make sure to profile and identify suspicious behaviors and shut them down. Nation-state attacks used to be the most sophisticated. Today, even middle of the road hackers are sophisticated. We’ve become more aware of zero-days on shelf malware ready to hit. We’re much more responsive than we used to be. More sophisticated attacks are happening daily. Healthcare and retail are particularly scary. Threats are multifaceted using well-known infrastructures. Social engineering. Most sophisticated use platforms like Dropbox, HubSpot, and other distributed techniques that are freely available. Slower cooker payload may be delivered in 50 days. Temporal difference across different application platforms (i.e., Twitter, Box, Drobox) much more complicated. Command and transport. Layer of obfuscation – not a blacklisted domain payload delivered to a CRM used as a proxy to another infrastructure. This is very complex. Hackers are targeting large corporations. Hackers are more sophisticated. Larger organizations have so many points of entry that are not closed. A directory with an org chart opens a company for social engineering attacks. Everything is becoming more connected – BYOD, laptops, mobile connecting to Wi-Fi. We see criminals making more money from the internet than any other area. Ransomware attacks on banks. The internet can generate more money. I expect this to continue and grow. Customers are more computerized. The manufacturing supply and demand chains are all connected. Vulnerabilities will increase. Organizations need to ramp up cyber security capabilities. Attackers are using second vectors to attack the target using social engineering. There are more distributed, scalable attacks with cloud and containers. Cybersecurity threats are distributed. There is no longer a known signature. Indicators of compromise and attack are distributed. How attack patterns change, shift from tools, gain access to reconnaissance. Leverage attributes of the environment to take advantage of them.

The demo consists of the first hour of the game, although Bethesda says in the announcement post that it could be more, depending on how you play.

Here's just how much rig you need to play Prey: Minimum Requirements CPU: Intel i5-2400 or AMD FX-8320 GPU: GTX 660 2GB or AMD Radeon 7850 2GB Memory: 8 GB Recommended Requirements CPU: Intel i7-2600K or AMD FX-8350 GPU: GTX 970 4GB or AMD R9 290 4GB Memory: 16 GB Pre-order customers can pre-load the game on PS4 at midnight ET April 28.

Who hasn’t been influenced by great novels like Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash, which gave us virtual worlds, or Tom Cruise’s data gloves and gesture-controlled computer in Minority Report? Now those things have become real, and we want to see what’s coming next. Our theme is about what inspires game developers, executives, and investors to be creative. Part of the event will focus on the inspiration cycle that is accelerating as the walls between science fiction, video games, and real-world technology come down. We don’t think there’s another conference that focuses on the seams between these industries. This event will focus on inspiration and creativity. So much of what used to be science fiction is coming true, and it is inspiring even more accelerated visions of the future in games and other entertainment. We hope to inspire you by taking you to the moments that led to great ideas across multiple industries. You’ll leave refreshed and ready to change the worlds of gaming, technology, and more. We think this conference will offer a rare chance for cross-pollination and networking between high-level people in different industries, and we believe that insights in one place can lead to inspirations in another. This conference is for high-end gaming executives, startup CEOs, developers, investors, publishers, marketers, tech experts, entertainment industry professionals, sci-fi experts, AR and VR executives, and other professionals. I should also point out that this is where we try to create an actual GamesBeat community with our supporters, readers, and attendees. We gather the right people in the room and encourage everyone to get to know each other. Join us. If you’re interested in sponsoring, message andie.rhyins@venturebeat.com.

Photo: Bloomberg 1 2 Stocks on Friday edged lower on Wall Street after data showing the US economy grew at its weakest pace in three years in the first quarter gave traders a reason to cash gains. However, major indices closed up for this month, with the NASDAQ up for six consecutive months, the longest streak in nearly four years. The US’ GDP grew at a 0.7 percent annual rate, below the 1.2 percent rise estimated by economists, as consumer spending barely increased and businesses invested less in inventories. The economy grew at a 2.1 percent pace in the fourth quarter of last year. “GDP was a little bit light and that may be the cause of some weakness today,” said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, Texas. Citi Research’s gauge on US economic data surprises turned negative for the first time since November last year. The soft growth data is bad news for the administration of US President Donald Trump after campaign promises to significantly boost growth and adds to concerns among some in the market that lower taxes, deregulation and increased government spending — the main reasons for a post-election rally — will be, at the least, delayed. “We saw the rally fade quite a bit into the last part of the first quarter,” Bradshaw said. “I think you’re going to have to see some [legislation] within the next couple of months, otherwise the market will become disenchanted. So far it’s been all talk, no show.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Friday fell 40.82 points, or 0.19 percent, to close at 20,940.51, the S&P 500 lost 4.57 points, or 0.19 percent, to 2,384.2 and the NASDAQ Composite dropped 1.33 points, or 0.02 percent, to 6,047.61. For the week, the Dow rose 1.9 percent, the S&P gained 1.5 percent and the NASDAQ rose 2.3 percent. This month, the Dow gained 1.3 percent, the S&P rose 0.9 percent and the NASDAQ jumped 2.3 percent. The NASDAQ was on Friday buoyed by gains in Amazon.com Inc and Google’s parent Alphabet Inc. Amazon rose as much as 3.4 percent to a life high of US$949.59, and ended up 0.7 percent at US$924.99, while Alphabet gained as much as 5 percent to a record of US$935.90 and closed up 3.7 percent at US$924.52 after their quarterly results beat estimates. Combined earnings reports and expectations for S&P 500 companies show profits are estimated to have risen 13.6 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. While strong earnings have kept the market at or near record levels, persistent geopolitical tensions have weighed on investors’ minds. Intel Corp fell 3.4 percent to US$36.15 after the company reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue. Baidu Inc (百度) ended down 4.1 percent at US$180.23 after the Chinese Internet company forecast second-quarter revenue largely below estimates. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the New York Stock Exchange by a 1.59-to-1 ratio; on NASDAQ, a 1.76-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 39 new 52-week highs and six new lows; the NASDAQ Composite recorded 103 new highs and 44 new lows. About 6.94 billion shares changed hands in US exchanges on Friday, above the 6.55 billion daily average over the past 20 sessions. This story has been viewed 1549 times. Comments will be moderated.

Major indexes closed up for April, however, with the Nasdaq up for six consecutive months, the longest streak in nearly four years. Gross domestic product grew at a 0.7 percent annual rate, below the 1.2 percent rise estimated by economists, as consumer spending barely increased and businesses invested less in inventories.

For the week, the Dow rose 1.9 percent, the S&P gained 1.5 percent and the Nasdaq rose 2.3 percent. During April, the Dow gained 1.3 percent, the S&P rose 0.9 percent and the Nasdaq jumped 2.3 percent. The Nasdaq was buoyed Friday by gains in Amazon and Google’s parent Alphabet.

There's been an outpouring of first-hand accounts of sexual harassment, gender discrimination, bullying and racial bias on blogs, social media and in lawsuits. These strongly suggest high rates of turnover among the very groups companies are struggling to keep as they try to change the demographics of their mostly white and Asian male staffs.  According to the "Tech Leavers" study, nearly eight in 10 employees who left tech jobs reported experiencing some form of unfair behavior or treatment, while 85% observed it. And 37% said they left their jobs because of it. In fact, unfair behavior and treatment was the No. 1 reason given for leaving, and was twice as likely to be cited than being recruited for a better opportunity.  Other findings: -Women experienced and observed far more unfairness than men. -Nearly one-quarter of underrepresented men and women of color experienced stereotyping, twice the rate of white and Asian men and women.  -Nearly one-third of underrepresented women of color were passed over for promotion, more than any other group.  -LGBT employees were the most likely to be bullied (20%) and experience public humiliation (24%) and 64% said it contributed to their decision to leave. -Men from underrepresented groups, such as African Americans, Latinos and Native Americans, were most likely to leave due to unfairness (40%). -Underrepresented women of color were significantly more likely to cite unfairness as a reason for leaving than white and Asian women (36% versus 28%). -Nearly a quarter of underrepresented men and women experienced stereotyping in their previous job and at almost twice the rate of white and Asian men and women. -Employees in tech companies were significantly more likely to leave due to unfairness than technical employees in other industries (42% versus 32%). Ellen Pao, who brought an unsuccessful gender discrimination lawsuit against one of Silicon Valley's most powerful venture capital firms, triggering a national debate on the treatment of women, says everyone knew this sense of unfairness was prevalent in tech — particularly with regard to women and underrepresented people of color. "Now we have the data to understand the scale of these issues," said Pao, now chief diversity and inclusion officer at the Kapor Center for Social Impact and a venture partner at Kapor Capital. The study reinforces earlier findings that the tech industry is like a sieve for underrepresented groups. One study found that women in tech leave their jobs at twice the rate of men. Another found that after about 12 years, about half of women had left their jobs in STEM fields, mostly in computing or engineering. Previous studies mostly focused on the experiences of women in the industry. The Kapor study is one of the first to turn its attention to a nationally representative sample of all groups, including groups that are underrepresented in tech such as women, African Americans and Hispanics. Diversity experts say the percentage of each demographic group that remains with a company each year could be the most telling data with which to gauge how inclusive a workplace is. Retention rates naturally vary year to year but should not vary greatly across demographic groups, they say. In the study, why underrepresented groups left their jobs "is where we see differences," Dr. Scott said. "All groups left due to unfairness but for different types of unfairness." Former Uber software engineer Susan Fowler, who made explosive allegations of sexism and harassment at the ride-hailing company in a post on her personal blog that led to an internal investigation, said her request to transfer to another team to avoid her harasser was rejected because of retention concerns. "It turned out that keeping me on the team made my manager look good, and I overheard him boasting to the rest of the team that even though the rest of the teams were losing their women engineers left and right, he still had some on his team," wrote Fowler who left Uber in December. So Fowler calculated the retention rate for her department. She says it had slipped from being about a quarter female to 6% in a year.  "Women were transferring out of the organization, and those who couldn't transfer were quitting or preparing to quit," she said. $16 billion cost According to the Kapor Center, a black man responded to the survey that he observed several people being passed over for salary raises and promotions because they didn't fall in line with the "jock culture." "Gross generalizations were made of groups of people," he wrote. "I was offended by the liberal use of stereotypes and the insistence on making a 'welcoming culture' that truly focused on only improving work life for a single demographic.” Women, African Americans and Hispanics are underrepresented in all occupations within the tech sector when compared to the U.S. population and the private sector as a whole. Among the top-grossing tech companies such as Apple, Facebook and Google, black and Latino employees combined represent 3% to 5% of employees, numbers that have not budged in three years, Kapor Center found. Since first going public with their diversity problem in 2014, tech companies have spent hundreds of millions on diversity initiatives, many of which focus on recruitment, hiring and programs such as unconscious bias training. The tech industry frequently blames the "pipeline" for not delivering enough qualified candidates from underrepresented backgrounds. But Kapor Center co-chair Freada Kapor Klein says the more nuanced and accurate way to frame the issue is to look at the complex set of biases and barriers that begin in preschool and persist in the workplace that have kept women and people of color from gaining access to some of the nation's highest-paying jobs in one of its most sought after economic sectors.  She believes how those underrepresented groups are treated once inside these companies goes a long way toward explaining why tech companies can't get their diversity numbers to budge. Intel is outside the norm Intel is one of the only tech companies to release its retention data. Retention became a key focus after the tech giant realized underrepresented groups were leaving at higher rates. In February, Intel said it had reduced those rates, achieving a 15% exit rate for women and people of color compared to a 15.5% exit rate for white and Asian men and women. The semiconductor giant had plenty of incentive to focus on retention, according to the Kapor study. The industry is shelling out an estimated $16 billion a year to replace employees who leave as a result of unfair treatment. Individual tech companies are also taking an incalculable hit to their corporate reputations, the study found. More than a third of disaffected employees in the study said their experiences would make them less likely to refer others to seek jobs at their former employers and a quarter said they would be less likely to recommend others buy or use products from their former employer. Perez is now chief product officer at HealthSherpa, where she says she can bring her "authentic self" to work. She says she and fellow executives think of and treat new employees as co-founders. If she tells the CEO about a feminist book she's reading, he pops it into his Amazon cart. The 20-person start-up, funded by Kapor Capital, has taken the venture capital firm's pledge to boost diversity and is creating diversity and inclusion initiatives.  Retention is a metric that HealthSherpa has consciously started to track, Perez says. If tech companies don't pay attention to it, "you are literally sacrificing pure talent and you are impacting your bottom line." The good news: Improving work culture and adopting a comprehensive diversity and inclusion strategy can reduce attrition. Nearly two-thirds of employees who left tech said they would have stayed if their employer had fixed its culture. "Tech has a huge problem with a culture of disrespect," Klein says, "that plays out differently based on different demographics." "What that means," she says, "it can be changed."

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Notebooks Acer Predator Triton 700 Shows That Thin Notebooks Can Still Pack a GTX 1080 GPU and Keep Temperatures Under the Limit By Omar Sohail 17 hours ago 21Shares Share Tweet Submit Looks like the Razer Blade Pro has a new competitor in the block called the Acer Predator Triton 700. We’ve already seen the Taiwanese company release one behemoth-sized Predator 21 X but it was time the firm really tested its engineers’ ingenuity and together, they’ve come up with this. It is still impressive that they have managed to cram powerful technology into something this thin. However, that will leave customers with one huge compromise that we’ve seen time and time again on these portable machines and that’s the price. Acer Predator Triton 700 Comes With a 15.6-Inch Display, a Fairly Decent Weight and Cools the System Using Its Unique AeroBlade Cooling Solution Normally you guys would expect to see a 17.3-inch display on a gaming notebook that will be able to incorporate something as powerful as the GTX 1080 but then that would defeat the purpose of portability. Featuring a screen size of 15.6 inches, the Predator Triton 700 aims to keep things light as it weighs just 2.6KG. That would give customers the impression that the processor side of things would have to be compromised but that just the complete opposite. Related The Acer Predator Triton 700 Maintains a Very Thin Form Factor Thanks to NVIDIA’s New GTX 1080 Max-Q Chip The Predator Triton 700 comes with an overclockable Intel Kaby Lake processor and since this is a gaming notebook, we’re assuming it is the i7-7820HK running at a base clock speed of 2.90GHz. The unique thing about the notebook is its cooling system and placement of the trackpad. There is a glass touchpad located above the keyboard so you will need to get used to it if you buy one. There is a Full HD IPS panel and the notebook provides support for two NVMe PCIe SSDs coupled with up to 32GB of DDR4 memory running at 2,400MHz. There is also a single Thunderbolt 3 port, two USB 3.0 ports, one USB 2.0 port, Gigabit Ethernet jack, HDMI 2.0 and DisplayPort 1.2. The keyboard according to the company is a mechanical one but it will have lower key travel as opposed to the ones that feature Cherry MX or equivalent switches and each key features separate RGB lighting, which is a craze that is taking the world by storm. Advertisement Acer’s Predator Triton 700 will be available in the U.S. during the month of August at a jaw-dropping price of $2,999. This price may increase depending on the hardware you choose though. If you possess the funds, would you buy this or the Razer Blade Pro? Let us know your thoughts down in the comments.

A dreary reading on first-quarter gross domestic product ( GDP ) and fresh geopolitical tensions with North Korea overshadowed positive earnings reactions for Dow stocks Chevron and Exxon Mobil, as well as a temporary funding measure to avoid a government shutdown, with the blue-chip barometer eventually closing at a loss. The S&P 500 Index ( SPX ) and Nasdaq Composite (COMP) followed suit, but not before the latter notched a fifth straight all-time intraday peak. Despite the day’s lackluster finish, the Dow, S&P, and COMP all closed the week and month higher, with the Nasdaq logging its longest monthly win streak since 2013.

The  Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA – 20,940.51) traded in a slim 61-point range, before settling down 40.8 points, or 0.2%. Intel paced the 21 Dow decliners with its 3.4% loss, while Chevron led the nine advancers with its 1.2% gain. For the week, the Dow added 1.9%, and 1.3% on the month. The  S&P 500 Index (SPX – 2,384.20)  gave back 4.6 points, or 0.2%, paring its weekly and monthly advances to 1.5% and 0.9%, respectively. The Nasdaq Composite (COMP – 6,047.61) edged down 1.3 points, or 0.02%, but not before hitting a record intraday high of 6,074.04. The COMP added 2.3% on the week and month — its sixth straight monthly gain. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX – 10.82) tacked on 0.5 point, or 4.4%. Week-over-week, the market’s „fear gauge” plunged 26%, and surrendered 12.5% in April. 5 Items on Our Radar Today: A U.S. Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling that blocked Anthem ‚s proposed takeover of rival Cigna.

Print Story X Print Story Business April 29, 2017 Share Advertisement Big-data analytics company surges in market debut BENGALURU: Shares of Cloudera Inc surged as much as 24 percent in their stock market debut on Friday, the latest in a string of technology initial public offerings this year, giving the big-data analytics company a market value of about $2.3 billion. Cloudera's offering of 15 million shares was priced at $15 per share, above its expected range of $12-$14, and raised $225 million. Shares opened at $17.80 on the New York Stock Exchange and hit a high of $18.64 in early trading. Cloudera helps businesses store, process and analyse data through Hadoop, an open-source software system that can sort and handle massive amounts of information. The company has more than 1,000 customers, including Dish Network Corp, Citigroup, MasterCard and Cisco Systems. Its closest rival, Hortonworks Inc, whose offerings are also tied to Hadoop, went public in February last year. Hortonworks' shares had climbed about 11 percent since then. Palo Alto, California-based Cloudera's valuation is a steep fall from the $4.1 billion it was once valued at in the private market. Investors including chipmaker Intel Corp piled into Cloudera several years ago when a flood of money into private technology companies pushed valuations skyward. This year has been a hotbed for technology IPOs after a dull 2016, which marked the slowest year for such IPOs since 2008, when just 20 technology companies went public. The number of U.S. IPOs has more than tripled so far in 2017, compared to year-ago levels, with the technology sector leading the issuance market, according to Thomson Reuters data. Snap Inc, the owner of the popular image-sharing app Snapchat, grabbed eyeballs when it went public last month in the biggest technology IPO in three years. Cloudera, founded in 2008, is backed by Fidelity Investments as well as high-profile investors including T Rowe Price and Google Ventures, the venture capital investment arm of Alphabet Inc.   Advertisement Comments Comment Advertisement Topstory Dawn Leaks report implementation: Army angry at order issued by govt Should I resign on your demand, go and play cricket?

Continue Reading Below Major indexes closed up for April, however, with the Nasdaq up for six consecutive months, the longest streak in nearly four years. Gross domestic product grew at a 0.7 percent annual rate, below the 1.2 percent rise estimated by economists, as consumer spending barely increased and businesses invested less in inventories. The economy grew at a 2.1 percent pace in the fourth quarter. "GDP was a little bit light and that may be the cause of some weakness today," said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas. Citi Research's gauge on U.S. economic data surprises turned negative for the first time since November. The soft growth data is bad news for the Trump administration after campaign promises to significantly boost growth and adds to concerns among some in the market that lower taxes, deregulation and increased government spending - the main reasons for a post-election rally - will be, at the least, delayed. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT "We saw the rally fade quite a bit into the last part of the first quarter," said Bradshaw. "I think you're going to have to see some (legislation) within the next couple of months, otherwise the market will become disenchanted. So far it's been all talk, no show." The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 40.82 points, or 0.19 percent, to close at 20,940.51, the S&P 500 lost 4.57 points, or 0.19 percent, to 2,384.2 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.33 points, or 0.02 percent, to 6,047.61. For the week, the Dow rose 1.9 percent, the S&P gained 1.5 percent and the Nasdaq rose 2.3 percent. During April, the Dow gained 1.3 percent, the S&P rose 0.9 percent and the Nasdaq jumped 2.3 percent. The Nasdaq was buoyed Friday by gains in Amazon and Google's parent Alphabet. Amazon rose as much as 3.4 percent to a life high of $949.59, and ended up 0.7 percent at $924.99, while Alphabet gained as much as 5 percent to a record of $935.90 and closed up 3.7 percent at $924.52 after their quarterly results beat estimates. Combined earnings reports and expectations for S&P 500 companies show profits are estimated to have risen 13.6 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. While strong earnings have kept the market at or near record levels, persistent geopolitical tensions have weighed on investors' minds. Intel fell 3.4 percent to $36.15 after the company reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue. Baidu ended down 4.1 percent at $180.23 after the Chinese internet company forecast second-quarter revenue largely below estimates. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.59-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.76-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 39 new 52-week highs and six new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 103 new highs and 44 new lows. About 6.94 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges on Friday, above the 6.55 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

However, if you’re after something somewhat portable, you should look elsewhere. For Stunning IPS screen Smart screen and GPU choice Beautiful finish Against Quite pricey Old processor model Middling keyboard There’s something to be said for aspiring to move away from a full-sized desktop and towards a more portable, low-space notebook. The latest Erazer gaming laptop from Medion is technically portable: at 17 inches on the diagonal, it’d be considered a desktop replacement. Packing an Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB of memory, a 480GB solid-state drive (SSD), an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 graphics chip and a G-Sync enabled, 17.3-inch, IPS 1080p screen, this Erazer isn’t about to rob you of a desktop-grade gaming experience just for shrinking down a bit. This is a system more than capable of driving any of the latest AAA titles at a full 60 frames per second (fps) at 1080p, in beautifully color accurate detail with little to any worry. Couple that with Nvidia’s G-Sync technology, and watch as screen tearing and frame drops become a thing of the past. Spec Sheet Here is the Medion Erazer configuration sent to TechRadar for review: CPU: 2.6GHz Intel Core i7-6700HQ (quad-core, 6MB cache, up to 3.5GHz) Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 (8GB GDDR5); Intel HD Graphics 530 RAM: 16GB DDR4 (SODIMM; 2 x 8GB) Screen: 17.3-inch FHD (1,920 x 1,080) IPS LED Storage: 480GB SSD (SATA 3) Ports: 3 x USB 3.1, 2 x USB 3.1 Type C, 2 x Mini DisplayPort, HDMI-out, LAN RJ45, SD/SDHC/SDXC memory card reader, mic-in, line-in, S/PDIF Connectivity: Intel Wireless-AC 8260 (802.11ac); Bluetooth 4.1 Camera: Full HD webcam Weight: 7.7 pounds (3.5kg) Size: 16.4 x 11.2 x 1.3 inches (418 x 287 x 34.2mm; W x D x H) Price, availability and value But, with an asking price of £1,699 (about $2,199, AU$2,937), is the Erazer worth plunking down that much for a recently-dated processor and an apparent lack of spinning storage? That is a huge chunk of money, regardless of how you look at it, especially for the spec sheet this laptop touts, compared to the desktop competition much less laptops. Don’t believe us? As of this writing, for £1,706 you could get a Ryzen 7 1700 CPU, Samsung 850 Evo 500GB SSD, 1TB Seagate HDD, 32GB of HyperX DDR4 memory, a Gigabyte GTX 1070 and a 27-inch, BenQ 1440p IPS screen – with a solid set of peripherals – for almost exactly the same amount of cash.  That’s a system with four times as much computational power, three times as much storage, twice as much memory, running on a screen that’s 10 inches larger and at twice the resolution. Ultimately, you’re paying for that portability. For that same money or less, you could have an HP Omen 17, replete with one of the latest Intel Core i7 processors (Kaby Lake) as well as a 128GB SSD + 1TB hard drive (HDD) combo. Likewise, you can get a custom-built Origin EON17-X laptop for a few more hundred bucks with more recent hardware. And, honestly, we just don’t see a big portability play here with the Erazer. It’s big, it’s bulky and it’s just too much to cart on a commute. What does that leave you with? A system that you essentially still leave in one place from day to day. As for availability, Medion serves both the US and UK as well as most of western Europe. Design That said, the Erazer is truly a beauty. Although the LED lighting, situated around the trackpad and the back of the screen, may be less than appealing to those looking for a sleeker, more professional device, the soft touch finish wrapping the rest of the system is simply stunning. And, while it’s certainly not the most portable of notebooks, the sharp angles situated around the design keep it looking sleek. The bezel is a little chunkier than we’d like, and the standard membrane keyboard leaves much to be desired (especially for the price), but there’s a lot to be said for it. What did impress, however, was the cooling system. No doubt due in part to its large size, but it was rare for us to hear the fans ramp up, if at all.  That said, unsurprisingly, the fans are somewhat whiney when they do kick in, but they’re nothing that a good pair of headphones can’t drown out. While, frankly, you shouldn’t have to, most of the time you’ll be buried into a good game, so it’s not something we’ll get too hung up on with how rarely it happens. The I/O, on the other hand – oh boy, what a compliment. With the Erazer, you could effectively run three additional displays attached to this monster. Memory abound, storage absent Storage, however, is one area in which the Erazer really comes unglued. In short, you get a single 480GB SSD. Fill that up with your run-of-the-mill OS programs, and you’ll be left with less than 280GB for games – not ideal. Considering the Erazer nears the £1,700 mark, and given it’s humongous dimensions, we have to ask: why no additional HDD? Fortunately, the situation regarding memory is far merrier. With two out of four available DIMMs taken up with two 8GB RAM modules of DDR4 RAM, meaning you could throw another 16GB in for good measure, to give you a total of 32GB, which useful for media rendering tasks.  However, in that scenario, a seriously beefy external HDD, or a dedicated NAS, would almost be a necessity. Benchmarks Here’s how the Medion Erazer X7849 performed in our suite of benchmark tests: 3DMark Sky Diver: 25,396; Fire Strike: 12,136; Time Spy: 4,997 CineBench R15 CPU: 688 points; GPU: 85.63 fps GeekBench 4: 3,784 single-core; 13,510 multi-core PCMark 8 Home: 3,871 points PCMark 8 Battery Life: 2 Hours and 53 Minutes Battery Life (Techradar Movie Test): 2 Hours and 37 minutes Deus Ex Mankind Divided (1080p Ultra): 55 fps; (1080p Low): 107 fps GTA V (1080p Ultra): 54 fps; (1080p Low): 167 fps Performance Computational performance was a little lower than we expected, averaging below 700 on CineBench R15’s multi-threaded performance, as to be expected from the mobile Skylake processor buried at the heart of this wee beastie.  That last point is a bit of a stickler for us. At this point in time, Skylake is looking positively old in the world of advancing processors. Although Kaby Lake launched early in 2017, the mobile parts have been available since before December.  On top of that, Kaby Lake X, Intel’s next generation processor, is supposedly right around the corner, meaning we could soon see a slew of new mobile parts hit the mainstream. Couple that with AMD promising Ryzen mobile parts within the next quarter, and the aging Skylake core looks positively decrepit. Does that mean the Core i7-6700HQ is chump change at this point? Yes and no. It’s still a serious contender, even in its mobile form factor, equalling roughly the same processing power as any keen-eyed Core i5-6600K desktop-side. If you’re looking to dabble in video rendering and editing on the move, it should be more than plenty to whet your appetite. As for graphics performance, the Erazer is well outclassed by the Origin EON17-X we reviewed last winter and on par with the HP Omen 17 of fall 2016. A battery bummer But, the big one is battery, right? In our testing, we found that during intense video playback, the battery lasted 2 hours and 37 minutes. So, enough to get the latest Marvel film done and dusted, and maybe go through some bonus features, but not quite long enough to get a good Peter Jackson ode to New Zealand quite all the way through. Similarly, the PCMark 8 Home battery test reported a somewhat lackluster 2 hours and 53 minutes. Both of these figures are expectedly a far cry from the 4 hours promised by Medion. Final verdict Ultimately, the Erazer is a fine piece of work. Its soft touch finish makes the product feel premium enough, but it doesn’t tout the aluminium stylings we’ve seen from similarly-priced Asus, HP or Dell laptops.  That said, this laptop should feel like home to any who spend the majority of their free time gaming, its frame resisting sweaty fingerprints and greasy food stains. Performance is solid, dependable even. And, the coupling of that GTX 1070 with a 1080p screen should mean you’re set for any AAA title that launches over the next two to three years at least, without tweaking any major settings. The price, though, and the lack of portability that comes with it, makes the Erazer less appealing than we’d hoped. If a spinning hard drive was thrown into the mix, we could perhaps forgive it, but for what Medion is asking, well, it’s just a little too much for what’s on the table.

Photo / YouTube One hundred days ago, I took the oath of office and made a pledge: We are not merely going to transfer political power from one party to another, but instead are going to transfer that power from Washington, D.C., and give it back to the people. In the past 100 days, I have kept that promise - and more. Issue by issue, department by department, we are giving the people their country back. After decades of a shrinking middle class, open borders and the mass offshoring of American jobs and wealth, this government is working for the citizens of our country and no one else. The same establishment media that concealed these problems - and profited from them - is obviously not going to tell this story. That is why we are taking our message directly to America. We have opened the White House doors to listen, engage and act. We've invited in labor leaders, factory owners, police officers, farmers, veterans and Democrats, Republicans and independents. The change began with the termination of the Trans-Pacific Partnership - a 12-nation pact that would have shipped millions more jobs to other countries. But leaving the TPP was only the beginning. We have also launched an investigation into foreign trading abuses and taken steps to protect the production of American steel and aluminum. After years of federal contracts going to foreign bidders, we are ensuring that government agencies enforce "Buy American" rules and give preference to American companies - and that American companies hire American workers. Crucially, to bring back our jobs, we are going to pursue a complete renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement: We've lost nearly a third of our manufacturing jobs in the 23 years since that terrible deal was approved.

Trump By Donald J. Trump April 29 at 6:00 PM Donald J. Trump is the president of the United States. One hundred days ago, I took the oath of office and made a pledge: We are not merely going to transfer political power from one party to another, but instead are going to transfer that power from Washington, D.C., and give it back to the people. In the past 100 days, I have kept that promise — and more. Issue by issue, department by department, we are giving the people their country back. After decades of a shrinking middle class, open borders and the mass offshoring of American jobs and wealth, this government is working for the citizens of our country and no one else. The same establishment media that concealed these problems — and profited from them — is obviously not going to tell this story. That is why we are taking our message directly to America. We have opened the White House doors to listen, engage and act. We’ve invited in labor leaders, factory owners, police officers, farmers, veterans and Democrats, Republicans and independents. The change began with the termination of the Trans-Pacific Partnership — a 12-nation pact that would have shipped millions more jobs to other countries. But leaving the TPP was only the beginning. We have also launched an investigation into foreign trading abuses and taken steps to protect the production of American steel and aluminum. After years of federal contracts going to foreign bidders, we are ensuring that government agencies enforce “Buy American” rules and give preference to American companies — and that American companies hire American workers. Crucially, to bring back our jobs, we are going to pursue a complete renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement: We’ve lost nearly a third of our manufacturing jobs in the 23 years since that terrible deal was approved.

Amazon rose 3.1 percent to $945.50 (Dh3,469.98), while Alphabet gained 4.2 percent to $928.50 after their quarterly results beat estimates. The two stocks also boosted the S&P 500 index. Data showed gross domestic product increased at a 0.7 percent annual rate, below the 1.2 percent rise estimated by economists, as consumer spending barely increased and businesses invested less on inventories. The economy grew at a pace of 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter. The major indexes are on track to end the month in positive territory, with the Nasdaq on track to post gains for the sixth straight month as the corporate earnings season continues to impress. Overall profits of S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 12.4 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. While strong earnings have kept the market at or near record levels, persistent geopolitical tensions in North Korea and Syria have weighed on investors’ minds. President Donald Trump said in an interview on Thursday that a “major, major conflict” with North Korea was possible over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. “While we had some strong tech earnings last night, the market is taking a cautious attitude towards Trump’s comments on North Korea and other geopolitical concerns,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York. At 9:39am ET (1339 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 16.76 points, or 0.08 percent, at 20,964.57 and the S&P 500 was down 0.08 points, or 0.00 percent, at 2,388.69. The Nasdaq Composite was up 13.18 points, or 0.22 percent, at 6,062.12. Five of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, with the energy index’s 0.46 percent rise leading the gainers. Royalty payments Oil majors Exxon and Chevron were up about 1.1 percent after the two companies reported quarterly profits above expectations. Qualcomm fell 3.6 percent to $51.25 after it said Apple decided to withhold royalty payments to its contract manufacturers that are owed to the chipmaker until a legal dispute between the companies is resolved. Apple was up marginally at $143.73. Starbucks fell 2.9 percent to $59.58 after the world’s biggest coffee chain cut its full-year profit target. Intel was down 3.2 percent at $36.20 after the company reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,464 to 1,034. On the Nasdaq, 1,308 issues fell and 873 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed 26 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 54 new highs and 16 new lows.

Miller April 28, 2017 10 Comments The applications for 5G wireless target autonomous vehicles, factory floors, and the Internet of Things...not end users. After 2G networks gave way to 3G, 3G networks gave way to 4G, and so you might expect that 5G networks will replace 4G LTE. But that's not likely to happen, or at least not anytime soon, according to a number of speakers at the Brooklyn 5G Summit at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering last week. Instead, the speakers I talked to explained that 4G is expected to form the backbone or anchor for networks going well into the future, and will likely continue to be the way most of us get our mobile data, with 5G being used to supplement 4G and provide data for other applications. "5G is the first G that won't replace the one before," said Tod Sizer, who heads mobile radio research for Bell Labs. Sizer said current 4G LTE solutions perform very well for voice, web surfing, and even video, but that new 5G networks will provide more flexibility for applications such as controlling machines on a factory floor, improved reliability compared to Wi-Fi, and better latency than LTE. But he said such networks will likely leverage both 4G and Wi-Fi and add new capabilities on top. The big difference at this year's summit, compared to earlier meetings, is that the industry is now "moving from how to what," Sizer said, as the specifications for 5G get more settled, even though the applications aren't as clear. Ken Budka, of Bell Labs Consulting, talked about how 5G will enable "the next industrial revolution," which will be brought about by combining digital interfaces and sensors on devices and machines with advances in machine learning and AI, all on the future network. The key to this, Budka said, is the transformative power of low-latency services. Some applications require high bandwidth, and others require low-latency, but most don't need both with the exception of VR and AR. Budka noted that in general, 5G will aim to provide one to three milliseconds of latency, compared to about 100 milliseconds in 4G. This is important for a number of applications. For instance, Budka said that in a car moving at 100 kilometers per hour, the difference in latency between 1 ms and 100 ms is half a car length. He also listed other applications, including industrial robotics, 3D printing in construction, cooperative robot and drone control, and teleoperation, in which humans operate devices from a remote location. From a design standpoint, he talked about a traditional core network working fine for 4G and most applications, but that an "edge cloud" would be needed for applications such as VR/AR and system control, where latency is crucial. 5G New Radio Durga Malladi, Senior VP of Engineering at Qualcomm Technologies, talked about 5G as a "unifying connectivity fabric" serving three broad buckets of applications with very different needs. Enhanced mobile broadband requires enhanced speeds for some applications and the ability to handle more people using more data every year. For a massive Internet of Things network, most of the devices use very little data, but constant low power consumption is key, as these devices need to work for years on small batteries. And you will also have mission-critical services that don't necessarily use a lot of data but require very low latency. Malladi talked about continuing to use 4G as a base to provide the core mobile broadband connections, and using the 5G New Radio standard for spectrum above and below what is typically used for 4G to help in basic cases but also to provide for new applications. This includes sub-6GHz bands to provide more mobile coverage and mmWave bands such as the 28- and 39GHz bands, which provide high-bandwidth over short distances, so they are being used in initial fixed deployments, but may also be used in mobile deployments. The key technologies in 5G New Radio include Massive MIMO (which involves using multiple antennas), robust mmWave support, advanced channel coding and DFT-spread, and OFDM-based waveforms for both uploads and downloads. Both stand-alone and non-standalone versions of 5G standards are on track to be approved next year (as part of the 3GPP R15 specification), with the first deployments expected in 2019. Much of the conversation at the summit was about the 5G New Radio standard, with many discussions about the specifics of many of the technologies, including details on multiple MIMO waveforms. Mikael Höök, Director of Radio Research for Ericsson Research, talked about how the new radio is necessary for new use cases, including broadband and media everywhere, sensor networks, smart vehicles, control of service, and remote devices. He said standardization is in full speed on the new timeline, and that it would have "future-proof" hooks to allow for future evolution. Höök said the principles behind the design of the new radio include spectrum flexibility, low-latency, a beam-centric design, connectivity, and interworking across spectrum bands. Many of the technical details Höök described were interesting, particularly as to how the system is designed to enable different use cases. For instance, it includes bandwidth adaptation so it can listen using a narrow bandwidth, but switch to a wide bandwidth when receiving large amounts of data, thus saving power. Other techniques are used to provide low latency and what he called URLLC ("Ultra-reliable and low latency communications"). In other sessions on the new radio, Huawei Fellow Peiying Zhu gave a talk on waveform, numerology, and channel coding. She talked about many of the changes necessary for the new radio, along with the need for LTE co-existence. Later, Zhu joined with Höök and others in a panel discussion. Höök said that there are use cases and deployments of the new radio, so we know the technology works, but that the uptake of new services is still in question. Docomo Keynote Seizo Onoe, CTO and EVP of NTT DOCOMO, gave a generally positive speech about 5G, but may have been the most realistic about the challenges it faces. Onoe said the economics of 5G are the "elephant in the room," as the technology will require the use of many small cells, and will force intense backhaul and backbone modernization, and thus substantial capital expense. But, he said, 5G's efficiency offers the promise of increased data capacity without increasing capital expense – and in particular cited the use of Massive MIMO and other technologies as opposed to just thinking of the service as a "hotspot service" for complementary use. Onoe said he is not worried about fragmentation from early versions and said front runners should take responsibility for compatibility. DOCOMO plans a 2020 rollout, he added, which is enough time to set standards. However, Onoe gave two "dark premonitions." In wireless technology, the previous generation often booms just before the launch of the next, as happened with enhanced 3G (HSPA+) before the 4G LTE launch. This could happen this time around, he said. Additionally, the industry has historically seen great success only with even-numbered generations, and Onoe wonders if the industry will need to wait for 6G to get everything it wants. Still, Onoe concluded on a positive note and said that while there are lots of myths about 5G, he believes that the industry should "get on the 5G bandwagon" and create new business models through collaboration across industries. Progress toward 5G Deployment Dave Wolter, AVP for Radio Technology and RAN Architecture at AT&T, talked about how the company wants to speed up deployment while still respecting standards, and discussed a variety of tests the company has conducted. Wolter noted that the December deadline for non-standalone 5G-NR (the standard that uses LTE as an anchor) is crucial because it involves all of the hardware-impacting parts and is necessary so silicon vendors can start designing chips. The idea is to ensure compatibility with the standalone version when that is completed in June 2018. Wolter said AT&T hopes for a standards-based NR deployment of 5G New Radio (NR) as early as December 2018, most likely with fixed wireless first, but with mobility to follow soon after. Still, there remain a number of details left to be decided, he noted. Wolter described how this would evolve over time, with fixed wireless likely first, then an upgrade to the next generation core, and later to widespread 5G deployment over time. He said AT&T will prioritize a non-standalone mode, and while it has an interest in standalone 5G, that effort will take time. He did note that there is no sub 6GHZ spectrum available for 5G in the U.S. except for around 3.5 GHz, which has other issues. (It is currently used for Defense Department and fixed satellite services, which could theoretically share the spectrum.) In the meantime, AT&T is most interested in the 39GHz frequency and has done a number of both fixed and mobile tests at 28GHz and 39GHz in partnership with Ericsson and Intel, using techniques such as automatic beam tracking and massive MIMO. I had the chance to ask Wolter about when he thought we'd see 5G support in handsets, and he said that might have to wait for 3GPP's Release 16 (as opposed to the Release 15 standards now in development). But he said the big advantage of 5G for mobile broadband is its high density, which provides a better experience when more people are watching video simultaneously, as well as making mobile augmented reality and virtual reality work much better. In a panel discussion, it was clear that different operators across the world have different visions. YongGyoo Lee, SVP for Korea Telecom, talked about having specifications ready so it could offer some 5G services for the 2018 Winter Olympics (though it appears that much of this will be pre-standard technology). Similarly, DOCOMO's Onoe talked about having a system running for the 2020 Summer Olympics. However, Frank Seiser, a VP for Technology Innovation at Deutsche Telekom AG, said he saw no driver for standalone 5G as currently proposed, and added that European operators have neither the fixed wireless spectrum the U.S. operators want to use nor the impetus of the Olympics that is driving the Japanese and Korean operators. In slides presented later at the summit, Seiser pushed the idea of a cloud-native architecture with much more network function virtualization and a service-based architecture but worries that the current Release 15 standards under development don't provide for these features. Seiser said that a joint industry push for a much more innovative 5G system architecture is needed in order to deliver on the 5G vision. For now, Seiser said, he sees little that you can do better in 5G versus LTE, and that it may be 6G before we solve that. In the meantime, almost everyone liked the idea of using non-standalone 5G, and all indicated it would be a long time before any of the current LTE spectrum will be used for 5G. Michael J.

Credit: Joshua Robinson/Penn State The Periodic Table highlighting the Chalcogenide families of elements MEDIA CONTACT Available for logged-in reporters only CITATIONS 2D Materials Apr 28-2017 CHANNELS All Journal News, Materials Science, Nanotechnology, Local - Pennsylvania KEYWORDS 2D materials, Nanomaterials, MOS2, Transition Metals Newswise — The possibilities for the new field of two-dimensional, one-atomic-layer-thick materials, including but not limited to graphene, appear almost limitless. In a new paper in the journal 2D Materials, Penn State researchers report two discoveries that will provide a simple and effective way to “stencil” high quality 2D materials in precise locations and overcome a barrier to their use in next-generation electronics. The discovery of a method to isolate a single atomic layer of carbon – graphene – in 2004 opened a new world of two-dimensional materials with properties not necessarily found in the familiar three-dimension world. Among these materials are a large group of elements that fall in the middle of the periodic table that are called transition metals. When atoms of certain transition metals, for instance molybdenum, are layered between two atomic layers of atoms from the chalcogenide elements, such as sulfur or selenium, the result is a three-layer sandwich called a transition metal dichalcogenide. TMDs have created tremendous interest among materials scientists because of their potential for new types of electronics, optoelectronics and computation. “What we have focused on in this paper is the ability to make these materials over large areas of a substrate in precisely the places we want them,” says Joshua Robinson, associate professor of materials science and engineering. “These materials are of interest for a variety of next generation electronics, not necessarily to replace silicon, but to augment current technologies and ultimately to bring new chip functionality to silicon that we never had before.” In order to integrate TMDs with silicon in transistors, chip companies will need to have a method to place the atoms precisely where they are needed. That method has not been available until now. In their 2D Materials paper, titled “Selective-area Growth and Controlled Substrate Coupling of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides,” Robinson and his group demonstrate for the first time a simple method of making precise patterns of two-dimensional materials using techniques familiar to any nanotechnology lab. “It turns out the process is straight forward,” Robinson explains. “We spin photoresist on the sample in the cleanroom, as if we are going to start making a device. It can be any of a number of polymers that are used in nanofabrication. We then expose it to ultraviolet light in the desired areas, and we develop it like a photograph. Where the polymer was exposed to light, it washes away, and we then clean the surface further with standard plasma etching processes. The 2D materials will only grow in the areas that have been cleaned.”    A second simple discovery described in this work that could help advance the field of TMD research involves overcoming the strong effect a substrate has on the 2D materials grown on top of the substrate. In this case, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), a highly studied semiconductor TMD, was grown on a sapphire substrate using typical powder-based deposition techniques. This resulted in the properties of the sapphire/MoS2 interface controlling the desired properties of the molybdenum disulfide, making it unsuitable for device fabrication. “We needed to decouple the effects of the substrate on the 2D layer without transferring the layers off the sapphire,” says Robinson, “and so we simply tried dunking the as-grown material into liquid nitrogen and pulling it out into air to “crack” the interface. It turned out that was enough to separate the MoS2 from the sapphire and get closer to the intrinsic performance of the MoS2.” The process is gentle enough to weaken the bonds connecting the 2D material to the substrate without completely setting it free. The exact mechanism for loosening the bonds is still under investigation, because of the complexity of this “simple process.” The two materials shrink at different rates, which could cause them to pop apart, but it could also be due to the bubbling of the liquid nitrogen as it turns into gas, or even contact with water vapor in the air that forms ice on the sample. “We’re still working on understanding the exact mechanism, but we know that it works really well, at least with molybdenum disulfide,” Robinson says.      The three co-lead authors on the 2D Materials paper are Ph.D. students Brian Bersch and Yu-Chuan Lin, and research associate Sarah Eichfeld. Also contributing to this work are Robinson’s Ph.D. student Keohao Zhang and his former Ph.D. student, Ganesh Bhimanapati, now at Intel, undergraduate student Aleksander Piasecki, and Materials Research Institute staff scientist Michael Labella. Robinson is co-director of the Center for Atomically Thin Multifunctional Coatings (ATOMIC) and the Center for Two-Dimensional and Layered Materials (2DLM), and Director of User Programs for the Penn State 2D Crystal Consortium, all part of the Penn State Materials Research Institute. The work was supported by the Center for Low Energy Systems Technology (LEAST), one of six Semiconductor Research STARnet centers, by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and by the National Science Foundation.

Stocks edged lower on Wall Street on Friday after data showing the US economy grew at its weakest pace in three years in the first quarter gave traders a reason to cash recent gains. Major indexes closed up for April, however, with the Nasdaq up for six consecutive months, the longest streak in nearly four years. Gross domestic product grew at a 0.7 percent annual rate, below the 1.2 percent rise estimated by economists, as consumer spending barely increased and businesses invested less in inventories. The economy grew at a 2.1 percent pace in the fourth quarter. "GDP was a little bit light and that may be the cause of some weakness today," said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas. Citi Research's gauge on US economic data surprises turned negative for the first time since November. The soft growth data is bad news for the Trump administration after campaign promises to significantly boost growth and adds to concerns among some in the market that lower taxes, deregulation and increased government spending - the main reasons for a post-election rally - will be, at the least, delayed. "We saw the rally fade quite a bit into the last part of the first quarter," said Bradshaw. "I think you're going to have to see some (legislation) within the next couple of months, otherwise the market will become disenchanted. So far it's been all talk, no show." The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 40.82 points, or 0.19 percent, to close at 20,940.51, the S&P 500 lost 4.57 points, or 0.19 percent, to 2,384.2 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.33 points, or 0.02 percent, to 6,047.61. For the week, the Dow rose 1.9 percent, the S&P gained 1.5 percent and the Nasdaq rose 2.3 percent. During April, the Dow gained 1.3 percent, the S&P rose 0.9 percent and the Nasdaq jumped 2.3 percent. The Nasdaq was buoyed Friday by gains in Amazon and Google's parent Alphabet. Amazon rose as much as 3.4 percent to a life high of USD 949.59, and ended up 0.7 percent at USD 924.99, while Alphabet gained as much as 5 percent to a record of USD 935.90 and closed up 3.7 percent at USD 924.52 after their quarterly results beat estimates. Combined earnings reports and expectations for S&P 500 companies show profits are estimated to have risen 13.6 percent in the first quarter, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. While strong earnings have kept the market at or near record levels, persistent geopolitical tensions have weighed on investors' minds. Intel fell 3.4 percent to $36.15 after the company reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue. Baidu ended down 4.1 percent at $180.23 after the Chinese internet company forecast second-quarter revenue largely below estimates. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.59-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.76-to-1 ratio favoured decliners. The S&P 500 posted 39 new 52-week highs and six new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 103 new highs and 44 new lows.About 6.94 billion shares changed hands in US exchanges on Friday, above the 6.55 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. tags #International Markets Related news Business Earnings lift Nasdaq to record; Amazon, Alphabet up after hours Apr 28, 2017 07:29 AM Business Wall Street ticks lower as Trump tax priorities unveiled Apr 27, 2017 07:25 AM Business Nasdaq tops 6000 as earnings boost Wall Street; US tax code eyed Apr 26, 2017 07:24 AM Business French election results catapult Wall Street higher; Nasdaq sets record Apr 25, 2017 07:25 AM Business Wall Street dips before French election, but up for week Apr 22, 2017 08:02 AM Business Brace for volatility as France votes in a four-way race to elect President on Sunday Apr 21, 2017 12:45 PM Business Wall Street rallies on earnings; Nasdaq hits record Apr 21, 2017 07:40 AM Business IBM sends S&P 500, Dow lower; Nasdaq advances Apr 20, 2017 01:31 AM Business Goldman Sachs, J&J pull Wall Street lower Apr 19, 2017 07:27 AM News Most Popular Top News Stay with winners! 100 stocks which rose to lifetime high in April gave up to 127% return Hindustan Zinc posts 42% rise in Q4 profit at Rs 3,057 cr, margin expands 940 bps Vijay Mallya gifted $40 million to his children, funnelled Rs 3200 crore overseas: ED’s dossier EC to get 30,000 new VVPAT machines by July for Guj, HP polls Market Week Ahead: 8 factors that investors will watch for Seven of top 10 cos add Rs 49,642 crore in market cap; HDFC Bank leads the charge Will the BJP repeat MCD poll strategy for civic elections in Uttar Pradesh?

The first commercial flight of the ERJ 145 occurred on April 6, 1997, with U.S. airline Continental Express. “The ERJ 145 marked Embraer’s commercial renaissance, paving the way for the development of new programs, such as the E-Jets, which moved the Company into the lead of the commercial jet market for up to 130-seat aircraft,” said Paulo Cesar de Souza e Silva, Embraer President & CEO. “Personally, I have a great affection for the program, which brought me to Embraer. I participated in practically all the jet’s sales campaigns as Vice President of Customer Financing.” The ERJ 145 family of jets consists of the ERJ 145 (50 seats), the ERJ 135 (37 seats), the ERJ 140 (44 seats) and the ERJ 145 XR (long-range 145 version). Since its entry into operation, the ERJ 145 family has accumulated more than 27 million flight hours and almost 730 million passengers transported, being used by more than 120 operators. Over the last seven years, the ERJ’s global customer base has almost doubled, from 39 operators, in 2010, to 70, today. During the same period, the application and use of ERJ models has been growing in emerging markets, such as Africa, where the ERJ fleet has increased from 16 units in 2010 to almost 60 jets in 2017. Robust and with excellent operating history, the ERJ platform is a success in commercial aviation, with almost 900 units delivered, having applications in the business aviation market, with the Legacy 600 and Legacy 650 jets, as well as in defense, such as the AEW&C, Multi-Intel and maritime patrol for the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) segment. In total, more than 1,200 aircraft based on the ERJ 145 platform have already been delivered worldwide, making the ERJ program one of the most successful in the aircraft industry.
