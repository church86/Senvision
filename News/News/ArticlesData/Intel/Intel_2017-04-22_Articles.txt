Gigabyte recently updated its Brix-branded portfolio with the GB-EKi3A-7100. It’s the first in the family to use a seventh-generation “Kaby Lake” processor from Intel, and follows Gigabyte’s GB-EACE-3440 in packing a similar overall design based on an older Intel N3450 “Apollo Lake” chip. Both are ideal for those who need a powerful, quiet PC that’s mountable under a desk or on the backplate of a monitor. Gigabyte’s new Brix unit is based on a compact, fanless design. It includes a VESA mounting bracket, Wireless AC connectivity, plenty of ports for peripherals and additional displays, and even two USB 3.1 Gen2 ports providing transfer speeds at up to 10Gbps. These ports are great for connecting additional displays when the HDMI and Mini DisplayPort connections just aren’t enough. Here are the specs: Processor: Intel Core i3-7100U Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 620 Memory: 2x DDR4 1.2v slots (2,133MHz, 32GB maximum) Storage: 1x M.2 slot PCIe/SATA (2280) Connectivity: Wireless AC (Intel 3165) Audio: Realtek ALC255 Ports (front): 1x Microphone/headphone combo jack 1x USB 3.1 Gen2 Type-C 1x USB 3.1 Gen2 Type-A !x RS232 COM port Ports (back): 2x USB 3.1 Gen1 1x gigabit Ethernet 1x Mini DisplayPort 1.2 1x HDMI 2.0 Ports (side): 2x antenna SMA connectors Motherboard size: 4.13 x 4.52 inches Dimensions: 1.42 x 4.61 x 7.09 inches Weight: 2.15 Price: ~$380 What’s important to note here is that customers are required to purchase memory and storage in addition to the bare-bones unit. The device supports up to 32GB of DDR4 memory clocked at 2,133MHz, but the company doesn’t provide any information about the storage capacity of the M.2 SSD slot. That “2280” number refers to the dimensions of the M.2 SSD stick, as you just simply install any M.2 SSD into the slot. Another feature we’d like to point out is the use of USB 3.1 Gen2 tech. When the second generation of USB 3.0 hit the scene, the conglomerate that regulates the USB standard decided to mix things up and rename both generations. That said, the old USB 3.0 ports are now called USB 3.1 Gen1, which still speeds along at 5Gbps. The newer generation clocking speeds at 10Gbps is now called USB 3.1 Gen2. To visually distinguish the two generations, USB 3.1 Gen1 (formerly USB 3.0) continues with the blue theme. The USB 3.1 Gen2 tech apparently relies on red so that customers can quickly tell between the two connections. But that’s only when the ports rely on the larger Type-A rectangular size, and not the newer miniature Type-C port size. Remember, Type-A and Type-C have absolutely nothing to do with port speed, but with port size. The Type-A model relies on a single-sided “this side up” connector whereas Type-C boasts a dual-sided “any side up” reversible connector. On the processor font, Intel’s seventh-generation dual-core chip has a base clock speed of 2.40GHz, and no turbo. Other highlights include four threads, a cache of 3MB, and a maximum power draw of 15 watts. It’s an ideal chip for a miniature, mountable PC that doesn’t rely on internal fans to cool the innards. In this case, the heat is simply distributed by the unit’s vented exterior.

Microsoft flagged its new policy early last year, telling the users that Windows 10 will be the only supported Windows platform on Intel’s upcoming 7th Gen Intel Core (Kaby Lake) based CPUs. The policy effected bady to the business oriented users who had a good reason to run old Windows on new PCs. Microsoft eventually changed the policy so that people who are running Windows 7 or 8.x will still get security updates until those OSes reach end-of-life, but won't get other fixes. Zeffy, who on his GitHub page describes the policy as just Microsoft's way of telling everyone who'd rather keep using Windows 7 or 8.1 on their Intel Kaby Lake or AMD Ryzen systems and not be eligible for future updates other than security bug fixes. His solution targets the new CPU-detection bits that Windows has added to help Windows Update know when not to ship new code. His GitHub page explains it all in detail. Rate this story Rating: 1 ...

Using latest hardware and still sticking win8/7 mean that the individual is happy with the OS, does not want to get win10. They produce handmade, intentional problems so people will develop urges to upgrade to win 10 so Micro$oft can gather everything about you without your permission for upcoming worldwide events.

Guru3D.com » News » Intel Core X series processor family and X299 chipset Announced at Computex May 30th Intel Core X series processor family and X299 chipset Announced at Computex May 30th by Hilbert Hagedoorn on: 04/21/2017 02:36 PM | Source | 57 comment(s) It looks like Intel is pushing forward their X299 Chipset release with alongside it Core X processors. The announcement would be May 30th with availability June 26th opposed to a release in August. The X299 chipset will be compatible with Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X Intel Core X series processors. Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X, will include 12, 10, 8, 6 and 4 core products. That 12-core version is a new one and seems to be a bit of a panic reaction from Intel towards AMD who might be releasing 12 and 16 core parts.    Kaby Lake Broadwell-E Kaby Lake-X Skylake-X CPU cores 4 6, 8, 10 4 6, 8, 10, 12 Cache 8MB Up to 25MB 8MB 13.75MB PCIe support PCIe 3.0 (16 lanes) PCIe 3.0 (40/28 lanes) PCIe 3.0 (16 lanes) PCIe 3.0 (44/28 lanes) Integrated graphics Yes No No No TDP 95W 140W 112W 140W Socket LGA 1151 LGA 2011-v3 LGA 2066 LGA 2066 Chipset KBL PCH-H X99 KBL PCH-X KBL PCH-X Memory support Dual-channel DDR4 Quad-channel DDR4 Dual-channel DDR4 Quad-channel DDR4   The X299 will bring quad-channel DDR4 support to compatible 14nm processors and 40 PCIe 3.0 lanes with Skylake-X procs. Kaby Lake-X procs will support dual-channel DDR4 and 24 PCIe 3.0 Lanes. Before you ask, why release both Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X at the same time and what is the difference? Well, Skylake-X thus can offer 12, 10, 8 and 6 core processors, the other (Kaby lake-X) remains to be a quad-core part. Skylake-X are the extreme edition like the 6950X series currently on Skylake-X. These processors will get a 140 Watt TDP, the quad-core Kaby Lake-X is rumored to be a 112 Watt part. Since the processors once again will need a new socket, LGA 2066t hat means that once again you have to purchase a new motherboard. There is a rumor right now that Intel is tweaking the cache sizes to increase performance. The new platform thus also offers support for Intel Optane and quad channel DDR4-2667 MHz memory.  Thanks to SH SOTN for the news-submit Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ... Not the best 3 ...

Ryzen launched and it already got moved to August. Rumors of 12/16 core Ryzen parts appeared and all of the sudden Intel makes a move to Computex and invested reportedly spent over US$100 million to accelerate its pace of manufacturing. Yes panic reaction, these parts might have been designed ready, but where not ready for fabbing this soon already.

The release date is panic not the chip itself, this thing was made to come in 4 months not two and this give merit to the amd x399 hedt platform.. it will be fun Zooke Member Guru Posts: 73 Joined: 2016-09-21 #5423092 Posted on: 04/21/2017 03:37 PM I see very few people buying a 12 core at an even greater price than their current top of the range 10 core chip. As long as AMD can match the features such as quad channel etc, Intel will have to keep responding. Great news for us consumers in the long run, but for right now anything you buy might be surpassed far quicker than normal.

This^^ Intel´s high end pricing structure was broken by Ryzen and the only way to change the situation is lower the prices of their cpus to reasonable terms. I wonder if Intel still remembers what reasonable prices look like... In my opinion Intel would be better cutting the prices of their current high end cpus than releasing newer ones but that´s me.

(AMD) Stock’s Ryzen 5 Is a Game Changer Why Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Still Has Nothing to Fear From Snapchat Why You Shouldn’t Count Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM) Stock Out Just Yet View All Posts The PC CPU market is in need of a shake-up. After nearly a decade with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) dominating the chip market, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has a chance to disrupt the leader. And markets are signalling AMD has a good chance of succeeding this year. Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr Intel is valued at just 12 times forward earnings and is cheap compared to AMD. It has yet to report sales for its latest CPU, Ryzen. For now, the stock’s value is inflated, with a forward P/E of 45 times. AMD’s Ryzen 5 Targets the Mainstream Market In March, AMD released Ryzen 7, a high-end processor that targeted the enthusiast market. It followed this month with Ryzen 5. This processor is more affordable and targets the mainstream market. On April 11, one technology review sites even declared the Ryzen 5 the most significant gaming CPU AMD ever made. The site singled out aggressive pricing, high computing power with six-cores and comparable performance to Intel as reasons for the claim. Retailers are pricing Ryzen 5 as low as $189 for the four-core 1500X. The 1600X, which has six cores, is nearly identical to the Ryzen 7 1800X. Budget PC builders may flock to this chip to save money. The higher core count also helps it outperform INTC chips for things like video encoding and video processing. Games that demand multiprocessing, like Civilization VI, also work better on AMD. Earnings Report on May 1 AMD confirmed that it will report quarterly results on May 1 after the market closes. The report will give investors an idea on the sales strength for Ryzen 7. It launched the chip at the beginning of March. A strong sales report will help AMD’s stock recover. CEO Lisa Su will likely confirm that the company will release Ryzen for notebooks and servers on time. Markets expect the release for notebooks will happen sometime in the second half of the year. Dubbed Naples, AMD expects to release the two-socket server chip based on the Ryzen platform in the second quarter. It will compete against Intel’s Broadwell server chips. Early benchmarks suggest that Naples will have more memory bandwidth to work with. That gives AMD’s solution an edge over Intel’s server chip. It is too early for investors to forecast market share growth for AMD in the server market. Pricing and chip speed will be the two factors that will shape AMD’s success in this segment of the market. Competition Heats Up With Nvidia Investors should not forget about AMD’s Polaris graphics card release from last year. Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) already responded to AMD by discounting prices of its GPU cards. The 1080 Founders Edition and 1080 GTX, for example, are on sale on Amazon.com. AMD will eventually launch Vega, a high-end GPU, this year. NVDA benefits from pushing out those cards now, before that happens. Once AMD releases Vega, Nvidia will probably discount prices for the high-end cards by even more. Takeaway on Advanced Micro Devices AMD will likely reiterate strong expectations for Ryzen. The chip release will help the company win back market share in the PC desktop, notebook and server markets. Consider the stock as a good speculation with upside potential. As of this writing, Chris Lau did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

TechRadar pro IT insights for business Search RSS US Edition News Reviews Insights TechRadar Laptops/PCs Printers Hardware Software Mobile Working Security Networks VPN Data Centre Hands on: Toshiba Portégé X20W-D-10V review Where will business Ultrabooks stop? Not yet rated By Desire Athow Laptops and netbooks  Shares What is a hands on review? Our Early Verdict The Toshiba Portégé X20W will appeal to those looking for a laptop that can last all day long, and deliver some serious computational power while weighing almost nothing. It is expensive, but that won’t be a problem for the target audience. For Superb finish and design Multi-purpose power charger Exceptional battery life Decent computational performance Against Lack of connectivity SATA 3 SSD rather than PCIe Sub-par graphics performance Short warranty It is difficult not to be amazed by the strides made by laptop manufacturers over the past few years when it comes to improving the general aesthetics and the size of notebooks. Indeed, this has happened to such an extent that Ultrabook-sized laptops have become the norm, making the term all but superfluous (interest in the term, according to Google searches, hasn’t been this low since it was first coined in 2011). Toshiba’s Portégé series represents the company’s top of the range ultra-portable models. The X20W-D-10V is the 2-in-1 convertible candidate, which the Japanese manufacturer claims is the thinnest and lightest 12.5-inch business laptop with an Intel Core processor. We’ll just stick to very light and very thin. The Z20t is its detachable alter ego with the Z30 series being the more traditional model with a fixed screen.  The X20W is one of the smallest laptops we’ve come across recently, with dimensions of 299 x 219 x 15.4mm and a weight of just 1.1kg. It’s a tad bigger than an A4 sheet and can be used comfortably as a tablet – the Apple iPad Pro, the one with a 12.9-inch display, weighs 713g in comparison. The model shipped to us (PRT12E-01800KEN) is the top of the range one which comes with an Intel Core i7-7500U processor, 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. Toshiba opted for a brushed onyx blue finish throughout the laptop, perhaps the best choice to enhance the look of the magnesium alloy chassis. We detected a tiny amount of flex on the screen but not on the chassis or the keyboard. Speaking of the latter, this gets little wrong despite its smaller size. The keys are smaller but still offer ample spacing, and while the feedback was sharp, there was enough travel (as usual, your mileage and personal tastes may vary). The SecurePad touchpad has a fingerprint sensor located at the top-left of the active area and can be used with Windows Hello, a TPM 2.0 chip and an infrared camera with dual microphone to provide a more secure environment. We found the touchpad comfortable and responsive to use, with an audible click when pressing on the lower corners to activate the left and right mouse buttons. As expected, the display, which is held in place by two hinges, in the style of Lenovo’s Yoga devices, has a fairly large bezel – which is where you’d expect the user to position their hands – and uses a matte finish to minimise glare when outdoors. That also helps eliminate fingerprints as well, and surprisingly, Toshiba used Corning Gorilla Glass 4 technology here. Toshiba also offers a number of accessories to maximise your productivity. These include a travel dock, a Thunderbolt 3 dock and a protective sleeve with an integrated pen holder. Yes, this laptop comes with an AES active stylus – from Wacom – but doesn’t include a slot for storage on the chassis itself. Other than the sheer svelte dimensions of the X20W, the other thing that will wow is how small the power supply unit is. It is so small (60 x 60 x 27mm) that it could (and should) have been integrated with the plug.  It is a multi-voltage PSU, capable of powering your laptop or your smartphone (5V@3A, 12V@3A and 20V@2.25A) via a USB Type-C connector. This power supply – and the aforementioned accessories – actually help mitigate one of the biggest issues associated with laptops of this size, namely the lack of connectivity. The device only has one USB Type-C/Thunderbolt 3 connector and an audio port on one side, and a full-size USB port on the other. There are no card readers, for example, and you lose the USB Type-C connector when you plug in the laptop (via that port). Wireless communication is provided courtesy of an Intel AC-8265 chipset (that offers 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2). Audio is handled by Harman Kardon DTS technology but don’t expect any surprises here. The laws of physics mean that the sound – which comes from two tiny speakers located underneath the palm rest – is nothing in particular to write home about, but it’s decent enough for the most part. In use, we found the laptop mostly cool to the touch, even under load, thanks partly to Toshiba’s new hybrid air cooling system. Running our usual benchmarks with the laptop, we found the results in line with what we’d expect from such a system bar one anomaly. On a number of graphics benchmarks, we found the HD 620 graphics subsystem to be significantly underperforming compared to, say, the HD 615 found on the Teclast X5 Pro. For example, the latter managed twice the FPS count compared to the Portégé. Unless you are a gamer, this shouldn’t matter much, but we find it troubling that there is such a massive gap in performance – and this was an issue that affected the graphics-related parts of all the benchmarks we used. Note that a charge-through, Type-C to HDMI connector, is also included in the package. Toshiba claims that the 3-cell battery should last for 14.5 hours (that’s 870 minutes) using MobileMark 2014. Running our standard test (50% brightness and playing a count-up video from YouTube), we stopped at 8 hours 16 minutes and still had 26% of the 45Whr battery left. The Portégé X20W-D-10V runs Windows 10 Pro, comes with WinZip (yes, WinZip) and a one-year collect-and-return warranty in the UK (and carry-in warranty across EMEA). Early verdict There’s plenty of competition for the Portégé: Dell has the new XPS 13 2-in-1 which has a couple more ports (including a card reader) and an optional higher-resolution screen. Sadly, it uses a Y-series Core CPU and doesn’t have a full-size USB port. HP’s EliteBook Folio G1 might not be as thin or light as Toshiba’s laptop, but it does have a three-year warranty as standard as well as a long battery life, a marginally lower price and far better connectivity. However, Lenovo’s ThinkPad Yoga 260 remains this machine’s most potent rival – it also comes with a digital pen and a 12.5-inch form factor, plus the ability to add a 1TB SSD and a smart card reader. So should the Portégé X20W-D-10V be on your shortlist (or in your buying basket)? The answer is yes if you are looking for the tiniest, most compact and portable convertible laptop. This Toshiba laptop comes at a premium (just under £1,600 in the UK – that’s around $2,050) but the price tag is justified given what nestles inside. These are the 10 best business laptops of 2017 What is a hands on review? 'Hands on reviews' are a journalist's first impressions of a piece of kit based on spending some time with it.

Rumor: Intel puts the pedal to the metal on its HEDT refresh by Wayne Manion  12:00 PM on April 19, 2017 The notorious rumor mongers at Digitimes report that Intel is planning to move several upcoming releases foward. The first rumor concerns the release date of the rumored Basin Falls high-end desktop (HEDT) platform, the accompanying Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X CPUs, the X299 chipset, and the rumored LGA 2066 socket. According to "Taiwan-based PC vendors,"  Basin Falls' premiere is moving from the end of July to a release date during the Computex trade show at the end of May. This news comes just days after rumors that the same launch was being moved from late July to late June. For those who don't follow the minutiae of Intel's ever-shifting codename structure, Skylake-X is expected to be the Skylake incarnation of Intel's long-running HEDT series of chips, which have traditionally born the '-E' suffix. Skylake-X CPUs are rumored to pack six, eight, or ten CPU cores and a quad-channel memory controller inside packages with at least 2000 pads. These chips are the natural successors to Broadwell-E models like the $1650, 10-core Core i7-6950X. The nature of Kaby Lake-X is not quite as well understood, but rumors suggest these chips will be quad core processors with dual-channel memory controllers that fit into the same motherboards as the Skylake-X chips. The advantage of these processors over standard-issue desktop Kaby Lake chips like the Core i7-7700K may be limited to higher clock speeds allowed by more aggressive TDPs, as well as any feature advantages inherent to the X299 motherboard chipset. In news that could affect a larger part of our audience, the rumor mill is also churning out speculation that Intel's Coffee Lake mainstream chips' release is being moved forward from January 2018 to August 2017. Coffee Lake is widely expected to be another subtle refinement of Intel's 14-nm architecture, similar to the relatively small changes observed in the Skylake to Kaby Lake transition. Some speculate that top-of-the-line Coffee Lake processors may sport six CPU cores. This would represent the first time that Intel has increased the core count of its mainstream processors since the 2008 release of the first Core 2 Quad processors. The rumor mongers speculate that Intel is quickening its cadence as a response to AMD's renewed competitiveness in the realm of high-performance desktop CPUs with its existing Ryzen R5 and R7 lineups, the coming Ryzen R3 chips, and the rumored 16-core models and accompanying X399 motherboard chipset. The move could also be somehow related to Intel's cancellation of the Intel Developer Forum conference. Tags: CPUs Chipsets Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Review Image Source: Chuwi Chuwi Hi13 Review: A $369 hybrid notebook that might outshine Microsoft’s Surface Book Mike Wehner @MikeWehner April 19th, 2017 at 3:03 PM Share Tweet Back in February I had the opportunity to put the Chuwi Lapbook 14.1 to the test. Its ultra-budget price paired with midrange specs resulted in a notebook that was far better than it should have been for such a ridiculously low price. Chuwi had already made a name for itself with well-received hybrid Windows tablets — namely the Hi12 tablet — so high quality wasn’t a huge surprise, and now the company is launching its most highly-anticipated device yet, the Hi13. I’ve spent about a week using it off and on, and if there’s one I can say with utter certainty it’s that there’s no way this thing should cost $1,000 less than a Surface Book. Don't Miss: These leaked iPhone 8 schematics are a travesty if they’re real On the specs front, the Hi13 isn’t a groundbreaking device, but it holds its own. It’s packed with a 64-bit quad-core Intel Apollo Lake processor and relies on Intel’s integrated graphics to do the heavy lifting on video and other visually intense applications. It features 4 GB of RAM and a modest 64 GB of built-in storage (expandable via SD card slot). A rear-facing 5 MP camera and front-facing 2 MP lens help it pull its weight as a standalone tablet, but it won’t win any photography competitions. Windows 10 Home edition is the standard operating system. The midrange internals pull their weight well, which is particularly surprising when you get a glimpse of the Hi13’s display. Believe it or not, despite an asking price of less than one-third that of Microsoft’s Surface Book, the Chuwi Hi13 utilizes the same 13.5-inch 10-point multitouch display. Its 3000 x 2000 resolution at 267 ppi looks gorgeous, and I was consistently shocked every time I remembered that the Hi13 is supposed to be considered a “budget” device. Most daily computer tasks like web browsing and streaming video feel great on the Hi13, and it can crush 4K YouTube videos with seemingly little effort. That being said, your choice of web browser is something you’ll want to consider on this device, as I’ve found using Chrome to be a rather miserable experience. It got so bad that I actually gave Microsoft Edge a try and found it to be so much faster that I’ve completely abandoned Chrome on this particular computer. Whether it’s simply Chrome’s resource-hogging habits or the quirks of touchscreen browsing on a Windows device, you’ll be best served by sticking with Microsoft’s new browser for your surfing needs on the Hi13. As a touchscreen, the display is responsive and very accurate, making web browsing by touch and basic tablet tasks feel smooth and fluid. The screen automatically reorients itself based on how you hold it, and even if you’ve never held a Windows tablet before, it’s very easy to use. The touchscreen keyboard can be opened and closed in an instant, and typing on it is essentially the same as a smartphone, which is neither a pro nor a con. The Hi13 is heavy for a tablet, weighing nearly two and a half pounds, and much of that is owed to the 10,000mAh battery which gives it full-day battery life in most cases, though that can obviously dip significantly if you find yourself streaming HD movies at full brightness. A lock/wake button and volume rocker rest on one side, with the SD card slot, USB-C charging port, MicroUSB and Micro HDMI ports grouped on the edge opposite the Windows touch button. As a tablet, the Hi13 is much, much more capable and impressive than its $369 price tag (or as low as $335, depending on your luck) indicates. Is it going to run circles around the Surface Book? No, but when you’re saving around $1,000 over the price of Microsoft’s beast, you’re going to be perfectly okay with that. Accessories Unlike the Surface Book, Chuwi’s Hi13 makes its add-on keyboard and pen completely optional purchases. They’re priced very, very low, at around $50 for the keyboard and $20 to $25 for the HiPen H3, so they’re no-brainers, but you don’t have to buy them if you don’t want them. Of the two, I’d highly recommend picking up the Hi13 keyboard at the very least. It snaps in effortlessly with a pair of powerful magnets and can be reversed if you want to position the screen in “tent mode” as well. It’s a full-sized keyboard with chiclet style textured keys, a metal top casing and faux-metal plastic rear. There’s hardware keys for volume and brightness, the latter of which was an unfortunate omission from the Lapbook 14.1. The keyboard’s built-in touchpad is quite good as well, and a big improvement over the Lapbook 14.1. It’s much more smooth and feels more accurate, while providing the familiar dual-level click and tap controls that you’d expect from a higher end Windows notebook. The HiPen H3 is quite nice as well, with a very clean design, extremely sturdy metal clip and well-positioned side buttons. The pen’s 1,024 levels of pressure sensitivity make the writing experience feel top notch, and the screen response time is fast enough that you can easily lose yourself in your scribbles without worrying about delay between pen and virtual paper. The pen attaches to the side of the tablet via a hidden magnet, which is a nice touch. If you’re an artist it’s an easy recommendation, but if you have no use for such a device, you can just as easily skip it. All-in-all, the Hi13 is another impressive and extremely affordable device from Chuwi, which is starting to really cement a reputation as an example of how Chinese tech firms could beat western brands at their own game. Later this month, Chuwi is set to reveal its Lapbook 12.3, which will pack similar internals to the Hi13 but bump up the memory to 6 GB, and an extremely sharp IPS display. In short, if you haven’t been keeping at least a casual eye on what Chuwi has been cranking out, it’s probably time to consider it.

Gigabyte's latest Brix IoT packs a Core i3 for extra grunt by Wayne Manion  1:00 PM on April 20, 2017 A couple of weeks ago we wrote about Gigabyte's Brix IoT PCs—a pair of fanless miniature computers with Intel Apollo Lake SoCs inside. We read over at Fanlesstech that the company has expanded the Brix IoT range with models packing a dual-core 2.4 GHz Intel Core i3-7100U CPU. The brawnier GB-EKi3A-7100 also packs two USB 3.1 ports, though it loses some of the connectivity options present on its less-powerful siblings. The Core i3 machine has an HDMI jack and a mini-DisplayPort. When the appropriate DisplayPort daisy-chaining hardware is in play, the PC can drive three independent displays, something that's bound to be useful in digital signage applications. The Kaby Lake integrated graphics can drive 3840x2160 displays at up to 60 Hz, a step up from the 4K-at-30 Hz limitation of the Apollo Lake versions.   For peripheral connectivity, the EKi3A-7100 has a pair of USB 3.0 jacks, plus one USB 3.1 Type-A port and one USB 3.1 Type-C connector. The included Gigabit Ethernet, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth 4.2 connectivity are all provided by Intel controllers. The Core version of the Brix IoT can run on input voltages from 12V to 19V. Gigabyte supplies a 65W, 19V external power brick with the machine. Serial UART connectivity is available with a standard nine-pin connector. Buyers who opt for the EKi3A-7100 instead of its smaller cousins will have to give up the microSD slot, the second Gigabit Ethernet port, and the GSM connectivity. The extra CPU power and graphics grunt make that exchange mostly a fair one, though. The Core version of Gigabyte's Brix IoT fanless mini PC measures a diminutive 7.1" x 4.6" x 1.4" (18 cm x 12 cm x 3.6 cm)—just a bit larger than the Apollo Lake versions in every dimension. Gigabyte did not provide pricing or availability information, though we expect the Core version to cost a bit more than the Celeron and Pentium versions.

Opinion: Electron Is Flash For The Desktop Patch Fixes Broken Updates On Windows 7 And 8.1 Running Ryzen, Kaby Lake CPUs Logan Booker Apr 22, 2017, 1:30pm ⋅ Filed to:  amd Australian Stories intel windows windows 7 windows 8.1 Share Image: Intel Microsoft has gone ahead with its plan to disable updates on pre-Windows 10 operating systems running on newer AMD and Intel processors. While your machine won't suddenly stop working, it does mean your Windows 7 or 8.1 install won't benefit from the latest updates. Fortunately, a simple workaround is now available. As predicted, an enterprising coder by the handle "zeffy" dived into Windows' internals and discovered where and how Microsoft performs the check. He or she explored a number of avenues and came up with two options to "fix" the problem. Both involved edits to a file called "wuaueng.dll", with one appearing to be an "internal testing feature used by Microsoft" and "could be removed in future updates", ruling it out in zeffy's mind. The second choice requires a "simple 1-byte change" and is the path the coder went with. The result is a patch anyone can apply to their Windows 7 or 8.1 installation. Of course, the patch comes with some caveats: You have to apply a new patch whenever wuaueng.dll gets updated. SFC scan errors will most likely occur as it will believe the integrity of the system has been compromised. If you can live with these, the patch is available from zeffy's GitHub repository.

Intel will reportedly announce its next-gen CPUs and new X299 chipset during their conference at Computex 2017 in Taipei.     The latest news is coming from Bench.life, which is reporting that Intel's Senior VP Navin Shenoy will make the announcement during his keynote speech on May 30, while general availability of the new CPUs will start on June 26. Now, what new CPUs can we expect from Intel, especially now since AMD kicked them pretty hard in the pants with their new Ryzen CPUs.   Intel is reportedly preparing new 4, 6, 8, 10, and even new 12-core CPUs - so expect Hyper-Threading on most of them, making them 4C/8T, 6C/12T, 8C/16T, 10C/20T, and a monstrous 12C/24T. We should expect Basin Falls X-Series to include new Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X processors. Kaby Lake-X will be the family of quad-core processors, while Skylake-X will handle the higher-end SKUs.

Wants to Make Recycled iPhones Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 8 Facing a Resurgent Samsung (SSNLF) View All Posts Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has slowed down the pace of its CPU releases over the past several years, and now that strategy appears to be paying off. For rival Advanced Micros Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) … AMD took advantage of the situation to make a big push with its new Ryzen processors, and Intel is now feeling the heat. Source: stargazer2020 via Flickr A report says the company has been forced to accelerate release of its new Basin Falls series CPUs by two months, with Coffee Lake chips being moved up even more. To achieve the rush move, INTC is reportedly spending big bucks to increase its manufacturing capacity. INTC Stock’s Slowing PC Processor Innovation With the global computer market declining for the fifth straight year, it’s not surprising that Intel took its foot off the gas in terms of new CPU development. Last year, the company ditched its “tick-tock” development model for one that stretched CPUs into three phases of development. Even earlier, it had begun to get complacent with releases. A prime example was the Broadwell CPUs. Scheduled for 2013, Intel didn’t get around to releasing them until September 2014 and even then, the line-up was staggered with nine months between the first mobile chips and availability of desktop CPUs. INTC was originally scheduled to release Cannon Lake, a new 10nm chip this year. But then it added Coffee Lake, based on the same 14nm process as three previous generations of chips. Coffee Lake will be the primary CPU aimed at mainstream PCs, and its release was pushed to 2018. Cannon Lake is still on track for 2017, but for low-power devices like ultrabooks. AMD Moves to Disrupt With Ryzen PC manufacturers don’t like being at the whims of Intel’s schedule. New models are sometimes delayed for months, waiting for new INTC chips. Consumers may be reluctant to buy a new PC that has a year-old CPU in it. Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iMac hasn’t been updated since 2015 and the blame is often placed with Intel for delayed CPU releases. Intel’s rival in the computer CPU business has not been sitting still. AMD is taking full advantage of INTCs strategy. It has released new Ryzen CPUs that are based on all-new Zen architecture, with improvements that go far beyond the modest gains Intel’s bumps have been providing. AMD Ryzen CPUs also emphasize multicore support, making them ideal for advanced uses like VR and 4K gaming. AMD has been trampled by Intel in the past, to the point where nearly 90% of PCs sold have “Intel Inside” stickers. But the new AMD Ryzen CPUs — which have been well received — could change that.

The list was compiled by documenting 260 data points of disclosure and performance measures for the Russell 1000, with data taken from publicly available information. CR Magazine’s research team looked at how companies handled climate change, environment, employee relations, human rights, corporate governance, financial performance and philanthropy/community support. CR Magazine notes that this year: 38 companies rose an average of 15 ranks. 15 companies in the top 100 fell an average of 14 ranks. The average rank increase for the Top 10 was 12 places. 13 companies are new to the list in 2017 that were not on the 2016 list. Five companies were dropped from the list based on negative CSR events within the last year: Johnson & Johnson, Merck, E.I. Du Pont De Nemours, Monsanto, and Dow Chemical. Six companies were noted as “cautioned” but remain on the list this year. Hasbro says that some of its efforts that helped the company rise to number one on the list include its initiatives in responsibly sourcing its materials. Hasbro says the company: ensures that all third-party factories producing Hasbro product are pre-qualified and only source products from qualified factories; ensures comprehensive factory monitoring that identifies areas of non-compliance and timely remediation; drives for transparency and communication throughout the supply chain; and engages with strategic stakeholders to further inform its approach to improving workplace conditions. Hasbro rose to number one on the list for the first time this year; it is the third year the company has been named in the top five.   Categories Environmental Management, FeatureTags Corporate Social Responsibility, CSR Approaches to Managing EHS&S Data Sponsored By: Enablon    The New Energy Future - Challenges and Opportunities in Corporate Energy Management Sponsored By: Edison Energy    Video: Expense & Data Management for Complex Payables Sponsored By: Ecova, Inc.    Practical Guide to Transforming Energy Data into Better Buildings Sponsored By: Lucid    Leave a Comment Cancel reply NEWSLETTER NEWSLETTER SIGNUP Join 100,000+ subscribers who gain a competitive advantage with our news and analysis.

Extreme Engineering Solutions (X-ES), which has supported its embedded boards with Gentoo Linux, will now offer a Red Hat flavored X-ES Enterprise Linux (XEL) board support package option as the default, with Gentoo still available as an alternative. XEL will be offered for all x86-based X-ES “embedded processing modules,” which would appear to include its Intel Bay Trail based XPedite8150 and Xpedite8152 COMs, among others. Tthe first four “featured products” with XEL are VPX and VME compliant SBCs aimed at high-end networking (see farther below). XPedite8150 The open source, GPL-licensed XEL BSP “operates in conjunction with a stable Enterprise Linux distribution to add full functionality and accessibility to all of an X-ES embedded computing module’s ports and I/O,” says X-ES. The XEL BSP adds a layer of support for X-ES hardware through an assortment of kernel modules and drivers, says the company. XEL appears to be based on the server-oriented Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, although it may derive from the similar, Red Hat sponsored upstream Fedora community project or the RHEL-like CentOS. “Linux distributions compatible with XEL include, but are not limited to, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, and Scientific Linux,” says X-ES. XEL is said to support “Enterprise Linux 6 versions both in the x86_64 and i686 architectures, all versions of Enterprise Linux 7, and RedHawk 7.2 and 7.2.3 in the x86_64 architecture.” The XEL BSP drivers provide access to Intel ICH GPIO and Intel “Bay Trail” devices, I2C GPIO devices, and temperature sensors. XEL also offers access to I2C GPIO devices through either a sysfs or I2C character device interface. The temperature sensor is said to support processors in the coretemp driver and a large AT24 serial EEPROM. There’s also support for access to a PCI-to-VME bridge. Numerous scripts and utilities support X-ES functions such as access to readings from onboard temperature sensors, automatic I2C/SMBus device registration, and onboard LED control. XEL is available with support and updates via its X-ES Open-Source Software Portal.   VPX and VME boards first to offer XEL The XEL product page showcases four fairly recent SBCs that ship with the distribution, although it would appear that XEL is also available for all its x86 boards. Three of the SBCs use the VBX standard, which is also adopted by the QorIQ LS2088A based XPedite6370 SBC we covered last year. As an ARM-based board, however, the XPedite6370 would not appear to be eligible for XEL. A fourth board complies with the older VME standard, which lacks VPX’s support for modern connectors, bus technologies, and serial fabrics. Both the VPX and VME formats are governed by the OpenVPX standard, the latest in a line of mil/aero-focused specifications maintained by VITA (VME Industry Trade Association). Two of the four boards use the 3U form factor while two others use the larger 6U. XPedite7670 (left) and XPedite7570 (click images to enlarge) Here’s a quick rundown on the first four XEL-enabled X-ES SBCs, with names linking to product pages:   XPedite7670 — This 3U VPX-REDI board taps an up to 16-core, server-class Intel Xeon D-1500 from the 5th “Broadwell” generation, which we’ve seen on COMs like the Advantech SOM-5991 and Eurotech CPU-161-18. The 160 x 100mm XPedite7670 features dual GbE ports and dual 10-GbE ports configured as 10GBASE-KR, and can load up to 16GB DDR4 and 32GB NAND. The board includes three VPX sites and an XMC site, and supports I/O including 16x PCIe, 6x SATA III, 2x USB 3.0, 6x serial, and GPIO. Extended temp support is available for up to 12-core models.   XPedite7570 — The VPX-REDI compliant XPedite7570 runs on a “Broadwell-H” or 4th Gen “Haswell” Core i7 with Intel QM87 chipset, and offers 4x GbE ports, 2x of which are configured as SerDes ports. A PCIe switch with Non-Transparent Bridging enables direct communication with other Intel processors, eliminating the need for a separate switch module, says X-ES. The 160 x 100mm board supports up to 8GB of DDR3L and 32GB NAND, and provides 3x VPX sites and one XMC/PrPM site. I/O includes 16x PCIe, 5x SATA III, 2x USB 2.0, 2x serial, GPIO, and 2x HDMI/DVI-D or dual-mode DP ports.   XCalibur4643 — This 6U VPX SBC offers a Xeon-D-1500 with up to 16 cores paired with a Xilinx Kintex UltraScale FPGA. The 233 x 160mm board furnishes dual 10-GbE ports on the dataplane and 3x PCIe x4 interfaces on the expansion plane. OpenVPX, XMC, and PrPMC sites are available. The XCalibur4643 supports up to 32GB of DDR4 and 64GB of NAND, and provides 4x GbE, 4x SATA, 2x USB, and up to 5x RS-232/422/485 ports on the back panel. An optional front-panel add-on provides GbE, USB 3.0, and RS-232 ports in single units.   XCalibur4531 — The 6U, VME-compliant XCalibur4531 features a 5th Gen Core i7 with Iris Pro graphics backed up with up to 16GB DDR3L and 64GB NAND. The 233 x 160mm board provides a VME interface and dual XMC/PrPMC sites, with I/O including 3x GbE, 2x USB 2.0, 2x serial, and a SATA port. There’s also HDMI/DVI-D or dual-mode DP, as well as PMC I/O. XCalibur4643 (left) and XCalibur4531 (click images to enlarge)   Further information The X-ES Enterprise Linux (XEL) BSP is available now on the XPedite7670, XPedite7570, XCalibur4643, and XCalibur4531 SBCs, and appears to be available for download for other X-ES x86 embedded boards. More information may be found at the X-ES XEL product page.   Related posts: High-end boards run Linux on 64-bit ARM QorIQ SoCs First 64-bit distro for Raspberry Pi 3 is… SUSE?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 22 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman See Which Of The Latest 13F Filers Holds Intel Shutterstock photo At Holdings Channel , we have reviewed the latest batch of the 22 most recent 13F filings for the 03/31/2017 reporting period, and noticed that Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) was held by 16 of these funds. When hedge fund managers appear to be thinking alike, we find it is a good idea to take a closer look. Before we proceed, it is important to point out that 13F filings do not tell the whole story, because these funds are only required to disclose their long positions with the SEC, but are not required to disclose their short positions. A fund making a bearish bet against a stock by shorting calls, for example, might also be long some amount of stock as they trade around their overall bearish position. This long component could show up in a 13F filing and everyone might assume the fund is bullish, but this tells only part of the story because the bearish/short side of the position is not seen . Having given that caveat, we believe that looking at groups of 13F filings can be revealing, especially when comparing one holding period to another. Below, let’s take a look at the change in INTC positions, for this latest batch of 13F filers: Fund New Position? Change In Share Count Change In Market Value($ in 1000’s) Wagner Bowman Management Corp Existing +1,332 +$35 Roanoke Asset Management Corp NY Existing +340 +$9 Monarch Capital Management Inc. Existing -176 -$42 Nippon Life Insurance Co. Existing -22,796 -$856 Abner Herrman & Brock LLC Existing +1,547 +$51 OLD Point Trust & Financial Services N A Existing +4,700 +$140 Cape Cod Five Cents Savings Bank Existing +10,483 +$350 Country Trust Bank Existing -12 -$1 Culbertson A N & Co.

Existing +21,419 -$2,435 Factory Mutual Insurance Co. Existing UNCH -$235 Aggregate Change: -26,696 -$5,073 In terms of shares owned, we count 8 of the above funds having increased existing INTC positions from 12/31/2016 to 03/31/2017, with 7 having decreased their positions. Worth noting is that Loeb Partners Corp , included in this recent batch of 13F filers, exited INTC common stock as of 03/31/2017. Looking beyond these particular funds in this one batch of most recent filers, we tallied up the INTC share count in the aggregate among all of the funds which held INTC at the 03/31/2017 reporting period (out of the 505 we looked at in total). We then compared that number to the sum total of INTC shares those same funds held back at the 12/31/2016 period, to see how the aggregate share count held by hedge funds has moved for INTC. We found that between these two periods, funds increased their holdings by 1,095,773 shares in the aggregate, from 65,146,069 up to 66,241,842 for a share count increase of approximately 1.68%. The overall top three funds holding INTC on 03/31/2017 were: We’ll keep following the latest 13F filings by hedge fund managers and bring you interesting stories derived from a look at the aggregate information across groups of managers between filing periods. While looking at individual 13F filings can sometimes be misleading due to the long-only nature of the information, the sum total across groups of funds from one reporting period to another can be a lot more revealing and relevant, providing interesting stock ideas that merit further research, like Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC). 10 S&P 500 Components Hedge Funds Are Buying » The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.

Finally the technology is close to landing in computers and portable devices. The technology will first be adopted by Intel's own server and business setups with the new Optane memories. Also the world's largest PC manufacturer Lenovo has announced previously that it will give some of its laptops a new hybrid drive which will include a small Optane drive. 3D Xpoint is said to be nearly as fast as a DRAM type memory, but the memory density is four times larger. Even if it might be as fast as some RAM memories it is not meant to replace them but instead give a huge speed boost to SSD and hybrid drives that are currently using NAND technology. As you might imagine all this advancement in SSDs is not going to be cheap. For example, a 375 GB Optane SSD DC P4800X costs over $1500 without sales tax, so you'll have to wait a little while before mass markets are going to be adopting it. However, for people that are interested in the performance of the new type of memory, and might even have use for it in servers or other business settings, AnandTech has an in-depth article, albeit crippled by Intel's policies a bit, about the aforementioned P4800X Optane SSD.

The price is still too high...but considering that it is basically able to operate as half-speed non-volatile ram, the price makes a bit more sense. If Intel can bring themselves to offer this to the general public for a good price without crippling it, we could see some big changes in the way that software is written. We could also see Intel become a monopoly in the SSD market.

By Agam Shah U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Apr 22, 2017 3:00 AM PT Credit: HP More like this Lenovo's ThinkPad P71 will work with HTC, Oculus VR headsets Power to the portable: 3 high-performance mobile workstations HP Inc. begins life with a new 4K laptop Video Mingis on Tech: Diving into Windows 10 Creators Update and the future of OSes Apple's Mac Pro has been ignored for so long that even Windows 10 mobile workstations are catching up on features and performance. Take HP's latest Zbook laptop workstations , which were announced on Friday. These heavy built laptops -- which is why they are called mobile workstations -- have comparable memory and storage capacity technology to the Mac Pro, but excel in other areas. The laptops feature Thunderbolt 3 ports, DDR4 memory, Intel's latest Kaby Lake-based Core and Xeon processors, and the latest GPUs from Nvidia and AMD. By comparison the Mac Pro has Thunderbolt 2 ports, an old AMD GPU, DDR3 memory and Intel Xeon processors based on the Ivy Bridge architecture, which were released in 2013. Add that all up, and you can rely on the Zbook for work like content creation, VR and video editing that you would otherwise do on a Mac Pro. Windows desktop workstations, like HP's Z and Dell's Precision desktops, are already far superior in technology than the Mac Pro. And the Zbook laptops -- which come in screen sizes of 14-, 15.6- and 17.3-inch screens, are up to half the price of a Mac Pro. Apple has said it will upgrade the Mac Pro in 2018 or 2019, but the current version, which was released in 2013 and recently got a minor upgrade, is so behind that many have moved over to Linux or Windows PCs. The ZBook 17 is the most powerful of HP's new workstations. It supports up to 4TB of hard drive or SSD storage, 64GB of memory, and can be configured with Intel's Xeon E3 v6 or Core i5/i7 chips. It has two Thunderbolt 3 ports, which can support two 4K displays. It can support GPUs including Nvidia's latest Quadro P5000, which can handle VR content creation. The laptop can be configured with a 4K screen, and it also HDMI and USB 3.0 ports. It will be priced starting at US$1,519. The Zbook 15 has many features that are similar to the Zbook 17, but is a step down in some features. It supports up to 3TB of storage, and supports Nvidia's Quadro M2200 GPU, not the P5000. This laptop can be configured with a 4K screen, and is priced starting at $1,419. The Zbook Studio, which starts at $1,399, is like the Zbook 15, but much thinner and lighter at around 2 kilograms. It also has fewer features like half the memory and lesser storage capacity. Given its size, it supports only Nvidia's Quadro M1200M GPU. It also has a DisplayPort 1.2 port. These laptops are available worldwide. Other features include support for AMD's FirePro GPUs, and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. HP also announced the ZBook 14u with a 14-inch screen, which is only available with Intel Core i5/i7 processors. The laptop's price wasn't announced at the time of press.

This latest edition of the industry-leading report presents several new datasets and analyses including an expanded list of new states, a review of the community solar landscape, and greater insights into solar shopper demographics. According to EnergySage data, the typical solar shopper is a mid-career male in his mid-40s with interests in real estate, financial services, and home services in addition to solar energy. This most recent report also features a new section analyzing residential solar data by utility territory. EnergySage compared the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of solar to today’s electricity rates in territories served by Commonwealth Edison Co., Consolidated Edison (ConEd), Dominion Power, Florida Power & Light Co., Southern California Edison, and Xcel Energy. In all service areas, the LCOE of solar is lower than the 2016 residential electricity rate offered by the utility, affirming the comparative benefits of solar as a low-cost energy source. Other key insights in the latest Solar Marketplace Intel Report include: Solar prices are falling at accelerating rate Between H1 2016 and H2 2016, gross cost per watt on EnergySage dropped by 6.25%. That is more than triple the rate of decline from the first EnergySage Solar Marketplace Intel Report from July 2014 to June 2015, and the greatest rate of decline measured in any of the reports to date. This trend may reflect improved operational efficiencies at solar companies, lower customer acquisition costs via online channels like EnergySage, increased competition, and the low cost of solar panels and inverters. More quotes result in more sales Consumers who receive offers from multiple solar installers are significantly more likely to complete a solar purchase. EnergySage users who received 5+ quotes in 2016 were nearly eight times more likely to buy than those who received only one quote. These results offer a clear message: quotes from multiple installers will increase consumer confidence, and solar shoppers should be encouraged to seek multiple quotes. Solar shoppers are mostly male EnergySage used Solar Marketplace demographic data to develop a profile of today’s solar-interested consumers, and found that three out of every four solar shoppers (77%) are male. This gender imbalance presents an opportunity for the solar industry to develop new messaging and outreach strategies to attract more female shoppers, and expand the product category to achieve true mass-market appeal. “This latest report speaks to the importance of transparency and comparison-shopping in residential solar,” said EnergySage CEO and founder Vikram Aggarwal. “For the consumer, getting more quotes empowers them to make better-informed decisions. For the installer, more quotes results in increased consumer confidence, which in turn results in a higher likelihood of purchase. Comparison-shopping platforms like EnergySage make win-win situations like this possible.” EnergySage is an online comparison-shopping marketplace for rooftop solar, community solar and solar financing, and is uniquely positioned to share solar market insights. This report furthers EnergySage’s mission to support the healthy growth of the solar industry via consumer education and empowerment, price transparency, and greater information sharing among all stakeholders.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware  ⋮  Leak Intel’s Monstrous 12 Core / 24 Thread HEDT Skylake-X Processor Confirmed – Will Debut On 30th May In Intel Keynote, Availability By End of June By Usman Pirzada Apr 21, 2017 299Shares Share Tweet Submit Intel's Skylake-X platform promises to introduce the first ever 12-core SKU for the Mainstream/HEDT segment. Woah, we have just received confirmation from Benchlife.info that Intel is going forward with the 12-Core Skylake-X part after all. This is pretty big news which I had previously published as a rumor. Meanwhile, the launch of the company’s X299 platform is going to happen at Computex 2017 as previously stated. It will be unveiled at the Intel Keynote by Navin Shenoy who is the General Manager and Senior Vice President of Client Computing Group (CCG). Intel’s response to Ryzen: Rolling out 12-Core Skylake-X HEDT chip under the X299 platform on 30th May Benchlife has also revealed the mass availability date for the platform, which is going to be on 26th of June 2017. This means that Basin Falls will be shipping with not 4 but 5 SKUs. The five SKUs will include a 12 core, 10 core, 8 core, 6 core and 4 core model. The 12, 10, 8 and 6 core models will be based on the Skylake architecture. The 4 core model will be based on the Kaby Lake architecture which launched on mainstream platforms earlier this month. All Skylake-X chips will feature a rated TDP of 140W (with the possible exception of the 12 core die) while the Kaby Lake-X chip will feature a TDP of 112W. All chips will be marketed as the Core i7-7000 series processors and utilize the LGA 2066 socket. Related Report: Intel Has Pushed Forward Basin Falls, Skylake-X and Coffee Lake To Tackle Newly Competitive x86 Landscape The LGA 2066 socket of the HEDT Basin Falls platform is called Socket R4. SKL-X will have up to 44 PCIe 3.0 lanes (a total of 68 lanes) while Kaby Lake-X will have only up to 16 PCIe 3.0 lanes (a total of 40 lanes). Skylake-X will have quad channel DDR 4 memory up to 2667MHz in 1DPC mode and up to 2400MHz in 2DPC mode. Kabylake-X on the other hand will only have dual channel DDR4. The Kaby Lake PCH will have 24 PCIe 3.0 lanes, 8 SATA Gen3, 10 USB 3.0 ports and connected via 4 DMI 3.0 lanes to the processor. Intel LAN (Jacksonville PHY) will also be present on the chipset. Advertisement This move is something that can be categorized as unprecedented from Intel and can be cautiously allocated  as a reaction to AMD’s Ryzen. Or more specifically the looming threat of bigger and faster Ryzen processors with even more cores inbound. Remember that word on the grapevine is that AMD is planning on releasing its 16-core Ryzen CPU and the X399 platform in the 3rd quarter of 2017 for the gaming market. If such a thing should happen, it would turn the tables on Intel, which will need to revamp its lineup in order to compete with the sheer number of cores that AMD will be throwing at it. According to the source, the 14nm Coffeelake processors and its Z370 chipset will be releasing in August as well as more CPUs and the H370 and B360/H310 chipsets following at the end of 2017 or early 2018. There is also one very obvious implication in all this: that Intel will be cutting prices for the price points across the board as well. Microcenter has already started cutting prices, but as of yet there is no word from Intel on an official price cut. It is possible that Intel will introduce the new set of price cuts with the new Skylake-X lineup and has currently adopted a wait-and-see strategy, which would make a lot of sense. Related Intel’s X299 HEDT Platform with LGA 2066 Socket Codenamed ‘Basin Falls’ – Launch Pushed Forward to Computex 2017 in June The x86 battleground has been silent for far too long and things are obviously starting to heat up for both companies. Armed with the flexible Zen architecture, AMD makes a formidable opponent thanks to their value proposition of perf per $. Not only can they now match Intel in terms of core count (remember, 16 Naples dies can be re-purposed for the commercial space if AMD sees fit) but are in the same league in terms of performance per core as well. Intel will need to accompany this 12-core reveal with a price cut for maximum effect but regardless of how many $ Intel shaves off the MSRP, one thing is clear: The Game Is On.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software Image Source: nSeika Hack lets older Windows users get around Windows 10 update restriction Chris Smith @chris_writes April 20th, 2017 at 6:29 PM Share Tweet Microsoft keeps saying that it’s not going to be as aggressive about Windows 10 upgrades as it used to be, but actions speak louder than words. Recently, users discovered that they were not able to receive the latest security updates on their Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 PCs that are powered by newer Intel chips. Microsoft issued a new tool that checks a computer’s processor and prevents it from receiving any updates in case it detects it’s a new generation CPU on a computer running a Windows version that’s not Windows 10. As expected, someone was able to crack Microsoft’s restrictions and re-enable updates. Don't Miss: Niantic is finally addressing Pokemon Go’s biggest problem Both Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 are still supported. We’re looking at three and six years of updates, respectively. But Microsoft would rather have you upgrading that new PC to the latest version of Windows 10. One way to convince you to pull the trigger is trying to prevent your laptop from receiving system updates meant to keep your PC safe. To be fair, Microsoft did warn Windows users about what’s coming. New Intel chips won’t support older Windows versions, Microsoft said all the way back in 2016. However, when Patch Tuesday came last week, and Windows 10 Creators Update along with it, Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 users discovered they were not able to receive their security updates. Microsoft’s tool was already in place giving an error message that read “Your PC uses a processor that isn’t supported on this version of Windows and you won’t receive updates.” One Windows user took it upon himself to fix this issue, ZDNet reports. Developer Zeffy posted a new patch on GitHub that stops Microsoft’s tool from checking your computer’s processor age. That means any Kaby Lake or Bristol Ridge Ryzen users can install the security updates for Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 after using this unofficial patch. According to the developer, Microsoft’s March 16 update for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 came with this changelog entry: “Enabled detection of processor generation and hardware support when PC tries to scan or download updates through Windows Update.” As Zeffy put it, that’s “essentially a giant middle finger to anyone who dare not ‘upgrade’ to the steaming pile of garbage known as Windows 10”. You can get Zeffy’s fix at this link.

Not anymore. Last year, the company’s co-founders Dan and Johnna Charbonneau hired Galvin, who had worked as a fundraiser and a consultant to global nonprofit groups and social entrepreneurs. Now CBT Nuggets’ charitable giving arm, Nugget­Love, doesn’t just give money. It gives Galvin’s time and expertise — and sometimes the talents of other employees — to help a targeted group of nonprofit organizations raise money and spread their message. The Charbonneaus’ eyes opened to this new way of corporate giving a few years ago after CBT Nuggets donated to the Los Angeles-based nonprofit Drop in the Bucket. Drop in the Bucket builds wells and sanitation systems in Uganda, enabling girls to go to school and women to be part of the local economy, instead of spending much of their time fetching water. The nonprofit also starts village savings and loan programs, offering microloans to entrepreneurs. Interest from the loans pays to maintain the wells, and the loans help spur a market economy, Galvin said. After working with Drop in the Bucket, “we realized we could do more to help in the world,” Johnna Charbonneau said. “We decided we wanted to work with charities who help their beneficiaries not only fulfill basic needs — like clean water and sanitation — but who also elevate their beneficiaries to become self-reliant,” she said. “We felt we could do this by working with a small number of charities assisting them in their development efforts, helping them become stronger and more sustainable, and thus making a bigger impact on difficult social, economic, and environmental problems.” Sharing the NuggetLove CBT Nuggets, which was founded in 1999, produces and sells online training for information technology professionals worldwide. It has 127 employees — 95 of them are based in Eugene. The private company doesn’t reveal its annual revenues, but it said each year it channels to NuggetLove about 1 percent of total revenues. Nonprofit groups apply to be part of the NuggetLove program. CBT Nuggets is currently helping the 15th Night Movement, a partnership of over 20 local organizations, working to prevent homelessness among area youth. The project’s name comes from social services agencies’ observation that if young people don’t have a place to call home by the 15th night, they run a greater risk of chronic homelessness. For the past month, Galvin has been leading weekly meetings of a seven-person committee to help the 15th Night project with marketing and communications. Organizations that are striving for social change, to improve lives or advance their mission, are looking to business for support in terms of time, money and/or talent, said Megan Schultz, a Eugene consultant who has been contracted to help launch the 15th Night. “In CBT Nuggets’ case, they have all three,” she said. “They’re really trying to meet organizations where they‘re at. What is it that would be most helpful to you?” NuggetLove also works with the Kenyan nonprofit, I See Maasai Development Initiative, which works to improve Maasai communities by providing access to school supplies and scholarships, water projects, such as wells, healthcare facilities, public health education, and social entrepreneurship opportunities in the tourism industry. Galvin said she isn’t aware of any other companies CBT Nuggets’ size that structure their corporate giving in this way. “Even though this is a small company, they are on the leading edge of what’s being done in corporate citizenship,” said Maryann Fiala, spokeswoman for the Association of Corporate Contributions Professionals. Members of the South Carolina-based nonprofit group lead corporate responsibility programs at for-profit companies and corporate funded foundations. “More and more companies, regardless of their size, are recognizing the value of good corporate citizenship and are choosing to do it strategically rather than hit or miss,” Fiala said. It’s very common for companies to offer resources, not just money, to help nonprofit groups build their capacity, she said. “You can give them X number of dollars that can go so far. But if you can give them skills that can multiply the dollars they’re raising and multiply the impact on ... whatever social ill they’re trying to solve, then you’ve given so much more than money.” Increasingly companies, even small ones, want their giving to have global impact, especially if their marketplace is global, Fiala said. A strong corporate giving program also can help businesses recruit and retain workers, she said. “The generation of workers coming into the workforce now are telling us very vocally they want to work for companies that want to do good in the world,” Fiala said. “They want to work for a company that does more in the world than just provide a product or service.” Other ways of giving Besides its targeted work with several nonprofit groups, CBT Nuggets also gives to the community in other ways. The company has to constantly upgrade its own computers, so it routinely donates its old ones to local nonprofit groups, Galvin said. It also looks for groups of people who could benefit from free CBT Nuggets training. After Intel Corp. announced last year that it was laying off 12,000 workers, including employees in Oregon, CBT Nuggets offered affected employees six months of free CBT Nuggets’ online training to help them brush up their skills or gain new ones, with the goal of keeping them employed in Oregon’s tech industry. Several hundred laid-off Intel workers accepted the offer, Galvin said. That effort led CBT Nuggets to brainstorm how it could help sustain and grow Lane County’s tech force, she said. Galvin contacted the Lane Workforce Partnership, a local workforce agency. Earlier this month, NuggetLove announced it is offering six months of free online training to Lane County job seekers working with Worksource Oregon, a partnership of various public and private agencies, including the Lane Workforce Partnership and the state employment department. “We serve all job seekers,” said Jessica McCormick, the partnership’s workforce project manager. “It could be someone looking to advance their career, or someone laid off, or currently looking for work.” The six months of training, worth an estimated value of $500, “is a really good opportunity for anyone interested in getting into the tech field,” McCormick said. The partnership is excited to offer this opportunity to clients, she said. “One of the goals of Lane Workforce Partnership is to expand the use of services to underrepresented populations,” McCormick said. “That includes rural Lane County. This is a unique opportunity for people with barriers to transportation to get some very sophisticated training.” For years, through its Outside the Wire program, CBT Nuggets has offered six months of free training to service men and women transitioning out of the U.S. military. About 70 veterans have used or are using the free training, Galvin said. Esteban Hermosillo, 24, is among them. Hermosillo lives at Camp Pendleton near Oceanside, Calif. He has served in the U.S. Navy in information technology, as a network administrator and system administrator, since July 2013, and is planning to transfer out of the Navy this summer. Hermosillo is enrolled in Microsoft Software & Systems Academy, a program for service men and women leaving active duty to train as cloud developers and administrators and database administrators. He said he stumbled upon CBT Nuggets’ website, and learned about the six-months-free-­training offer, so he applied. “It’s been an awesome tool,” Hermosillo said, adding that he is using the training to learn about servers and to achieve Cisco certification as a network administrator. “I watch all the videos,” he said. “They have a bunch of quizzes and tests.” Hermosillo said without the program, the CBT Nuggets training would have cost $600. “That was money I did not have,” he said, “and I was hoping to get some support. It’s been invaluable to me.” Follow Sherri on Twitter @sburimcdonald . Email sherri@registerguard.com .

Trump visited the headquarters of tool manufacturer Snap-on Inc., and will later sign a an executive order that seeks to make changes to a visa program that brings in high-skilled workers. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) With the technology industry constantly complaining about a talent shortage, making it harder to hire foreign workers doesn’t seem like an obvious solution. Oddly enough, though, President Donald Trump’s proposed changes to the H-1B visa program could help companies such as Microsoft and Google bring in the foreign talent they need. In his “Buy American, Hire American” executive order, Trump told four Cabinet agencies to propose new procedures for granting H-1B visas, including a possible replacement for the current lottery system. In this year’s lottery, the government got 199,000 applications in less than a week for 85,000 available visas. The applications were down a bit from last year, which can be read as a sign that outsourcing firms — the biggest users of the H-1B program — are worried about a Trump crackdown. And that’s a good thing. The outsourcing firms, mostly Indian companies such as Wipro and Infosys, often pay their foreign workers less than typical technology-industry wages to maintain websites and perform other routine back-office tasks. Critics say their business model harms American workers. Industry observers also believe the outsourcers flood the government with H-1B applications to improve their odds. If they stop playing that game because of Trump’s vow to police abuses, the odds should tilt in favor of companies such as Amazon and Intel. Administration officials suggest that Trump wants to move away from the lottery and toward a system that would reward higher-paying employers. They also suggest that he may raise the application fee and set a higher minimum salary for H-1B workers. All of those moves would make the program less hospitable to outsourcers and more useful for Silicon Valley firms looking for truly high-end skills. “You solve a supply-demand problem by either increasing supply or raising the price,” says Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation. “President Trump essentially is raising the price.” The outsourcing firms, of course, will adapt to the changes. “One effect is they will just do more work in India,” Atkinson says. “The other possibility is that it becomes harder for these companies to make their model work.” Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, thinks the Indian firms will have to pay more — and hire more U.S. citizens — if they want to keep their American clients. Get the Bottom Line from Nicklaus and Gallagher Meet the best small businesses to work at in St. Louis What's going up: Read the Building Blocks blog How do they stack up? Compare pay of top St. Louis executives “These firms are under serious margin pressure anyway,” Kirkegaard says. “They need to move up the food chain, do more than basic bug-finding and back-office optimization. … To do that, to become more of a high-value-added provider, they’re going to have to hire more American workers.” Trump’s executive order eventually may transform H-1B from a lottery into something like an auction, where the visas go to the firms willing to pay the most. Firms such as Google — or in other industries, Monsanto or Goldman Sachs — would be able to hire the world’s best talent and find specialized skills that are in short supply. That, after all, is what the H-1B program was designed for. And, those U.S. companies tend to try to keep the workers they bring in. “They pay workers well, and they sponsor them for green cards,” Kirkegaard points out. “It’s a different use of the program than the outsourcing firms do.” Ideally, the U.S. should combine an auction process with a way to issue more visas when companies need more workers. Trump, having run on an anti-immigration platform, isn’t likely to go that far, so employers will have to settle for a more efficient allocation of the current quota.

Those lucky — and wealthy — enough could do so in an outfit from H&M’s Coachella collection and end their night in an air-conditioned safari tent designed by Marriott.

(Photo by Kevin Sullivan, Orange County Register/SCNG) Show Caption of Expand Coachella, once an indie darling, used to bury sponsors on its website, but this year, the festival’s corporate partners all have an experience to sell and a logo to slap on it. Some offered ways to interact with their brands without an obvious sales pitch, while others used the three-day festival to promote new products and special offers. The experiences offered in 2017 included drone shows, a psychedelic journey through space, a makeup counter and an opportunity to get a selfie in fake snow. Studies have found millennials — the demographic buying up tickets to the sold-out festival — are more prone to FOMO, or the “fear of missing out,” making them more likely to form connections to brands that allow them to share unique interactions with their envious friends at home. Ticket seller Eventbrite found that more than 78 percent of millennials would rather spend their money on events than on products and more than 77 percent tied their “best memories” to a live experience in a 2014 nationwide survey of more than 2,000 adults. “We’re living in an era where a lot of people are paying for an experience,” said Jeff Fromm, a partner at the Kansas City, Missouri-based ad agency Barkley and author of “Marketing to Millennials.” “And brands are looking to integrate with those people who have discretionary money.” It’s not necessarily a bad thing either, Fromm said, as long as the sponsorship doesn’t take away from Coachella’s charm. Guests at Coachella seemed to agree, with some of the sponsored “experiences” this year getting praise from the people who paid at least $399 per ticket. Coachella is a “bucket list experience” and consumers looking to check it off the list aren’t likely to be deterred by sponsorships, overt or otherwise, Fromm said. Netflix, Heineken and H&M all showed up at Coachella. Netflix offered free WiFi to promote its new series “Girlboss;” Heineken, a longtime sponsor, brought in surprise guests; and H&M as it has in recent years sponsored a fashion line in the spirit of the music festival. Computer company HP Inc. had one of the largest presences at Coachella this year, but fans seemed to view most of their offerings favorably. HP hosted a lounge with virtual reality, a light show controlled by fans using the latest HP computers, and a machine to create custom bandannas. Along with Intel, the tech company also backed a synchronized drone performance with hundreds of the aerial robots that circulated on social media as one of the better moments of Coachella’s first weekend. The Antarctic, a massive dome sponsored by Intel and HP near Coachella’s main entrances, similarly drew praise. The 15-minute show gave fans a chance to relax in beanbag chairs in the air-conditioned dome while watching a trippy 360-degree video that first starts in the desert and then flies through space, time and the human brain. HP partnered with visual artists Android Jones and Eric Pare to create the immersive installation, according to the company. “They’re not really in your face trying to sell you stuff,”  said Amy Kirkpatrick, of Irvine, as she exited the dome with Mitch Franco, of Santa Ana. “We’re not running out to buy HP printers or computers or anything.” Kirkpatrick said they had not noticed the HP logo until the very end and weren’t aware of the other companies’ booths throughout the polo field, many of which were tucked away from the main stages. Marriott and American Express were among those offering special tents for members of their rewards’ programs and the general public. American Express created a lounge for fans to create mini-music videos at Coachella, and outside the venue they offered an exclusive party for Platinum cardholders in Palm Springs. At Marriott, guests could pose for pictures on four stages set up to look like locales around the world, from the beach to an arctic tundra complete with fake snow for snow angels. Rewards members got access to a VIP area with unique food and drink vendors and a chance to bid on eight safari tents themed after Marriott’s various hotel chains. Actress Vanessa Hudgens tweeted out a picture in front of one of the tents during the first weekend as part of a brand partnership with Le Meridien Hotels, one of Marriott’s chains. Fromm said arrangements like the one with Hudgens are helping to reach younger generations. “Millennials are less likely to accept company points of view than prior generations and more likely to accept non-traditional forms of communications,” he said. Some of the experiences were only for the festival’s most wealthy clientele. VIPs could get rides to the event in a Coachella-themed BMWi, worth $142,000, and the company set up displays within the VIP areas as part of its #roadtocoachella campaign. The walls of the tent were papered in photos of BMWs near the wind farms that are the gateway to the Coachella Valley. The special tent had couches for lounging, phone-charging lockers and a display that showed promotional videos created for Coachella, including one with Sunday night performer and film composer Hans Zimmer. However, you couldn’t test drive a car on-site, unlike the Stagecoach Country Music Festival, which allows people to test out Toyota trucks on an off-road course. Eight-year Coachella veteran Andy Zepeda said he’s noticed the amount of corporations visible at Coachella increase every year, but it hasn’t reached a level where it bothers him, yet. “As long as it is giving me something new to experience, I don’t really mind it as long as it not getting in my way,” he said. The sponsors this year offered either experiences that gave him more to do, or they offered free merchandise, like bandannas, he noted. Fromm, the marketing expert, said Coachella fans should get used to the sponsorships, which help Goldenvoice, the promoter, expand the festival without increasing ticket prices or cutting into their revenues. In exchange for their support, the brands get a captive audience, he added. “I’m not surprised to see more of these events, and brands are looking for the opportunity to engage with consumers,” Fromm said. “It’s not going to get smaller; it’s going to get bigger.” More stories, photos from Coachella 2017: Photos: See all of the Coachella vibes from Weekend 2 What happened on Friday, Weekend 2 Coachella 2017: This is the cool, weird stuff you can buy in the festival’s Vintage Market See a couple’s Coachella proposal Radiohead conquers Coachella’s second weekend Photos of Radiohead from Weekend 2 Photos of the bands and their fans on Friday, Weekend 2 Meet the young kids rocking out at the festival How ‘Amnesty Boxes’ keep drugs out and festivalgoers safe Live updates from Weekend 2 17 things to know about opening weekend Photos: What it actually looks like to be at Coachella’s opening weekend Here’s how the first Friday at Coachella went down Photos of the bands and their fans on Friday, Weekend 1 Who wore it best (or worst)?

He has been covering Microsoft since 2009 back when this site was called WMExperts (and later Windows Phone Central). His interests include Windows, Surface, HoloLens, Xbox, and future computing visions. Follow him on Twitter: @daniel_rubino. A new low-cost Surface device and Windows 10 Cloud OS combo could do some serious damage to Google's Chromebook ambitions in U.S. schools. On May 2, all eyes will be on Microsoft at its New York City event. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is expected to take the stage and unveil a new push into the education market, likely focused on the U.S. initially. Google has been making big inroads into the K-12 education sector with its low-cost and easy-to-manage Chromebooks. According to IDC's latest numbers,, Chromebooks represented 49 percent of that market last year, up from 40 percent in 2015 and just 9 percent in 2013. Another research firm, Futuresource, puts the number even higher at 58 percent, up from 50 percent in 2015. Apple, which has taken the brunt of the damage from the Chromebook wave in education in the U.S, meanwhile lost significant momentum in recent years. Apple's iOS, featured on the waning iPad series, went from a peak of 26 percent of the market in 2014 to just 14 percent last year, according to Futuresource. Microsoft's Windows, by comparison, did better, dropping from 25 percent to 22 percent in that same time period. For non-U.S. markets, the tale is very different. There, 65 percent of the education market is Windows, with Chrome OS at just six percent and Android at 17 percent. Apple held steady at just nine percent of the global education K-12 markets. The timing is right for Windows 10 Cloud Google is on to something with its Chromebook line, at least in the U.S. Combined with hardware support from major manufacturers, a mature app ecosystem, and ease of IT management, Chromebooks are the preferred choice for school IT departments. In speaking with some local school IT administrators – both public and private – here in Marlborough, Mass., it is the ability to lock down and secure Chromebooks, followed by cost, that is driving Chromebook adoption. 7 things you need to know about Windows 10 Cloud Microsoft is poised, however, to get back into education. Windows RT was a disaster for the company on many levels, including its confusing name, poor marketing, software limitations, and pricing. The Windows 10 Cloud OS, which may go by the name "Windows 10 S" when unveiled on May 2, is a different scenario. This time, Microsoft has a story to tell and a strategy to market this version of Windows to the right audience. Key differences between Windows RT and Windows 10 Cloud OSes include: A more mature Store for Windows Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps. The ability for the OS to be upgraded to a Home or Pro license. Capacity to run Win32 apps via "Project Centennial" bridge apps via the Store. A hardware team that's more in tune with commercial and consumer needs and desires. Combined with advancements in hardware and improvements to the OS, Microsoft has clear goals it wants to achieve with Windows 10 Cloud. In an internal document obtained by Windows Central (above), we can see exactly how Microsoft views Windows 10 Cloud as competing against Chromebooks in performance benchmarks. Additionally, recommended minimum specifications for a Windows 10 "CloudBook" are listed for hardware manufacturers: Quad-core (Celeron or better) processor. 4GB of RAM. 32GB of storage (64GB for 64-bit). A battery larger than 40 WHr. Fast eMMC or solid state drive (SSD) for storage technology. Pen and touch (optional). Microsoft is focusing heavily on all-day battery life, as evidenced by its new "Power Throttling" initiative that's being tested in recent Windows Insider Program previews for the "Redstone 3" release expected this fall. Windows 10 on ARM will go further Windows 10 on ARM is another big step for Microsoft that is expected to come to fruition this fall, as well. With the ability to run what was an x86/64 OS on mobile ARM processors, the company can further drive down hardware costs, improve battery efficiency, and make thinner and lighter devices. Intel is making significant strides in reducing battery consumption, and Microsoft's Power Throttling goes further. According to the company, its Power Throttling support will be extended to other processor types (currently it is limited to 6th and 7th Generation Intel processors), which likely includes ARM. The Achilles heel of Windows laptops has always been two-fold: poor battery life, and risk management due to viruses and installing .exe software. Both of those problems are now being ameliorated through Windows 10 Cloud. Windows 10 on ARM devices are expected at the end of 2017 in the fourth quarter. Today's Surface Book is too expensive The current problem for Microsoft and its Surface line is the price. At Microsoft's Surface Studio event in October 2016, Microsoft's Corporate Vice President of Devices Panos Panay used a photo of his son to demonstrate how children naturally adopt digital inking on a PC. In the picture, presented as a backdrop, the child is using a Surface Book. That device starts at $1,600 and increases to more than $3,000 for the high-end version. Kids love inking and the Surface Book, but how do you get it into schools? While in a perfect world all kids would be able to afford a Microsoft Surface Book, the chances of that happening are minuscule. Clearly, Microsoft needs a lower-cost, entry-level device that provides a similar experience with an emphasis on a touchscreen and digital pen. A new "Surface Laptop" running Windows 10 Cloud is the ideal solution, if it meets the minimum hardware specifications mentioned earlier. It also could also replace the now deprecated non-pro Surface 3. Microsoft is expected to announce such a device on May 2, though some of our sources say the new hardware may not come until Microsoft's Build conference the following week. A traditional laptop without a detachable keyboard would keep production costs down (fewer product SKUs), and it would work for schools, where losing a keyboard (or breaking it) could cause headaches for IT staff. As a solution to making the laptop more Surface-like, the keyboard could rotate around like Lenovo's Yoga series or HP's x360 line. I also suspect a Surface Pen will be a part of any Surface Laptop, because the recent Creators Update focuses on inking. The new EPUB support in Windows 10 makes sense when you think of a push into education for Microsoft. Likewise, the seemingly odd addition of EPUB support for the Edge web browser and corresponding digital book section in the Windows Store makes more sense once you bring education into the equation. However, one issue Microsoft could face in schools is app selection. While UWP is evolving and improving the selection of quality apps specifically related to education, it cannot possibly match the Google Play Store. That could change over time, and perhaps Microsoft has some strategies in place to help lure companies to create apps specifically for this genre. Windows 10 Cloud and Surface for schools makes sense Recently, a nephew of mine who is nine years old saw my Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon. He said, "That looks like my Chromebook." I jokingly corrected him by stating "No, your Chromebook looks like my PC laptop." The point should be obvious: The education market is critical to Microsoft's future based purely on familiarity. The debate between macOS and Windows preference, for instance, almost always comes down to what you were exposed to first. Rarely in today's world do adults try both OSes, evaluate them equally and come to rational decisions. Chromebook or PC? The answer may be age dependent. If Google is already at 50 percent adoption in the U.S. education market, that is a generation that's now in the Google and Android ecosystem. Microsoft needs a plan to take that on and, for once, I feel like it may have some significant advantages with Windows 10 Cloud and a new Surface. The recent announcement that it will align the servicing models for Windows 10, Office 365 ProPlus, and System Center Configuration Manager also likely plays a part in this plan. Windows 10 Redstone 3: Everything we know so far Microsoft's hardware partners are likely to pick up the slack and deliver even lower cost hardware to run Windows 10 Cloud in the coming months in preparation for fall 2017. All of that combined with Apple's declining popularity in schools is a perfect opportunity for Redmond. As such, Microsoft's May 2 event could be the start of a significant push for the company — one that will have a lasting effect on a new generation.

Mainly, getting the schools to want to carry these computers. 6 1 day ago Reply Gabriel Hernandez5 Microsoft already offers books in a new app in Creators Update, however this is not a library, its a bookstore, so IMO Microsoft should reuse this SaaS but let universities to publish their online books into this library secured by Microsoft's authentication services, this would let professors know their students which have a registration in the University or Highschool, can have access to the library using Microsoft's Book apps suited as a library.  1 1 day ago Reply Wevenhuis How should I interpret the performance of quad core "celeron" compared to arm (say snapdragon 800 or 835)? 2 1 day ago Reply RohanRonQM The Qualcomm SD810 v2, or SD617 would be comparable to a Celeron (2013), or Intel Core M3 (1st gen), or even a Core i3 (2nd gen) . Of course, from there you would be able to tell the newer ARM processors would be much closer to newer Intel Core M5, Core i3/i5, etc. . Just a heads up: The entire Intel Atom lineup was probably as powerful as a Qualcomm SD 400, 410, or 605. 0 1 day ago Reply ozaz For future reference, what do you base this on?

It is terrible. When they try to do something productive, such as write a résumé, I always tell them to get on word. They are forced to use google docs and it is so limited compared to word. They even have older versions of word on older computers, and those are more powerful than google docs. Another thing I don't understand is why do the teachers use Windows 10 and the students use chrome books 🤔. They clearly know Windows is more productive and they decide to give students google services. 4 1 day ago Reply Hirox K it's frreeeeeee... (whisper) 0 1 day ago Reply VOMoreira No. I know for a fact they pay for the services. Students get emails and drive storage just like Microsoft does with exchange and OneDrive. It's the exact same service, but worse. If anything, it's probably cheaper because it is worse. 3 1 day ago Reply 19Michael87 There is probably a huge Linux fanboy running the IT department at your school that finally has the ultimate tool (Chrome OS) for him to use in his holy crusade against Microsofts evil dominance ;-) 0 1 day ago Reply VOMoreira Lol. I tried. They say its better for the students and I just don't see how its better. 0 1 day ago Reply bleached It is good for the students and definitely easier for the staff. Chromebooks require almost no support. They basically just need WiFi and an account created for each student. Windows historically isn't anywhere near as easy to manage and requires dedicated IT support. When students log into a Chromebook it automatically has all their settings and files available, no matter what machine they are on. It is really simple and each user has their own separate experience. Windows is getting better here, but it still takes some time when you first log in and Microsoft's services (especially Edge) just aren't really designed for this style of cloud computing. I think this is where Microsoft really needs to improve. Logging in with your Microsoft ID should quickly give you the same experience on any device without having any setup required to use their services. Chromebooks accel here. There are certainly tasks that are tougher to complete on a Chromebook. Computer programming, video editing, CAD, etc. just aren't great experiences. These types of niche classes require niche hardware and services. For the vast majority of tasks required of students, mainly document creation and research, Chromebooks are more than enough. 3 1 day ago Reply HackAtak WOW, "They basically just need WiFi and an account created for each student. Windows historically isn't anywhere near as easy to manage and requires dedicated IT support."   What you meant to say is to fully utilize a Chromebook, Wi-Fi/Internet is REQUIRED otherwise its a paperweight!   All too many on here tout the chromebook as good for the student which is CRAP, its cheap and easy for the school to cut corners and further indoctrinate the youth toward a product that has absolutly NO PLACE in the business world or upper education for that matter.  I for one hope MS knocks their introduction out of the park and boot these CRAPbooks to the curb!  I do business with many schools and they all agree, they went with the chromebooks because they were cheap and about the only alternative to textbooks, but they now see the issues with FREE and Google and how they control, track and monitor activities of chromebook users and collect that data so they can use it to sell to companies for marketing purposes.  Google Drive and Gmail, there aren't any bigger security issues in the world than thats two repositories for the NSA, CIA, FBI, etc.  To better prepare students for the work place, using a chromebook and google docs is doing them a disservice...PERIOD!   0 6 hours ago Reply bleached Schools have so much to hide from the CIA, FBI, etc. Do you hear what you are saying! There is no difference between a child typing a report in Google Docs vs Word. Google Docs is overkill for that function! 0 6 hours ago Reply RohanRonQM Google Suite was better for cloud computing 5 years ago when Microsoft had only Outlook and SkyDrive.

Now MSFT has caught up and gotten way better as a cloud computing platform compared to others like GSuite or IBM. 1 1 day ago Reply RohanRonQM Google Suite is cheaper compared to Microsoft Azure services 0 1 day ago Reply Tom Westrick Does it matter? Do students actually need every single feature in Word? They need to learn typing, proper sentence structure, APA formatting, etc. That can be done just as well within Google Docs as it can within Word.  0 1 day ago Reply VOMoreira I personally feel word is better, but that's what I grew up with. The issue isn't that word is better, the issue is that they are using software that is not at industry standards. So when they go to the work force, they won't have the knowledge to use company software (in today's industry it being MS office). 2 1 day ago Reply Tom Westrick So, my school used Windows XP and Office 2003. When I got to the working world, my company used Windows 7 and Office 2007 - now Windows 2013. There's still a learning curve between the different versions of Office, and I still have to walk people through finding some feature because its location changed from a previous version of Office.  If someone can adjust to the layout of a new version of Office, they can adjust to Office coming from Google Apps.  1 1 day ago Reply VOMoreira That I do not know about. If you have enough faith that students can handle change, then so be it. But at the moment we have students who don't understand how the cloud works, or even save a file to a computer. Both of which I learned in high school. 3 1 day ago Reply RohanRonQM so true. some teens even young adults think bad WiFi connection or Cloud Storage problems happens because it's raining outside. .

It is much more functional than word, much better for collaboration and works any where. Office products stagnate innovation. Teachers use Windows because teachers struggle to change with the times. They prefer to stay in their comfort zone. I have been a teacher for 30 years, have used Microsoft since the beginning and then moved on to Google. The whole ecosystem is far superior to MS. It works and works well. The only changes to Office  over the last 10 years have been minor and superficial. Kids brought up on G Suite have no problem transitioning to Office because they are adaptable. Office users are very rigid in their thinking and to be truthful rather dated -4 1 day ago Reply VOMoreira You clearly haven't used the recent office as microsoft has collaboration as well. They updated and have added online word, excel that allows multiple users to edit the same document (just like Google). I have tried to use Google docs as I often have to explain it to students. 2 1 day ago Reply RohanRonQM I can agree with you on Office XP till Office 2010, but the newest Office 365 version is so much better and more adaptable to how you want it. 2 1 day ago Reply DragonPoo Really?  A lot of the teachers I know have Macs through their school, not Windows.  Must depend on the district. I agree about Word versus anything else, though. 0 1 day ago Reply RohanRonQM Google Suite (Gmail, Drive, Google Docs) is cheaper per user than Microsoft Azure (Office 365+OneDrive+Outlook). Last time I looked in 2014 the pricing was: Google = $9 per user per month MSFT = $12 per user per month Apple = $8 per user per month (but limited to only Apple devices so no company/school chooses this) 0 1 day ago Reply Drael646464 We'll have to see what MS offers schools. MS often operates as a charity, and I expect they will see the humanitarian side of this. I'd put money on them creating a special deal for schools.  0 21 hours ago Reply ozaz Is there any evidence that inking is beneficial from a learning point of view? Its a nice idea (and gives a good marketing story) but if it comes at added expense perhaps schools should be wary of spending extra money on devices with inking support, especially after so many wasted money on ill-considered iPads. At least until there is evidence of benefit. 0 23 hours ago Reply Curtis Quick You're kidding right? I guess you never thought that a student could take notes with a pen. It is so much easier to handwrite notes and the ability to add diagrams and drawings is phenominal! A Windows 2-1 device and OneNote will draw circles around a Chromebook any day. Chromebook is last century in comparison. Teachers can share their lecture notes with students. Students can share notes with oneanother - all without ever needing to use a keyboard! Every subject benefits from easy pen input. Science, Math, History, Art. Everywhere you have more than just words a pen is a great idea. Try drawing a diagram for physics with a keyboard. Or doing math problems. Or Art. You will quickly understand what I mean. Modern versions of Windows on 2-in-1 devices are exactly what students need in the classroom. They provide almost every conceivable manner of input that a student might need and they do it well. The only thing Chromebooks had going for it was cost, setup and a strong ABM (anything but Microsoft) attitude. Modern Windows 2-in-1 devices can do both and so much more. Schools were burned by iPads, and when they see how much more they can do with Windows 2-in-1 devices than Chromebooks it will be like the iPad all over again. 3 22 hours ago Reply ozaz I didn't ask what the idea behind it is. I asked if there is any evidence that it actually benefits learning. The idea is obvious but just because something sounds appealing in theory does not mean it is actually beneficial in practice. If there have been any convincing studies that show learning is enhanced by student use of a stylus equipped computing device (compared to just traditional pen and notebook for notetaking) please link me to them.  If they don't yet exist, I would question the wisdom of schools investmenting in stylus-equipped devices for students just because they sound good in theory. Stylus-equipped devices for teachers is a different issue, and would presumably make much less of a contribution to overall expenditure anyway. 1 20 hours ago Reply Drael646464 It allows you to take your own notes, adding notes to web pages, documents, etc. If notation and note taking is considered useful, which of course it is, then ink is useful. I think the price difference, will be trivial. Adding acrive stylus support to a display doesn't cost a lot for a manufacturer. We are talking sort of 20 bucks here.  2 21 hours ago Reply ozaz $20 to the manufacturer, but what about the added cost to the schools, factoring in inevitable regular loss and damage to styluses? Surely more than the cost of pen and paper. Hence my question above as to whether there is evidence it provides added learning benefit over notetaking via pen and paper. 0 20 hours ago Reply Drael646464 Well, windows cloud, I imagine a free license product running on the cheaper ARM chipsets, will be basically the same cost as a chromebook. It'll be cheap. Windows has touch capability, stylus capability, and Ink. It also has the ability to upgrade to full windows 10.  0 21 hours ago Reply toph36 "Windows 10 S"?  That would be just as confusing as Windows RT.  I hope they keep Cloud in the name, even though that is not exactly what this is.  Although "Cloud" is more of a concept, so it does make sense to use here. 2 1 day ago Reply Azizelh To be honest, we thought Edge was a bad name for the browser, specially compared to Spartan. But we got used to it quick. 6 1 day ago Reply RohanRonQM I still call it Project Spartan 0 1 day ago Reply Jezza Yes, but the average consumer might not adopt it in the same way as those who regularly stay on top of Windows news. Personally, I think the S doesn't signify anything if it isn't marketed very well, people might think it stands for something like 'Speed' or 'Special'. If they called it 'Lite' or 'Education' it would at least get the point across in some respects. 3 1 day ago Reply Hirox K Maybe win10 lite? (i know, i know, 0 creativity...

I think "clould" is a fine name, but not for an OS that is in no way clud based or even tied to the cloud. I think for once MS should pick a clear, meaning name. Perhaps Windows 10 Secure == W10S. I think this is the intent of being locked to teh store. As I recall enterprises, or schools, are allowed to curate their own store apps. 0 1 day ago Reply SuperMarioPlayer The problem with the proposed name "Windows 10 Secure" is that Microsoft already claims that Windows 10 is the most secure version of Windows to date (which it probably is.) Windows 10 for Classrooms might be be better since it's obviously for use in classrooms and stuff, but I don't know. 1 1 day ago Reply Chris Stevens1 That all true. I do not think School (S) or Classroom (C) are great because this sort of OS, while being annouced fro education would also be good elsewhere. Other used kiosks, compuiters in public places, like libraries, government office public areas, etc. Also this OS would be approporite for many business users. Possible optiona are. Currated (C), Kiosk (K) or Public (P). I nt does not matter to me.

But the numbers, to me, show that Microsoft's strategy of "US only" or "US first" is as wrong as it gets. Yes, the growth of ChromeOS in the USA may be worrisome to Redmond BUT the USA is just ONE country in 196. In 195 countries, Chromebooks are absolutely irrelevant. Now you may say "well, that's why they should focus on the US". But that's, to me, the wrong strategy. They hold a large margin worldwide but if they continue to treat the US as special and focusing all their offerings and services only on the US, all that Google or any other competitor needs to do is to open those same types of services to people in the other 195 countries. We can take a couple of examples from history: - Microsoft has always treated Europe as a second-rate (or third, or fourth) market for the Xbox (and most other things, really). As a result, Sony's PlayStation rules in Europe with over 70% marketshare (in some countries over 90%). They've sold over 22 million consoles in Europe. Xbox? Less than 8 million. - Nokia's Eflop years saw the company leave their European/Asian focus and move it to the US. Because "Europe was guaranteed". As a result, sales in Europe continuously declined without the US market growth making up for it. - Sony's Xperia phones, at the same time, saw great growth in the European market because Sony made an effort instead of bothering with focusing in just one country (the US). When Sony decided to change that - around the time of the Xperia Z4 - and start trying to focus in the US market alone, sales of Xperia devices started to come down.   So whilst it's important that Microsoft shows aggressiveness in the US market to combat the Chromebook infestation that has installed itself on Uncle Sam's lands, it will be a major flaw if they limit the efforts to the USA. In Europe and other Western or Westernised markets, if Microsoft doesn't make an effort to show some parity of treatment with the US, they risk Google or someone else to come along and show that parity. And then they'll not only risk not gaining back anything in the US, they'll be losing market in those other countries. It's also worth noting that the educational system in Europe and Western markets is far better than the American and more likely to adopt new technologies to tackle on new educational challenges. Microsoft simply can't let that pass and not take the chance. 13 1 day ago Reply Azizelh Simple... The focus on the US is not because of the US. It's because schools here offer items to their students and are ready to pay some money for that. None of the schools I personally know in France for example offer them to students. They have some in dedicated rooms and the libraries, but none in class. Pretty sure it's the same or close in other countries. Reason is schools and tuitions are too cheap in most European countries to allow for these expenses. Most of the time of course. Im sure some school can offer them, just MUCH less than US. 3 1 day ago Reply Hoekie Over here we do. So that can't be the reason. Also deals for pure personal use. It's the US being cheap.

From the graphs above, there's not enough information to know. If what you said is right, @Azizelh, then you would expect global figures to track much more based on the US figures, simply because the US budget would dominate. On the other hand, if the total global numbers appeared similar to the "rest of the world" half of the graph, then @DJCBS would be right. 0 1 day ago Reply spazinvader To me, the time is already late.

So let's establish something, schools are enterprise.  You try managing thousands of these devices in the hands of children, it is a nightmare.  Apple's management utilities left a lot to be desired whereas Google knocked it out of the park with Chromebooks.  Chromebooks have significant advantages over Windows, OS X and iOS in the eyes of school IT decision makers: They are ridiculously inexpensive per unit.  You can buy 2 chromebooks for the cost of 1 iPad or PC. Hardware support warranties are inexpensive per unit. Management is all in Google's cloud and it is incredibly easy to maintain, control, distribute apps, secure and lock down these machines.  It is also low to almost no cost for the Chromebook management tools.  Most schools decided to focus their engineering time on faculty/staff machines that require more advanced workflows. Chromebooks are 100% integrated with Google Apps.  Google Apps is/was far more aligned with consumer needs and experiences than Office 365, so lots of people gravitate towards it because it feels less intimidating to them.   Lightweight, great battery life and are very reliable for teachers that have crafted their lesson plans around this piece of technology.  Consumers today expect more intuitive software and design that to them feels more natural.  What they get at work or school is just frustration, because they cannot reconcile the duality that this iPad at home works great, why can't my IT staff make it work this great here.  Chromebooks never had that problem, they are the same natural, simple experience both at home and at work or school. The consumerisation of IT is real, expectations have changed dramatically and has made the job of IT administrators harder everywhere. I see this new Microsoft device as the start of the great iPad and Chromebook purge, IF they can get the management right and work on their consumer experiences. Intune, Azure AD, Windows 10 and Office 365 together looks to be a winning combination for IT decision makers that is evolving every day.  I have already began moving in that direction at my school, it remains to be seen if other school IT decision makers will follow suit. 5 1 day ago Reply Tunde Fajimi Great insights jblank46!

Let me give you an example, you think this Cloud OS is a good idea, but basically its RT2.0.... fair enough, that is what you think.   But in the real world, in my experience at the enterprise level.... businesses have or want to strip not the Win32 stuff out but the UWP/Store from Windows 10.   So, I work with a medium size company that wants to deploy Win10 from Win7 which is virtualized and users use citrix.   Now do you want to know what those builds look like now in testing.... everything you write about in these articles are being stripped out... whether its the Store app, OneDrive, UWP, tablet mode, etc.   Windows without Win32 and open is kind of like Kate Upton without the rack, what's the point?   Windows with UWP might as well be a Chromebook, either way I doubt the consumer is going to come back in mass. What MS is doing is throwing a bunch a mud at the wall hoping the consumer is coming back, the problem is.... reality is much different.    0 1 day ago Reply MrElectrifyer There's 1 MAJOR advantage Chromebooks have in the Educational market that Windows 10 currently has nothing to match; NEVER need to reboot to update the OS. Chromebooks merely being the Chrome web browser on Windows means that to install security patches/updates, all that has to happen is the user closes the browser and the security updates are installed automatically without requiring ANY reboot. That is automatically and seamlessly done whenever a user logs out the system, and if a security patch didn't get the time to install prior to the chromebook going to sleep, that's easily and quickly done on next resume from sleep. So, literally 0 need for reboot to stay secure, literally 0 need for IT department keeping tabs on them for security reasons. Compare that to Windows 10 where when you wake it up from sleep, you'll be getting that stupid "Updating Windows, don't turn off your computer" message for several minutes, especailly when they've not been updated in a while due to them not being used in a classroom. Imagine getting that when you're about to write an online Exam (which is the only place where Chromebooks were used on my Campus, everything else is Windows). Unless an IT department is being paid to keep those Windows 10 Cloud Laptops up to date, or those Laptops never turn off (in which case they can do the restart when the user logs off and thinks they've put the Laptop to sleep), Windows 10 Cloud won't be able to remain secure, making them a security threat to the Campus. 0 1 day ago Reply Daniel Rubino Microsoft's policy is to not require a reboot for an update more than once every 4 weeks. I really don't see that as a big deal these days. Additionally, the Unified Update Platform (UUP) goes a long way to helping with this as well. 1 1 day ago Reply MrElectrifyer It's not much of a concern as a consumer, 'cause I'm only dealing with 1 PC (a Surface Pro 2 in my case), and I can easily take a moment to configure Windows Updates to match my workflow for the rest of my use of the Windows PC. No problem with that. In the case of a school campus, where there's 1000s of them - all of which don't get used for months until an Exam is coming up - it becomes a big concern in terms of both time and security. You'll need to pay an IT department to mange each and every one of those Windows Laptops/Convertibles, 'cause unlike Windows Desktops, they're not connected to a LAN 24/7, and thus can't be updated remotely. If you don't pay an IT department to do that, you risk having significant delays or interuptions when the Laptops are needed; during an online Exam. That's the major advantage Chromebooks have; savings in both IT department costs and time. With Chromebooks, any Teacher (regadless of background) could just grab a Laptop cart (contains about 50 Chomebooks I think) from some IT room (where the cart was plugged in charging the Laptops) at anytime of the year, bring it to the classroom, students simply unplug 1 of them and take to their desk, log-in, and can begin the exam (no waiting for any updates). Once they're done, they sign out, take the Laptop back to the cart and just plug in its power cable. To get the same with most of todays Windows Laptops, you'll need to be fussing with both power and ethernet cables for each and every one of those Laptops in some specialized cart, so that when in the IT room, they can be connected to the LAN and kept up to date remotely when not in use for months. That adds more room for human error, unless the campus pays some premium to get a custom Windows Laptop and Laptop cart that can get both power and ethernet over 1 connection. On top of that, would still need to pay an IT department to be keeping tabs on them remotely. None of which is a concern with Chromebooks.

Who knows how close MS is to achieving those targets? Incidentally, my 2-years-old Chromebook Flip cold boots in 7 seconds. So Chromebook numbers are a little skewed to lower the bar for MS. It's interesting though that MS is trying to re-invent the Chromebook, only it will cost more, be less secure, and be restricted to a much smaller and lower quality application pool. 1 1 day ago Reply Drael646464 Cost more? Why would it cost more? It's using the same chipsets, the same type of hardware, and likely a free license.  Personally I wouldn't say that's better app quality, when the app pool (android apps) isn't even designed for the FF, and they are more geared to social networking and bus stop games than education. Chrome apps themselves number a paltry 10,000. Admitedly for the education sector, windows might have a small catch up, but its not exactly huge, nor are education apps demanding functionality. For the most part people use web browsers, and word processors.  The whole point of difference for Windows could is - its touch enabled, its ink and stylus enabled and its fully upgradable to full windows. Which makes chromebook seem kind of sad by comparison IMO, as an educational tool.  0 22 hours ago Reply Aden Rossinni Yes, but they don't do much so ... 0 1 day ago Reply vEEP pEEP Get'em while they are young...

Thats basically MS whole strategy this year - affordable, long battery life cellular larger screen devices. And its a damn good play, because it will get the UWP developer engine grinding.  0 22 hours ago Reply Aden Rossinni I've heard of many schools here in Australia wanting to drop the Chromebooks because they either didn't realise that they couldn't do **** or realised later in using them. They are just gimmicks, and have already been swapped for Surface Pros in some places, so what MS is doing is perfect in this situation. 3 1 day ago Reply yac man please quote your sources ( otherwise untrue / did not happen / fake news ).   0 1 day ago Reply Drael646464 sd 0 22 hours ago Reply Drael646464 As importantly, the tablet market where windows on arm is targeted, is a sector where only windows and budget are growing amonst consumers. By making a budget hybrid, perhaps something like the transformer book, windows can be positioned in BOTH of the growth sectors of tablets, when both samsung and apple have been slipping for four years. a serious foothold in tablets will drive UWP development, as will any substantial sales of a cloudbook. Re-positioning Windows to re-enter the fray for pocket cellular devices.  So this year, I expect not simple a surface pro, but a budget model. I'm hoping with a transformer book design, so it can be also more laptop like. And without the ridiculous screen sizes - perhaps a happy 10.1 inches, or even apple like 9.7. I expect this is why the rumours on surface suggest both arm, and intel - it'll be both.  Basically its the whole budget thing that is MS's entire pathway back to market dominance, in particular larger touchscreen devices. And that's also the point of difference for a cloud book - its touch enabled, its stylus enabled (as you say, a rotatable design would suit education best). If windows can make gains on bigger screen touch devices, that breathes life into UWP. And you can see the push for UWP in all of MS's recent moves - the option to lock windows down to store only, the cloud device, and the cheaper arm devices. THIS is how they are tackling the app gap - by fighting in an area where they have strenth - bigger screens.   0 22 hours ago Reply r4incs So MS is playing catch-up once again? It turned out really well last time (looks at Windows Phone/Mobile). 0 21 hours ago Reply bleached This article doesn't mention exactly where schools are saving money with Chromebooks. I don't think it is cost of the hardware. It is likely cost of supporting and managing Windows machines. There are plenty of low cost Windows machine as available today, but they are not easy for a school with limited resources to deploy. Microsoft needs to further simplify Windows and match the services available on Chromebooks. We will hear how Microsoft will handle this, but it seems they are being short sighted. 1 13 hours ago Reply Nect removed 0 10 hours ago Reply Michael Alan Goff So, serious question, has Microsoft cleared the gap in maintenance/management between Windows and Chrome OS? 0 2 hours ago Reply Sin Ogaris I wouldn't exactly say this is the right time, pc's and tablets are already well and truly engraved in the education sector. 0 1 hour ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

The device was developed with input from the community, and funded through an Indiegogo campaign in November, which reached its target in just one hour. Originally aiming for $75,000, the company has since raised over $1.4 million. Previously referred to by its development codename 'Pyramid Flipper', the device will launch as the Eve V, featuring a range of desirable specs and features. The Indiegogo campaign originally estimated that shipments would begin in February, but that schedule has clearly slipped. However, the company said that it will begin its "first pilot production run at the actual factory floor on 25th of April" to ensure that its production process runs smoothly, before ramping up for larger-scale assembly. Eve explained that "this stage will take us around 10 days and then assembly of the remaining units will take 2-3 days more after which they will be immediately shipped", adding: We will start production of second batch of units immediately after first batch is produced. Second batch production is as before planned to be done in 30 days. We are considering splitting up production runs for the 2nd batch so like producing 500 devices first and shipping them 2 weeks after the first batch, making 500 more and shipping them few days later and so on before all 2000 devices are produced. This would help us to ship part of the limited birds faster than in 30 days! The exact timeline of the second batch will become clear after the first batch is produced. Eve also said that "each screen will be calibrated individually" in partnership with US firm Portrait Displays, "to make sure each and every V leaving [the] factory floor will follow our color calibration requirements." The Eve V is similar in concept to Microsoft's Surface Pro 4, with a tablet form factor and retractable kickstand, along with a detachable keyboard. But the Eve device offers some even more attractive features than the Surface, including a wireless mode for the keyboard, so that it can be used without being directly connected to the tablet; USB 3.1 Type-C ports; and Intel's latest 7th-generation (Kaby Lake) processors. Here's an overview of the Eve V's key specs: 12.3-inch IGZO LCD with 2736x1824px resolution and Corning Gorilla Glass 7th-generation (Kaby Lake) Intel Core m3, i5 or i7 processor 8GB or 16GB LPDDR3 RAM 128GB, 256GB or 512GB SSD storage 2MP front-facing camera 5MP rear camera 802.11ac Wi-Fi with 2x2 MU-MIMO Bluetooth 4.2 1 x USB 3.1 Type-C port with Thunderbolt 3 support 1 x USB 3.1 Type-C port (Gen1) 2 x USB 3.1 Type-A port 3.5mm audio port microSDXC card reader 2 x noise-cancelling microphones 4 x 1W speakers Fingerprint sensor, hall sensor, gravity sensor, light sensor, gyroscope GPS N-trig stylus (Surface-compatible) with two buttons, and 1024 pressure levels Keyboard with Pogo-pin connectors and wireless connectivity; backlight; glass Clickpad by Synaptics Up to 15 hours of battery life 'Early bird' pricing for the Eve V has now ended, so full pricing will apply for future sales. You can find details of the cost and configurations for each model here. The company's CEO, Konstantinos Karatsevidis, referred to the Eve V, with tongue-in-cheek, as a 'Surface-killer' in an interview with Neowin last year. Microsoft is likely to launch its new Surface Pro 5 in the next few weeks, but the device is not expected to differ significantly from its predecessor, featuring a similar design to the Pro 4, along with new Kaby Lake processors.

Those lucky — and wealthy — enough could do so in an outfit from H&M’s Coachella collection and end their night in an air-conditioned safari tent designed by Marriott.

(Photo by Kevin Sullivan, Orange County Register/SCNG) Show Caption of Expand Coachella, once an indie darling, used to bury sponsors on its website, but this year, the festival’s corporate partners all have an experience to sell and a logo to slap on it. Some offered ways to interact with their brands without an obvious sales pitch, while others used the three-day festival to promote new products and special offers. The experiences offered in 2017 included drone shows, a psychedelic journey through space, a makeup counter and an opportunity to get a selfie in fake snow. Studies have found millennials — the demographic buying up tickets to the sold-out festival — are more prone to FOMO, or the “fear of missing out,” making them more likely to form connections to brands that allow them to share unique interactions with their envious friends at home. Ticket seller Eventbrite found that more than 78 percent of millennials would rather spend their money on events than on products and more than 77 percent tied their “best memories” to a live experience in a 2014 nationwide survey of more than 2,000 adults. “We’re living in an era where a lot of people are paying for an experience,” said Jeff Fromm, a partner at the Kansas City, Missouri-based ad agency Barkley and author of “Marketing to Millennials.” “And brands are looking to integrate with those people who have discretionary money.” It’s not necessarily a bad thing either, Fromm said, as long as the sponsorship doesn’t take away from Coachella’s charm. Guests at Coachella seemed to agree, with some of the sponsored “experiences” this year getting praise from the people who paid at least $399 per ticket. Coachella is a “bucket list experience” and consumers looking to check it off the list aren’t likely to be deterred by sponsorships, overt or otherwise, Fromm said. Netflix, Heineken and H&M all showed up at Coachella. Netflix offered free WiFi to promote its new series “Girlboss;” Heineken, a longtime sponsor, brought in surprise guests; and H&M as it has in recent years sponsored a fashion line in the spirit of the music festival. Computer company HP Inc. had one of the largest presences at Coachella this year, but fans seemed to view most of their offerings favorably. HP hosted a lounge with virtual reality, a light show controlled by fans using the latest HP computers, and a machine to create custom bandannas. Along with Intel, the tech company also backed a synchronized drone performance with hundreds of the aerial robots that circulated on social media as one of the better moments of Coachella’s first weekend. The Antarctic, a massive dome sponsored by Intel and HP near Coachella’s main entrances, similarly drew praise. The 15-minute show gave fans a chance to relax in beanbag chairs in the air-conditioned dome while watching a trippy 360-degree video that first starts in the desert and then flies through space, time and the human brain. HP partnered with visual artists Android Jones and Eric Pare to create the immersive installation, according to the company. “They’re not really in your face trying to sell you stuff,”  said Amy Kirkpatrick, of Irvine, as she exited the dome with Mitch Franco, of Santa Ana. “We’re not running out to buy HP printers or computers or anything.” Kirkpatrick said they had not noticed the HP logo until the very end and weren’t aware of the other companies’ booths throughout the polo field, many of which were tucked away from the main stages. Marriott and American Express were among those offering special tents for members of their rewards’ programs and the general public. American Express created a lounge for fans to create mini-music videos at Coachella, and outside the venue they offered an exclusive party for Platinum cardholders in Palm Springs. At Marriott, guests could pose for pictures on four stages set up to look like locales around the world, from the beach to an arctic tundra complete with fake snow for snow angels. Rewards members got access to a VIP area with unique food and drink vendors and a chance to bid on eight safari tents themed after Marriott’s various hotel chains. Actress Vanessa Hudgens tweeted out a picture in front of one of the tents during the first weekend as part of a brand partnership with Le Meridien Hotels, one of Marriott’s chains. Fromm said arrangements like the one with Hudgens are helping to reach younger generations. “Millennials are less likely to accept company points of view than prior generations and more likely to accept non-traditional forms of communications,” he said. Some of the experiences were only for the festival’s most wealthy clientele. VIPs could get rides to the event in a Coachella-themed BMWi, worth $142,000, and the company set up displays within the VIP areas as part of its #roadtocoachella campaign. The walls of the tent were papered in photos of BMWs near the wind farms that are the gateway to the Coachella Valley. The special tent had couches for lounging, phone-charging lockers and a display that showed promotional videos created for Coachella, including one with Sunday night performer and film composer Hans Zimmer. However, you couldn’t test drive a car on-site, unlike the Stagecoach Country Music Festival, which allows people to test out Toyota trucks on an off-road course. Eight-year Coachella veteran Andy Zepeda said he’s noticed the amount of corporations visible at Coachella increase every year, but it hasn’t reached a level where it bothers him, yet. “As long as it is giving me something new to experience, I don’t really mind it as long as it not getting in my way,” he said. The sponsors this year offered either experiences that gave him more to do, or they offered free merchandise, like bandannas, he noted. Fromm, the marketing expert, said Coachella fans should get used to the sponsorships, which help Goldenvoice, the promoter, expand the festival without increasing ticket prices or cutting into their revenues. In exchange for their support, the brands get a captive audience, he added. “I’m not surprised to see more of these events, and brands are looking for the opportunity to engage with consumers,” Fromm said. “It’s not going to get smaller; it’s going to get bigger.” More stories, photos from Coachella 2017: Photos: See all of the Coachella vibes from Weekend 2 What happened on Friday, Weekend 2 Coachella 2017: This is the cool, weird stuff you can buy in the festival’s Vintage Market See a couple’s Coachella proposal Radiohead conquers Coachella’s second weekend Photos of Radiohead from Weekend 2 Photos of the bands and their fans on Friday, Weekend 2 Meet the young kids rocking out at the festival How ‘Amnesty Boxes’ keep drugs out and festivalgoers safe Live updates from Weekend 2 17 things to know about opening weekend Photos: What it actually looks like to be at Coachella’s opening weekend Here’s how the first Friday at Coachella went down Photos of the bands and their fans on Friday, Weekend 1 Who wore it best (or worst)?

What’s even more impressive is the adoption rate. The speed of new tech taking over aspects of everyday life is blindingly fast. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is one of few providers of brains to all this tech. Fundamentally, a company as seasoned as INTC should have a rosy long-term future. It has a few competitors, but there is enough room for everyone to thrive. And the cost of entry is high enough so that there won’t be too many new entrants into the arena. Click to Enlarge Technically, INTC stock could be developing a massive bullish pattern that could bring new multi-decade highs … but it could take some time. The earnings release in a couple of weeks could spur a move, but those events for the short term are coin flips. The short-term reaction to earnings is more gambling than investing regardless of the quality of the report. From a price-earnings perspective INTC is not expensive. Furthermore the analyst expectations are also evenly distributed. So INTC stock is not set up for a big disappointment. Nevertheless, I am not a fan of buying Intel stock here and risking $36 per share hoping for a rally. Instead, I prefer selling risk below proven support and let time do the work and I can profit even if the stock stalls. The Bet: Sell the INTC Dec $31 naked put and collect 90 cents to open. In essence, I get paid for a chance to own Intel stock at a 15% discount from current levels. If it falls below $31, I would be put the stock and accrue losses below $30.10 per share. Selling naked puts is dangerous and I only do it if I am willing and able to own the stock at that price so it can be daunting. To render the risk more time, I can change the bet to a sold credit put spread instead. This way my maximum risk will be finite and still earn a respectable yield. The Alternate: Sell INTC $31/$30 credit put spread. Both trades have about the same theoretical 85% chance of success but this one is hedged where as the sold naked put is not. If successful the spread will yield 20% reward on risk. Learn options as easy as 1-2-3 in a personal 1on1 webinar here. Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

Yet, nearly two years following its release, the device is still a sales juggernaut. It is almost single handily propping up Microsoft’s in-house hardware line-up. PC makers, having missed on out the Windows 2-in-1 craze prior to the Surface Pro 4’s launch, have created dozens of Surface Pro 4 alternatives. There are plenty of reasons to buy the Surface Pro 4, though it’s not hard to find some pretty good reasons to not buy it too. Before building the Surface Pro line, Microsoft had never tried to make a PC of its own. Instead, it relied on its partners. That reliance got the company nowhere though. HP and a few others only dabbled with the concept. By the time the iPad arrived, Windows PC makers were too focused on miniature notebooks that didn’t offer a great experience. The iPad offered an easy way to navigate it, tons of apps, great looking hardware and fantastic battery life. The are good reasons to buy and not buy the Surface Pro 4. Then Surface Pro 4 was made to deliver that same experience for Windows 10 users. The tablet market would never be the same. Read: Surface Pro 4 Review: The Best There Is What is the Surface Pro 4? Surface Pro 4 is Microsoft’s Windows 2-in-1 vision brought to life. Its thin body and 12.3-inch display guarantee that it’s often mistaken for a regular tablet, which its design does mimic. It has the internals of a laptop PC, though. You can rely on the apps from the Windows Store or download the same powerful programs that you’ve always relied on. Microsoft isn’t limiting the things you can install on this device. Read: iPad Pro Review: Why I Returned the New iPad The Pro 4 offers a bit of variety. You can’t get it with different screen sizes, but you can decide how much or how little power you need. The $799 model is the cheapest and the least powerful of all versions. It includes an Intel Core m3 processor. Its most powerful variant is the $1,699 model with Intel Core i7 processor. You can buy either of these machines and some of the models in between at Best Buy, Staples and more. Read: 12 Surface Pro 4 Tips for New Owners Whether you should buy the Surface Pro 4 or not heavily depends on what you need your PC to be. Here are some reasons you should and shouldn’t purchase Microsoft’s alternative to the iPad Pro. Reasons to Buy a Surface Pro 4 Surface Pro 4 Accessories & Kickstand Are Excellent Cheaper Surface Pro 4s Have Arrived, Sort Of Reasons to Not Buy a Surface Pro 4 It Doesn’t Have USB 3.0 Type-C or LTE There Are Modestly Priced Surface Pro 4 Alternatives Surface Pro 4 Accessories Are Still Expensive Surface Pro 4 Doesn't Have USB 3.0 Type-C or LTE   1 / 5  Lots of things in computing remain the same. We’re always looking for more power and more battery life. The Surface Pro 4 is a great computer that’s starting to show its age. It made its debut in October 2015. It’s seen no meaningful updates since then. Read: Surface Pro 5 Release Date, Rumors & More Since the Pro 4’s launch, USB Type-C ports that allow you to charge and connect to tons of accessories with a single cable have arrived. They’re in our high-end phones and coming to tablets and laptops. The Surface Pro 4 has just a single USB 3.0 port. It’s full-size and not capable of the transfer speeds new USB Type-C ports with Thunderbolt 3 technology are capable of. Constant data connectivity is another thing that we’re all starting to expect from mobile devices. The Surface Pro 4 is missing it, despite every other notebook or tablet in its price range offering models that can be added to a smartphone plan. Having mobile data support inside the Surface Pro 4 would save you from hunting around for wireless internet connections in public. All Surface Pro 4s have Wi-Fi, but not cellular data. If you’re looking for that, definitely look into the iPad Pro or other Windows 2-in-1s.   1 / 5 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

Call of Duty WW2 Release Date, Private Beta, Co-op Revealed Share Tweet by Al McCarthy | @FanboyAttack | on April 22, 2017 With a world wide reveal for Call of Duty WW2 imminent, marketing materials have apparently started to hit retailers readying for pre-orders of the game.  Some of which Charlie Intel has gotten their hands on that give us some new information about the next COD game in regards to its release date and private beta. According to the marketing materials, Call of Duty World War 2 will release on November 3rd, 2017.  Ahead of that though, a private beta will be conducted for those that pre-order the game.  Further details include complete descriptions of the game, the campaign, multiplayer, and cooperative mode. The flyer mentions landing in Normandy on D-day, and battling across iconic locations across Europe.  As far as the Call of Duty series has come in terms of visuals over the last decade, and the highly cinematic nature of the games should lend to this being another great Call of Duty single player campaign in the World War 2 setting. Multiplayer has been confirmed in the material to be “grounded, fast-paced combat.”  But it also teases that there will be new social elements for Call of Duty: World War 2. Lastly, the flyer mentions a cooperative mode.  Whether that will be in the form of zombies, spec-ops, co-op campaign, or something else that we’ve yet to see in the series has yet to be revealed. No dates have been given for the private beta, it’s unclear if it will happen earlier in the year, more towards release, or if they will conduct both open and closed betas for the game.  Next week’s reveal should open the gates for pre-orders and we’ll likely get more details about this. Call of Duty: World War 2 will be revealed next week during a livestream on April 26th.  If you can’t wait for that, the first images for Call of Duty WW2 popped up on the web last night.

(AP Photo/Rockstar Games)   Dana Hull Bloomberg     In the race to the autonomous revolution, developers have realized there aren't enough hours in a day to clock the real-world miles needed to teach cars how to drive themselves. Which is why Grand Theft Auto V is in the mix. The blockbuster video game is one of the simulation platforms researchers and engineers increasingly rely on to test and train the machines being primed to take control of the family sedan. Companies from Ford Motor Co. to Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo may boast about putting no-hands models on the market in three years, but there's a lot still to learn about drilling algorithms in how to respond when, say, a mattress falls off a truck on the freeway. If automakers and tech enterprises want to make their deadline, they have to hurry up. The test cars tricked out with lasers, sensors and cameras being put through the paces on tracks and public roads can't do it on their own. Simulators never run out of gas -- and the ones at Waymo can model driving more than 3 million miles in a single day. "Just relying on data from the roads is not practical," said Davide Bacchet, who leads the simulation effort in San Jose, California, for Nio, a startup aiming to introduce an autonomous electric car in the U.S. in 2020. "With simulation, you can run the same scenario over and over again for infinite times, then test it again." As improbable as it may seem to the lay person, hyper-realistic video games are able to generate data that's very close to what artificial-intelligence agents can glean on the road. AI software has been playing around with games from Super Mario Bros. to Angry Birds for a while now, tackling problems in controlled environments and learning through trial and error. Last year, scientists from Darmstadt University of Technology in Germany and Intel Labs developed a way to pull visual information from Grand Theft Auto V. Now some researchers are deriving algorithms from GTAV software that's been tweaked for use in the burgeoning self-driving sector. The latest in the franchise from publisher Rockstar Games Inc. is just about as good as reality, with 262 types of vehicles, more than 1,000 different unpredictable pedestrians and animals, 14 weather conditions and countless bridges, traffic signals, tunnels and intersections. (The hoodlums, heists and accumulated corpses aren't crucial components.) The idea isn't that the highways and byways of the fictional city of Los Santos would ever be a substitute for bona fide asphalt. But the game "is the richest virtual environment that we could extract data from," said Alain Kornhauser, a Princeton University professor of operations research and financial engineering who advises the Princeton Autonomous Vehicle Engineering team. Waymo uses its simulators to create a confounding motoring situation for every variation engineers can think of: having three cars changing lanes at the same time at an assortment of speeds and directions, for instance. What's learned virtually is applied physically, and problems encountered on the road are studied in simulation. Quick Brown Fox Whenever a human has to grab the wheel of a test car because self-driving software hasn't responded properly, "we're able to play back the exact situation and predict via simulation what could have happened if the car had been left to drive itself," Waymo said in a self-driving project report. "If the simulator shows better driving is called for, our engineers can make refinements to the software, and run those changes in simulation in order to test the fixes." At Toyota Motor Corp.'s Toyota Research Institute in California, engineers try to "break the system" through what's known as the Quick Brown Fox test: running mile after mile in the most challenging weather and traffic conditions. For all the stupid mistakes motorists regularly make, the human brain is far superior to a computer in perceiving and reacting to the unexpected, from a pothole to a construction zone to a toddler chasing a ball into the street. That's the great challenge for all the companies competing to be first in the autonomous space: how to make onboard systems better than people at driving, and make driving safer. A looming question is what state and federal safety regulators will demand as proof an autonomous car should be given license to roam. Hundreds of billions of miles may have to be racked up, one way or another. The authorities will probably accept a combination of real and replicated, but rules spelling out requirements have yet to be written. Gill Pratt, chief executive officer of the Toyota institute, told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee in February that simulation should "be an acceptable equivalent to real-word testing," with follow-up validation. That's the road developers are increasingly traveling. -- -- -- With assistance from Ryan Beene and Jeremy Kahn Tweet This article filed under: Business Technology Bloomberg BizTech Newsletter Article Comments () Guidelines: Keep it civil and on topic; no profanity, vulgarity, slurs or personal attacks.

Peloton Drivers The Series B funding round was led by Omnitracs, but also featured investments from “Intel Capital, DENSO International America, BP Ventures, Lockheed Martin, Nokia Growth Partners, UPS Strategic Enterprise Fund, Volvo Group, Sand Hill Angels, Band of Angels and Birchmere Ventures along with new investors B37 Ventures, Mitsui USA, Okaya, Schlumberger, US Venture, and Breakthrough Fuel.” So, it was a pretty serious group of investors from the looks of it, most of which are involved intimately in the trucking sector in some fashion or other. The CEO and co-founder of the company, Josh Switkes, commented on this fact: “We are excited to be working with a growing group of leading companies from across the industry as well as forward-looking state and federal regulators to bring pragmatic, driver-assistive truck automation solutions to market. This new round of global strategic investment bolsters Peloton’s position as the leading provider of near-term automated truck technology in North America and soon beyond.” The press release provides more: “Peloton has raised a total of $78 million since inception. Series B funds will fuel Peloton’s growth plans, including the rollout of the world’s first commercial two-truck driver-assistive platooning system later in 2017, as well as development of more advanced automation solutions.” Thanks to the new funding, Peloton is reportedly planning to accelerate projects with several OEMs, including Volvo Trucks North America. As it stands, Peloton is planning to begin trialling its platooning technology with a number of US-based Fortune 500 fleets within the next year or so. Buy a cool T-shirt in the CleanTechnica store!

In filings with the SEC, Cloudera revealed revenues of $261 million for fiscal 2016, up 57 percent from $166 million the previous year. The company lost over $186 million in 2016, however, $203 million in 2015, and $135 million in 2014. Further, the company says in its Form S-1 that it expects net losses to continue “for the foreseeable future.” The filing lists competition from “legacy data management product providers” HP, IBM, Oracle, and Teradata, public cloud providers Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure, and open source companies Hortonworks and MapR. See also: How to Prepare your Infrastructure for the World of Big Data As other reports noted, the market cap for Cloudera could hurt one of its largest investors: Intel, whose investment in Cloudera totals over $1 billion since it was founded 2008, according to Crunchbase. According to Forbes, “in May 2014, Intel took a 22 percent stake in Cloudera — investing about $766 million at $30.92 a share — when the company was valued at $4 billion.” Intel and Cloudera jointly developed machine learning intelligence threat platform Apache Spot, which was announced in September. IPO valuations for tech companies lower than previous funding rounds, or “IPO down rounds,” have previously been identified as possible trend by TechCrunch, but are not necessarily major cause for market concern. Application performance management company AppDynamics was set for an IPO with the same share price range as Cloudera and a similar valuation in January before announcing its surprise sale to Cisco for $3.7 billion. Cloudera is expected to hold its IPO in the next several weeks on the New York Stock Exchange as “CLDR.” Previous Article Liquid Web Helps WordPress Customers Visualize Site Changes with New Tool Next Article IBM Sales Miss Shows Return to Growth Not Without Roadblocks View all Cloud Computing articles WHIR NewslettersSubscribe Now and Get Our Exclusive Report on "The Hosting Infrastructure Ecosystem" WHIR Daily Web Hosting Newsletter European Web Hosting Newsletter Email* Country* Please select United States United Kingdom Canada India Netherlands Australia South Africa France Germany Singapore Sweden Brazil -------------- Afghanistan Åland Islands Albania Algeria American Samoa Andorra Angola Anguilla Antarctica Antigua and Barbuda Argentina Armenia Aruba Australia Austria Azerbaijan Bahamas Bahrain Bangladesh Barbados Belarus Belgium Belize Benin Bermuda Bhutan Bolivia Bosnia and Herzegovina Botswana Bouvet Island Brazil Brit/Indian Ocean Terr.

Researchers have built a primitive microprocessor out of a two-dimensional material similar to graphene, the flexible conductive wonder material that some believe will revolutionize the design and manufacture of batteries, sensors and chips. With only 115 transistors, their processor isn't going to top any benchmark rankings, but it's "a first step towards the development of microprocessors based on 2D semiconductors," the researchers at Vienna University of Technology said in a paper published in the journal Nature this month. Two-dimensional materials have the benefit of flexibility, meaning that they can be incorporated more easily into wearable devices or connected sensors, and potentially making them less breakable: Picture a smartphone that bends rather than breaks if you drop it. Today's semiconductors and screens are already pretty thin, but they still rely on the three-dimensional physical properties of the materials they're made from in order to function. Bend a silicon wafer and it will crack. But 2D materials like graphene or the transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) used by the Vienna researchers, are truly two-dimensional, made with crystals just one layer of atoms or molecules thick, allowing them to flex. TMDs are compounds composed of a transition metal such as molybdenum or tungsten and a chalcogen (typically sulfur, selenium or tellurium, although oxygen is also a chalcogen). Like graphene, they form into layers, but unlike graphene which conducts electricity like a metal, they are semiconductors, which is great news for flexible chip designers. Stefan Wachter, Dmitry Polyushkin and Thomas Mueller of the Institute of Photonics, working with Ole Bethge of the Institute of Solid State Electronics in Vienna, decided to use molybdenum disulfide to build their microprocessor. They deposited two molecule-thick layers of it on a silicon substrate, etched with their circuit design and separated by a layer of aluminium oxide. "The substrate fulfills no other function than acting as a carrier medium and could thus be replaced by glass or any other material, including flexible substrates," they wrote. Recent Intel microprocessors act on data in 64-bit "words," can understand hundreds or even thousands of different instructions, depending on how you count them, and contain hundreds of millions of transistors. In contrast, the microprocessor built by the researchers is only capable of acting on data one bit at a time, using a set of just four instructions (NOP, LDA, AND and OR), and the circuit features used to build it are of the order of 2 micrometers across, 100 times larger than those found in the latest Intel and ARM processors. With more work, though, the microprocessor's complexity could be increased and its size reduced, the researchers said. They deliberately chose an overly large feature size for their manufacturing process to reduce the effects of holes, cracks and contamination in the molybdenum disulfide film and to make it easier to inspect the results with an optical microscope. "We do not see any roadblocks that could prevent the scaling of our 1-bit design to multi-bit data," they said, and only the challenge of lowering contact resistance stands in the way of sub-micrometer manufacturing. That's not to say it will be easy: Although the manufacturing yield for subunits was high, with around 80 percent of the arithmetic-logic units fully functional, their non-fault tolerant design meant only a few percent of finished devices worked properly. Commercial microprocessor manufacturers deal with yield problems by making their chip designs modular, and testing them at a variety of speeds. Chips that work at higher speed fetch higher prices, while faulty subcomponents can be permanently disabled and the resulting chips, otherwise fully functional, sold as lower-spec models. It's taken 46 years for Intel to get from the 4004, a four-bit central processor with 46 instructions, to the latest incarnation of the x86 architecture, Kaby Lake: With all that the industry has learned about micromanufacturing since then, progress with flexible semiconductors may be a little faster.         LATEST STORIES (8) Syrian Gov't Forces Capture Abu Qula Dam West of Palmyra Iraqi Forces Capture More Territories in Battle with ISIL in Western Mosul Iraqi Popular Forces Defuse Terrorist Attack amid Spiritual March Iraqi Forces Guarding Civilians While Providing Aid to People in Western Mosul Syrian Army Drives Terrorists out of Key Heights near Border with Lebanon Iraqi Air Force Conducts Air Assaults on Multiple ISIL Targets in Tal Afar ISIL Nears Defeat in Mosul as Iraqi Forces Liberate Several Neighborhoods Iran's IRGC Navy Receives New Cruise Missiles More Information about Iran Election 2017 Candidates Senior Commander: PMF Ready to Attack Tal Afar IRGC Navy Equipped with New Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles Russia Ready to Prioritize Air Defense Systems Deliveries to Syria First VP: Iran Welcomes Exchange of Electricity with Georgia, Russia, Armenia Official Underlines Iran's Self-Sufficiency in Building Fighter Jets' Simulators Iraqi Forces Recapture Neighborhood from ISIL in Western Mosul Syrian Gov't Forces Capture Abu Qula Dam West of Palmyra TEHRAN (FNA)- Syrian army forces captured Abu Qula dam from the ISIL terrorists and extended the security belt around Palmyra (Tadmur) city.

While your machine won't suddenly stop working, it does mean your Windows 7 or 8.1 install won't benefit from the latest updates. Fortunately, a simple workaround is now available. As predicted, an enterprising coder by the handle "zeffy" dived into Windows' internals and discovered where and how Microsoft performs the check. He or she explored a number of avenues and came up with two options to "fix" the problem. Both involved edits to a file called "wuaueng.dll", with one appearing to be an "internal testing feature used by Microsoft" and "could be removed in future updates", ruling it out in zeffy's mind. The second choice requires a "simple 1-byte change" and is the path the coder went with. The result is a patch anyone can apply to their Windows 7 or 8.1 installation. Of course, the patch comes with some caveats: You have to apply a new patch whenever wuaueng.dll gets updated. SFC scan errors will most likely occur as it will believe the integrity of the system has been compromised. If you can live with these, the patch is available from zeffy's GitHub repository. [GitHub, via DSO Gaming] WATCH MORE: Tech News Comments skrybe @skrybe Apr 22, 2017, 12:32pm I still think MS disabling updates is a terrible idea considering the OSes are still in extended or even mainstream support. Fair enough to dump Vista and XP, but 7 and especially 8(.1) are new enough they *should* be getting updates. Why announce support windows if you're not going to honour them? Reply 0 Steve F. Guest Apr 22, 2017, 1:45pm Because Microsoft, as an arm of the US intelligence services, wants every PC on earth to be running Windows 10 so they can spy on everything you do. Simples. Reply 0 soldant @soldant Apr 22, 2017, 1:45pm Windows 7 was released in 2009, so I think it's fine to move on from that OS, it's been long enough for people who will be using newer hardware to upgrade. Remember back in the 90s we were upgrading our OS every few years, it wasn't until Windows XP and its unexpected lifespan that people stopped. Now MS are back on track with their regular upgrades. I'd rather we have people using modern operating systems and focus on improving them rather than extended legacy support. Reply 0 grim @grim Apr 22, 2017, 3:39pm something something... OS doesn't respect user... something something Reply 0 skrybe @skrybe Apr 22, 2017, 6:20pm From Microsoft themselves: https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet As I mentioned they're in either extended support (Win 7) or mainstream support windows 8. Possibly you could argue that Windows 7 doesn't get the new CPU support since it's out of mainstream support. But windows 8(.1) absolutely should be getting updates that support the latest CPUs. @djbear: It's not just Rizen they won't support new Intel CPUs aren't planned to be supported either. And no it doesn't make sense, at least not for windows 8(.1) Support should include support for newer CPUs at least until the end of Mainstream support. Reply 0 djbear @djbear Apr 22, 2017, 9:43pm It could be and im guessing here support for previous CPU's is baked into the OS and they dont think its worth the time and effort to update the OS to support such a small subset of the population Reply 0 grim @grim Apr 23, 2017, 12:38pm I have a comment history with @soldant regarding windows (proprietary, no control by the user) vs Linux (controlled by users for users). That's all that I was referencing Reply 0 djbear @djbear Apr 22, 2017, 5:13pm They aren't stopping support just because it's an old operating system. They are stopping updates because 7 and 8.1 do not support rizen. Rizen owners more than likely make up an insignificant amount of users on 7 and 8.1. makes sense Microsoft does not support rizen owners on old operating systems. rizen is fully supported on 10.

By Paul Acevedo Saturday, Apr 22, 2017 at 3:00 pm EDT 13 Comments Welcome to another installment of Steam Spotlight, our weekly look at interesting Steam games for your Windows PC. Free to play games come in all shapes and sizes, but Heavy Metal Machines stands out as a top-down car combat game. Players select from gnarly road machines and then enter an arena for a team-based carpocalypse. Heavy Metal Machines is free to play and currently in Early Access. Read on for detailed impressions and your chance to win a valuable booster pack! See on Steam Car combat made simple Heavy Metal Machines begins with a quick tutorial that teaches the rules of the road. No need to worry about acceleration and breaking here. You just jam the analog stick of an Xbox controller or point the mouse in the direction you want to drive, and you're off. Holding a button puts your ride in reverse, though I find it largely unnecessary during the heat of battle. Each of Heavy Metal Machine's vehicles (13 available now, with more on the way) has two regular weapons and one special weapon. You can use regular weapons as much as you want, but they have a cooldown timer (indicated in the lower-left corner of the screen). My vehicle of choice, Wildfire, comes with a rapid-fire ring of fire that damages anyone unlucky enough to be close to it; and a long-range reflective shot. The long-range shot's cooldown is lengthy, but the ring of fire makes up for it. Special attacks take time to charge up – almost the entire length of the round. Once the meter fills, you can unleash it and bring serious pain to your foes. Wildfire's special fires a nuclear blast in a wide radius around her. Anyone who gets killed during battle will respawn at their base a short time later. The money earned from kills can be spent on upgrades at any time. Each weapon has four upgrades to choose from, although you can only buy two in order to keep their power in check. General upgrades and special weapon upgrades are available as well. These upgrades last for the duration of the match, much like the upgrades in a MOBA. Game types Heavy Metal Machines is exclusively a free online multiplayer game, so no driving solo here. It currently offers two modes of play, with Ranked, Custom Lobbies, and Spectator modes planned for the future. Practice is the primary game mode, with super short wait times (less than half a minute in my experience). The other mode has crazy wait times of fifteen+ minutes. Developer Hoplon really needs to provide some incentive to choose Play over Practice, as there isn't any right now. Practice is a four-versus-four game in which each team tries to capture a single bomb and deliver it to the other team's base. Getting it there won't be easy, as the arena has yellow walls that everyone else but the bomb carrier can pass through, as well as red zones that make you drop the bomb if touched. The enemy team will naturally gang up on the bomb carrier, so everyone else has to surround and protect him or her. It's a fun dynamic, and I enjoy going for kills even when I don't have the bomb. Deliver that bomb, and your team will score a point, ending the round. The match lasts until one team has three points. This can take as few as 10 minutes or as many as 30, depending on whether the other side wins some rounds or not. Completing games get you experience for not only your overall profile, but also the vehicle used. Leveling up vehicles unlocks new skins for them, whereas the overall level doesn't seem to have a benefit right now other than assisting with matchmaking. System requirements and controls One big feather in Heavy Metal Machines' cap is its low system requirements. Thanks to the top-down view (rather than a traditional 3D view), the game doesn't need beefy hardware to run. In fact, it runs on machines with Intel Integrated Graphics (HD 4000) and 4GB of RAM – good news for Ultrabook owners. Heavy Metal Machines can be played with either mouse and keyboard or Xbox controller. If playing with mouse and keyboard, the mouse steers the vehicle, which might be off-putting for people used to more direct control in racing games. Hence a controller is really the way to go. The only thing is, the menus don't support controllers at all. You can use one during matches, as long as you've gone into the options menu and selected controller (it won't just detect and let you use it). But we should really be able to play entirely with a controller rather than switching to the mouse for menus. Controller support for menus can't be too much work for the developers, so they should prioritize adding it. In-app purchases Since Heavy Metal Machines is a free to play game, it relies on in-app purchases for sustainability. These consist of premium currency (called cash here), booster packs (which bundle temporary boosters you can also buy with cash), and character packs. To unlock new characters/vehicles, you generally need to spend soft currency (gold) earned from matches or buy them faster with cash. One character only costs two or three bucks worth of currency, but most will require a $12.99 purchase (which also leaves you with some cash left over). Buying a character is a great way to support the developer, although it's hard to know whether you'll like one before buying. Hoplon probably needs to add a few more ways to spend money if they want to keep established players making purchases over time. Current impression Heavy Metal Machines is currently in Early Access, so we can't give it a final impression or full review. The game has a long way to go, as it only offers one mode and one map/track to play at the moment, and controller support for menus needs to happen. But the core gameplay is genuinely fun – way more so than I expected it to be. If you enjoy car combat games, this one's definitely worth a try. The current scarcity of content might not keep players around too long, but it's still good for a few hours of battles. Hopefully, Hoplon will keep the updates coming frequently because Heavy Metal Machines just needs to grow a bit before it can truly rock. Dare we hope for an Xbox version someday as well? Yes, we do.

The Samsung Chromebook Plus proves them wrong thanks to great hardware, a beautiful touchscreen and the S Pen. It also runs Android apps well. That’s why we listed it as one of the best Chromebooks of 2017. Students will love the Samsung Chromebook Plus because the S Pen, normally found only on the Galaxy Note phones and tablets, makes taking notes easy. Owners can read and write with less eye strain, thanks to the great screen. The Samsung Chromebook Plus feels small enough to carry from class to class and the battery lasts long enough to enjoy some entertainment back in the dorm later that night. These same reasons mean business users will enjoy taking it on the road and using it for work and play. In fact, most consumers will love the Chromebook Plus. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Touchscreen The 12.3-inch touchscreen on the Samsung Chromebook plus excels at almost every category of evaluation. It’s bright and comfortable to use even in bright settings. I used it at 50% most of the time, which also extends the already great battery life. The colors on the display look nice and the high-resolution displays text clearly with crisp sharp quality. It’s easy to read using the screen even for long times. Controlling the computer using touch in laptop mode feels more comfortable now that we’re getting used to touchscreens. I hate that my MacBook doesn’t let me scroll quickly with a flick of my finger on a touchscreen. Once you get used to the quick motion, you miss it on devices without one. We’ll look at the S Pen below. The palm rejection helps note takers and artists in the right apps. The system works so much better than my iPad Pro with Apple Pencil or any other active or passive stylus setup. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Hardware Design The computer looks almost like a square with 11.04″ x 8.72″ x 0.55″ dimensions. It’s not square, but looks it and that’s a good thing when using touch or the pen. the 3:2 aspect ratio seems more natural for a tablet. Samsung gave the Chromebook Plus an aluminum chassis. The textured surface on the lid and around the keyboard feels nice and looks great. It’s also super thin and sleek. The bezel around the display gives the user enough space to hold the computer in tablet mode. Its hinges give enough stability without making it hard to open and close. The combo headphone/mic audio jack sits on the back left edge closest to the screen. There’s also a USB-C 3.1 port next to that and a micro-SD card reader with a door that covers it. The right edge holds the S Pen silo closest to the screen. Next we get the second USB-C port, the power button and LED status light and volume up/down rocker buttons. Both USB-C ports will charge the computer. The 2-in-1 convertible design means you have the option of using the Chromebook as a traditional laptop plus tent mode as seen above or stand mode. Bend the screen back so that you can lay the keyboard facing down on a table and use just the screen with touch or the S Pen as seen below. Samsung Chromebook Plus: S Pen Keyboard and Trackpad The input devices on the Samsung Chromebook Plus mostly add to the devices quality. The S Pen works with the screen to create a great writing experience. We get the best palm rejection using apps that support it, like my favorite Android note-taking app Squid, formerly Papyrus.  Metamoji Note is another great Android note-taker. Other active digitizer pens let users rest their palms on the screen, but some of them don’t work as well as the S Pen on the Samsung Chromebook Plus. The S Pen supports pressure sensitivity and writes or draws smoothly. Slide it into the silo on the right side of the keyboard to stow it. Don’t worry. It can’t go in wrong, so you won’t damage it like the S Pen on the Samsung Galaxy Note 5. Speaking of older Samsung S Pens, I miss the buttons that give the user a right-click. The spacious and responsive trackpad sits below the keyboard and doesn’t get in the way. I didn’t accidentally touch it with my palm while typing. The keyboard feels a little mushy, but I got used to it quickly. Typing on it accurately isn’t difficult after getting used to the feel. It’s narrower than a typical keyboard, which also takes time to adjust to. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Performance and Battery Life The performance seems great. The computer scored 9159 on Octane, a useful benchmarking website. That’s a decent score when running the benchmark over a slow public Wi-Fi hotspot. Other computers that run on an Intel processor will smoke the Samsung Chromebook Plus. The ARM processor in the Samsung Chromebook Plus runs quickly compared to other ARM Chromebooks. It reboots in seconds and apps jump to fill the screen. Open a dozen tabs in Chrome before it really slows down. Even though the Chromebook generally runs quickly, it suffers one problem. Closing the lid and letting it sleep, then opening it often causes it to freeze and reboot within about 30 minutes. I’m not the only one with the problem. A Reddit thread includes a bunch of other owners with the same or similar issues. A few of those in the thread replaced their Chromebook and didn’t experience problems with their second machine. I fixed this problem with a total reinstall of the operating system. Look for a How To post on that very soon. Until then, use Google’s help site, which explains how to download ChromeOS onto a USB flash drive or card and then restore the OS using recovery mode. This forces a fresh install, which downloads the OS and reinstalls it from a flash drive or SD card. Since then, the freezes have gone away. The battery of the Samsung Chromebook Plus lasts longer than most. Notice in the screenshot above that with 85% battery life left, the OS estimates about 8:23 until it runs out of power. I’ve used the Chromebook for as long as 2 hours at a time and it typically drops by only 15% resulting in about 12-14 hours of use depending on usage and screen brightness. The screen stays at about 50%. Users may not want to use the Samsung Chromebook Plus for multimedia, like streaming music or viewing videos online, unless they plan to hook up headphones or external speakers. The downward facing speakers pump very little volume. In a moderately loud environment, you have to boost volume 100% to tell that sound is coming out. With decent external speakers, playing through an HDMI TV with good speakers or hooking up a nice set of headphones fixes the problem. That is how most people listen to audio on a laptop anyway. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Software ChromeOS powers the Samsung Chromebook Plus with a new addition: the Google Play Store and Android apps. Before Google added the Play Store, the Chromebook seemed so simple. Users can load Chrome Apps (see the Chrome Web Store above) that run in Chrome browser or a window that may not look like Chrome, but still is. If you want to reset the Chromebook, just run something called a Powerwash. This erases the Chromebook and reinstalls the operating system. You log back in with your Google account and within a few minutes all the apps and settings come to life. Adding Android apps makes this Powerwash process a little more complicated, especially if you run Android apps that need a lot of setting up or must download files to work, like my Bible apps. Google partially fixed the problem by automatically downloading most of the apps installed on the Chromebook before the Powerwash. In spite of the added complexity of Android apps, running a Chromebook got a lot more interesting after Google added the Play Store. I don’t install all the apps that I run on the Google Pixel XL. A lot of those apps do things that a user can do inside Chrome as well or better. However, a few of the best Android apps find a fitting home on ChromeOS. Microsoft doesn’t let users install the mobile Word, PowerPoint and Excel apps on any screen larger than 10-inches. That means no Android versions of these apps on my Chromebook. You have to run the online versions instead. That’s the only Android app I miss. The rest of my apps work fine on the device. You can install the apps by side loading them, but that’s not for the beginning user. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Specs Hexa-core Dual Arm Cortex A72 2GHz Processor 4GB of LPDDR3 RAM 32GB eMMC storage Model Number – XE513C24-K01US 12.3-inch LCD Touchscreen Display with 2400 x 1600 resolution and 3:2 aspect ratio and 400 nit brightness 2-in-1 rotating display Shared integrated graphics 2 1.5watt stereo speakers facing down 720p webcam 802.11ac/a/b/g/n Wi-Fi with Marvell 88W997 wireless card Bluetooth 4.0 Headphone mic combo audio port 2 USB-C 3.1 ports (up to 5Gbps and 4K display output with optional adapter) 1 micro-SD card slot Spill resistant 74-key keyboard S Pen 2-cell Li-ion 5140mAh batter with 39 watt hours Dimensions – 11.04″ x 8.72″ x 0.55″ Weight – 2.38lbs The Bottom Line Samsung makes the best Chromebook money can buy. It will get better when they release the Samsung Chromebook Pro, which adds an Intel Core M processor making it faster, but reducing battery life. The Samsung Chromebook Plus includes the excellent S Pen with great palm rejection while writing or drawing. The bright and sharp screen displays text, video and images beautifully and lets users turn down brightness to extend the already great battery life. I experienced freezes and frequent crashes at first. However, the problem seems isolated and a swap at the store or reinstalling the OS should fix the problem. Let’s hope Samsung can find out what’s wrong and fix it with an update. The mushy narrow keyboard might cause some to struggle as they type. I’ve got big hands and got used to the size and the feel of the keys after a couple days. At $449, or on sale at Best Buy for $419 in April 2017 or $369 for students until May 6, the price might cause some potential buyers to pause since other Chromebooks cost as low as $200. None of those cheaper machines comes with the great S Pen or excellent screen. Few offer battery life as long as the Samsung Chromebook Plus.   4 Responses 04/15/2017 Michael Perry Reply Thanks for a very nice review. I have the Samsung Chromebook Plus and have been using it for about two weeks now having purchased at a reduced cost from Amazon Prime. The things I enjoy are the fun I get from it installing new games and seeing how they run. I have had good luck with so many different games like SimCity Buildit and Shadowmatic. I wish they would fix the immersive screen and allow a switch in the on screen keyboard to turn this on. I have not sideloaded the MS apps since most of my docs are google docs. I do have OfficeSuite Pro installed which seems to be set up for chromebooks and it has support for OneDrive and Google Drive which is nice. It also runs quite well on the Plus and allows editing and saving of word, powerpoint, and excel files. Its worth “noting” that OneNote is present and can be installed. The screen ratio and brightness is something which has amazed me a few times. This is a nice small form factor laptop hybrid thing and I have used it in tablet, tent, and laptop. I have not used the touch screen that much in non tablet modes. I will experiment with that. I did load almost all the apps on my Pixel and as I mentioned I love trying new games that come out to see how they play. I am not a demanding gamer but its fun to see them run in full screen or immersive mode on the Plus. I wish Google would make the tablet form factor a bit easier but the S-pen makes it nicer. There are so many nice touches with the Plus! I am planning a long trip to Asia later in the year and will be taking the Plus with the select group of Android apps plus Skype or another SIP client to make calls. 04/15/2017 oldman65 Reply Great review. However I scored 10080 with octane 2 when my Samsung plus is connected to a socket, and I replaced Microsoft Office by Google Office ( Suite) long long time ago and never missed it. Most Web applications are great with a Chromebooks but having the possibility to run Android applications is definitevely a plus. 04/18/2017 PC Reply Question, how is the S PEN lag? Earlier reviewers were sent a Chromebook Pro from Samsung and many commented that there was a noticeable lag between the ink appearing and your writing. Also how low can you turn down the brightness as I like to do writing at night in a low light. I was considering the Lenovo Yoga Book, because of the feature of using real ink and paper on top of the HALO surface area. 04/22/2017 Gary Reply Don’t expect Apple Pencil level latency performance. There is noticeable lag, so you will have to compensate and write slower/carefully for your writings to appear as they would on actual paper. It also depends on the software of course, but I would say the level of lag is about same as Surface Pens. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Key researchers are using GTA V-derived code to power simulations and test scenarios to test the software that runs autonomous vehicles--in a sense the vehicles are "playing" the games, learning from interactions within the world itself, and more importantly the mistakes they make. This generates tons of data for the vehicle's "brains" to learn from, and gives engineers valuable information in the process.   The vehicle's machine-learning algorithms are put through their paces via simulations, which act as the other half of testing outside of the cars testing their skills on actual roads. With its myriad of cars, people, and dynamic physics-filled sandbox GTA V is the perfect virtual testing ground for driverless cars to learn from. Researchers at Intel Labs and Darmstadt started using GTA V for autonomous vehicle testing last year, and now other teams have picked up on it.   Using GTA V for their tests, Google's self-driving car project Waymo is able to run simulations where cars drive 3 million miles per day.   "Waymo uses its simulators to create a confounding motoring situation for every variation engineers can think of: having three cars changing lanes at the same time at an assortment of speeds and directions, for instance," Bloomberg reports. "What's learned virtually is applied physically, and problems encountered on the road are studied in simulation."   Los Santos' roads may not be safe from crazy players, but its fictional world is being used to make our real roads even safer.

antoniosk Hard and Fast Television, (re)enhanced: the Samsung QLED range By Antonios Karantze, in Nice Kit! Good Kit!, posted: 23-Apr-2017 10:11 Television. Been around since the 1930’s, with an evolution that has been interesting and non stop. It wasn’t that long ago we had a Philips K9 TV in the house (no remote – that was an extra $600 in 1984), and in recent years we’ve had the rapid shift towards flat panels and high definition viewing, supported by the content industry. And yet the concept is still remarkably similar: a screen 1 or more gather around for knowledge, entertainment and disconnection with reality. I often wonder if ‘TV’ will actually become more a personal viewing exercise, with viewers opting for a tablet or similar and the comfort of their own environment, rather than the shared experience of many people watching (and the inevitable commentary…. “what is this cr*p”?) I had the privilege of being introduced to Samsung’s new QLED range of Televisions a few days ago. These are due in the NZ market in May 2017 and continue the evolution of LED-LCD display technology, with colours and pictures that are strong, vibrant, bright and a joy to view. The current technology buzz in the TV display world is OLED, which is an early lifecycle technology that emits light (to assemble a display pictures) in a different fashion to the more mainstream LCD TV's. While it’s fascinating to see the evolution of technology and the promises these improvements bring, I tend to focus on how these compare to the here and now. Television is a well penetrated product into most people’s lives, and you’ll find one in most homes and places of work around NZ and the world, and they continue to function day in and out without too much fuss. The switch from the older tube technology to Plasma and subsequently LCD came with the usual hallmarks of new methods; the old technology had better colours, was more fluid and better saturation (so pictures looked more natural and so on), while manufacturing quality of early technology often meant the lifespan of a TV was adjusted from 25 years down to 10, and even 5 for some types until common sense (and sales trends) kicked in. In the range below, the Samsung panels are an evolution of LED technology and not OLED. While that’s interesting, how these panels perform and what they offer is more valuable than what's under the metal/plastic. Declaration: I have 3 Samsung TV’s, acquired between 2007-10. A 27” that had it’s screen die 1 day before the end of the warranty (on boxing day no less), but which Noel Leeming had repaired and is still going strong 10 years later (disappointingly, when you see so many flash new models these days). A 37” with a bezel (the plastic edging around the screen) that has cracked from several house moves), and a little 22” doing duty in the bedroom. All the TV's operate fine, and for me (and I expect a great many people) they will only be replaced when they stop working… meaning the market for Samsung’s new models as always is somebody seeking a replacement for various reasons. The highpoint of features and functions for me is equipment that’s 7-10 years old, meaning anything new will certainly be appealing. I am a researcher and make considered purchases, meaning features, form, function and most importantly for such a major appliance, ability to elegantly mount and position in the house.                 65” glory – Q8C $7,999                       75” of curve and style – Q8C $13,999           55” of Smart Viewing – Q7F $5,199 In the pictures above are the mainstream models being shown, on a gloomy day in Te Papa in Wellington. I deliberately took photo’s of the TV’s against their bright background, so the performance of the display can be somewhat thought about. On display is a variation of flat-to-wall, and curved screen models. Retail pricing by model is typical of this type of new product, and I expect market pricing will differ somewhat by the end of the year (In the model distinction, F means Flat and C means Curved): Model Q7F Q8C Q9F Curved No Yes No Screen Sizes 75” - $12,499 65" - $7,199 55" - $5,199 75" – $13,999 65" – $7,999 55" – $5,999 88" - $34,999 75" – $17,999 65" - $9,999 All panels are 4K displays with nearly no bezel at the edges, have superb clarity and brightness, downward firing speakers, beefed up user interface for control (with some good executions of control), a remote control that doesn’t have 200 buttons and some good thoughts for wall mounting. The control software is based on Tizen, a linux alternative with it’s roots in smartphone land, and has been driven by Samsung/Intel as an alternative to Android. A quick search of the web indicates it’s had an ignominious introduction, which you’d expect of anything new taking on established players, but on the TV's at least it functions smoothly and quickly. As usual, the downward firing speakers have limited ability to shift air meaning all the TV’s would benefit from a separate speaker system just to have adequate sound; it’s a shame all manufacturers have gone this way on premium models, as it feels just a little cheaty to expect all consumers to have a ready made home theatre setup to support a beautiful panel: I can’t stand box speakers and their wires being on display just to support watching TV. A significant point of interest for me was the connections on the back, and the very real questions around how to mount the TV nicely on a wall, connect the huge plethora of other devices one would reasonably expect to it, and keep it all nice and tidy. Samsung’s answer, first introduced in some premium models last year, is the control box. This unit connects to the TV via a bundled 5m fibre cable (the white cable above), and has connections for HDMI x4, USB2 x3, Gigabit Ethernet x1, Optical out x1. 1x UHF tuner (with F-Connector). The control box is the brains of the whole package, and the fibre cable allows for an elegant way of mounting the telly and hiding the wires. A 15M cable option will be available, circa RRP$400. In the second picture, you can see a panel that pops off – on the whole range, this is where Samsung’s mounting bracket is installed, and allows the TV to be mounted flush to the wall (curved or flat TVs). The bracket cost is up to $300 for the 55/65” range, and $350 for the 75”. The third picture gives an indication of the panel. Finally, the remote control is a neat little affair that is channeling other simplified silver remote controls, and operates on both Bluetooth and IR. The unit has voice control (hence the need for Bluetooth) as well as standard TV functions (IR), which is interesting… I would have thought going for full Bluetooth the more elegant step but there you go. It works fine and has a decent range and function. There are also the Samsung Smart View apps for Android and iOS, which act as soft remote controls, and can also be used as alternatives to an Apple TV or Chromecast to transmitting from your phone to the screen (I didn’t have a chance to try this out though, so not sure how well it works). Samsung also support Steamlink, meaning a PC can be connected over the home’s LAN with gaming happening on the TVs, something which sounds quite promising and no doubt has a few details in its setup. So, opinion The screens perform beautifully, display and function is very good (as you would expect at this price range), sound is ok, there has been some decent thinking into wall mounting and addressing the explosion connecting different devices brings to the modern viewing experience. The interesting comment from me was on the evolution of apps; Netflix, Lightbox, Neon, Hulu, Amazon all had apps available. Notable absence was TV3 and TVNZ, to which the response was that these folks weren’t developing for Smart TV anymore, focusing instead in channeling their effort into Freeview Plus and making their content available that way (which is a shrewd move: Having witnessed first-hand the level of work required to directly support Smart TV’s with a media app, the investment in human power vs benefit is horrendously skewed. Far more productive to focus on one source). The Smart interface had some genuinely neat tricks around source handling (elegant swapping between an Xbox, Blu-ray player, streaming content from a connected USB stick and so on), and performance never felt like the unit was chugging along or working hard. I’ve never been a fan of Smart TV’s, historically because of the commitment of the manufacturers to keeping the OS supported, enhanced and feature rich, and I hope the launch of this range is a commitment from Samsung to keep supporting what they build for the reasonable life of the TV; after all, I expect my next TV to last another 10 years, and I would be disappointed with any brand that dropped support of its software quickly for the next big thing. I’m keen to see where this range is at around October/November in the market, pricing and performance wise. Samsung have a real opportunity here to make some inroads, and judging by the Boxing Day sales in Dec 2016 have absolutely cleared the warehouses to support this new range. Worth considering.

HIDESHOW NAVIGATION Top Stories Governor Senate Congress Harrisburg Features Search for: PA-13: Boyle Calls for Investigation Into Claims Russia is Blackmailing Trump Written by Nick Field, Managing Editor Congressman Brendan Boyle wants to get to the bottom of claims that Russia is blackmailing President-Elect Donald Trump. “If true, the intelligence report outlining allegations of Russia’s possession of compromising personal and financial information about President-elect Donald Trump is beyond unsettling and sheds great light on Mr. Trump’s oddly sympathetic approach to Russia and its meddling in our election, as determined by our intelligence community,” Rep. Boyle stated. “If substantiated or verified, I will call for a formal, bipartisan congressional investigation into these scandalous and disturbing allegations.” As reported by CNN, a two-page addendum on the matter was included in the latest briefing for President Obama, President-Elect Trump and Congressional leaders. The thirty-five page dossier, compiled by a former member of British Intelligence, was then released by Buzzfeed. While the information has not been verified, it has been deemed credible. While I know there are some salacious details in the Intel report, it's important people focus on the explosive charge re: Trump lawyer 1/2 — Brendan Boyle (@RepBrendanBoyle) January 11, 2017 If Intel report is true, it would be the most treacherous and criminal act in US political history. Congress must investigate immediately. — Brendan Boyle (@RepBrendanBoyle) January 11, 2017 This is NOT about R or D! I mean does anyone think this would ever be an issue with John McCain? Or Romney? Or both Bushes? Of course not. — Brendan Boyle (@RepBrendanBoyle) January 11, 2017 Boyle currently sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

Robert Guzzardi says: January 12, 2017 at 1:37 pm The Sordid History of the Firm Behind the Trump-Russia Dossier Meet Fusion GPS. 7:15 AM, JAN 12, 2017 | By MARK HEMINGWAY Thursday’s New York Times has a report on how the highly suspicious dossier alleging that Donald Trump was compromised by Russian intelligence agents came into existence. Among the other interesting revelations was that the dubious opposition research report was put together by the research firm Fusion GPS: The story began in September 2015, when a wealthy Republican donor who strongly opposed Mr. Trump put up the money to hire a Washington research firm run by former journalists, Fusion GPS, to compile a dossier about the real estate magnate’s past scandals and weaknesses, according to a person familiar with the effort. The person described the opposition research work on condition of anonymity, citing the volatile nature of the story and the likelihood of future legal disputes. The identity of the donor is unclear. What’s interesting about this revelation is that Fusion GPS has an institutional reputation for doing shoddy and underhanded political work, and nearly all of it has been at the behest of Democrats looking to attack Republicans. In 2012, Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberly Strassel did some blockbuster reporting on Fusion GPS’s alarming efforts to dig up dirt on donors to Mitt Romney and socially conservative causes: Robert Guzzardi says: January 12, 2017 at 1:18 pm Good idea. BuzzFeed was all too ready to report Fake News. The motive is clear and malicious. *** Trump has grounds for a libel lawsuit against BuzzFeed BuzzFeed may have accomplished the nearly-impossible in journalism this week, when it arguably libeled President-elect Trump by publishing a report about his alleged Russian ties.

James Clapper called Donald Trump to inform him that Donald Trump confirmed Thursday that the director of national intelligence contacted him to deny leaking a dossier containing a variety of allegations against the president-elect over his relationship to Russia. *** “James Clapper called me yesterday to denounce the false and fictitious report that was illegally circulated,” Trump tweeted. “Made up, phony facts.Too bad!” *** Clapper said he emphasized “that this document is not a U.S. Intelligence Community product and that I do not believe the leaks came from within the IC.” http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/12/donald-trump-james-clapper-russia-dossier/96481140/ Apple of Your Turdseye says: January 12, 2017 at 12:29 pm Linda2: It would be shorter to just call it Trumpism.

Dismiss Notice Competition NB Weekly Magazine Top 5 Tech Innovations by Nigerians Discussion in 'Nigeria Gadgets & Tech Articles' started by mrdigitech, Dec 3, 2015. Views count: 8172 mrdigitech Member Technology has been the bedrock of economic and infrastructural development in many nations of the world. Countries with massive technological innovations and innovators are well respected in the comity of nations, and often tend to influence the political and economic policies of less tech endowed nations, There is no doubt that Africa is at the lowest level in the food chain when it comes to technology innovations. This is a continent usually plagued by famine, war, strife, and illiteracy, all of which combine to make her the dumping ground for goods produced by technologically advanced nations. Currently, things are changing for the better in a continent hosting the largest number of nations commonly referred to as “The Third World.”The level of illiteracy is declining, Africans are getting better educated and the continent is generally witnessing a rise in the number of tech innovations and inventors. Nigerians are at the forefront when it comes to technology innovations in Africa. Tech innovators are springing up daily, a development which has seen her ascend an enviable position on the continent. With that being said, these are the Top 5 Tech innovations by Nigerians. 1. The Nepaless Iron Although the name may sound weird to many, make no mistake, it may just help straighten up your clothes in the absence electrical power or when you least expect it. This product is the brainchild of Ayokunle Adeniran, a mechanical design engineer based in the United States. This technologically gifted Nigerian saw a potential in a continent blighted by persistent power problems and general infrastructural deficiencies, and created a stopgap product to ameliorate the deplorable situation we find ourselves. The Nepaless Iron, also known as “Iron Rhino,” is basically a gas-powered pressing iron that works just like your normal pressing, except for the fact that it isn’t powered by electricity. This Nepaless Iron is powered Butane, a hydrocarbon found in gaseous petroleum fractions. Butane is sold in small gas canisters, with retail price hovering around N120 per canister. This product comes in handy, especially in nation such as ours where electrical power is largely seen as a privilege by the masses. 2. Multi-core Processors Multi-core processors enable computers handle lots of computing processes and tasks efficiently and effectively. Computers with multi-core processors perform a whole lot better than computers lacking them, and a Nigerian professor at Stanford, Professor Oyekunle Olukotun, played a pioneering role in its early development. A multi-core processor implements multiprocessing in a single physical package, allowing modern computers fitted with this kind of processors run multiple instructions at the same time. Although its development has largely being attributed to major IT giants such as Intel and AMD, the role played by Professor Olukotun in its discovery cannot be overemphasized. Professor Olukotun conceived the idea along with his friends in the mid nineties, after discovering the importance of multi-core processors in hardware utilization; however, it was until the early 2000s that his idea came to light. His innovation has paved way for the development of superfast, highly efficient computers and mobile smart devices. 3. Mimosa Weed Solar Energy With the world clamoring for renewable energy and a greener environment, devoid of harmful industrial activities, Professor Justus Nwaoga, from the department of Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Chemistry, University of Nigeria Nsukka, discovered that the common weed Mimosa Pudica had the potential to harness the energy from the sun. His findings were brought to life after observing the behavioral patterns of the Mimosa, especially when exposed to sunlight. After observing that the Mimosa leaves opened at sunrise and folded at sunset, he dug deeper into the chemical component of its leaves and discovered a compound called “black silicon,” which he says is responsible for the plant’s high sensitivity to sunlight. He used the pigment discovered in the Mimosa to create solar panels, which is stirring up interest in countries such as China, a leading power in solar energy development. 4. HopStop HopStop is the brainchild of Chinedu Echeruo, a former analyst at investment bank and hedge fund. HopStop works just like your regular mapping app only that it’s more oriented towards providing free customized public transit directions and other information relating public transit. This app lets users get up-to-the-minute biking, taxi, walking, public transit and hourly car rental directions based on the travel options selected. Users can also find popular shopping areas, bars, restaurants, attractions, and much more, using the Hopstop city guide. The popularity of Hopstop has grown over the last five years, especially in the United States, where its positive impact has largely been felt. HopStop was ranked among the top 100 fastest growing companies in the U.S in 2011 and has been named as one of the top transit apps for Apple products by respected media agencies in the world, including Business insider. 5. Chip Interconnection Technology Funny enough, Nigerians have been at the forefront when it comes computer innovations and technology, with Philip Emegwali being the most iconic of them all. Now we have a Nigerian, Cyprian Emeka Uzoh, holding more than 300 semiconductor patents worldwide. The Copper Interconnect technology is one of such innovations that have contributed significantly to the development of computer electronics and technologies, and Cypian Uzoh played key role in co-developing and co-implementing it in notable Tech companies around the world, including IBM. Nigeria has made giant strides in science and technology, tech start-ups are springing up daily, buoyed by the massive rise in the number highly talented, educated and tech savvy citizens. Nigerian innovators are making significant impact globally and are highly sought-after for their technical prowess and ingenuity. These are the kind of innovations we need in Nigeria, a development that will see her attain her true position in the comity of industrialized nations and ultimately achieve her vision 2020 objective.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Computers The Galaxy S8’s processor is powerful enough to run Windows Chris Smith @chris_writes April 21st, 2017 at 5:28 PM Share Tweet Don’t get too excited about installing Windows 10 on the Galaxy S8 just yet, although you can run a virtualized Windows 10 desktop on the phone using the DeX accessory seen in the image above. However, the powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 platform that powers Samsung’s phone will also power Windows 10 devices later this year. The chipmaker confirmed that Windows 10 devices based on the Snapdragon 835 system-on-a-chip (SoC) will be available in stores in the fourth quarter. Don't Miss: It’s official: Everyone hates the iPhone 8 design that just leaked “Our Snapdragon 835 is expanding into mobile PC designs running Windows 10, which are scheduled to launch in the fourth calendar quarter this year,” Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf said during the company’s Q2 earnings call on Thursday. That’s hardly a surprise, ZDNet explains, as Microsoft and Qualcomm announced last December that always-on cellular Windows 10 PCs based on ARM chips will be launched this year. But this is the first time either company announced a launch timeframe for these devices. The Snapdragon 835 chip will run full Windows 10 desktop compiled natively for ARM SoCs. These devices will support both universal Windows apps as well as Win32 apps (via an emulator). Qualcomm wants to bring some smartphone technologies made possible by the new chip to Windows 10 PCs, including Gigabit LTE and battery-saving tech to Windows 10 devices that will be ultralight, and always connected to a network. This is certainly an exciting announcement for the future of the PC, and Intel should be worried. The Snapdragon 835 is the fastest chip in town when it comes to Android devices, and next generations will be even faster and more energy efficient. Sure, they won’t serve the needs of “Pro” users who need plenty of computing power, but they’ll be great for mobile computing. And if Qualcomm is already confident its ARM chips can power PC experiences, then there’s one other reason to be excited. If there’s one rival Qualcomm can’t beat in mobile chips performance, it’s Apple. There’s one rumor that keeps coming back saying Apple is working on its own ARM-based Macs. The more advanced its A-series chip get, the more likely it is to see such devices — don’t get too excited about Macs running on A11 chips just yet. It’s unclear at this time who’s making these Qualcomm 835 Windows 10 PCs, but we’ll probably learn more details in the second half of the year.

Overclocking refers to the practice of increasing processor clock speed, which increases thermal output and power draw. Professional overclockers therefore resort to extreme methods of cooling such as liquid nitrogen in order to reach record-breaking clock speeds. Overclockers from around the world share their high scores on dedicated platforms like HWBOT, which provides the latest updates on global rankings and tournament results. MyBroadband spoke to local overclocker Andrew “DrWeez” Roberts to find out about competitive overclocking in South Africa and get some expert advice. Roberts is ranked as the best overclocker in South Africa on HWBOT and is in the Elite overclocking league. What is your current worldwide ranking and greatest moment? My rank has slipped to 42nd, mostly due to the release of next-generation hardware that we in South Africa have not had access to. My greatest moment would have to be when I broke the 3DMark 11 world record using a GeForce GTX 580 Lightning. I was still quite new to overclocking with liquid nitrogen and I was able to beat the likes of Kingpin. The score only stood for a few days. What are important tips for overclocking hardware? The biggest tip I can give for air and liquid cooling is to manage the heat. The better you can control your temperature, the more voltage you can apply. Even something as simple as high-quality thermal paste like Thermal Grizzly can make the difference between an average and above-average increase in performance. If you find yourself hitting limits, there are many ways to remove the limitations imposed on your hardware, but you should understand the risks of removing protection. Work in small steps and make sure you have adequate cooling. What are the biggest challenges for local overclockers? The biggest challenges we face in South Africa are the costs. In order to find the best hardware, you need to test a large quantity of processors, video cards, and memory. No two pieces of silicon are the same and small manufacturing defects can make the world of difference when operating at the extremes. With a Z170 chipset and high-frequency memory overclocking, it was discovered that we needed to even go as far as testing multiple motherboards to squeeze out the maximum frequencies. Our local second-hand market is small in comparison to Europe or the USA, and 95% of everything I test is purchased new and sold at a loss. There is also a serious shortage of liquid nitrogen suppliers in South Africa and only one supplier will allow liquid nitrogen to be collected in low-pressure containers. In South Africa, we pay triple what others pay around the world. Do you have any tips for those interested in competitive overclocking? Buy the best equipment, it will save you in the long run. Get active with the guys who are overclocking, there is a lot to learn and the best way to learn is with others. My last bit of advice would be to start with the old-generation stuff, LGA775 and up. The kit is cheap and it’s a lot of fun. Stick to dry ice for as long as possible and your goal should be to score in the top 20 of your chosen hardware class and cooling method. Make sure you get the right memory type for the system you are planning to overclock, as not all memory modules are equal. Is it worth buying an unlocked Intel 7th-gen CPU if you are an everyday gamer? I have just started my adventure with Kaby Lake and so far I am impressed. All four 7700Ks I have tested reached 5,300Mhz with my Cooler Master Nepton 280L, and this is the first time Intel have an unlocked chip in all three classes. This means there should be an unlocked chip available in everyone’s budget. The only thing to remember is that you need a Z-series motherboard to fully take control of overclocking the chip and memory. I have a Core i3-7350 on order and really hope the Core i3 delivers the same impressive boost I experienced with the i7. The move to Intel’s 7th-gen processors should be a no-brainer for any gamer on hardware older than a Z170 motherboard. Which is your favourite brand of PC cooling hardware? For extreme cooling, I am huge fan of the der8auer and Kingpin kit. For everyday cooling, it’s a tough race between Corsair and Cooler Master. If I had to make a choice, I would pick EK’s custom water cooling products. I have to mention thermal paste when talking about cooling, because it really is an important part of cooling your system. Thermal Grizzly is the only thermal paste I use for both air and water cooling. Roberts usually streams live on Twitch and YouTube every Tuesday and Thursday after 19:00 and continues to compete in overclocking competitions.

Mnuchin said he consulted with President Trump on the decision.   Exxon had applied for a waiver from sanctions imposed by the Obama administration in a bid to resume its lucrative joint venture with Russian state oil giant PAO Rosneft. In a statement, Exxon said “we understand” the decision by the Treasury Department. Exxon explained that its application for a license was aimed at meeting the company’s “contractual obligations” in Russia, where competitors are allowed to drill under European sanctions. There are powerful reasons why Exxon would want to get back into business with Rosneft: Their agreement to form a joint venture, signed in 2011, allowed Exxon to conduct offshore exploration in the Black Sea and the Kara Sea in Siberia. The undeveloped oil fields are thought to be the most promising in the Russian Arctic, according to S&P Global Platts. In 2012, the two firms agreed to jointly develop more oil reserves in Siberia and establish a research center in the Arctic. Plans to build a large natural gas plant near Vladivostock in eastern Russia followed in 2013. The deepening relationship was put on hold, however, after the United States, European Union and other Western countries imposed sanctions on Russia in 2014 over its role in the crisis in Ukraine. Exxon, which has been operating in Russia for more than 20 years, was allowed to finish some of its projects. But then the drilling stopped. A lot has changed since then. The Russian economy has turned the corner, emerging from a painful recession in the final quarter of 2016. Oil prices have climbed back above $50 per barrel. The Trump administration is under intense scrutiny over its ties to Moscow. The fact that the current secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, spearheaded the Rosneft deal while CEO of Exxon, has drawn even more attention to the waiver request. Tillerson has recused himself from all government matters involving Exxon. He also sold all his stock in the firm, and is placing the shares he would have received over the next decade into an independently managed trust. But a political storm started brewing earlier this week when the Wall Street Journal first reported that Exxon was seeking a waiver. Sen. John McCain, a Republican, asked “Are they crazy?” when news of the waiver application broke. McCain is a leading critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intel Committee, said that the waiver should be denied. “The Treasury Department should reject any waiver from sanctions which would allow Exxon Mobile or any other company to resume business with prohibited Russian entities,” he said in a statement. “I was very surprised Exxon did this because it would be bad publicity. The secretary of state was only on the job for two months and they already tried to get behind the sanctions,” said Fadel Gheit, managing director of Oppenheimer & Co.’s oil and gas research division. Still, the financial incentives for Exxon are powerful when it comes to Russia. “Exxon is a big company. It’s very hard for anything to move the needle,” said Brian Youngberg, senior energy analyst at Edward Jones. “Russia could potentially be that, years out. It potentially could be very lucrative.” In March 2016, Tillerson said that Exxon was “very anxious to get back to work there.” His successor echoed that hope earlier this year. “In Russia, we’re there for the long term,” CEO Darren Woods said in a February interview with Forbes. http://www.wfmz.com/business/national-and-world-business/trump-denies-exxon-permission-to-drill-for-oil-in-russia/458132079 Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News.

Just when it looked like the stock market was drowning in a sea of worry, President Donald Trump threw it a much-needed life line. Trump on Friday said he will reveal a “massive” tax package that will deliver cuts “bigger I believe than any tax cut ever.” The president plans to unveil the details on Wednesday, reiterated by a Saturday tweet: Big TAX REFORM AND TAX REDUCTION will be announced next Wednesday.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 22, 2017 Some of the stock market’s sluggishness since the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.30%  hit a record on March 1 has been blamed on the absence of meaningful policy change since Trump took office. As a result, any hints that the president is committed to delivering on tax reform and deregulation will help to offset worries about soft economic data, most notably tepid auto and retail sales. But even that may be a boon for stocks as economic weakness could prompt the Federal Reserve to opt for gradual normalization of monetary policy, according to strategists at Yardeni Research. France's presidential election: What you need to know(2:57) Amid heightened security fears following a terror attack in Paris, the French will elect a new president in two rounds of voting on April 23 and May 7—the result could reshape the European Union. WSJ's Niki Blasina explains who the top candidates are, how they could win, and what might happen next. Photo: Getty Images. Then there is also the chance that the U.S. bureaucracy may come to a screeching halt next week if Republicans and Democrats are unable to reach an agreement on the spending bill to fund the government for the remainder of the fiscal year. The deadline to get the deal done falls on April 29, Trump’s 100th day in office. Even so, with the much-anticipated tax reform a step closer to reality, investors will be emboldened to return to the market to chase stocks higher. That the corporate-friendly measure comes on the back of an upbeat earnings season will give the market added upside momentum. Analysts are projecting one of the best quarterly earnings in more than five years on the back of a recovery in both the U.S. and global economies. Almost 200 companies are slated to release earnings next week including Dow components Caterpillar Inc. CAT, -0.36%   and Boeing Co. BA, +0.60%  and tech giants Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +1.37% Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, -0.13% GOOG, +0.18%  and Intel Corp. INTC, +0.39% Still, the French election could be the fly in the market’s soup.

The race is a four-way contest between Emmanuel Macron, Marine Le Pen, François Fillon, and Jean-Luc Melenchon although pundits expect centrist Macron and far-right National Front leader Le Pen to win the first round for a runoff vote in May. At stake is not only the future of the third largest economy in Europe but also the eurozone given pledges by Le Pen and Melenchon to quit the union if they win. Read: When are the French election results out on Sunday? Strong showings by Euroskeptics Le Pen and Melenchon could result in “risk aversion which could weigh on markets while Macron or Fillon could spark a move back into risk markets and potentially kick off a rally for stocks,” said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets. The S&P 500 fell 7.15 points, or 0.3%, to close at 2,348.69 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.15%  shed 30.95 points, or 0.2%, to finish at 20,547.76 on Friday.

Just when it looked like the stock market was drowning in a sea of worry, President Donald Trump threw it a much-needed life line. Trump on Friday said he will reveal a “massive” tax package that will deliver cuts “bigger I believe than any tax cut ever.” The president plans to unveil the details on Wednesday, reiterated by a Saturday tweet: Big TAX REFORM AND TAX REDUCTION will be announced next Wednesday.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 22, 2017 Some of the stock market’s sluggishness since the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.30%  hit a record on March 1 has been blamed on the absence of meaningful policy change since Trump took office. As a result, any hints that the president is committed to delivering on tax reform and deregulation will help to offset worries about soft economic data, most notably tepid auto and retail sales. But even that may be a boon for stocks as economic weakness could prompt the Federal Reserve to opt for gradual normalization of monetary policy, according to strategists at Yardeni Research. France's presidential election: What you need to know(2:57) Amid heightened security fears following a terror attack in Paris, the French will elect a new president in two rounds of voting on April 23 and May 7—the result could reshape the European Union. WSJ's Niki Blasina explains who the top candidates are, how they could win, and what might happen next. Photo: Getty Images. Then there is also the chance that the U.S. bureaucracy may come to a screeching halt next week if Republicans and Democrats are unable to reach an agreement on the spending bill to fund the government for the remainder of the fiscal year. The deadline to get the deal done falls on April 29, Trump’s 100th day in office. Even so, with the much-anticipated tax reform a step closer to reality, investors will be emboldened to return to the market to chase stocks higher. That the corporate-friendly measure comes on the back of an upbeat earnings season will give the market added upside momentum. Analysts are projecting one of the best quarterly earnings in more than five years on the back of a recovery in both the U.S. and global economies. Almost 200 companies are slated to release earnings next week including Dow components Caterpillar Inc. CAT, -0.36%   and Boeing Co. BA, +0.60%  and tech giants Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +1.37% Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, -0.13% GOOG, +0.18%  and Intel Corp. INTC, +0.39% Still, the French election could be the fly in the market’s soup. See also: Here’s how French election could test U.S. stock market’s resilience On Sunday, French voters will go to the polls to choose a new leader in a closely watched election that is emerging as an important test of whether the wave of populism that is sweeping across the globe will find traction or fizzle. The race is a four-way contest between Emmanuel Macron, Marine Le Pen, François Fillon, and Jean-Luc Melenchon although pundits expect centrist Macron and far-right National Front leader Le Pen to win the first round for a runoff vote in May. At stake is not only the future of the third largest economy in Europe but also the eurozone given pledges by Le Pen and Melenchon to quit the union if they win. Read: When are the French election results out on Sunday? Strong showings by Euroskeptics Le Pen and Melenchon could result in “risk aversion which could weigh on markets while Macron or Fillon could spark a move back into risk markets and potentially kick off a rally for stocks,” said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.

Casey | April 21, 2017 09:00 am MORE As I strapped on an HTC Vive headset, I immersed myself in a virtual render of the Bank of England, an architectural masterpiece demolished in the 20th century. I realized that virtual reality is bigger than gaming, and it seems that HP agrees. The company just launched its latest line of ZBook workstations, including the VR-capable ZBook 17 G4 that my powered my immersive experience. Available now, starting at $1,519 (with VR-ready configs starting at $3,438), this ZBook is a 17-inch tank of a workstation that can be customized to support VR content running at 90 frames per second. MORE: The Best Laptops for Business and Productivity While virtually teleporting around this bank render, which ran in the Enscape 3D program, I thought about VR as a tool for the modern executive. It's a lot easier to understand a new project you're signing off on from this point of view, especially as one controller button allowed me to see how things looked when more or less clouds changed interior lighting. The VR-capable HP ZBook 17 G4 Depending on your needs, you can configure the ZBook 17 G4 with a range of CPUs (from 7th Gen Core i3 up to Xeon), as well as discrete Nvidia Quadro (with P4000 and P5000 options for VR) and AMD Radeon Pro graphics. It also sports dual Thunderbolt 3 ports and includes security standards such as a TPM chip and a Smart Card Reader, with the option for a fingerprint reader. HP also announced the 15-inch ZBook 15 G4, which is available now, with pricing starting at $1,419. This model can't support VR, but it does feature the same range of Intel's Xeon and 7th Gen Core CPUs. It's for the user who runs demanding software from the likes of Adobe and Autodesk, but doesn't require virtual realities.The 18-mm thin HP ZBook Studio G4 Workstation users who demand more portability will likely have their eye on the new 4.6-pound, 18-millimeter-thin ZBook Studio G4, which also features 7th Gen Kaby Lake CPUs. We look forward to testing out the configuration with a 92-watthour battery, as HP's claiming it will offer 16.5 hours of life on a single charge, which is only available in the single hard drive configurations. It's available now with pricing starting at $1,399. HP's also bringing back the 14-inch ZBook 14u G4, its lightest workstation, for this 4th generation refresh. Starting at just 3.61 pounds, this notebook packs 7th Gen CPUs, AMD FirePro 3D graphics, up to 32GB of memory and up to 2TB of storage. Unlike the others, pricing and availability for the 14u won't be revealed until this summer. ✖ HP Laptop Guide Best HP Laptops and Chromebooks How HP Compares to Other Laptop Brands HP Tech Support Rating and Report Card What's in HP's Warranty?

That stripped down flavor of Windows 8 was a commercial and critical flop, but Microsoft aims to make ARM-based PCs a thing in the era of Windows 10. Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf provided an update on the future of Windows on ARM in a recent investor call, saying the first Qualcomm-based Windows PCs will be available at the end of this year. Microsoft and Qualcomm first revealed this plan in December 2016, but there was little in the way of details at the time. What we do know is Microsoft has learned from the past, and it won’t be going down the same path as Windows RT. That version of the OS lacked support for true desktop apps, relying completely on the so-called Modern UI apps that rolled out with Windows 8. In its new take on ARM PCs, Microsoft has developed a built-in emulator that can run regular desktop apps on the ARM architecture. Mollenkopf made his comments in connection with the Snapdragon 835, the latest chip from Qualcomm that is currently only available in the Galaxy S8. This is a quad-core chip based on Qualcomm’s custom Kryo 280 64-bit CPU core. In current configurations, it can be clocked as high as 2.45GHz. In a demo last December, Microsoft showed a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 running Windows 10 without any appreciable lag. It worked fine in Edge and even booted up Photoshop in a respectable amount of time. The main selling point here is efficiency — a PC powered by an ARM SoC could run for much longer, and the on-die support for cellular modems means it’ll be easier for OEMs to include mobile data. ARM chips should also be cheaper than Intel or AMD, which means cheaper machines. Microsoft has seen less expensive devices like Chromebooks and iPads eat into sales of Windows laptops, and many of these devices run on ARM. However, ARM-based Chromebooks tend to use less powerful (and therefore cheaper) ARM chips. Windows needs the power of something like the Snapdragon 835 to be viable. OEMs might find the savings over Intel parts to be smaller than expected. The first wave of ARM Windows devices will come from brands other than Microsoft — Lenovo is rumored to be planning a convertible laptop of some sort. We may get a peek at some early ARM-based Windows devices at the Build conference in May.         LATEST STORIES (8) Syrian Gov't Forces Capture Abu Qula Dam West of Palmyra Iraqi Forces Capture More Territories in Battle with ISIL in Western Mosul Iraqi Popular Forces Defuse Terrorist Attack amid Spiritual March Iraqi Forces Guarding Civilians While Providing Aid to People in Western Mosul Syrian Army Drives Terrorists out of Key Heights near Border with Lebanon Iraqi Air Force Conducts Air Assaults on Multiple ISIL Targets in Tal Afar ISIL Nears Defeat in Mosul as Iraqi Forces Liberate Several Neighborhoods Iran's IRGC Navy Receives New Cruise Missiles More Information about Iran Election 2017 Candidates Senior Commander: PMF Ready to Attack Tal Afar IRGC Navy Equipped with New Anti-Ship Cruise Missiles Russia Ready to Prioritize Air Defense Systems Deliveries to Syria First VP: Iran Welcomes Exchange of Electricity with Georgia, Russia, Armenia Official Underlines Iran's Self-Sufficiency in Building Fighter Jets' Simulators Iraqi Forces Recapture Neighborhood from ISIL in Western Mosul Syrian Gov't Forces Capture Abu Qula Dam West of Palmyra TEHRAN (FNA)- Syrian army forces captured Abu Qula dam from the ISIL terrorists and extended the security belt around Palmyra (Tadmur) city.

By JuricaDujmovic Columnist Playing computer games is more than a pastime for some younger people. It’s a career. A study by Unibet sheds new light on the phenomenon of eSports, as competitive gaming is called. Did you know that the League of Legends (multiplayer online battle arena/MOBA) final drew in more viewers than the last game of the 2016 NBA Finals (36 million vs 31 million)? Or that the total eSports prize pool exceeds $93 million? As you can see, competitive gaming has become a serious business. Just how serious? Let’s talk numbers. ESports viewership has been growing steadily, from 76 million occasional and 56 million frequent viewers in 2012, to a staggering 194 million and 191 million, respectively, in 2017. Statista projections take those numbers even further, expecting them to rise to 286 million and 303 million, respectively, by 2020. To put this into perspective, male millennials in the U.S. already watch eSports as much as they do baseball and ice hockey. Along with the audience, the number of pro gamers has also been growing rapidly. In 2012, there were 4,246 of them, while in 2016 there were 13,555. Big prizes So we have the audience and the digital athletes — all we’re missing now are prizes. And they are generous, indeed. Winning a major golf tournament, such as the U.S. Open, can actually be less lucrative than winning Dota 2 (another MOBA tournament). Each member of the Wings Gaming team who won The International 2016 Dota 2 tournament went home with $1.83 million in prize money. The gamer with the most money earned is Saahil Arora (gaming nickname: UNiVeRsE), a U.S. Dota 2 player who made $1.73 million in 2015, his best year. In comparison, Dustin Johnson was awarded $1.8 million for winning the 2016 U.S. Open, and Sergio Garcia, the winner of the 2017 Masters, took home $1.98 million. From 2013 to 2016, the amount of money handed out across all eSports games more than quadrupled, from $21.4 million to $93.3 million. This year could breach the $150 million mark, an almost 100-fold increase from 2003. Countries with the biggest winnings in 2016 were China ($19.3 million), the U.S. ($14.7 million) and South Korea ($11.9 million). If you’re thinking about becoming a pro gamer, you may be interested in seeing which games rake in the most dough: Although Dota 2 overshadows all other games, Heroes of the Storm (released in June 2015) and Hearthstone (March 2014) have breached the top 10 and are poised to overthrow Counter-Strike by the turn of 2018. Companies take notice Such growth has attracted the attention of big companies like Coca-Cola Co. KO, -0.05%  and Red Bull, which not only sponsored, but also worked on organizing their own events, for gamers to compete in. Other prominent sponsors include Logitech International SA LOGI, -1.02% Razer and Intel Corp. INTC, +0.39% which has been sponsoring such events for over 10 years. Sponsors pay good money to get event exposure as teams feature their insignias on their jerseys, websites and social media. As it is with other sports, age plays a significant role in a player’s success. Historically, 25 has been the most lucrative age for professional gamers. Beyond 25, there is a big drop-off in earnings potential, with ages 31-33 marking the leanest range for gamers aged 15 or above. College scholarships So the next time you see your child playing computer games, think twice before saying it’s a waste of time. Gaming could get your kid into college. On April 6, the University of Utah announced it would be offering scholarships for League of Legends players, following in the footsteps of the University of California, Irvine. There you have it. ESports can no longer be ignored or belittled. What do you think about eSports? Would you support your child in becoming a pro gamer? Or would you yourself take the chance?

By JuricaDujmovic Columnist Playing computer games is more than a pastime for some younger people. It’s a career. A study by Unibet sheds new light on the phenomenon of eSports, as competitive gaming is called. Did you know that the League of Legends (multiplayer online battle arena/MOBA) final drew in more viewers than the last game of the 2016 NBA Finals (36 million vs 31 million)? Or that the total eSports prize pool exceeds $93 million? As you can see, competitive gaming has become a serious business. Just how serious? Let’s talk numbers. ESports viewership has been growing steadily, from 76 million occasional and 56 million frequent viewers in 2012, to a staggering 194 million and 191 million, respectively, in 2017. Statista projections take those numbers even further, expecting them to rise to 286 million and 303 million, respectively, by 2020. To put this into perspective, male millennials in the U.S. already watch eSports as much as they do baseball and ice hockey. Along with the audience, the number of pro gamers has also been growing rapidly. In 2012, there were 4,246 of them, while in 2016 there were 13,555. Big prizes So we have the audience and the digital athletes — all we’re missing now are prizes. And they are generous, indeed. Winning a major golf tournament, such as the U.S. Open, can actually be less lucrative than winning Dota 2 (another MOBA tournament). Each member of the Wings Gaming team who won The International 2016 Dota 2 tournament went home with $1.83 million in prize money. The gamer with the most money earned is Saahil Arora (gaming nickname: UNiVeRsE), a U.S. Dota 2 player who made $1.73 million in 2015, his best year. In comparison, Dustin Johnson was awarded $1.8 million for winning the 2016 U.S. Open, and Sergio Garcia, the winner of the 2017 Masters, took home $1.98 million. From 2013 to 2016, the amount of money handed out across all eSports games more than quadrupled, from $21.4 million to $93.3 million. This year could breach the $150 million mark, an almost 100-fold increase from 2003. Countries with the biggest winnings in 2016 were China ($19.3 million), the U.S. ($14.7 million) and South Korea ($11.9 million). If you’re thinking about becoming a pro gamer, you may be interested in seeing which games rake in the most dough: Although Dota 2 overshadows all other games, Heroes of the Storm (released in June 2015) and Hearthstone (March 2014) have breached the top 10 and are poised to overthrow Counter-Strike by the turn of 2018. Companies take notice Such growth has attracted the attention of big companies like Coca-Cola Co. KO, -0.05%  and Red Bull, which not only sponsored, but also worked on organizing their own events, for gamers to compete in. Other prominent sponsors include Logitech International SA LOGI, -1.02% Razer and Intel Corp. INTC, +0.39% which has been sponsoring such events for over 10 years. Sponsors pay good money to get event exposure as teams feature their insignias on their jerseys, websites and social media. As it is with other sports, age plays a significant role in a player’s success. Historically, 25 has been the most lucrative age for professional gamers. Beyond 25, there is a big drop-off in earnings potential, with ages 31-33 marking the leanest range for gamers aged 15 or above. College scholarships So the next time you see your child playing computer games, think twice before saying it’s a waste of time. Gaming could get your kid into college. On April 6, the University of Utah announced it would be offering scholarships for League of Legends players, following in the footsteps of the University of California, Irvine. There you have it. ESports can no longer be ignored or belittled. What do you think about eSports? Would you support your child in becoming a pro gamer? Or would you yourself take the chance?

However, the powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 platform that powers Samsung’s phone will also power Windows 10 devices later this year. The chipmaker confirmed that Windows 10 devices based on the Snapdragon 835 system-on-a-chip (SoC) will be available in stores in the fourth quarter. Don't Miss: It’s official: Everyone hates the iPhone 8 design that just leaked “Our Snapdragon 835 is expanding into mobile PC designs running Windows 10, which are scheduled to launch in the fourth calendar quarter this year,” Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf said during the company’s Q2 earnings call on Thursday. That’s hardly a surprise, ZDNet explains, as Microsoft and Qualcomm announced last December that always-on cellular Windows 10 PCs based on ARM chips will be launched this year. But this is the first time either company announced a launch timeframe for these devices. The Snapdragon 835 chip will run full Windows 10 desktop compiled natively for ARM SoCs. These devices will support both universal Windows apps as well as Win32 apps (via an emulator). Qualcomm wants to bring some smartphone technologies made possible by the new chip to Windows 10 PCs, including Gigabit LTE and battery-saving tech to Windows 10 devices that will be ultralight, and always connected to a network. This is certainly an exciting announcement for the future of the PC, and Intel should be worried. The Snapdragon 835 is the fastest chip in town when it comes to Android devices, and next generations will be even faster and more energy efficient. Sure, they won’t serve the needs of “Pro” users who need plenty of computing power, but they’ll be great for mobile computing. And if Qualcomm is already confident its ARM chips can power PC experiences, then there’s one other reason to be excited. If there’s one rival Qualcomm can’t beat in mobile chips performance, it’s Apple. There’s one rumor that keeps coming back saying Apple is working on its own ARM-based Macs. The more advanced its A-series chip get, the more likely it is to see such devices — don’t get too excited about Macs running on A11 chips just yet. It’s unclear at this time who’s making these Qualcomm 835 Windows 10 PCs, but we’ll probably learn more details in the second half of the year.

Today, the company introduced Power Throttling, which is already available in the latest Redstone 3 build, 16176. The new feature is meant to preserve battery life, and Microsoft says that when it tested it in January, there was up to an 11% reduction in CPU power consumption, "for some of the most strenuous use cases." Basically, it works by cutting down on CPU access for apps that are in the background, prioritizing apps in the foreground, those that are playing music, and some other "categories of important work we infer from the demands of running apps and the apps the user interacts with". There will also be APIs to allow developers greater control over this. As a user, you also have control over Power Throttling. You can control it system-wide with a Power Slider, or you can adjust it on an app-by-app basis through Battery Settings. Unfortunately, the technology is only available for devices with Intel's sixth-generation Skylake chips or higher. It uses Intel Speed Shift, so that means that there's also no support for AMD's new Ryzen chips just yet. Microsoft says that it's working to bring support to more processors over the next few months. Also, the company says that Power Throttling isn't the final name for the feature, and that it may change between now and when it's released with Redstone 3 later this year.

Quotes in the article Kimberly-Clark Corp KMB ▼ 129.96 -1.27 -0.97% Hasbro Inc HAS ▲ 96.03 +0.02 +0.02% Mattel Inc MAT ▼ 21.79 -3.42 -13.57% Broadcom Ltd AVGO ▼ 217.66 -0.55 -0.25% AdChoices "On Monday, we hear from Kimberly-Clark (KMB) and I've had the same view about this stock since my days at Goldman Sachs in the '80s. You buy Kimberly-Clark when it gets hit. This is a strategy that's never failed me, and I bet this time will be no different," the "Mad Money" host said. With the first round of the French election occurring on Sunday — and the biggest week of earnings approaching — Jim Cramer smells panic in the air. He recommended focusing on individual company reports that can help shed light on the true state of the global economy. With that in mind, here are the stocks and events on Cramer's radar next week: Hasbro (HAS) will report earnings alongside Kimberly-Clark on Monday, and Cramer said rival toymaker Mattel's (MAT) weak Thursday earnings report should not drag Hasbro down. "Hasbro's developed a very different model from Mattel's. It's more experiential, and it does a huge amount of business selling Disney (DIS) toys, and given that we've got a new 'Star Wars' movie later this year [and] maybe a couple of 'Star Wars' movies down the line, I bet it's a winner, not a loser like Mattel," Cramer said. Read more from CNBC's Jim Cramer Tuesday brings an onslaught of over 30 major earnings reports including Chipotle's (CMG), and the fast-casual chain is approaching the 18-month mark at which health-risk concerns begin to taper out. That is good news for the company moving forward, Cramer said. "However, the stock's already had a big run. I don't want you to chase. There are so many people who expect it to be a great quarter that we need to be sensitive to the idea that the improving news may actually cause a short term sell-off before the stock advances again," the "Mad Money" host advised.© Provided by CNBC The earnings wave continues on Wednesday, with United Technologies (UTX), PepsiCo (PEP), and Twitter (TWTR) reporting, among others. Cramer knows there is a hidden market out there for Twitter, particularly among those with accounts, so he is curious to see what kind of reaction a weak quarter might get. "I say it's too risky, at least until we see those [earnings] numbers. Then we make a decision," he said. Southwest Airlines (LUV) will report earnings before Thursday's bell, and Cramer says that having no overseas routes will be a boon to the stock. "Call me a buyer both before and after what I think is going to be a terrific report," Cramer said, adding that he owns the name for his charitable trust, ActionAlertsPlus.com. And with oil prices expected to head back to $47 from Friday's $49.50, Cramer says both Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) will be buys if they announce any good news on their earnings calls next Friday. "Hope for panic next week and take action when you get it with some of these great opportunities," Cramer said. © Provided by CNBC As cyberattacks grow in power and number, Proofpoint (PFPT) CEO Gary Steele sees them moving from targeting organizations to hacking individuals through email and social media. "We're all about protecting individuals and we've seen the threat landscape really move in that direction, where bad actors are targeting people, not infrastructure, these days," Steele told Cramer on Friday. "As a result of that, companies need to buy protection that Proofpoint provides," the CEO said. While cyberattackers are often very skilled at mimicking a company's email style in order to trick unassuming workers, Steele said Proofpoint serves as a formidable defense. "We employ a big team of threat researchers and data scientists, and through the innovation that we provide, we are very good at detecting these kinds of things," Steele told Cramer. Cramer also turned to a favorite technology play, Broadcom (AVGO), to look ahead at any possibly takeover candidates for the smart and voracious acquirer. The "Mad Money" host came up with two ideas. First was Xilinx (XLNX), a maker of programmable chips that shares its slice of the semiconductor space with Intel (INTC). "Why would Broadcom think to buy this one? First of all, it would give them more exposure to some very attractive end markets like communications, data centers, connected car, [and] aerospace, among others," Cramer said. Cramer also acknowledged the buzz around Broadcom possibly buying struggling Japanese electronics giant Toshiba (6502.T-JP), but said this cheaper buy is a riskier bet. "Given all of the consolidation in the semi space in recent years, there aren't that many attractive takeover candidates left, which is all the more reason for Broadcom to do the straightforward thing and buy Xilinx before someone else snaps it up instead. It wouldn't be cheap, but it would be worth it and no one could integrate this company or get more out of it than Broadcom can," he said. © Provided by CNBC Cramer has noticed over the years that big-name hedge fund managers tend not to comment on, or recommend, high-quality stocks to the average investor. "I bet most of the people who run big hedge funds likely wouldn't be caught dead owning any of those great stocks. If anything, they'd want to short them," the "Mad Money" host observed. From the countless investor letters, stories, and interviews Cramer has seen, he knows very well that no savvy hedge fund titan would dare come out and say he owned a great deal of stock. "The most you'll get out of them is that they aren't all that short…. or at least not yet," he said. In Cramer's lightning round, he flew through his take on some caller favorite stocks, including: AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV): "Well-run, inexpensive drug company. I'd be a buyer." Blackstone Group, LP (BX): "Went through that quarter. They did terrifically. With their IPO window opening, they can re-liquify. I think it's a buy. I've been saying that for a while, though."

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson By Reuters Apr 21, 2017 at 5:07 pm | Print View NEW YORK — Forget about French elections or the flagging Trump trade. Corporate America is set to unleash its biggest profit-reporting fest in at least a decade next week, with more than 190 members of the S&P 500 index delivering quarterly score cards, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices data. The lineup accounts for around 40 percent of the benchmark index’s value, or more than $7.7 trillion, and includes big names like Google’s parent Alphabet, Amazon.com, Microsoft and Exxon Mobil. The onslaught could keep stock investors’ focus largely on earnings next week even as the world’s attention is likely to be drawn elsewhere. Many strategists have attributed the 10 percent rally in the S&P 500 since Donald Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election to optimism Trump would boost the domestic economy through tax cuts and an infrastructure spending binge. Upbeat earnings from Morgan Stanley and other banks so far this reporting period cushioned geopolitical worries, helping push the S&P 500 up 0.9 percent this week, its best such performance in two months. Shares of smaller companies did even better, with S&P’s benchmark indexes for small and mid-cap stocks notching their best weeks of 2017, with gains of between two percent and thee percent. Expectations for the quarter’s profit growth have risen as well, and the first three months of the year now appear set to mark the strongest quarterly earnings growth in more than five years. In the past week alone, expected S&P 500 first-quarter earnings per share growth rose to 11.2 percent from 10.4 percent, a more than 7 percent jump, according to Thomson Reuters data. Just 76 companies reported this week compared with 134 in the comparable week a year ago. Next week’s rush will represent a 15 percent increase from the 166 S&P constituents that reported in the comparable week last year. Thursday will be the busiest day with nearly 70 reports due, including updates after the closing bell from Alphabet, Amazon, Intel Corp, Microsoft and Starbucks Corp. That could make for a bang in the market on Friday, which is also the final trading day of April, said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. Like what you're reading?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 23 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Embraer Receives Customers to Celebrate 20 Years of the ERJ 145 Jet Operations Rio de Janeiro, Brazil – April 11, 2017 – As part of the celebrations for the 20 years of commercial operation of the 50-seat ERJ 145 jet, Embraer receives, as of today, almost 30 operators of the jet family for the two-day Embraer Operators Conference (EOC), in Rio de Janeiro. The first commercial flight of the ERJ 145 occurred on April 6, 1997, with U.S. airline Continental Express. “The ERJ 145 marked Embraer’s commercial renaissance, paving the way for the development of new programs, such as the E-Jets, which moved the Company into the lead of the commercial jet market for up to 130-seat aircraft,” said Paulo Cesar de Souza e Silva, Embraer President & CEO. “Personally, I have a great affection for the program, which brought me to Embraer. I participated in practically all the jet’s sales campaigns as Vice President of Customer Financing.” The ERJ 145 family of jets consists of the ERJ 145 (50 seats), the ERJ 135 (37 seats), the ERJ 140 (44 seats) and the ERJ 145 XR (long-range 145 version). Since its entry into operation, the ERJ 145 family has accumulated more than 27 million flight hours and almost 730 million passengers transported, being used by more than 120 operators. Over the last seven years, the ERJ’s global customer base has almost doubled, from 39 operators, in 2010, to 70, today. During the same period, the application and use of ERJ models has been growing in emerging markets, such as Africa, where the ERJ fleet has increased from 16 units in 2010 to almost 60 jets in 2017. Robust and with excellent operating history, the ERJ platform is a success in commercial aviation, with almost 900 units delivered, having applications in the business aviation market, with the Legacy 600 and Legacy 650 jets, as well as in defense, such as the AEW&C, Multi-Intel and maritime patrol for the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) segment. In total, more than 1,200 aircraft based on the ERJ 145 platform have already been delivered worldwide, making the ERJ program one of the most successful in the aircraft industry.

But Adam Gopnik might have just written the one that puts all others to shame. In a way, it’s as much about us as it is about Trump. Here’s a taste: Our problem is not Trump Derangement Syndrome; our problem is Deranged Trump Self-Delusion. This is the habit of willfully substituting, as a motive for Trump’s latest action, a conventional political or geostrategic ambition, rather than recognizing the action as the daily spasm of narcissistic gratification and episodic vanity that it truly is… There is, perhaps, something not exactly reassuring but in its way tolerable about this delusion. It explains the real reason for the sudden willingness to imagine that Trump is capable of being “Presidential.” People who have acts and actions that add up to some coherent plan—or even to an evil scheme—tend to have an ideology. It possesses them, or they are possessed by it. With Trump, it is perfectly clear that he only has a series of episodic wounds and reactions—it’s all fears and fits. * Given that truth, Paul Ryan’s tribute to the mad king in TIME magazine makes it clear that he is beyond delusional. A businessman always willing to challenge convention, he has shaken up Washington and laid out an agenda of generational proportions. Never afraid of a battle, he has made it his mission to fight for those who feel forgotten. Where others would pivot, he stays true to who he is. Where others would turn back, he forges ahead. Up close, I have found a driven, hands-on leader, with the potential to become a truly transformational American figure. * Charles Pierce has a few choice words in response. There are not two consecutive words in that paragraph that are remotely true. But, if I were a speaker whose party caucus is in open revolt, and I were writing about a president* who at the moment has to dial one-and-an-area-code to reach mere incompetence, this is the kind of thing I would write. * Perhaps you saw that this happened: .@POTUS invited @SarahPalinUSA to dinner and told her to bring some friends pic.twitter.com/Okk6wVWpha — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) April 20, 2017 * I was going to ignore that one until I read what Jamelle Bouie had to say about it. First, he noted what went on at the White House during Obama’s presidency. Obama, in particular, brought a rotation of popular and esteemed black artists to the White House for performances and meetings, from singers and musicians like Beyoncé and Stevie Wonder to actors like Denzel Washington and Forest Whitaker to rappers like Kendrick Lamar, directors like Ava DuVernay, and documentarians like Deborah Riley Draper. This elevation of black art and black performance, from the first black president, was a statement of inclusion, a declaration that the story of American achievement is also the story of black art forms and black excellence. That the latter is an integral part of the former. These meetings weren’t political per se, but they were part of Barack Obama’s politics. Then Bouie provides some background about the people Trump just had over for dinner at the White House. I’ll simply sum it up with the fact that Ted Nugent once called President Obama a “subhuman mongrel.” Hence… [Trump] is, in other words, a president who ran a racist campaign, meeting with men and women who sell racial defiance to an angry multitude of white Americans. That image, of Trump and his visitors gathered around the Resolute desk in the Oval Office, sends a clear and unmistakable message. It’s one part cultural representation and one part cultural repudiation. It’s an attack on Obama, his legacy, and the ethos of inclusion he brought to the White House. And it’s a not-so-subtle declaration of victory. We took our country back, and now you have to live with it. * On a brighter note: Back on track: sent letters with @ConawayTX11 inviting Comey, Rogers, Brennan, Clapper and Yates to testify before House Intel Committee: pic.twitter.com/6WVUz5xuDQ — Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) April 21, 2017 * Finally, it looks like next week we’re going to get to hear from an adult again. Former President Barack Obama will speak to young people at the University of Chicago on Monday, returning to the city for what will be his first public event since leaving the White House. Obama and young leaders will hold a conversation on civic engagement and discuss community organizing at the university’s Logan Center for the Arts, his office announced Friday. Other than his work with initiatives like “My Brother’s Keeper,” it is clear that civic engagement will be a focus for Obama’s post-presidential activities. I look forward to watching that unfold.

Brian Barrett Security Date of Publication: 04.22.17. 04.22.17 Time of Publication: 8:00 am. 8:00 am Security News This Week: A Coachella Smartphone Thief Forgot About ‘Find My iPhone’ Christopher Polk/Getty Images Another week, another round of exploits and intrigue. The good news? North Korea didn’t do a nuclear test, as had been feared, and the missile launch it attempted went about as poorly as one could hope. The bad news is the continued brinksmanship that could spark armed regional conflict that quickly dominoes across the globe. But still! In non-NK news, the US reportedly wants to charge Julian Assange, which would have pretty serious First Amendment implications for journalists. And on another legal front, courts are using AI for sentencing, which rings alarm bells for civil liberties advocates. A sneaky new phishing attack could make fake websites appear not just legit but secure. We took a look at why encrypted phone calls haven’t quite taken off yet the way chat has. And Facebook rolled out a handy new feature in beta that will let you use your Facebook account to get back into other services you forgot your password for. Also,we’ve got SecureDrop now. Please use it to send us info securely and anonymously! And there’s more. Each Saturday we round up the news stories that we didn’t break or cover in depth but that still deserve your attention. As always, click on the headlines to read the full story in each link posted. And stay safe out there. Man Who Stole 100 iPhones at Coachella Forgot Find My iPhone Is a Thing Some people spend their time at Coachella enjoying the music. Others find love in unexpected places. And one, apparently walked around grabbing iPhones and stuffing over 100 of them into his backpack. Because technology contains wonders beyond all reasonable expectation, many of the victims immediately activated the “Find My iPhone” feature, allowing them not only to locate the alleged perp but literally follow him around the venue until security finally nabbed him. A nice reminder that crime doesn’t pay, especially dumb crime. Bose Knows: Headphone Company in Hot Water for Data Snooping Bose manufactures some terrific noise-canceling headphones. That’s good! The accompanying app that Bose encourages its customers to download allegedly tracks listening habits, and sells that information to data warehouses. That’s… less good. The allegation comes in a lawsuit filed this week in Chicago, which seeks “millions of dollars” for affected Bose owners. The act of collecting consumer data and selling it to third-party advertisers and such shouldn’t surprise; that funds most of the web at this point. The lawsuit makes the distinction, though, that the Bose privacy agreement doesn’t mention data collection, and even if it did, consumers don’t see it after downloading the app. Darpa Wants Secure Chips to Complement Software A hefty percentage of cybersecurity efforts focus on software solutions, which makes sense given how most of the problems are structured. But Darpa, the government’s tech-brain battalion, wants hardware to get a little more love. The agency says it can prevent up to 40 percent of current cyberattacks with more secure hardware. The ultimate goal? Processors that are smart enough to stave off software attacks without having to wait for a patch. There’s been some work in this area already—Intel bought McAfee a few years ago to help secure its processors, then sold off its majority stake last fall—but hopefully a nudge from Darpa will prompt some much-needed progress. Spies Among Us Surveillance: It’s not just for professionals! Motherboard this week ran an illuminating series on consumer-level snooping enabled by apps like FlexiSpy, and their disturbing implications. Go ahead and read them all if you have time, but especially the one that kicks the series off. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. hacks securedrop security security this week Skip Social.
