Brad Evans reveals overlooked names for Week 12 What's on the Menu at Intel's (INTC) 2016 Developer Forum? Afrasiab Mian ZacksAugust 16, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Share Tuesday saw the kickoff of the annual Intel INTC Developer Forum in San Francisco, CA. The event is an occasion for the company to dazzle consumers and 6,000 developers alike with its new products and strategic plans. Although Intel has seen difficulty in the chip market due to the major shift in consumer preference toward mobile devices, the company has plenty of new initiatives. One such market that Intel hopes to remain an integral part of is the so-called “Internet of Things” (IoT), which our team has discussed here. IoT refers to everyday items that are connected to a network and can communicate with each other in order to streamline various activities for consumers. This new market has seen the meteoric rise of cloud computing, with recent IPOs Twilio Inc. TWLO and Acacia Communications ACIA stocks soaring recently. Let’s take a look at what Intel has planned in order to maintain its foothold as a go-to tech company in the years to come. Virtual Reality Intel CEO Brian Krzanich spent a solid chunk of time on day one of the conference discussing Project Alloy, the company’s virtual reality (VR) headset, which does not need a PC to function. Intel plans on making the design for the headset public by the second half of next year, and is working with Microsoft MSFT to bring holographic capacity to all Windows 10 PCs within the same timeframe. Intel already has a major role in VR headsets that work with PCs. The company’s chips are used in Facebook’s FB Oculus Rift and Microsoft’s HoloLens. As we have noted, the VR market is still quite new and has a massive amount of potential. Intel wants to bring itself to the forefront of this technological revolution, and Project Alloy could be its first-class ticket there. Artificial Intelligence Another major technological development from the turn of the 21st century is the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). The world of AI is still uncharted, and has not only technological but ethical implications as well. In Intel’s case, we got a taste of AI through the RealSense camera, which is what powers Project Alloy as well as the company’s obstacle-avoiding drones. Intel is also offering Project Aero, a platform for consumers to create their own drones. By processing thousands of hours of visual data, these drones can be programmed to automatically fly around various obstacles. The general mechanism behind AI is encapsulated in the way the drone operates. Essentially, machines can parse massive troves of data in order to learn and adapt to performing various tasks. Apple’s AAPL Siri and other personal assistants are an example of AI, with unmanned robot arms in car factories serving as another application of the concept. Intel calls the RealSense camera “Visual Intelligence,” which will also be used in its other major undertaking: autonomous vehicles. Self-Driving Cars Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Elon Musk’s Tesla TSLA are key players in the push for self-driving cars, but that market is becoming more crowded with time. In late-June, Intel formed a partnership with driverless technology company Mobileye MBLY and BMW BAMXF to develop its own take on the self-driving car. The idea is that the camera will allow vehicles to avoid obstacles the same way the drones can, increasing driver safety and taking another step towards bringing the concept into the market. For more on the self-driving car market, check our team’s guide on the industry. Bottom Line Intel was once the leader of all things technology. It has since descended from that throne, but is slowly working its way towards regaining lost ground. There are more days ahead in the Developer Forum, so it will be interesting to see if and what other information is revealed. Intel currently sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) due to numerous upward earnings estimate revisions for the foreseeable future. Current quarter estimates stand at $0.66 compared to the $0.64 estimate of 60 days ago, while full-year estimates are up eight cents to $2.51 per share. Investors should keep an eye on how this storied company tries in its own way to bring the consumer into the world of tomorrow. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The firm says its headset, called Project Alloy, will offer 'mixed reality' - bridging the gap between VR headsets such as the Oculus Rift and AR headsets such as the Microsoft HoloLens, which projects holographic data onto the wearer's field of vision. The Intel system is also entirely wireless, meaning users will not need to be tethered to a powerful PC for it to run. Scroll down for video  The firm says its headset will offer 'mixed reality' - bridging the gap between VR headsets such as the Oculus Rift and AR headsets such as the Microsoft HoloLens. During his opening keynote at the 2016 Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco on Tuesday, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich unveiled Project Alloy, an all-in-one virtual reality solution made from the ground up.  'Merged reality delivers virtual world experiences more dynamically and naturally than ever before – and makes experiences impossible in the real world now possible,' he said. The firm is also working with Microsoft to use the same 'holographic engine'  its HoloLens uses, which it announced would be part of Windows 10 next year.

Share this article Share 21 shares 'Next year, we will be releasing an update to Windows 10, which will enable mainstream PCs to run the Windows Holographic shell and associated mixed reality and universal Windows applications,' Microsoft's Terry Myerson said. 'The Windows Holographic shell enables an entirely new experience for multi-tasking in mixed reality, blending 2D and 3D apps at the same time, while supporting a broad range of 6 degrees of freedom devices.'  The heaset includes Intel's RealSense, allowing it to track a user's hands and where they are without external sensors.  'With most VR and AR technologies available today, it’s challenging to merge physical, real-life movement and environments with simulated virtual objects, environments and actions, Krzanich wrote in a post explaining the new system. 'When it comes down to it, today’s virtual reality isn’t really that virtual.  'You often need a complex set of consoles, multiple sensors and cameras, and hand controllers. During his opening keynote at the 2016 Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco on Tuesday, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich unveiled Project Alloy, an all-in-one virtual reality solution made from the ground up. 'Merged reality delivers virtual-world experiences more dynamically and naturally than ever before — and makes experiences impossible in the real world now possible.'  'Through merged reality, see your hands, see your friends … see the wall you are about to run into,' the firm said. 'Using Intel RealSense technology, not only can you see these elements from the real world, but you can use your hands to interact with elements of your virtual world, merging realities. ' WHAT PROJECT ALLOY CAN DO  Intel CEO Brian Krzanich says the system will be allow user to: 'Pick up your real-world tennis racket in your living room and step virtually onto the court at Wimbledon.  'In doing so, forgo the cost — and creep factor — of installing high-end sensors in every corner of your living room normally needed to scan your environment. Instead just lean fully into practicing your back swing — bringing both your hand and your racket into the virtual field of play.  'Surge backward or forward, reach up or down, sway to the left or right — enjoy fully 6 degrees of total freedom in your movement.  'And take that virtual swing, without hitting that very real-world, and very expensive, table lamp several feet away from you.' He alo said it could put people into the middle of a concert. The heaset includes Intel's RealSense, allowing it to track a user's hands and where they are without external sensors. 'Experience a sporting event, a concert or a film scene from any point of view — and from any position.  'Walk onto the field and right into the goalie box, or join the huddle, looking over the quarterback’s shoulder to see the calls before they’re played.  'Stand on the stage with your favorite band and feel the love of the fans from their point of view.  'Choose your experience and navigate it. It’s all up to you. The virtual world doesn’t need to be virtual; it can be real.' That means you can 'cut the VR cord,' allowing a free range of motion with 6 degrees-of-freedom across a large space.  'This, combined with collision detection and avoidance, enables the user to utilize physical movement to explore a virtual space,' Intel says.  Intel is collaborating with Microsoft to optimize Windows-based content and experiences on Intel-based VR devices such as Alloy. Intel will open the Alloy hardware and provide open APIs for the ecosystem, allowing developers and partners to create their own branded products from the Alloy design, in 2017.   Share or comment on this article e-mail 21 shares Most watched News videos Cyclist films moment car causes him to crash then drives away Gruesome moment Korean chef dissects a LIVE octopus Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Teen films a burning 'meteorite' moving across sky in Japan Shocking moment man hits women in mass chicken shop fight Mystery homeless woman in Rome avoids questions from reporter Supermodel Gigi Hadid fights off man who grabs her at Milan show Kim Kardashian attacked in Paris by notorious prankster Funny moment blonde woman dancing on roadside causes car crash 'Die baby, die': Two women admit to 'dementia doll' abuse Doorman knocks-out troublemaker during two-on-one confrontation The moment a 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit Fukushima Six rebel electors have signed an agreement to try to block...

The deal, announced today at the Intel Developer Forum, is a strategic move from the Santa Clara, CA company to offer its large-scale custom chip manufacturing facilities, which include 10-nanometer production lines, to third-parties, including those using its rival's technology. I have a ton of Intel ARM devices already. Perhaps Intel could call these new chips "XScale". Just thought that up. I'm kind of proud of it.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Intel's Joule developer board looks to challenge Raspberry Pi. Credit: Intel More like this IDF 2016: Powerful chips, robot brains, and super-fast data lasers Raspberry Pi 3 review: The revolutionary $35 mini-PC cures its biggest... Raspberry Pi Alternatives Emerge to Fill Need for Speed Video Reality check on the Internet of Things Intel has unleashed a new competitor to Raspberry Pi 3 with its new Joule development board, which packs in superior graphics and wireless connectivity. The chipmaker has loaded the development board with technology found in regular PCs: a 64-bit quad-core Atom processor, 4K graphics, 802.11ac connectivity, and DDR4 memory features. However, Joule doesn't compete on price with the Raspberry Pi, which sells for US$35. A high-end version of the Joule board is on sale at the Intel Developer Forum this week for $369.99. [ Download the State of the CIO 2016 report ] The Joule will provide big-time computing power for robots, drones, smart devices, and wearables. Like Raspberry Pi, Joule supports flavors of Linux and the Windows 10 IoT Core operating systems. Joule also supports Intel's 3D RealSense camera, which is being used in drones and robots, as well as virtual reality and augmented reality headsets. The camera can recognize gestures, track objects, measure distances, and if programmed correctly, recognize human emotions. The camera helps drones and robots avoid collisions. Price aside, the challenge for Intel is to get developers to accept the board. Intel's previous boards haven't been widely accepted, and many projects using Intel boards have been driven by the chipmaker. The Raspberry Pi has sold in the millions, and it has a thriving software development ecosystem around it. At IDF Tuesday, Intel showed the Joule chipset being used in a bartending robot and motorcycle helmet. But an interesting use was in a pair of smart glasses, helping a quality control worker conduct real-time analysis, with the glasses buzzing when there were problems with products.  This is by far the fastest of Intel's development boards, including Galileo Gen2 and Edison, which haven't been upgraded for years. Intel also offers the tiny Curie system used in wearables. Curie is also used in BMX bikes and in skateboards, providing real-time statistics to TV audiences. The Joule boards are available in two configurations. The Joule 570x has a 1.7GHz Atom T5700 processor, 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM, and 16GB of storage. The Joule 550x will have a 1.5GHz Atom T5500 CPU, 3GB of LPDDR4 memory, and 8GB of storage. The Joule systems will support 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0, and USB 3.0. Like many developer boards, they will have standard GPIO, I2C and UART interfaces. To comment on this article and other CIO content, visit us on Facebook, LinkedIn or Twitter.

DJIA S&P 500 NASDAQ Markets Today Intel Makes a VR Bet; Microsoft Adds to its AR Bet; Ford Steps Up Its Self-Driving Efforts Here's a look at major tech stories in the news. Eric Jhonsa Aug 16, 2016 7:09 PM EDT Intel shows off a VR headset that doesn't need to be paired with a PC or phone Intel (INTC)  is intent on not getting left out as virtual reality and augmented reality headsets get launched left and right. The chip giant has used its latest Developer Forum to unveiled Project Alloy, a reference design for a virtual reality headset that -- unlike Facebook's (FB) Oculus Rift, HTC's Vive or Sony's (SNE) PlayStation VR -- doesn't need to be paired with a high-end PC or gaming console to function. Facebook is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio. Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells FB? Learn more now. Rather, all of its processing power, no doubt provided by Intel silicon, is housed inside the headset. As is the case with many of its other hardware efforts, Intel's goal isn't to sell large quantities of hardware, but to sell chips to OEM partners whom it hopes will adopt its reference designs. Intel also promises Alloy headsets will be able to take in content from a user's real-world environment and bring it inside a virtual world. In addition, unlike the aforementioned rival hardware platforms, Alloy doesn't need any external sensors or cameras to be placed in the room where a headset is being used, or even any handheld controllers. These features are enabled by Intel's RealSense depth-sensing/motion-tracking camera technology. Alloy isn't alone in taking an all-in-one approach to VR: AMD (AMD) , which has worked hard to optimize its GPUs for VR, is partnering with startup Sulon Technologies to develop a headset that doesn't need any pairing.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums The budget CPU overclocking dream may still be alive at Intel by Jeff Kampman  5:55 PM on August 16, 2016 Intel's Pentium Anniversary Edition chip was a surprise to us when it launched a little over two years ago. Sure, that 53W chip offered just two cores and two threads, but the thing overclocked to 4.8GHz and kept pace with much beastlier chips from Intel and AMD in our review. Good times were had, and the chip became a fixture of our budget builds. When Skylake rolled around, however, a G3258 replacement wasn't among the many dual-core parts at the base of the towering sixth-gen Core processor model lineup. This omission made us sad. Sure, the Core i3-6100 is a great chip, but its $125 price tag is nearly double that of the $70 the Pentium Anniversary Edition still commands. In budget builds where every dollar counts, $55 could be the difference between a lower-end graphics card or a more powerful one, to name just one potential trade-off. Intel overclocking honcho Dan Ragland held a session about the overclocking features in Broadwell-E and Skylake processors today, and I caught up with him after to inquire about the prospect of future Pentium AE-esque products in upcoming generations of the company's CPUs. While Ragland unsurprisingly wouldn't commit to any definite statements about Intel's product roadmap, he did indicate that the extreme overclocking community has expressed strong interest in a Pentium AE successor, and that the company has been thinking about ways to expand processor overclocking to more value-oriented chips in the future. That's a glimmer of hope for those of us who just want to have fun with cheap CPUs. I wouldn't get too excited about the prospect of a Kaby Lake Pentium AE-type chip, though. Ragland cautions that Intel's first job is to turn a profit, and it doesn't take a genius to see that it's easier to get strong margins out of $220-$320 quad-core parts and $1650 ten-core CPUs than it is to justify a $70 part that can beat those chips at their own game. That said, whether strong per-core performance will rule thread count in the era of DirectX 12 and Vulkan, as it did when the Pentium G3258 first broke onto the scene, remains murky. We will never, ever complain about stronger IPC performance, but some very informal testing on our part shows that well-coded Vulkan titles like Doom can achieve Skylake Core i7-like performance on older eight-core AMD hardware, all else being equal. That behavior suggests Intel might not be at as much risk of cannibalizing its own model lineup with a strong dual-core part today as it might have been in the past. Whatever seventh-generation Core chips look like, eight-thread or even 20-thread chips might deliver performance commensurate with those bigger numbers in the future better than they do today.   Even with all that in mind, overclocking began as a way of beating The Man—the Mendocino Celeron 300A and its effortless 50% clock speed headroom is just one example. Given that heritage, it's no shock that Intel would rather not release another officially-sanctioned chip that can punch out parts higher in its model lineup. Still, Ragland didn't agree with my description of the Anniversary Edition chip as an anomaly in Intel's modern lineup, so I guess we'll just need to take his advice and stay tuned.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Intel unveiled a new virtual reality initiative dubbed “Project Alloy” during the Intel Developer Forum (IDF) on Tuesday. Project Alloy is a virtual reality headset that runs Windows Holographic, the special version of Windows that also powers Microsoft HoloLens, Slashgear explained. Unlike other PC-based solutions, Intel’s Project Alloy includes the full computing experience right inside the headset; there’s no need to plug it into a separate computer. The downside to that is the relative size of the headset that’s required to power the whole experience; Slashgear described it as “bulky,” and indeed that seems to be the case. Also, Intel might be the first with this form of VR headset, but there are other wireless options. Project Alloy, a 1st gen #VR solution – imagine merging realities and experience your world differently #IDF16 pic.twitter.com/ZUrKDZ57hT — Intel (@intel) August 16, 2016 Take, for example, Samsung and Oculus’ Gear VR. It’s powered by a smartphone, isn’t too bulky and doesn’t require a separate computer. Indeed, your phone is the computer that powers the whole Gear VR experience. Intel is trying to push the boundaries of what VR is capable of, however, by integrating motion sensors so that someone who wears Project Alloy can walk around. That’s something you certainly can’t safely do with a Gear VR. Slashgear said Intel plans to launch Project Alloy as a platform so that partners, those who no doubt want to use its RealSense cameras and processors, can launch devices built on the platform. Microsoft, as a partner, will provide Windows Holographic as the underlying software. The Allow Open Platform is expected to open to Intel’s partners during the second half of next year.

While no concrete details about the 7th Generation of Intel Core products lines were given, we were offered a couple of bits of information to tide the hype until a full launch. On the stage, support for HEVC Main10 Profile was announced with 7th Gen, although it was unclear if this was decode only or encode as well. This is still a step up from Skylake support, where Main10 required hybrid hardware/software decoding acceleration. Moving it into hardware for Kaby Lake will help with performance and power consumption, particularly of 4K content where HEVC vs. H.264 differences are bigger than Full-HD. The demo on stage showed GoPro software taking 4K data from six cameras and being able to switch between the content of each camera without stuttering or delay, on a 2-in-1 mobile device. For gaming, we were treated to a demonstration of Overwatch being run off of the 7th Gen IGP. That being said, it was not mentioned what the resolution or quality the game was running at, and V-Sync was not enabled. Intel clarified that the demos on the stage were from their highest performance CPUs, but the fact that only 2-in-1s were on display demonstrates that Kaby Lake will be focused on mobile first. The HP and Dell prototypes also add to the ASUS prototypes we saw at Computex earlier in the year. Intel stated that 7th Gen CPUs are already in the hands of partners, ready for production devices, and we should expect to see them in the hands of consumers this autumn.  Again, given the focus, it seems we will encounter Kaby Lake in mobile form factors (4W and 15W) before anything on desktop.

POST A COMMENT 35 Comments View All Comments Black Obsidian - Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - link As the owner of an Ivy Bridge-based NUC doing HTPC duty, I've been waiting for HEVC Main10 decode support (and HDMI 2.0) to upgrade. Looks like that'll be happening soon. Reply edzieba - Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - link Are you sure you haven't been waiting for High Profile 10-bit support, not Main Profile? For media playback (BD and it's UHD successor) on an HTPC, High Profile support is the relevant encoding profile needed for playback. Reply Black Obsidian - Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - link Full hardware support for High Profile would be ideal, but even partial support would be something. My Ivy Bridge NUC does H265 entirely in software, and chokes on 1080p content if there's any significant amount of on-screen movement. Reply nandnandnand - Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - link All I care about is how Kaby Lake mobile will do vs. Zen mobile APUs. Reply yannigr2 - Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - link It will have (much) higher IPC compared to Zen, (much) better energy efficiency compared to Zen and completely destroyed by Zen in the graphics section. Reply psychobriggsy - Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - link 1. Unknown as yet, IPC is likely to be in the same ballpark though (finally!) even if KL edges it by a few percent. Clock speeds at various TDPs and real-life battery usage are what matter in the end and these figures are a way off being tested. Maybe even Cannonlake will be the competition, not KL. 2. Unproven as yet - AMD had to implement a lot of energy saving on 28nm APUs and these will be migrated to 14nm APUs 3. Zen is a CPU core and doesn't do graphics. The Zen-based APU will likely use Vega level graphics however, and totally destroy the Intel graphics in all aspects. Reply TheinsanegamerN - Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - link vega level would take too much power. something 460 sized would be about as big as a 125 watt APU could take. If they solve the bandwidth problem though, it would still be a major advantage over intel. Reply MrSpadge - Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - link By "Vega level" he means it's based on the same architecture level, not the size & performance of the chip. Reply smilingcrow - Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - link 3. Mobile these days generally means 15W or even less so it's not safe to assume that AMD's inherently better graphics prowess will allow them to compete with Intel at these power levels as it depends a lot on how good their fabrication partner is. Reply TheinsanegamerN - Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - link all massive assumptions, given that intel typically lags behind GPU wise and we have yet to see zen cpus in action.

Email Address:  Photo courtesy Intel Intel Reveals Project Alloy, an All-in-one VR Headset With Mobile Positional Tracking By Ben Lang - Aug 16, 2016 49 407SHARES FacebookTwitterRedditLinkedinSubscribe The Entire VR Industry in One Little Email The Daily Roundup is our comprehensive coverage of the VR industry wrapped up into one daily email, delivered directly to your inbox.  Email Address Today at the Intel Developer Forum event in San Francisco, Intel revealed Project Alloy, an all-in-one mobile virtual reality headset which the company says will launch in 2017 as an “open platform.” On stage at IDF 2016, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich unveiled the new headset during the opening keynote. The Alloy headset, which has fully on-board processing and sensors, is said to be capable of tetherless virtual reality, thanks to an ‘inside-out’ positional tracking solution which doesn’t rely on external trackers. Photo courtesy Intel Tech specs on Project Alloy are slim for the time being, but the headset is said to have its own on-board processor (confirmed to be a “PC-class” 6th-generation Intel Core processor), as well as an array of the company’s ‘RealSense‘ cameras which handle a range of computer-processing functions. See Also: Oculus CTO Affirms Positional Tracking Priority for Gear VR Intel says that, tanks to RealSense, the headset will be capable of hand-detection, and it’s likely that the cameras will also track the space surrounding the user in order to provide tracking data. The company also says the headset is capable of “collision detection and avoidance,” enabling users to traverse large volumes of space without running into walls and other objects. We’ve seen inside-out positional tracking solutions attempted by a number of different companies; so far, we haven’t seen any that are robust or performant enough for real-world VR usage. SEE ALSO Intel Developing an Augmented Reality Headset Using RealSense, Report Suggests Intel further says that the headset will support mixed reality (which they’re calling “merged reality”), allowing applications to combine parts of the virtual world with the virtual world. For now, Intel is tight lipped on specs like resolution, field of view, weight, and battery life. But the company says that Project Alloy will be released in 2017 as an open reference design, upon which partners can build their own branded headsets. Photo courtesy Intel With a ‘hanging’ head mount design, Project Alloy’s ergonomics are decidedly more like Sony’s PlayStation VR headset than the Oculus Rift of HTC Vive. That’s good news, as we’ve found Sony’s headset to be among the most comfortable out there. IDF 2016 runs for the next two days, so we may see more of Project Alloy yet.

TAGS intel intel alloy intel headset intel project alloy intel vr headset Ben Lang Sebastien Mathieu and another headset in the bandwagon!!!, this is gonna be soooo confusing for the average users…. Will Should be OK if it works with Steam VR games, even better if Oculus supports it kalqlate Nope. The “average” user will simply say, “Hmm… I use Windows at home and at work, and this thing runs Windows without a cord. Yes, I’ll take this one. Thanks!” HTC Vive will quickly evolve to this platform. Oculus, on the other hand, will do the wrong thing and spin their wheels trying to get Zuck his money back, but with Intel, Microsoft, all of their partners, and EVERY maker group around the world making their own Alloy headsets, Oculus will finally give in or perish. Bob I agree that Oculus need to pull their head out of their ass and start getting to work on the next iteration. It’s a shame to see the ones that revitalized virtual reality through crowdfunding are now at the back of the queue in terms of consumer interest. It’s almost guaranteed at this point that their research team is working hard on delivering a headset device with significantly improved resolution, which is still a problem for all vr devices including this one, and a much wider fov. The first company to deliver at least 4K resolution per eye and 180 degree field of view in a simple lightweight package with excellent ergonomics and a strong software infrastructure to boot will eventually lead the pack. Price may still be an issue but for a device with these kind of technical specifications it’s hard not to salivate for one. For some reason I have a feeling Facebook have got something cooking up their sleeves. kalqlate With all the endless river of money they have backing them, I would hope Facebook has got something cooking. It had better be spicy and delicious. I think it’s too late for them to compete in the general market long term. What I see them doing instead is create Rift-exclusive access to the upcoming Facebook VR platform, a place where Facebook members can share their profiles and activities in slick and engaging VR environments, invite their friends into cool VR environments for immersive games and real-time telepresence activities, and to record VR activities/vlogs for later sharing. Given the billion+ users Facebook has, even if just 1% participate in Facebook VR, that will be 10 million Rift units sold in just one or two years. Estimating $100 profit on each sell of the Rift, that would get Zuck back half of his outlay in the first one or two years. If Facebook VR turns out to be a hit, and I suspect it will, the year following that will bring ten times the number of participants, thus 10 times the Rift sells, but they’ll have to keep Facebook VR exclusive to Rift for two to three years. Maybe they’ll allow Gear VR access, but that’s about it. After Zuck has made enough $billions off of Rift, he’ll announce Facebook VR compatibility with other VR devices, perhaps in the third or fourth years of its existence. Nigerian Wizard “a ‘PC-class’ 6th-generation Intel Core processor”. Jesus. Are we going to have to install fucking fans on our heads? Texazzpete It’s been a while since the first fanless Core M processors came out. Why the heck are you ignorant about fanless Intel Core CPUs? Nigerian Wizard This isn’t a core M processor. This is a gimped full fledged PC processor. kalqlate Look at the 15-watt’ers on the following page before YOUR core processor overheats: http://ark.intel.com/products/family/88392/6th-Generation-Intel-Core-i7-Processors#@All. Not even enough heat for an ant trying to use it as a foot warmer. Get Schwifty! Yeah, I too am curious about this Intel chip application… and power with heat especially with the inside-out tracking load. OTOH, the fact Intel is actually taking notice and developing a product that isn’t just a repeat of the Vive/Rift approach is refreshing. It’s also intriguing that both VIve and Rift might have made design errors in the ergonomics if it’s really the case that the “hanging head” design really is that much more comfortable. Will Somebody’s gotta do it. Releasing it as a reference design for partners seems promising. Wish everyone would get on that PSVR ergonomics tip too. Oh, and hot-swappable batteries… Augure Hot swappable battery is an horrible, wasting, polluting solution and shouldn’t exist anymore in 2016. If you need your batterie to be swapped on a headset that should be use more than 3 hours by a single user, then you’re doing things way wrong. Will It seems like half the promise of mobile VR is essentially larping, or large scale multiplayer experiences, competitive or otherwise. The value of being able to re-up your power source on the go without “jacking-out” appears inherent, particularly in a competitive long form scenario. As to it being wasteful, I’m not sure how hot-swappable batteries are more polluting than batteries that require you to power down and reboot your device to install. user2 i dont think that it is a good idea. vr as an addition to a mobile phone, a pc or a console is much more attractive than another computer. a vr version of the nuc with a headset, that’s what they should make imho. kalqlate The following article gives a little more details and alludes to the idea that the device will also be compatible with “mainstream PCs”, perhaps in an optional tethered mode: https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602189/intel-and-microsoft-are-teaming-up-to-make-virtual-reality-ubiquitous. Augure What a huge missed opportunity. Everyone’s waiting for such a untethered VR headset that use a RealSense/Leap/Kinect like sensors to do dual-lens AR, reverse tracking and hand tracking. But a having a bulky and useless “PC-Class” module attached to it, instead of going for the other thing everyone is waiting for, you now, actual fucking wireless in 2016? Because this is never going to be as portable and versatile as a smartphone or as powerful and complete as a PC, the Intel processor is useless, especially with their notoriously crappy video cards. What a missed opportunity damn. Let’s see what Google Daydream will bring, Google is one of those hysterically stupid and inefficient companies with all the keys in their hands that they yet don’t use. Texazzpete They could also go for starships to fly to a nearby galaxy. Just because you want something doesn’t mean the tech is available and economically feasible. Augure STFU you loser. Texazzpete Your childish posts are all the more amusing since you’re almost certainly an adult. Grow up. Augure It’s better to be a vulgar adult, than a completely stupid worthless adult loser like you. I’m talking about your previous comment specifically, not you of course. Rob H You realise there’s not situation where you don’t look like a baby throwing his dummy out the pram, right? Do you think the manufacturers just like wires? “But a having a bulky and useless “PC-Class” module attached to it, instead of going for the other thing everyone is waiting for, you now, actual fucking wireless in 2016?” Having a dense useless idiot commenting on a post about the progression of VR technology demanding things that are currently technologically unfeasible, instead of going for the thing everyone is waiting for you to do, get a fucking education in 2016? Augure Or instead, don’t be a fucking sub-human loser dragging the human race down when it’s literally a news: http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/09/04/quark-vr-wireless-htc-vive-prototype/ And actually…not a news since there are dozens of tech comps doing this since I don’t know…2/3 years already. And more importantly these companies are few, sometimes one man endeavour with no budget while big companies are not even fucking doing their job. Or the worse being that because of unperceptive limited monkeys like you who don’t get shit about the world, the market sociological mechanics and technological momentum VR might either drag for 10 years before picking-up. And please, it’s 2016 and it’s the internet, these insult are not personal they’re poetically vulgar expression of the violent emotion I feel when I read stupid shit like yours, I don’t care of have anything against you. Rob H Sorry you feel facts and intelligence are “dragging the human race down” so i’m I’m guessing you have autism as it’s the only explanation for your retarded comments. And just because my little cousin believes in the tooth fairy doesn’t mean she exists, no more than just because you believe the crap your writing makes working wireless hmds a reality. If you want wireless hmds, you’re talking future tech, not current. Valve seems to be the closest as far as im aware as they have claimed they’re working in conjunction with another company (cant remember who) and have a demo due “this fall” but clearly stated its not ready as they still haven’t overcome all the technical difficulties related to the limited transfer rate of data wireless connections have. I mean, fair enough, you could argue there are already wireless hmds – get google cardboard and stream your pc to your phone. That doesn’t mean its any good and ready for serious use. Go fucking educate yourself before you continue spouting bullshit and making an even bigger fool of yourself than you already have. BUT, i’d be quite happy to be proven wrong on this. I’m willing to let you prove how right you are and how wrong I am, here’s your chance to prove you’re right -> Go ahead, list the “dozens of tech companies” with these working wireless hmds that are consumer grade technology matching those on the market – but of course we who actually have these things called braincells know that’s not something you can do and that statement was in fact a complete fabrication, but go ahead try, ill wait; BTW I’m expecting a list of at the very least 24 seeing as you’ve stated there’s at least this many. P.s. do you really think anyone is offended by “loser” – it’s clear as day just reading the first couple of sentences of your misinformed whiny posts that you’re the only one here with no real life friends xD You’re attitude is exactly the same as some spoilt little brat as Christmas crying because Santa’s elves didn’t bring you the fully functional iron man suit you demanded on your list. Grow the fuck up and wake up to reality. Augure Oh so you’re bigoted against people with autism? Yet you’re the one who don’t know how to fucking read (and Google)? I POSTED you the most recent factual news about wireless HMD and told you there are dozens of companies with wireless VR technologies under the form of processors, wireless antennas or even actual HMDs you fucking loser. “I mean, fair enough, you could argue there are already wireless hmds – get google cardboard and stream your pc to your phone” wait so you even make the statement yourself you fucking degenerate? Wireless HMD is a MUST-HAVE for mass-market adoption, like hand-motion tracking is, and all manufacturers are starting (a little late) to realise it, probably because the domain is circled by unperceptive ignorant losers like you who think that something that is not only feasible and actually obligatory doesn’t even exist. Rob H Never said anything is bad about being autistic, i hold nothing against you for it as it’s not like you can help it but it does explain your pathetic bullshit rant. And yeh you posted a link to one hmd that are TRYING to create a consumer quality wireless headset and have clearly stated themselves THE TECH ISN’T FUCKING READY YET. It’s not “starting a little late” at all, it’s technically unfeasable at this point as has been the entire development cycle of VR headsets so far. Most developers that have released hmds have nearly all stated they’d love it to be wireless but at this point in time, it’s simply not possible to have a quality, consumer level vr experience and it also be wireless. There’s plenty of research into its development – This doesn’t mean they can suddenly pull a working one out a magicians hat. Seriously, stop acting like some spoilt little shit just because you don’t actually have a clue how the real world works. Are you simply suggesting manfacturers and developers should just stop trying to give consumers products they want and are the best of what is currently available in terms of technology because you think they should only release technology that doesn’t even exist yet? Do you think when the first b&w box tvs were released they should have waited instead til the flatscreen 4k 3d hdr tvs were ready instead? Seriously, learn what product & industry progression are. And, I’m still waiting for these “dozens” of examples, sounds like there are so many you’ll have no problems listing at least 24 with these working wireless consumer grade hmds. So please, go ahead…(oh, and using an example that have themselves admitted that their tech isn’t anything like ready yet isn’t supporting your argument xD It support the fact you’re acting like some spoil brat demanding things that’s not yet possible.) As for your last paragraph, are you actually that dense? The only ignorant person here is you as you obviously live in some fantasy land…wireless hmd tech is simply not fucking ready yet no matter how much you throw your dummy out the pram over it. It’s being researched, get it into your thick head. It’s not going to suddenly leap a couple of years forward technology wise just because some sad little shit like you is demanding it in the comment section.Neither should the rest of the world not be able to buy things that are the best currently available because you want something that’s simply not possible at this point in time. Grow up user2 i still hope that daydream will be just that: a headset with tango and maybe a screen which connects to your smartphone. all smartphone manufacturers have their low(er) cost headsets already, so daydream must be something else. Augure Yup a high-end Tango enabled smartphone would open many doors. As far as the Galaxy S8 rumours go in terms of resolution, ram etc…seems to be going the right way, but clearly VR has been lagging too much. Will Project Alloy is a self-contained device; there is no need for an attached “module”. It is indeed what you describe waiting for, an untethered headset with inside-out positional tracking, dual lense AR, and hand tracking. As for wireless, I read about a solution here that the military uses for their simulations that seems to work stable, and is on its way to the consumer market (though it requires a pendant or hip pack, because *). Unfortunately there are still two problems with this: first, unless it can operate on a citywide scale through an integrated network, it will never be able to offer a truly free roaming experience, and even then doubtfully ever in rural areas. Secondly, *almost no one wants a radio transmitter that close to their brain. Augure Consumer version doesn’t mean military use. If you can use Internal AR headset with a regular PC or mobile HMD, it’d be great to use at home, office or exhibitions first and foremost. The main problem here is that nobody wants to NOT be able to use their own system, PC or mobile, AND have to use a limited and supplementary one which adds to the bulk of the headset. In fact I wished their was a project allow that would either get rid of this bulk and be usable with any computer with a simple cable OR have a high-end smartphone system like mobile HMDs. But then, that’s why the absolute best solution, is still going to be a Smartphone VR Headset with the capability of the Alloy, which I think only Google Tango seems to be cable of now. Will It all depends on the cost of the thing. If it’s in the ballpark of the Rift and Vive, and you can also tether it to a computer, then it’s a home run. Even if it’s somewhat more expensive, the value that it offers is exceptional. To have a full PC experience on the go can’t be understated. I love my Gear VR, but it’s not quite the same, and I’m constantly paranoid about scratching the screen; it also doesn’t tether to a PC. The S7 is an $800 investment as well, and if I don’t need my phone to double as a VR headset, I can spend a lot less on it. That being said, I actually really like the idea of Project Tango being integrated with Daydream. Hopefully that comes to pass. I’ve always wanted a phone that’s powerful enough to be the guts of a family of products, like a tablet shell, laptop case, home console, and VR headset all powered by a beast of a phone. There’s always Magic Leap to think about as well. If you’re interested in the wireless military tech that’s moving to consumer, here’s that link: http://www.roadtovr.com/serious-simulations-claim-their-zero-frame-latency-tech-can-make-vr-headsets-wireless/ Taziar The only way to have wireless video would be lossy video compression, reducing quality. Further, it takes quite a bit of processing power to compress 90hz 1080p+ video real time. Processing power already being used to create the content. And most importantly, compressing, transmitting, and decompressing video adds latency, the biggest killer of VR immersion. Augure True, wireless video has to be lossless which would means raw quality and no-latency. Such wireless video processor are at the horizon but the standards, codecs and such have to be pushed and experimented with now. kalqlate This current new generation of VR is still evolving. There is still ample room to innovate. The following article, which gives a little extra detail, informs… Myerson also boasted that Intel and Microsoft had found ways to run virtual-reality applications on less powerful PCs than the ones the Oculus and HTC headsets rely on. https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602189/intel-and-microsoft-are-teaming-up-to-make-virtual-reality-ubiquitous Have you personally experienced HaloLens? If a VR version has computing built in and proper FOV, how is that not a great solution? (Bear in mind that the consumer price of such a device will surely come in at less than $999.) The reason why no one is doing wireless is because there’s still way too much latency in wirelessly transmitting the computed hi-res video to the headset. When that is finally conquered, then, yes… your wireless VR dreams will come true. Augure The Headset is too bulky, it actually makes the untethered cord point moot. Also nobody wants to use a untethered VR headset that isn’t connected to an actual computer or smartphone platform. I’ve experienced HoloLens, it was a letdown until it actually made me understand that AR glasses are not around the corner at all and are in the 5-10 years horizon before they can reach current VR headset standards. That’s why I said I’ve been waiting for a Internal AR/VR Headset like this one but if I can’t using with my actual system, be it computer, console or smartphone, it’s completely useless. In fact that’s the most sought after functionality of the Gear/Mobile VR: untethered AND cabled streaming from different machines. kalqlate You lamented: The Headset is too bulky, it actually makes the untethered cord point moot. All VR headsets are bulky. The key to success is comfort for long-term use. That’s the point of the Alloy design as indicated at the end of this article: With a ‘hanging’ head mount design, Project Alloy’s ergonomics are decidedly more like Sony’s PlayStation VR headset than the Oculus Rift of HTC Vive. That’s good news, as we’ve found Sony’s headset to be among the most comfortable out there. As you know, once you’re immersed in VR, the bulk of the headset doesn’t matter… except if its weight is present on your face. The Alloy design mitigates that better than the Oculus and Vive designs. Therefore, bulk (size) is only an issue when you’re looking at it from the outside. Who cares when you’re on the inside? You said: Also nobody wants to use a untethered VR headset that isn’t connected to an actual computer or smartphone platform. :D Nobody? :D Clairvoyant Augure knows all, sees all. :D Actually, your statement makes no sense. For computer use, most people’s current systems are not up to spec for tethered VR headsets. Solution: buy a new, more powerful computer, For phone use, either people will be satisfied with Cardboard quality or will buy a new, more powerful Samsung smartphone (that they don’t currently have) for use with Gear VR. Therefore, introducing a device that has on-board rendering power somewhere between Gear VR and a PC is the smarter purchase when a purchase is most likely necessary anyway. I’m currently satisfied with my Nexus phone. I do not want to buy a new Samsung phone or other high-quality phone just to experience Gear VR or any other high-quality phone-based VR. Further, it has been recently revealed that Microsoft has filed a patent for a HaloLens type device that has a shield that electronically darkens and lightens to support AR/VR/MR in one device. Seriously, why would you desire to be tethered to a box in one room when if that box can be shrunk into your untethered headset, you can roam your ENTIRE 3-D mapped home or office as if it were dark and spooky catacombs, a future spaceport, or expansive museum? You said: I’ve experienced HoloLens, it was a letdown until it actually made me understand that AR glasses are not around the corner at all and are in the 5-10 years horizon before they can reach current VR headset standards. Too bad you were disappointed by HaloLens. I went into my demo being extremely skeptical of the puny FOV. However, I was quite pleasantly surprised when it didn’t spoil the AR effect at all. The sense of immersion was complete for me. You said: That’s why I said I’ve been waiting for a Internal AR/VR Headset like this one but if I can’t using with my actual system, be it computer, console or smartphone, it’s completely useless. “Completely useless”??? :D … that’s a good one! Along with the “nobody” above, you’re showing that you’re prone to exaggeration. To repeat the quote from the article I previously cited and presented in my prior comment: Myerson also boasted that Intel and Microsoft had found ways to run virtual-reality applications on less powerful PCs than the ones the Oculus and HTC headsets rely on. This may be alluding to the idea that Alloy can be tethered or untethered. I get the same impression about Google’s Daydream device. On this point, we’ll have to wait and see. We should know in December this year when the specs are revealed. :) Sorry that we’re not five to ten years in the future for the type of device you’re looking for. What you see in devices like Alloy and HaloLens is current state-of-the-art. Maybe Magic Leap’s upcoming device will satisfy all of your desires. Until then, you can just sit it out while many many others of us enjoy what is available or nearly available. Augure What you or I think doesn’t matter, unless you work in prospective. NOBODY, meaning a too unsignificant portion of the market will want a project Alloy, which means this project will disappear and is useless (given they’re rarely iterated when they fail). But I can agree that the integrated computing is not so much a problem, in fact you made me realise it might even find used in untethered situation like pre-installed experiences for exhibitions, augmented gaming etc… The main problem is when using it as a system, nobody wants to have an additional device that is neither a versatile smartphone nor a powerful computer. And if there’s not way to use/tether it with a PC then this is not a good VR usage solution, just a limited untethered showcase solution. As for Magic Leap, since it’s vaporware I’d rather wait for Daydream. kalqlate The main problem is when using it as a system, nobody wants to have an additional device that is neither a versatile smartphone nor a powerful computer. I will leave it to you to answer the question: What percentage of people who would like to experience VR from time to time have a phone or computer system that is NOW compatible with VR other than Cardboard? I have a Nexus 5, and I’m COMPLETELY happy with it. I have a PC that is fully high-end VR capable, but I absolutely will not opt in on tethered VR, though I have experienced and love both the Rift and Vive. I’m sure that there are many others like me… as indicated by the relatively slow sales of VR headsets. Google DayDream will be a great solution for those who are ready to buy a new phone. For people like me, who aren’t interested in a new phone or the tethered experience, an Alloy is the ticket. You say “nobody” because you feel strongly about your needs and wants. Remember though… not everyone is you. :) you made me realise it might even find used in untethered situation like pre-installed experiences for exhibitions, augmented gaming, etc. Why just “pre-installed”? Headsets like Alloy and Daydream map your environment. There is already software that will RE-map the corridors and rooms of one environment to another environment, and I’m sure such algorithms will be employed in “experiences for exhibitions, augmented gaming, etc.” that you can have in your home or office. So, why just “pre-installed”? Where’s your imagination? The main benefit of Alloy over a tethered solution is that your ENTIRE current environment (not just one room), however big or small it may be, can be used as the boundaries that the game or exhibition map themselves to, whether that is re-mapping from some other environment or as the default characteristic for the exhibition or game to adjust itself to whatever physical environment it finds itself in. Will Why do you think Magic Leap is vaporware? It only just received it’s first venture funding in 2014. The Rift was Kickstarted in 2012 and didn’t release until this year. Augure Everybody sane knows Magic Leap is vaporware. It’s strange because I had a Rift as far as 2013…fucking hypocrite. Will Magic Leap utilises a well studied technology demonstrated by Nvidia and MIT. In the past two years there has been over $1.5 billion invested in them by companies like Google and Alibaba as recently as February with $800 million invested at that time. In June they partnered with Lucasfilm. They’ve been evaluated by Forbes and the Financial Times at over $4 billion inside of 2016. These are not companies without significant resources to investigate their decisions. What basis do you have for labeling it as vaporware? Augure Do you remember that “company that revolutionised renewable energy thanks to a magic energy cell based on a secret beach sand formula” in which Google, Microsoft and such and such invested millions if not billions for a few “mysterious boxes” of which nobody knows the content but that would magically produce energy for their buildings? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RehT-Do9bs DO you remember? Because I do and guess what: NOBODY ever saw the colour of one of those “revolutionary” boxes, that replace NONE of the energy grid in the country or elsewhere, of which we still have no idea how and even IF they work. Yet Google invested in it. That’s called money laundering vaporware but you probably don’t know what I’m talking about. Will I’m actually quite interested in money laundering. In many ways it is an important part of our economy, and a main driver of the Grey Market. It’s just that usually money laundering is only a necessity of criminal organizations, as legitimate corporations can simply shelter their money through tax havens, political lobbying, and loopholes effectively enough to avoid the unnecessary risk of full scale illegal action. I’m not sure when the last time you checked in with Bloom Energy was, but there are actually quite a few companies using their products. The new Apple campus will be powered at least partly by Bloom, and even smaller locations like some Home Depot stores already use their generators. They may not be quite as competitive as Ballard(once considered vaporware long before Bloom) in the on-site(or vehicle) fuel cell sector, but they certainly aren’t failed by any stretch. It still remains true that both Ballard and Bloom have proven fuel cells as a viable alternative going forward. I think they may have just overestimated the appeal and value their technology would offer by the time it came to market versus the advancement of on-site technologies like solar paired with a high efficiency Lithium battery, or perhaps supercapacitors in a few years. Still, I wonder why you think specifically Magic Leap, such a young company with so many glowing first person reports, and so much investment so recently, would be a fraudulent money laundering operation? Augure In the real world, even for big corporations, Fiscal Optimisation or Tax Evasion only take you so far. Large scale and shared sector money laundering is actually nothing new, here’s another concrete example: remember catching the H1N1 virus? Neither do I, or the billions of people who were lied to in their face that there was an imminent “pandemic”, which even the W.H.O. ended-up backtracking on. Yet, dozens of governments around paid hundreds of millions dollars to pharmaceutical companies in order to buy vaccines of which 90% went to waste. Want better? A friends of mine investigated for the account of medical institutions on the H1N1 and found something that you can easily find yourself on Google: 6 months before the H1N1 even existed, the biggest pharms (Sanofi, Bayer, Merck etc…) invested millions in the construction of “pre-emptive vaccine production factories, in the eventual case of flu-like pandemic”…right in fucking Mexico. You know the rest: 6 months after (which makes it impossible to have predicted or anticipated the appearances of a new flu-mutation) worldwide medias started declaring the first case of a pig-flu occurring in…Mexicos. If you haven’t hovered close to the “sun” of big corporations then you probably don’t know what they are capable of and how they operate. And that’s why, I’m confident (although definitive proofs would infer a serious investigative journalism that could threaten me or would end this scheme) that the same Bloom Energy was a scam from the get-go, Magic Leap is vaporware: it’s in every aspect of what hear, how we hear about and what actually is. We know what’s possible in terms of A.R. and how thanks to research and patents; NONE of the Magic Leap patents refers to a “specific revolutionary AR” technology that fits the narrative and actual description of the product. And the fact that the same big companies that aliened behind the same kind of vague if not meaningless PR with the same unfounded hyperboles that nobody in the crowd got infos or proofs of, is sign that it’s absolute bullshit. And the only point of such schemes, when millions and even billions is invested in something that has not even one real occurence or demonstration in years, is the sign of an advanced, high-level money laundering scheme (as soon as you invest money in any companies, there are millions of ways to retrieve it or detaxe it)… Will I think perhaps we have different definitions of what money laundering is. In order for money to be dirty, it must have been gained from criminal enterprise. The point of the laundering is to move cash from the Black or Grey market, and into the view of the government, where it can be taxed and spent legitimately. It is very inefficient, and the reason gangsters often engage in an economy of trade, swapping drugs, sex, people, murder, and stolen goods in place of money. Crucially, a successful business is generally required to launder large amounts of money. It’s extra hard to cook the books on a money pit, and the larger the pit the more attention you draw. Defrauding the government of billions of dollars on their own soil, including the inevitable collateral damage of all the genuine, naive money invested in good faith alongside your knowingly criminal cash, is a great way to end up investigated by a hundred lawyers from a hundred angles, from defrauded investors, tax collectors, and all manner of law enforcement, not to mention your competitors, who would gladly see you fail, and already bring legal action against you at every opportunity. This is all so incredibly risky that I just don’t see how a company like Google, with a vast, publicly visible tax stream, would also feel the need to not only engage in invisible, illegal fund creation, but also bother to bring that money, through laundering, into full view of the American government within their own borders by defrauding countless people. I can’t even imagine what criminal activities they could engage in that would produce literal billions of dollars in need of laundering, or indeed what methodology they would use to extract or even initially invest such money into a company that ends up failing. It’s so much easier just to create wealth by creating successful businesses and reaping the rewards. The H1N1 pandemic is an interesting example, and possibly a real one, but I don’t see how it’s analogous. Do you posit that it was also a money laundering scheme? If so, whose money was laundered? It seems more likely to be a simple creation of short term supply in demand, if not a coincidence. The H1N1 virus was and is real, and so is the vaccine. The only thing possibly fabricated was the extent of it’s danger, though it did still kill tens of thousands of people in hundreds of countries, it did not outstrip the regular flu virus in it’s death toll or reach. But it’s still a real virus that kills people, and the vaccine is not vaporware; it delivered as promised. I notice you also avoid comment on Bloom Energy’s continued progress, and that of their very similar competitor in Ballard. It’s interesting because that’s a much more direct comparison to your argument against Magic Leap. Both examples relied on well know, though hard to harness technologies. Bloom with using fuel cells to create reliable and efficient electricity, and Magic Leap with using Photonic Chips to create convincing lightfields. In both cases the technology is well understood and just requires advancement, and in both cases demonstrations of the technology were completed directly with investors in the beginning and not publicly. I would point to LucasArts’ involvement with Magic Leap as inscrutable if they weren’t actually presented with and impressed by working technology. They’ve invested no money, just partnered to provide content creation, which they’ve demonstrated publicly themselves. Why would LucasArts and Disney go to this effort if they couldn’t reasonably expect to recoup development costs? WyrdestGeek I don’t know about Magic Leap, specifically, but more generally Augure kinda has a point. Another really recent example: Theranos– super-fast blood testing? Nope. But lots of people said lots of things about how it was totes awesome. https://www.statnews.com/2016/04/13/theranos-debacle-threatens-investment-diagnostic-testing/ People and organizations–even including powerful people and organizations–can allow themselves to be misled. Regarding Magic Leap– I choose to remain wishful thinkingly optimistic that it will be awesome. But that’s a luxury I can afford because I’m not actually investing anything (time or money) into it. I just listen to podcasts and read this webpage. — Furry cows moo and decompress. Will Being misled is a little different than a vast billion dollar criminal conspiracy that involves collusion from parties on all sides for the express purpose of laundering money which by definition itself must have come from illegal enterprises. I wouldn’t discount out of hand the fact that Magic Leap could be misleading some people, I’m just not sure what the basis is at this stage for being so sure that they are completely misleading everyone involved – especially when there are so many positive eyewitness accounts, and the technology has been proven out by 3rd parties. WyrdestGeek I hope this pans out. Lack of positional tracking in mobile impairs presence pretty badly. jimrp Just glad they are trying it means a better tomorrow.

Devindra Hardawar, writing for Engadget: We've seen plenty of unique dev kits from Intel, including the SD card-sized Edison, but not one as powerful as this. Intel announced Joule today, a tiny maker board that will allow developers to test RealSense-powered concepts and, hopefully, bring the to the market faster than before. The company says the tiny, low-powered Joule would be ideal for testing concepts in robotics, AR, VR, industrial IoT and a slew of other industries. And it also looks like it could be an interesting way for students to dabble in RealSense's depth-sensing technology in schools. There will be two Joule kits to choose from: the 550x, which includes a 1.5GHz quad-core Atom T5500 processor, 3GB of RAM and 8GB of storage; and the 570x, which packs in a 1.7Ghz quad-core Atom T5700 CPU (with burst speeds up to 2.4GHz), 4GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. Both models include "laptop-class" 802.11AC wireless, Intel graphics with 4K capture and display support, and a Linux-based OS. intel developers culture ← Related Links → Cable Expands Broadband Domination as AT&T and Verizon Lose Customers Intel Breaks Qualcomm's Hold On Apple's Baseband Chips Windows UAC Bypass Permits Code Execution This discussion has been archived.

You wanna play rough, Samsung? Okay Project Alloy ... Chipzilla's open-source VR headgear (Source: Intel) 16 Aug 2016 at 22:19, Chris Williams Chris Williams Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics Windows 10, Arm, Apple, Intel, Microsoft Recent Articles ARM: Hold my beer, we'll install patches for your crappy IoT gear for you Suse: Question. What do you call second-place in ARM enterprise server linux? Answer: Red Hat Today the web was broken by countless hacked devices – your 60-second summary IDF16 Intel has vowed to open up its new all-in-one Project Alloy virtual reality headset, unveiled today at its Developer Forum in San Francisco. Alloy is described as "an open hardware platform," and will rival Samsung's Gear VR and similar virtual reality goggles. Alloy is powered by an Intel chipset and RealSense cameras, and, most importantly, it is wireless. You're supposed to pop it on and freely walk around your home or office or wherever and explore a 3D pretend world without tripped over or being limited by a cord connected to a computer. It also doesn't need any motion sensors placed around you to sense your movements. This is opposed to head-mounted displays that are tethered by a cable to a PC and need sensors on poles around you to detect you walking and moving your hands. Instead, the Alloy uses cameras mounted on its front to map out the real physical space around you: if you get too close to someone else or a wall or object in the real world while wandering around in your make-believe world, the software renders the obstacle in your display to let you know you're about to fall out of a window or step on the cat. This was demonstrated on stage at IDF this morning when an Intel staffer wearing the goggles almost walked into Chipzilla CEO Brian Krzanich standing a few feet from him: Big Brian's face loomed large in virtual space ship world. Those same cameras detect your hands in front of you, showing them in the virtual display and allowing you to manipulate things in the pretend world. You can even use things in your hands as tools in the virtual universe. On stage, an Intel staffer pulled out a small wad of folded dollar bills, held them up and used them to cut into a malleable object in the virtual world. Gotta hand it to Intel ... How your arms appear in a virtual world while wearing Alloy specs There's a battery in the strap that goes around the back of your head, and the device's weight is balanced so it sits on your head rather than rolling forward or back off your bonce. There are no technical specifications available yet. Vows ... Chipzilla's promised to come up with a standard for Windows 10-compatible head-mounted displays and an open Alloy design Intel said it will "open the Alloy hardware and provide open APIs for the ecosystem, allowing developers and partners to create their own branded products from the Alloy design, in 2017." This means it should be possible for people to build their own Alloy goggles and hook them up, wirelessly, to their computers. "Anybody can take the Alloy hardware, combine it with Windows Holographic, and build a world-class virtual reality system with any manufacturer they choose," said Krzanich. So, open provided you use Windows, it seems. Let's hope Alloy fares better than Intel's Project Tango smartphone, which was touted for $399 in January, and offered to developers so they could experiment with mobile apps and its RealSense motion detection camera. That handset was quietly axed in July amid Intel's exit from the smartphone processor world. ® Sponsored: 10 Reasons LinuxONE is the best choice for Linux workloads Tips and corrections Post a comment More from The Register Microsoft splashes Virtual Reality-slinging 'Scorpio' Xbox Console set to land in time for Christmas ... next year 41 Comments Virtual reality will take over the world by 2020, reckons analyst haus Psst.

In his keynote, CEO Brian Krzanich made clear Intel wants its chips and technology to play a major role in this emerging market. "Virtual reality represents one of those fundamental shifts that redefine the way we work, how we are going to entertain and how we communicate," he said. Krzanich demonstrated a battery-powered, untethered virtual reality headset system that includes all the computational and graphic power it needs onboard. That in turn will set users free to move through virtual reality constructs without running into the physical constraints of a cord. It also would allow the wearer to interact with the world in what’s being called augmented reality, technology that shows users an image overlay of their surroundings, giving them information about what they’re looking at or allowing them to manipulate virtual objects. Intel's prototype untethered virtual reality headset, which it calls Project Alloy.  (Photo: Intel) The Project Alloy headset incorporated Intel’s front-facing 3-D camera technology, which it calls Real Sense. That gives users the ability to use hand gestures to execute commands. The headset Krzanich showed the audience was a single unit, no trailing wires, no tethering to a computer. The design contrasts with Facebook's Oculus Rift, the $600 VR headset that has been dinged by some reviewers because it tethers users to a box and limits movement. USA TODAY Oculus Rift VR is big hit in my house “It’s completely self-contained virtual world all in one package. To me, that’s what virtual reality means,” Krzanich said. Intel introduces Project Alloy, a "self contained" VR headset which doesn't need a cord to connect anywhere #IDF16pic.twitter.com/61xEfhQMSq— Allana Akhtar (@allanaakh) August 16, 2016 It doesn’t appear that Intel actually plans to build VR headsets but rather to provide the design for various developers to work with. By the second half of 2017 the company plans to make the specifications for Alloy available to all, “allowing everyone access to the build sheets, exactly what it takes to build an Alloy themselves,” Krzanich said. That’s not surprising as Intel has never been a consumer product company, but instead enabling consumer products such as PC, said Brian Blau, a senior Intel analyst with Gartner. “I suspect Project Alloy is similar to Google Daydream. It’s potentially a device, it's being prototyped, but it’s more of a set of specification that partners can use to build devices,” he said. He noted that historically, Intel has worked hard to associate the Intel brand with new technologies, the long-running “Intel Inside” campaign for PCs branded that into consumers brains. Now the Mountain View, Calif. company’s task is to associate the Intel brand with this new, all-in-one form for virtual reality, Blau said. Intel did not announce how much the Project Alloy headset might sell for. The bigger news long term may be that Intel and Microsoft plan on working together on virtual and augmented reality, said Patrick Moorhead, president and principal analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy. Both companies were late to the game when it came to smartphones and it appears they don’t plan to miss this virtual train. “Microsoft and Intel working together on mixed reality is a very positive sign and historically, more has been accomplished with the two working together than against each other,” said Moorhead. USA TODAY We test HoloLens, VR's augmented cousin Microsoft executive vice president Terry Myerson joined Intel's Krzanich on stage to say the two companies were working together on software to run virtual reality devices. Microsoft is developing its own VR headset, the HoloLens, which contains Intel chips. Additionally, Microsoft has said that all Windows 10 systems will have some capability of augmented reality capability. Together, that adds up to a lot of ways for consumers to access this emerging technology, Moorhead said. No cords The untethered headset Krzanich showed the audience represents what could be the breakthrough form factor that will take VR from a niche device for game players to something that is truly becomes part of daily life in the way smartphones have. How users enter virtual and augmented reality spaces today tends to fall into three groups. There are tethered headsets that plug into a computer, smartphone-based headsets that snap a phone into a headset and all-in-one headsets that contain all the processing and battery power. “It’s a really interesting device because they have everything in one package, you don't have to worry about having the right smartphone or which headset you have, you don’t have to buy an expensive headset,” Blau said. 60 CONNECTTWEET 5 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2byxB2m

However, Project Alloy, as the headset is being called, won’t actually compete head-to-head with the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. Instead, it’s meant to be a reference design for other manufacturers — and a long-term bet to keep Intel relevant in the nascent virtual reality space. Project Alloy is at its core a standalone headset that works without any external computer, and also doesn’t require users to plug in their own mobile phones. This sets it apart from both the more expensive Rift-type VR hardware and cheaper mobile VR headsets like Samsung’s Gear VR. In addition to its own computing chips, Alloy also packs a number of camera sensors that make it possible to use one’s own hands as controllers. Alloy is also capable of recognizing elements of the space around a user, which means that you’ll be able to play a game in your living room without inadvertently bumping into your coffee table. Intel has been developing this kind of sensor technology under the RealSense moniker for some time. However, Intel won’t be selling consumers Alloy headsets any time soon. The company is instead looking to open source the Alloy design next year, and allow third parties to build their own headsets based on Intel’s reference design. The company is also collaborating with Microsoft to bring some of its technology to Alloy-based headsets. Earlier this summer, Microsoft announced plans to bring the holographic technology that powers its own HoloLens headset to third-party devices. So why is Intel throwing its head in the VR ring if it doesn’t actually want to build its own consumer headsets? Because it wants other manufacturers to use its chips, and that’s currently far from certain. Related Daydream: How Google Is Tricking Us All to Embrace Virtual Reality High-end headsets like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive are already often powered by Intel, since the company’s chips are at the core of many gaming PCs. However, mobile VR headsets like Samsung’s Gear VR use phones to do the heavy lifting, and mobile has long been a sore spot for Intel, as most phones are powered by ARM chips. The future of virtual reality is still very much undecided: Will consumers flock to stationary, more capable but also more expensive headsets? Or will they instead embrace cheaper and less-capable mobile headsets? Google is betting on the latter, and introduced a new Android-based VR platform called Daydream earlier this year. The company has alliances with a series of handset makers, and first Daydream-capable phones are expected to launch later this year. For Intel, that’s a worrying trend. If handset makers dictate the future of VR, then it may find itself once again shut out of a massive opportunity. By introducing Alloy now, Intel essentially signals hardware makers that it is ready to be a part of the future of virtual reality headsets — even if the first Alloy-based headsets won’t ship any time soon.   Filed Under: Intel virtual reality Want to read more articles like this one?

Black and white wallpapers for macOS and iOS   skip to main content skip to main menu     Deal with ARM would theoretically let Intel build 10nm iPhone and iPad chips By Christian Zibreg, Aug 16, 2016 Tweet 3 Comments Chip giant Intel announced today at its Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco an important deal with UK-based fabless semiconductor maker ARM Holdings that will permit other foundries to build chips based on ARM’s most advanced Cortex-series CPU cores using Intel’s sophisticated ten-nanometer process technology. Given that Apple’s in-house designed A-series chips include fully customized 64-bit CPU cores based on ARM technology, the announcement expands Apple’s options by letting its contract silicon manufacturers such as Samsung and TSMC fabricate iPhone and iPad chips using Intel’s foundry services. Intel also confirmed a deal with LG Electronics to fabricate chips for upcoming LG smartphones on Intel’s ten-nanometer FinFET process technology. Apple already has deals with TSMC and Samsung to produce upcoming A10 chips, with TSMC said to have already landed a deal to fabricate ten-nanometer A11 chips in 2017. Looking beyond 2017, Apple could easily give some of its chip business to Intel. The Cupertino company is known for pitting multiple suppliers against each other to keep price quotes down. Apple is also rumored to have ditched LTE modems from Qualcomm for those made by Intel across AT&T-bound iPhone 7 units. Each new iPhone generation has come with fewer and fewer chips as Apple continues to integrate even more functions into its own processors. With that in mind, it is entirely conceivable that a future iPhone chip might integrate an LTE modem, in which case the Intel-ARM deal could prove crucial for Apple. Intel’s foundry business lets third-party semiconductor makers access Intel’s technology and manufacturing assets through turnkey services including design, wafer manufacturing, packaging and testing.

News & Analysis Intel Grabs ARM for 10nm Foundry Best density claimed in 10nm node Rick Merritt 8/16/2016 05:45 PM EDT 18 comments 1 saves Login to Rate Tweet SAN FRANCISCO – Intel revealed its 10nm process could outperform other foundries and will be used to make ARM-based mobile chips for companies including LG Electronics. To enable the move, Intel partnered with ARM’s Artisan division that is porting a reference design for one of its 64-bit cores to the process. The news at the annual Intel Developer Forum here reinforced the x86 giant’s continued strength in process technology. It also highlighted its need for a still-fledging foundry business to participate fully in the mobile market. Separately, China’s Spreadtum will make mobile chips in Intel’s current 14nm process. In addition, Intel’s 14nm Stratix 10 FPGAs will sample next quarter using a novel packaging technology that provides a lower cost than existing 2.5D techniques. The Intel 10nm node, still in a development stage, will sport a 54nm gate pitch. It’s the “tightest gate pitch any company will have in production for several years,” said Mark Bohr, a senior fellow in Intel’s manufacturing group. Intel said its 10nm process could have a two-year lead in transistor gate pitch. (Images: Intel) Bohr said both Intel’s 10nm and 7nm processes will continue the trend of delivering both denser chips and a lower cost per transistor. Although cost per wafer continues to rise with increasing numbers of steps and mask layers, “Moore’s law is alive and cost per transistor continues to come down at least for Intel,” he said. Intel’s two-and-a-half year old foundry business “had gone so quiet it looked like they were exiting it,” said G. Dan Hutcheson, president of market watcher VLSI Research Inc.  With the new deals, Intel is poised to make chips for ARM-based Android phones as well as the Internet of Things, “and a lot of the IoT will be based on ARM,” he said. Both Intel’s 14 and 10nm nodes are expected to deliver tighter logic area and lower transistor cost than historic trends. However, Bohr said the time between nodes will continue to be between two and two-and-a-half years given increasing wafer costs and complexity. “We are investing more effort in derivative technologies to make more use of these very expensive nodes and extend their life. Twenty years ago we would ramp up a node and two years later ramp it down again, Bohr said. Thus Intel has already started making its next-generation chips on a 14+ node it says will deliver 12% better performance. At the 10nm generation it expects to deliver 10+ and 10++ variants over time, Bohr said declining to provide details.

I tried something else, just averaged the last four node tick scalings as you listed, got 0.706x, would give 36.7 nm projection for 10nm node.

Ofc the cell area metric is valid, not disputing that.   Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Author Re: Why so shy on metal pitch? OtisTD   8/23/2016 11:02:31 AM NO RATINGS Login to Rate The reason Intel is using cell height instead of metal pitch is because they are not just doing straight dimensional scaling.  They are also reducing the number of fins per transistor in order to reduce the number of tracks in their design rule.  That way they get a smaller cell- and they want credit for that.  Some of the foundries used that trick as essentially their whole "density scaling" from 22nm to 16nm.  Intel did both from 22 to 14nm and appears to be doing both again from 14 to 10nm.  All of the basic concepts are related in this blog: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cmos-density-scaling-cppmxp-metric-ali-khakifirooz They are using fin depopulation to get functional scaling. So they want to use cell height to reflect that scaling, because the MX pitch doesn't capture it (which is why Witeken's math below doesn't hold because cell height is not the same as metal pitch).  I suspect they will come in with ~44nm min. metal pitch (43 is the historical projection), using double patterning, and they will use pitch quad (or SAQP) for the fins which will likely be close to 33-34nm pitch as well.  If you look purely at gatexmetal, then they don't get traditional 0.5x scaling- so that is why it looks a little different with the different metric. Not saying it's a good thing, it just is what it is.  Some people will hate it, but the foundries can't complain about it because they are selling the same story, only with less dimensional scaling underneath. The one thing even the most ardent Intel hater has to concede, unless of course they are just a shill, is that Intel has maintained their linear node scaling (gate pitch and metal pitch) through High K/Metal Gate and through FinFET introduction.  I don't think anybody else as done that.  See if it changes at 10nm, but I don't think so.

Their graph is cell height x gate pitch and it seems to claim the same kind of 0.46 scaling from 22nm to 14nm too. In 2014 their 14nm presentation was less fuzzy and the area scaling wasn't accelerated from 22nm to 14nm like the new graph suggests http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/pdf/foundry/mark-bohr-2014-idf-presentation.pdf Today's math might be a bit more creative than assumed.

ArF PQ would also be extendible to their 7nm node of course. Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Author Re: Why so shy on metal pitch? OtisTD   8/22/2016 3:57:37 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate I'm not sure what the A9 can tell you about compactness as it's competitors have the same compactness because they are made in the same foundries.   Regarding metal pitch, the Samsung 10nm process (Cho VLSI 2016) has 64nm gate and 48nm M1/MX pitches respectively.  If you project Intel's 10nm based on their historical trend then you would get 54nm gate pitch (matching their announcement) and 43nm MX pitch.  Those are possible with double patterning, but the fin pitch projects to 33nm, which likely means SAQP.

What I heard at the event was a gate pitch of 54nm and a closer inspection of the chart shows that's where Intel 10nm is plotted.

Announced at the Intel Developer Forum (IDF), executive vice president for Windows and devices, Terry Myers, introduced the update, saying that "all Windows 10 devices will include a holographic shell," which is geared towards compatibility with Microsoft HoloLens and the just-announced Intel Project Alloy. READ: What is Intel Project Alloy? Windows 10 wants to position itself as the ultimate operating system platform for augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR), with headset compatibility opening up a new world of potential. As the Microsoft promotional video shows (below), there is scope to run both 2D and 3D applications at the same time in your new virtual office environment, aiming for a seamless transition between the two. But we'll have to wait until December this year to learn about the developer-side specification for such apps, while the consumer update itself won't roll out until 2017. Even by then, will such an update lure people to buy VR/AR/MR devices in the first instance? And will those people want to use such devices at all times when running Windows? We have our doubts.

Intel unveils a ready-to-fly drone, the Aero, to win over developers Posted Aug 16, 2016 by Lora Kolodny (@lorakolodny) 0 SHARES Next Story Barnes & Noble drops its CEO after deeming him ‘not a good fit’ At the Intel Developer Forum on Tuesday, Intel unveiled a new, hardware product — a ready-to-fly drone; specifically, a quadcopter, aimed at software developers rather than casual hobbyists or commercial drone operators. Intel’s drone is a fully assembled unit that runs on Intel’s Aero Compute Board with a Linux operating system, RealSense for vision and comes with Santa Monica startup AirMap’s software development kit pre-loaded. AirMap, generally, helps drone users fly only where it’s safe and legal to do so. Other chip makers, like NVIDIA, Ambarella and Qualcomm, have been vying to gain market share in the burgeoning, if not yet clearly regulated, domestic and international drones market. But they’ve done so by selling their microprocessors to other hardware manufacturers, including companies that make UAVs or cameras and other systems that are integrated into them to enhance functionality, usually around filming and aerial data capture. Ambarella has supplied chips in the built-in cameras on DJI’s drones, and for GoPro cameras that can be mounted onto 3D Robotics drones, for example. And Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Flight platform and 4k cameras have been used in drones like the Tencent-Zerotech model called YING that sends data from mid-flight to Tencent’s social media platforms QQ and Wenxing. Intel is also an equity investor in drone tech startups, including: Yuneec, which makes drones that automatically avoid obstacles even in tight spaces; Airware, developers of an operating system for commercial drones; and PrecisionHawk, makers of a fixed-wing drone and software for agricultural and other commercial drones. Intel also acquired Ascending Technologies, a German autopilot tech company, in January of this year. The inclusion of AirMap’s software development kit in Intel’s Aero Ready-to-Fly quadcopters is a boon for the startup, which only launched this week at a closed conference for developers in Santa Monica, California. AirMap was already a partner of leading drone makers DJI, as well as 3D Robotics and Aeryon Labs. The startup’s CEO Ben Marcus told TechCrunch on Tuesday that AirMap is on a mission to “make drones a part of everyday life.” He said pervasive drone use can’t safely happen without an air space management system that covers the lower air space where drones fly, and relays that real-time information to drone operators, manufacturers and app developers about air space conditions. AirMap also makes data accessible in real time to other stakeholders like airports and regulators who need to know how and where drones are operating. The Aero Ready-to-Fly drone will be available to purchase by the end of this year, but Intel did not announce a firm on-sale date or price.

Where Project Alloy may rely on a full Core processor and graphics card inside its black and white body, Intel’s prototype WiGig VR headset leaves the heavy lifting to a separate PC as normal, but simply cuts the cord. It’s another use of WiGig, the wireless interconnect that Intel and others have been talking about for several years but which has struggled to make an impact. Right now, it’s only available in a few docking stations, allowing laptop users to connect to a display and other peripherals without plugging in USB or Thunderbolt. In fact, one of those was docks sacrificed in order to make Intel’s wireless VR prototype. It’s definitely an early attempt: the core is an Oculus DK2 developer headset, with a 3D printed shield that wraps around the front, and inside of which is mounted the guts of the docking station. At the other end, an Alienware gaming PC has been modified with a custom housing. Range is currently around five meters, the Intel engineers who have been working on the project explained to me. It’s not quite as straightforward as unplugging a monitor, keyboard, and mouse and plugging in an HDMI VR headset, however. The latency requirements of a docked laptop are very different to those of a gaming rig, and so custom firmware had to be written in order to streamline the link between the two. Right now, the channel which previously connected the display is handling VR video, while the backchannel for keyboard and mouse commands is used for other data like head positioning and such. In its current form, the WiGig 802.11ad link adds about 16ms delay on top of the usual wired connection. That, I’m told, doesn’t make for too terrible an experience – Intel has pushed it beyond the 75 fps target most VR titles aim for, and the system can easily handle 90 fps – and the engineers believe it can be cut further. Exactly where the project goes next remains to be seen. With what’s still a fairly limited range – the team described it to me as “wireless tethering” – it’s not so much a replacement to Project Alloy as it is an alternative approach. Future prototypes could well be a lot less bulky – most of the components in the customized headset aren’t needed, as they’re carried over wholesale from the donor dock – and refinements to the firmware will come in due course. Hopefully that means a little more stability, too, since the current hardware wasn’t playing ball so I couldn’t actually try it out myself. A companion project, meanwhile, has come up with a vest for VR gamers using the headset, with hot-swappable batteries. Right now, the current WiGig prototype hasn’t got anywhere close to testing battery life on its own. Nonetheless, the hope is that there’s sufficient interest that the project goes beyond the “interesting tinkering” stage. Given VR systems like HTC Vive and Oculus’ own Rift are still highly dependent on potent video cards, and Project Alloy is yet to demonstrate its own graphical talents, it seems like there could well be a market there.

Intel has a new concept for a wireless virtual reality headset Tech Insider 8/16/2016 Steve Kovach © Provided by Business Insider Inc intel project alloy virtual reality headset Intel, the company best known for making computer chips, is now exploring virtual reality. The company a concept device called Project Alloy, a wireless VR headset that unlike the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, doesn't need to be tethered to a computer to operate. Alloy is just a prototype now, and it's unlikely Intel will launch a standalone product. Instead, Intel is making Alloy an open hardware platform anyone can use to build VR headsets. It'll also work with Windows Holographic, the special version of Windows designed for augmented reality and VR. Intel has been in a tough spot in recent years as its core PC chip business . The company already whiffed on its chance to develop mobile processors for phones and tablets, and has started exploring other categories like drones and now VR.

Intel CEO Brian Krzanich showed off the headset Tuesday at the start of the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco. "Merged reality will be one of those fundamental shifts that is going to redefine how we work, how we are entertained and how we communicate," Krzanich said. Intel's RealSense technology is built into the all-in-one headset, allowing it to recognize where a person is at all times and what they're doing with their hands, which can act as controllers.

"It doesn't feel very virtual when you're tied to a confined space," Krzanich said. Intel's Craig Raymond displays the Project Alloy virtual reality headset during the Day 1 keynote at the 2016 Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco on Aug. 16, 2016.

"Gaming is going to be amazing. Imagine you could turn your entire house into a level of a game, and you're not walking into walls because you have a camera element to it and you're actually using your hands not a VR controller," Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy told NBC News at the event. Project Alloy will be open source, allowing developers to first get their hands on the technology and create new experiences. Terry Myerson, executive vice president of Microsoft's Windows and Devices group, joined Krzanich onstage to announce Project Alloy will run on Windows Holographic, Microsoft's platform for its HoloLens mixed reality eyewear. Myerson said Windows Holographic would be released to mainstream Windows 10 devices next year. Myerson said the experience will bring a new experience for multitasking in mixed reality.

It's part of a push to let more people use what Microsoft calls mixed reality -- either bringing physical objects into virtual reality or overlaying digital objects on the physical world. Right now, Microsoft already covers that second area with its HoloLens hardware, but it's also working with a variety of hardware manufacturing partners like Intel to build new hardware that works with mixed reality.  [ Download the State of the CIO 2016 report ] The new capabilities will enable users with PC-powered VR headsets to interact with Windows 10 apps, mixed reality content, and virtual reality content all at once. That’s a major expansion of Windows Holographic, which is currently only available on the HoloLens. The move is a positive one for both companies, as virtual, augmented, and mixed reality all become increasingly popular, said analyst Patrick Moorhead. "Microsoft and Intel working together on mixed reality is a very positive sign and historically, more has been accomplished with the two working together than against each other," Moorhead said by email. "Intel and Microsoft were not aligned in smartphones or tablets, and the result was negative for both." The Windows Holographic announcement dovetailed with the news that Microsoft and Intel are working together on Project Alloy, a wireless headset that uses sensors to bring objects into VR from the real world. Intel will release an open-source set of specifications for building an Alloy headset and allow hardware makers to build their own.  As part of the news, Myerson showed off a simple Windows Holographic demo running on a US$600 Intel NUC mini computer. The demo, which ran at 90 frames per second, is an encouraging sign for people who don't have the powerful PCs needed to run the current crop of high-end VR headsets.  Microsoft will be outlining more details about its Windows Holographic strategy at the WinHEC conference in Shenzhen, China, this December.  To comment on this article and other CIO content, visit us on Facebook, LinkedIn or Twitter.

Rachel Aldrich Aug 16, 2016 3:59 PM EDT NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Shares of Intel (INTC) were gaining late Tuesday afternoon after the company announced it would be licensing technology from competitor ARM Holdings (ARMH), Bloomberg reports. The Santa Clara, CA-based digital technology company is looking to win more customers for its unit which manufactures chips for other companies. Intel, using ARM technology, will be able to offer companies its most advances 10-nanometer production lines to manufacture chips that are typically used in smartphones. The deal was unveiled today at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco. Intel, the world's largest semiconductor maker, generates most of its revenue from its personal-computer processors and has not yet gained much ground in the fast-growing mobile phone market, Bloomberg notes. The company seeks to convince other chipmakers to use its factories for production. Separately, TheStreet Ratings objectively rated this stock according to its "risk-adjusted" total return prospect over a 12-month investment horizon. Not based on the news in any given day, the rating may differ from Jim Cramer's view or that of this articles's author. TheStreet Ratings rated this stock as a "buy" with a ratings score of B+. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, reasonable valuation levels, good cash flow from operations, solid stock price performance and expanding profit margins. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had sub par growth in net income.

The maker board enables users to take a concept from prototype into production at a “fraction of the time and development cost,” according to Intel. “The future starts with the Internet of Things … the boundary between digital and physical is eroding toward a world where computing is truly mobile. If you start to count the number of computers in your life today, it is constantly increasing and everything is truly smart and connected,” said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich during a keynote at Intel Developer Forum, which kicks off in San Francisco this week. [Related: Intel, Microsoft Join Forces To Bring Virtual Reality Platform To Windows 10 PCs] Joule is available in two models – the 550x and the higher-performance 570x – and the developer kit will begin shipping in September through Intel partners. According to Intel, Joule features high-end compute, 4K video and large memory capabilities, as well as support for RealSense technology and other Intel software tools. Krzanich showed off an Internet of Things application as part of Intel’s Joule platform, pairing the module with French company Pivothead’s industrial safety glasses to monitor tasks performed by a factory operator. This technology enables the glasses to provide immediate audio feedback for real-time quality control, as well as visual assistance. Krzanich said the new technology positions Intel as a critical backbone component to all parts of the Internet of Things. “The Internet of Things needs computing at the end, in the middle and in the cloud – and we believe Intel technology will make all of this possible,” said Krzanich. The Internet of Things has become an increased focus for Intel in the past year, as the company shifts its strategy to become more of a cloud, data center and connectivity source and lessens its dependence on its more traditional area of focus, the PC market.

The news, delivered in a single slide at a technical session at Intel’s developer forum in San Francisco, ended months of speculation that such a move was in the works. LG, which often takes its cue from Samsung, is following its larger rival further into the chip business. Apple and China’s Huawei also have their own chip designs, while the rest of the phone industry generally uses processors from Qualcomm or Chinese rivals. Samsung has become one of the leading semiconductor firms in the world, though it not only designs the processors but also has a vast chipmaking operation that makes chips for Apple and Qualcomm, in addition to Samsung’s own processors. LG will take advantage of Intel’s next-generation 10-nanometer manufacturing technology, a thinner version that will debut next year. It’s unclear to what extent LG plans to use the homegrown chips. In theory it could be for a wide range of phones and tablets, though realistically LG’s initial use could be far more limited. An LG representative was not immediately available for comment. Using one’s own chips can have cost and other advantages, provided the processors can keep pace with rival chips. Although the chips will be made in Intel plants, it doesn’t mean Intel is having any better luck getting companies to adopt PC-style processors for use in phones. Instead, Intel also announced Tuesday it has signed a new partnership with archrival ARM that will allow other chipmakers to make ARM processors inside Intel factories. recode_divider More From Recode Donald Trump told Tim Cook that Apple is going to ‘build a big plant’ in the U.S. Post-election ‘terror and hysteria’ over Trump is not justified, says Observer editor Ken Kurson Recode Daily: Facebook built a censorship tool that could help it get back into China Can the journalists who work for Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner still cover the White House fairly?

Intel has entered into a new licensing agreement with competitor ARM to produce ARM-based chips in Intel factories. The deal, announced today at the Intel Developer Forum, is a strategic move from the Santa Clara, CA company to offer its large-scale custom chip manufacturing facilities, which include 10-nanometer production lines, to third-parties, including those using its rival's technology. Intel's new foundry licensing agreements also include deals to produce chips for LG Electronics, Netronome, and Spreadrum. "I think it can make a real difference in the industry," said Will Abbey, a general manager in ARM's physical design group, at IDF today. "For me, it simply makes sense." Intel will be tasked with producing ARM's 64-bit cores and other hardware that companies like Apple, Qualcomm, Nvidia, and others base their chip designs off of. ARM-based chips power a majority of the world's mobile phones, with many companies relying on either their own designs or those developed by Qualcomm. An Intel-ARM deal paves the way to producing chips for Apple and Qualcomm The deal is another reminder that Intel missed the boat on mobile. The company ceded ground to Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., and other chip makers who now assume the dominant and lucrative chip making role for smartphones that Intel has enjoyed with PCs for decades. Now, with PC sales declining, Intel is eager to make use of its foundry infrastructure to bring in new customers, even if it means developing chips it once hoped to design itself. Though it seems like an admission of defeat from Intel, the move is not altogether surprising. Rumors began percolating a few years back that Intel was in talks with Apple to manufacture chips for the iPhone and iPad, both of which use processors with ARM-based architecture. For years, Apple has been forced to turn to Samsung and TSMC to produce its Ax chip line. So it makes sense the iPhone maker would be interested in reducing its manufacturing dependency on its central smartphone competitor. With an ARM deal in place, Intel now has the licensing framework to grab its share of the iPhone chip business, pending of course any concrete deal with Apple. Given the proximity of a new iPhone launch next month and reports that Apple has already inked a deal with TSMC to produce the A11 chip for the 2017 iPhone, Intel may have to wait a while before it gets in on that business.

Intel and Microsoft announced Tuesday that they are working together to help computer manufacturers get into the business of making stand-alone VR headsets. Today that market essentially consists of just two products, Facebook’s Oculus Rift  and the competing Vive from phone company HTC. At an Intel event in San Francisco, CEO Brian Krzanich showed off his company’s new prototype, Project Alloy. He said it eliminates the inconveniences associated with existing headsets like the Oculus and Vive devices, and that next year Intel will give away the plans to computer manufacturers so they can make their own versions. “Intel will open-source the Alloy hardware, allowing everybody to create their own branded products,” said Krzanich. Intel’s new Project Alloy virtual-reality headset has an integrated battery pack and computer, so it doesn’t need tethering to a PC. Intel’s headset doesn’t have to be tethered to a PC, so a user can walk around to explore a virtual space. The device also has two depth-sensing cameras built in. Those can track hand and finger movements, enabling users to interact with virtual objects just by reaching out in space. By contrast, Oculus and HTC headsets require the use of hand controllers to interact with a virtual world. The depth cameras in Intel’s headset are also used to map physical surroundings and warn if a user walks too close to a real-world obstacle. An Intel employee demonstrated the Alloy headset onstage. He explored what looked like a room on a spaceship by walking around, reaching out with his hand to interact with levers and other objects. He also showed how objects held in your hand, such as a dollar bill, also appear in the virtual world. “We can do that with almost any object: we can take the virtual world into the real world,” said Krzanich. “This is going to be a big driver in innovation, because it’s different from anything out there right now.” Depth sensors on the headset allow you to interact with things in a virtual world using your hands and fingers, or objects you are holding. Terry Myerson, who leads Microsoft’s Windows group, joined Krzanich onstage and announced that an update called Windows Holographic will add support for virtual- and augmented-reality headsets to all Windows 10 PCs starting next year. In December, Microsoft and Intel will release guidelines intended to standardize VR headsets and make content and software compatible across different products. Microsoft said earlier this summer that it is already talking with hardware companies about making their own versions of Microsoft HoloLens, the company’s augmented-reality headset. Myerson also boasted that Intel and Microsoft had found ways to run virtual-reality applications on less powerful PCs than the ones the Oculus and HTC headsets rely on. Both require high-powered gaming PCs that start at around $1,000. Myerson showed a demo video of a woman using Intel’s Alloy headset and Microsoft’s software that he said was running on an Intel-made PC small enough to hold in one hand. “Intel is enabling us to bring this experience to mainstream PCs,” he said. He didn’t provide details of what Intel and Microsoft had done to make that possible. The video Myerson introduced was intended to show how a headset like Intel’s can be used for conventional workplace tasks as well as gaming. In it, a woman walked up to an empty desk in a sparse room. When she put on the headset, she saw giant interactive screens showing her calendar and other PC applications on the walls. At one point she selected a calendar entry for an upcoming trip and was virtually teleported to outside the Pantheon in Rome. “You’ll be able to interact with your familiar Windows apps as well as these 3-D apps at same time,” said Myerson. Intel’s Krzanich also talked about technology his company has developed to capture virtual-reality content more effectively. The company is installing systems of cameras in sports stadiums across the country to capture the action from multiple angles. Intel software uses the multiple viewpoints to digitally re-create the action in 3-D. “You can move anywhere on the court or field,” said Krzanich, showing a video clip of 3-D footage made during a game in last season’s NBA finals. “You can watch a basketball game from the three-point line and, if you see a dunk coming on, move to by the basket.” Krzanich contrasted Intel’s technology, called 360 Replay, with cameras that capture 360° and 3-D footage from a single point. Google, Facebook, Nokia, and several other companies have created cameras of that type. Krzanich said 360 Replay could be used for concerts and other performances, and to create new kinds of movies. Intel is setting up a production studio with the technology in Los Angeles to court Hollywood content creators. Learn more about virtual reality at EmTech Digital 2017.

X Intel strikes technology licensing deal with ARM Intel can offer third parties production lines for making chips used in smartphones Tue, Aug 16, 2016, 21:51 Updated: Wed, Aug 17, 2016, 11:23 Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich: he is steering the company to persuade other chipmakers to use its factories for their production. Photograph: Noah Berger/Bloomberg         Intel, the world’s biggest semiconductor maker, has announced that it is licensing technology from rival ARM Holdings, a move to win more customers for its business that manufactures chips for other companies.The two chipmakers, whose designs and technology dominate in computing and mobile, unveiled the agreement on Tuesday at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco. The accord will let Intel offer third-party semiconductor companies its most advanced 10-nanometre production lines for manufacturing the complex chips usually used in smartphones. Intel, which gets the majority of its revenue from making personal-computer processors, has failed to gain ground in the larger and faster-growing phone market – the stronghold of ARM’s technology. Chip fabrication Under chief executive Brian Krzanich, Intel is trying to persuade other chipmakers to use its factories for their production. Adding licences for ARM’s technology could open up that business to fabricating chips based on those designs for companies such as Qualcomm and Apple, which now have their chips produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and others. Intel’s embrace of the competing technology comes as the PC market continues to decline, and growth in the lucrative server-chip market slows. – (Bloomberg)       Topics: Brian Krzanich ARM Holdings Plc Intel Read More Intel’s chips deal with ARM helps it into the mobile market Intel to buy startup Nervana System to add cloud service Strong microchip sales help Intel post 2.6% rise in revenue Never miss a story.

Resend activation e-mail Gear & Gadgets / Product News & Reviews Intel will allow ARM chipmakers to use its 10nm manufacturing process Intel has mostly given up on its own phone SoCs. by Andrew Cunningham - Aug 16, 2016 8:42 pm UTC Login to bookmark 96 Intel Intel will be opening up its newest chip factories to companies making ARM mobile processors, according to joint press releases from both Intel and ARM. Companies designing chips based on ARM's Artisan Physical IP will be able to manufacture them on Intel's upcoming 10nm FinFET process, giving those chip companies an option aside from the currently dominant Samsung and TSMC. It sounds like ARM licensees who use ARM's off-the-shelf technology will be able to use Intel's fabs to create chips but that licensees like Qualcomm who use a lot of their own custom CPUs and GPUs won't be able to. "The initial POP IP will be for two future advanced ARM Cortex-A processor cores designed for mobile computing applications in either ARM big.LITTLE™ or stand-alone configurations," according to ARM's press release. Intel's release says that LG will be using the process to "produce a world-class mobile platform based on Intel Custom Foundry's 10nm design platform." The Intel Custom Foundry business has slowly been expanding since Intel first offered 22nm capacity to Achronix back in 2010, though its list of customers is still fairly small. Initially, Intel mostly offered capacity to chip companies that didn't compete with Intel in any significant markets, and in at least one case, Intel has actually purchased a company it was doing business with. But Intel dramatically scaled back its smartphone SoC plans a few months ago after years of poor sales and few design wins, so letting ARM SoC makers use Intel's factories could now be Intel's best option for making money in the mobile SoC business. The company is also continuing to work on its modems, one of which is rumored to be included in the next-generation iPhones. Chips based on Intel's 10nm process are expected at some point in 2017. The upcoming seventh-generation Core CPUs, codenamed "Kaby Lake," will be based on the current 14nm architecture, just like Broadwell and Skylake before them.

Credit: Intel/IDGNS More like this Microsoft has opened up HoloLens, says partner products are coming soon Intel eyes chips for mixed reality headsets Asus may be planning Microsoft HoloLens competitor in its VR push Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles Microsoft is bringing Windows Holographic to the masses with a forthcoming update to Windows 10, in a move to make it easier to blend physical and digital reality on any PC.  Windows Holographic will be made available through a software update sometime in 2017, Terry Myerson, executive vice president of the Windows and Devices Group, said at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco on Tuesday. Microsoft and Intel are working together to provide minimum hardware specifications for Windows Holographic PCs and headsets, he added. It's part of a push to let more people use what Microsoft calls mixed reality -- either bringing physical objects into virtual reality or overlaying digital objects on the physical world. Microsoft already covers that second area with its HoloLens hardware, but it's also working with a variety of hardware manufacturing partners like Intel to build new hardware that works with mixed reality.  The new capabilities will enable users with PC-powered VR headsets to interact with Windows 10 apps, mixed reality content, and virtual reality content all at once. That’s a major expansion of Windows Holographic, which is currently only available on the HoloLens. The move is a positive one for both companies, as virtual, augmented and mixed reality become increasingly popular, said analyst Patrick Moorhead. "Microsoft and Intel working together on mixed reality is a very positive sign and historically, more has been accomplished with the two working together than against each other," Moorhead said by email. "Intel and Microsoft were not aligned in smartphones or tablets, and the result was negative for both." The Windows Holographic announcement dovetailed with the news that Microsoft and Intel are working together on Project Alloy, a wireless headset that uses sensors to bring objects into VR from the real world. Intel will release an open-source set of specifications for building an Alloy headset and allow hardware makers to build their own.  As part of the news, Myerson showed a simple Windows Holographic demo running on a $600 Intel NUC mini computer. The demo, which ran at 90 frames per second, is an encouraging sign for people who don't have the powerful PCs needed to run the current crop of high-end VR headsets.  Microsoft will be outlining more details about its Windows Holographic strategy at the WinHEC conference in Shenzhen, China, this December.  To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

Black and white wallpapers for macOS and iOS   skip to main content skip to main menu     Intel unveils new Kaby Lake chips, VR headset for merged reality, drone platform & more By Christian Zibreg, Aug 16, 2016 Tweet 3 Comments At Intel Developer Forum today, chip giant Intel announced a seventh-generation Core processors, code-named Kaby Lake, along with a new drone platform, an exciting open-source virtual reality project and a bunch of other goodies. During an opening keynote presentation, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said the new Kaby Lake chips, due later this year, will let users stream movies in 4K resolution with smooth playback and long battery life. The company did not say when a low-power edition of the latest Kaby Lake chips suitable for use in Mac notebooks and iMacs might become available to vendors. Kaby Lake brings 4K to the masses Kaby Lake is the third chip platform built on Intel’s 14-nanometer process technology, following Broadwell and Skylake. Kaby Lake silicon includes support for Thunderbolt 3, native USB 3.1, DisplayPort 1.2 and hardware-accelerated HEVC Main10 profile. According to the Intel CEO, Kaby Lake is capable of playing the “highest quality 4K premium content on the market today without a hitch”. As part of on-stage demos, Intel showed off the capabilities of Kaby Lake-powered processor graphics by editing 4K video and playing Blizzard’s game Overwatch on HP and Dell notebooks. As we reported in March, Kaby Lake chips sport optimized microarchitecture and represent a “semi-tock” product release for Intel. Due to lack of support for DisplayPort 1.3, future Kaby Lake-powered Macs may not be able to drive an external 5K display over a single-stream cable. Say hello to Project Alloy Built from the ground up as an all-in-one virtual reality solution, Project Alloy is all about merged reality. Leveraging Intel’s RealSense technology, it lets you bring objects from the real world into your virtual world. The headset does not require external sensors, instead relying on cameras attached to the headset. Forget about virtual or augmented reality, here comes merge reality. As part of the demos showcasing the possibilities of Project Alloy, Intel showed how a real-world dollar bill can be used to manipulate objects in a virtual reality setting. The headset packs in all the computing power needed for untethered virtual reality experiences with six degrees-of-freedom across a large space, collision detection and avoidance and more. Using real-world objects like hands to manipulate objects in VR. In another example, the user sees and uses their hands to interact with elements of their virtual world, merging realities. And through its new deal with Microsoft, Intel is looking to mainstream those reality experiences on PCs. Project Alloy will be offered as an open source hardware platform with its own API in 2017. To learn more, read Intel CEO’s editorial on Medium in which he lays out his vision for merged reality and watch Intel’s promotional video embedded below. Aero, Intel’s new drone platform Drone enthusiasts and developers can take advantage of Intel’s new Aero Platform, an optional Vision Accessory Kit and an Intel Atom-powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicles developer kit to build sophisticated drone apps. The developer kit is a fully assembled quadcopter “the size of a standard playing card” with advanced depth and computer vision capabilities built on the RealSense technology. Intel’s Aero platform gives developers a quick way to build their own drone apps. Intel’s Aero Ready To Fly Drone supports several plug-and-play options, including a flight controller with Dronecode PX4 software, RealSense for vision and AirMap SDK for airspace services. The Aero compute board is available for $399 at click.intel.com. Here’s a nice video showing off a new Typhoon H drone utilizing the Intel RealSense technology to navigate obstacles while following its subject using GPS. Using intelligent obstacle navigation, the $1,899 drone not only avoids objects, but also plots an alternative course around obstacles. Pre-orders for the Aero Ready To Fly Drone opened today and the device will be available by end of year, said Intel. For upcoming programs and announcements on aerial technology, see Intel’s website and read the Aero fact sheet. Tidbits Aside from the new Kaby Lake chips, Project Alloy merged reality platform and Aero drone platform, Intel wooed developers with a bunch of other announcements. Some of the more interesting announcements include Joule, which is a maker board with a RealSense depth-sensing camera targeted at Internet of Things developers that’ll be featured in the upcoming season of America’s Greatest Makers; various tools for RealSense technology development; an all-new TXL Labs production studio “dedicated to pushing the limits of technology for production” and more. Last but not least, the chip giant announced a licensing deal with ARM that’ll let it produce ARM-based chips for third-parties (the CPU inside Apple’s A-series chips is built on the ARM platform, for example). What’s your favorite Intel announcement, and why? I must admit, I’m pretty stoked about the whole merged reality thingy and that VR headset.

The brains of the operation: a tiny new computer called Joule about the size of two dimes side by side. It's not anything consumers will buy, but Intel hopes it'll find a place in industry and to power myriad new computerized devices. This area, called the internet of things, is bringing computing smarts, camera eyes and network communications to things like traffic signals and pet collars. As PC sales decline year after year, Intel is betting the internet of things will shore up its business and keep the company on the cutting edge of the world's digital future. Pivothead builds AR safety glasses using Intel's Joule Intel shows how its new Joule technology can be used to advance computer vision using a set of augmented-reality safety glasses. 3:43 Close Drag The Joule is brainy enough to capture 4K video, communicate over Wi-Fi networks and run an Intel RealSense camera that captures 3D information as well as ordinary imagery. It's powered by a 2.4GHz Intel Atom processor, and has 4GB of memory, built-in graphics acceleration and can connect to outside devices with USB 3.0 ports. General Electric is a fan. Chief Executive Jeff Immelt took to the stage at IDF, saying the internet of things will make industry more productive and lead to smart cities that are safer and less clogged with traffic.

Called Knowledge Builder, Krzanich said that application creators will see their development time reduced down from weeks to mere minutes by using this new solution. Unfortunately, Knowledge Builder is only made available to select customers at this time. As Krzanich explained in his keynote presentation, today’s cloud is made by people: Facebook posts, messages on Twitter, emails, pictures and files shared from cloud drives. The average person generates around 600 to 700 megabits of data each day. But by 2020, these same individuals are expected to generate around 1.5GB of data on the Internet each day. Even more, airplane data will use 40,000GB per day and a smart factory will generate 1 million gigabites per day. That’s a lot of data residing in the cloud. Related: Intel’s Project Alloy is a wireless VR headset that merges the real and virtual To analyze and interpret it all, the data will need to be distributed across a massive number of computers given that one single machine can’t handle it all. It will need computing at “the edge, the middle, and in the cloud,” Krzanich explained, and will be made possible by Intel technology. Data fuels the cloud, and without it, the cloud is empty. Thus for developers, Intel provides tools to analyze all that data locally, “in the fog between,” or in the cloud itself. Thus enter the Intel Curie module for sending “insightful” data into the cloud. It’s nothing new of course, a tiny computer module for devices and wearables to digitize nearly every movement of the end-user. This Curie chip was actually demonstrated before the keynote began in a set of gloves used to play virtual synthesizers. The musician merely moved his fingers in the air to play virtual keys, and moved his hands to virtual sectors in the air to play different sounds (audio fonts). “In this small size, we packed the Intel Quark SoC, a Bluetooth Low Energy radio, a series of sensors, battery-charging capability, and an innovative pattern matching engine,” Krzanich told the audience. He added that Intel has released a variety of hardware and software tools for Curie over the last several years, and now the company is adding to that arsenal with the release of the Knowledge Builder toolset. Previously, developers had to send sensor data from systems like Curie to another computing system, like a large computer, or in some cases, into the cloud, where the pattern matching would occur. However, developers can now do all of that within the current Curie module itself. That all said, Intel’s Knowledge Builder toolkit allows developers to create an intelligent sensing application that runs directly on the Curie module using its on-chip pattern-matching engine. Related: Intel’s Joule is a maker platform so small it can be installed in safety glasses “It accelerates the process by using example data to train new algorithms,” he said. “So rather than having to use data scientists to understand those patterns, you can truly just use the motions themselves, and do them real-time.” That essentially means Curie can be used to identify any special movement, such as pattern-matching a karate kick by placing the module on someone’s leg, or placing the module on someone’s wrist and pattern-matching his/her tennis swing. First several motions are captured, and then those motions are imported into Knowledge Builder to identify those real-world movements. After that, Knowledge Builder analyzes the system and performs all the data science locally for the developer. Right now, “select customers” are using Knowledge Builder for sports applications, health care, manufacturing, and more. The solution will become broadly available in Q1 2017 for developers to create applications that rely on Intel’s Curie module.

Virtual reality and the real world must coexist, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said today at his company's developer conference in San Francisco. He hopes to mix the virtual and real together with Project Alloy, an aptly amed initiative that promises to free VR from the confines of tethers and dedicated spaces in people's living rooms. Instead of a single hardware product, Alloy represents Intel's vision of how future VR headsets should function. Compared to the current generation of high-end headsets like the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, the most striking difference is the lack of a series of cables connecting it to a PC. Alloy-based headsets will "cut the VR cord," allowing a free range of motion across a large space. Jettisoning the tether is made possible by a small piece of hardware Intel is calling a "Head-Mounted Device," which handles all of the computing power needed to run VR apps. It's a similar concept to the smartphones that power the Samsung Gear VR and Google Cardboard, but much more powerful. Project Alloy-based headsets will also incorporate Intel's RealSense cameras. Besides eliminating the need for dedicated tracking sensors, RealSense can display real-world objects—like your hands or a person standing in front of you—in the virtual world. Intel engineer Craig Raymond showed it off by approaching Krzanich on stage while wearing an Alloy prototype headset. Krzanich's head immediately came into view, with the RealSense camera tracking his movements in relation to the virtual room in which Raymond was standing. //Related Articles Report: Intel Eyes Augmented Reality Headset The demonstration was not perfect—it took a few tries for Raymond to get his hands to appear when he walked to a new location on stage, and the live feed that RealSense uses to deliver the real-world elements was choppy and jagged. But assuming Intel irons those issues out before Alloy technology ships to developers in 2017, it will have a powerful VR solution capable of eliminating the "chaperone" problem with which the Vive and Rift have to deal. Instead of a grid that appears on those headsets when the wearer gets to close to the walls or other objects of the real world, those objects could themselves appear and disappear as needed in the virtual world. The main ingredient in making that happen, of course, is enough computing power to render both the real and virtual worlds simultaneously. That's what Intel does best, and if it can deliver this time, it will likely inspire the confidence developers need to make the next generation of VR games and apps.

 Intel has a new concept for a wireless virtual reality headset Steve Kovach Aug. 16, 2016, 3:54 PM 1,515 facebook linkedin twitter email print Intel's Project Alloy VR headset. Intel Intel, the company best known for making computer chips, is now exploring virtual reality. The company announced on Tuesday a concept device called Project Alloy, a wireless VR headset that unlike the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, doesn't need to be tethered to a computer to operate. Alloy is just a prototype now, and it's unlikely Intel will launch a standalone product. Instead, Intel is making Alloy an open hardware platform anyone can use to build VR headsets. It'll also work with Windows Holographic, the special version of Windows designed for augmented reality and VR. Intel has been in a tough spot in recent years as its core PC chip business struggles along with the PC market as a whole. The company already whiffed on its chance to develop mobile processors for phones and tablets, and has started exploring other categories like drones and now VR.

Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich was scant on details of the L.A. studio, named Intel Tech Experience Labs, but said it will be “dedicated to pushing the limits of the technology for production, to really define what is possible with the tech." Unlike a traditional film studio, the lab will focus on helping others create virtual reality video using Intel technology.  Intel did not immediately respond to requests for comment about when and where the lab will open.  Caption 4 Stories You Can't Miss New York sees a surge of swastika vandalism since the election, scientists say they've found a way to give you a little extra warning before an earthquake strikes, the West Nile virus is spreading and in some cases the symptoms are dire, and one of Donald Trump's firsts tasks will be nominating a judge to replace Supreme Court justice Scalia.  New York sees a surge of swastika vandalism since the election, scientists say they've found a way to give you a little extra warning before an earthquake strikes, the West Nile virus is spreading and in some cases the symptoms are dire, and one of Donald Trump's firsts tasks will be nominating a judge to replace Supreme Court justice Scalia.  Caption 4 Stories You Can't Miss New York sees a surge of swastika vandalism since the election, scientists say they've found a way to give you a little extra warning before an earthquake strikes, the West Nile virus is spreading and in some cases the symptoms are dire, and one of Donald Trump's firsts tasks will be nominating a judge to replace Supreme Court justice Scalia.  New York sees a surge of swastika vandalism since the election, scientists say they've found a way to give you a little extra warning before an earthquake strikes, the West Nile virus is spreading and in some cases the symptoms are dire, and one of Donald Trump's firsts tasks will be nominating a judge to replace Supreme Court justice Scalia.  Caption 3 men found shot to death inside Compton park maintenance shed Three men who were found shot to death in a shed in a Compton park appear to have been squatters, sheriff’s homicide detectives said Wednesday.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Intel unveils Project Alloy virtual reality platform by Eric Born  2:18 PM on August 16, 2016 Oculus Rift and HTC Vive aren't the only companies dreaming big about virtual reality. At the Intel Developer Forum today, Intel's CEO Brian Krzanich revealed Project Alloy, the company's upcoming "merged reality" solution. Intel plans to offer the Project Alloy platform to developers sometime in 2017. One of Project Alloy's key technologies is Intel's RealSense camera system. These cameras enable movement with six degrees of freedom—without the need for external sensors or cameras. The RealSense cameras also offer merged reality features. Intel claims that Project Alloy allows users to see their hands, friends, and nearby walls while still interacting with virtual worlds. Unlike the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, which require users to own a powerful gaming computer, Intel's Project Alloy is an all-in-one device that doesn't need to be tethered to a computer. Intel hasn't revealed what kind of hardware will power the device, but claims that the device "completely redefines what is possible" from an all-in-one VR device.  Intel doesn't appear to be interested in making and selling its own Project Alloy devices, at least for the long term. Instead, Intel plans to make its technologies available to other developers. The company will open-source the Alloy hardware and SDK in 2017.  Tags: Graphics Mobile computing Gaming Register | Remember me View options x Subscriber options: E-mail me when people reply to my comments Comment sorting order: Flat, chronologicalNo threading.

The wire-free VR headset explained Mike Lowe17 August 2016VR Pocket-lint Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Virtual reality is a big deal, but delving into the virtual world typically requires a tethered-to-PC solution. That's where Intel Project Alloy does things differently: this all-in-one VR headset is designed without wires, with all its computational power and batteries tucked away inside. Is it set to be the ultimate VR headset? Intel Project Alloy: No tether required The premier VR headsets available today, such as Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, require a hardwire tether to associated PC, which can get in the way of the experience. Project Alloy has no wires to tether to any external sources (unless you want a video out to a separate screen), instead putting the computational power and batteries inside the device. That makes it more like the Samsung Gear VR, but with greater computational power potential. However, there are questions over this kind of design as it will surely be heavier than the competition, bringing its comfort into question. And what of heat dissipation? We'll have to wait and see if Intel has cleverly designed the headset to avoid these issues, as graphics cards and high-end CPUs require some kind of cooling. Intel Project Alloy: Multi-room tracking The main point of difference that Project Alloy offers compared to its competition is the integration of Intel RealSense cameras. This means the headset doesn't require any additional sensors placed around the room to detect its surroundings, unlike HTC Vive's arrangement of dedicated sensors. This means Project Alloy offers what Intel CEO, Brian Krzanich, describes as "multi-room tracking", i.e. the ability to use it throughout any given space, not just a dedicated pre-scanned area. The RealSense cameras can not only detect surrounding objects' distance from the headset, they can also bring digital visualisations of them into the virtual space. So if you're about to walk into your kitchen table, it'll pop-up into your field of view. However, RealSense's depth perception isn't foolproof just yet and the way these objects appear in view look like rough Photoshop cutouts rather than smoothly integrated virtual elements. Intel Project Alloy: No physical controllers required The ability for RealSense to visualise surrounding objects and bring them into Project Alloy's virtual environment does bring another interesting prospect, though: you can use your hands as controllers, with each digit tracked and able to move through six degrees of mobility. Your actual hands can appear, digitally rendered, in the virtual world for reference. So there's no more clicking a controller button to, say, hold onto an object in virtual space - simply clasp your actual hand to hold onto virtual objects. Clever stuff - but it needs some tweaks, as the slightly fussy demonstration on stage at the 2016 Intel Developer Conference (IDF) made apparent when a push switch needed to be fisted into motion rather than accurately handled. Intel Project Alloy: What is 'Merged Reality'? That real objects can be digitally rendered into the virtual world in real-time does bring another interesting ability to Project Alloy: merged reality, or mixed reality. Pick up a physical object and, if it's close enough to the headset's RealSense cameras, it will also be digitally rendered into the virtual world. Almost like a reverse-engineered augmented reality, if you will. As this process is refined it could mean more intricate input, with real-world objects directly correlating to the virtual world. Grab a paintbrush and make a detailed painting, say. For the sake of the demo at IDF, Intel used a one dollar bill, its corner used to lathe a virtual cylinder of gold into a new virtual object. Obscure demo, we know, but there's wider scope for, say, puzzle games that require specific crafting in order to progress. Intel Project Alloy: When will it be available and how much will it cost? Project Alloy will be available to Intel partners from the second half of 2017. That likely means we won't see a real-world consumer product until 2018 or even later. Price is off the cards at this stage in time. It will be largely dependent on the compute power integrated in the product, we suspect. Whether it's a one-size-fits-all specification is not yet known.

Joule is essentially a tiny and powerful computer with all its standard up-to-date parts. But it also has enhanced sensors with support for Intel's RealSense tech that make it suitable for powering software for drones, robots, and other gadgets to help those devices see, analyze, and collect data about the real world. Intel says this type of vision and data collection should let Joule be used for automation as well. In an onstage demo today at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco, wearable company PivotHead showed off Joule powering a pair of industrial safety glasses. Because all of the computation happens on Joule itself, the glasses can perform real-time analysis of a scene. In PivotHead's case, the glasses were performing volt verification on a piece of aircraft. There's no need for wires, or a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection, as Joule is capable of handling all the processing. That makes it useful in areas with poor connectivity. Joule is a tiny computer with big potential for computer vision, AR, and VR Joule developer kits are available for purchase now from sites like Newegg, Intel says, and the company plans on certifying the board for use in more than 100 countries by the end of the year. The system is also already today in use in a number of industries with custom-made products. Those include a bartender robot with Joule-powered computer vision made by Japanese company VStone and a heads-up display from French company EyeSight built into the highway police motorcycle helmets. As for why Intel is pushing so hard to power obscure and mostly experimental devices, it all comes back to its chip making roots. Intel's biggest priority right now is ensuring both its hardware and its software is powering the next wave of computing devices, from drones and robots to augmented reality glasses and VR headsets. With Joule and RealSense, Intel can stay involved in the more cutting-edge sectors of the market because it's giving away the technology at a low cost and letting anyone take advantage of it. One of Intel's biggest missteps of the last 10 years was ceding ground in the smartphone chip industry to rivals and upstarts, leaving one of the world's biggest PC players out of the mobile boom. Krzanich's entire philosophy as CEO as has been to prevent that from happening with the Internet of Things. Products like Joule and Intel's Quark, Edison, and now Curie line of microcomputers for wearables are designed to keep the company competitive as more new devices — many of them everyday objects like accessories, clothing, and appliances — come online every day.

It’s utterly self-contained and appears to be rather comfortable to wear, despite its current bulky size. That said, Project Alloy features a built-in battery that appears to reside on the backside of the device’s head strap. The only cord that was used during Intel’s keynote presentation was one to project the wearer’s viewpoint onto the big screen for all to see. Project Alloy does not require external sensors nor does it require controllers for moving and interacting with the environment. Instead, the headset relies on a pair of Intel RealSense sensors. intel project alloy vr headset self contained brian krzanichMore intel project alloy vr headset self containedMore Thanks to these sensors, wearers have a full six degrees of freedom within the virtual world. These sensors can track every movement, enabling room-scale mobile VR. One sensor mounted on the front can even “scan” real objects and bring them into the virtual realm in real time, such as the wearer’s hand or another person’s head. Related: Intel confirms 2016 arrival of 3D XPoint-based Optane SSD In a demo, the user approached a virtual X-ray machine with his real hand and saw the bones underneath. He then interacted with a virtual switch using his actual hand too. After that, the demo went on to reveal that Project Alloy supports multi-room environments, allowing the wearer to physically walk into the new virtual area. Because the headset has the RealSense sensor on the front, he doesn’t bump into actual physical objects, including the CEO of Intel standing in his space on stage. But users aren’t limited to just their hands. As previously stated, the RealSense sensor will bring in any object that can be used to interact with the environment. In the demo, the wearer used a real dollar bill to shave a virtual spinning object. You can actually see the wearer’s hand holding the dollar bill in the virtual realm, not a rendered stand-in. Right now, the headset looks rather bulky, with the main component firmly supported on the wearer’s face by the weighted battery on the back of his head. This unit is supposedly completely balanced, and will likely reduce in size as Intel fine-tunes the components within. Thus, because it’s self-contained, the Intel-powered computer resides inside the device, which likely resembles a NUC. Read More Intel Project AlloyMore That all said, Intel is expanding upon the foundation established by the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive by mixing the real world with a virtual environment. It’s the exact opposite of Microsoft’s HoloLens headset, which projects holograms into the user’s view of the real world. However, Krzanich indicated that Project Alloy would be able to bring the virtual into the real world at some point in the project’s future. Intel’s initial keynote opened up with the possibility of VR becoming so life-like it will be hard to distinguish it from the real world. That’s the road Intel plans to take with Project Alloy, and while the current system is capable of bringing real objects into VR, the “scans” aren’t particularly high resolution just yet. The project is still very much in development, but it’s a good indication of where virtual and mixed reality are heading.

Such experiences are said to be incredibly immersive but require said tether due to the immense amount of processing power and data that needs to be pumped to and from the visor. There’s also the issue of control / hand tracking in the virtual world as well as the fact that you’re totally oblivious to the real world around you and the people / objects in it. Given these limitations, it’s no surprise that we’re seeing some major players shift their attention to augmented reality. Such was the case on Tuesday during the keynote at the Intel Developer Forum (IDF) where Intel CEO Brian Krzanich unveiled a new “mixed reality” headset called Project Alloy (Intel is describing it as VR but it’s more AR). Intel’s reference design headset has a lot more in common with Microsoft’s HoloLens than it does the Oculus Rift or the HTC Vive. For starters, it’s a self-contained unit meaning all of the hardware needed for processing, (RealSense) cameras, sensors and the battery are built into the unit (no tether). Intel gave a brief demo during the keynote where it revealed its plans for Project Alloy. Unlike the competition, Intel isn’t planning to manufacture the wearable itself. Instead, they’re aiming to open both the hardware and APIs to allow developers and partners to create their own branded products using the Alloy design. Unfortunately, that won’t happen until the second half of 2017 at the earliest but it’s still an important step forward in the AR / VR universe.

How Microsoft thinks we'll use Windows 10 from next year 16 Aug 2016 at 19:06, Chris Williams Chris Williams Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics Windows 10, Arm, Apple, Intel, Microsoft Recent Articles Today the web was broken by countless hacked devices – your 60-second summary AMD is a rounding error on Intel's spreadsheet and that sucks for us all Intel stock falls on glum Q4 IDF16 First, it scrapped the classic Start Menu and gave us Tiles. Now Microsoft has confirmed it really is working on yet another radical user interface update – one that will allow you to use your desktop Windows 10 PC with virtual reality headsets. The feature, due to arrive next year, is dubbed the Windows Holographic Shell. It is designed to work on any normal PC, not just high-end graphics rigs; the emphasis is on the fact that anyone with a half decent machine can use the new UI. The Holographic Shell will run and present universal and so-called mixed reality apps in a multitasking 3D space in a connected VR headset. It doesn't matter if applications have classic 2D interfaces or new 3D controls: they'll be thrown together into a realtime-rendered make-believe world around the user like some kind of 1997 Silicon Graphics Inc tech demo. When you wear your "six degrees of freedom" headset, you can manipulate the 3D desktop using a Wii-like remote control, basically pointing at dialog boxes and icons hovering in the air and clicking on them rather than moving a mouse pointer on a 2D screen. Here's what Microsoft reckons Windows Holographic will look like on a modest Intel NUC box, running at 90 frames per second: Youtube Video For reference, NUCs sport Intel's 5th or 6th generation Core processors and its Iris graphics chipset. Confirmation of the Holographic Shell emerged at this year's Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco today. It comes after Microsoft started slinging its HoloLens gear at more and more people this month, and mentioned virtual reality coming to mainstream Windows 10 editions in June. Meanwhile, Microsoft is working on formalizing a specification with Intel for interfacing PCs with head-mounted displays, allowing hardware makers to build headsets and computers that are compatible with Intel's chipsets and Microsoft's software. The spec is due to be published by the end of the year. "Our shared goal is to enable our hardware partners to build a broad range of devices for the mainstream consumer and business markets," said Windows exec veep Terry Myerson on Tuesday. "We are working with several partners on the spec today, and plan to publicly release v1 of the spec at the Windows Hardware Engineering Community (WinHEC) conference in Shenzhen in December." Microsoft's move into virtual reality desktops is a bold one; the software giant was caught out by the sudden rise of touchscreen tablets and smartphones, and doesn't want to be late to this party. For one thing, Redmond is using its massive install base of Windows desktop devices to push mixed reality workspaces to people at work and at home. "I believe Microsoft has taken the industry lead in augmented reality and mixed reality with its own head-mounted display HoloLens, mixed reality operating system and partner ecosystem," tech industry analyst Patrick Moorhead told The Register during IDF. "This was a refreshing change for Microsoft who entered the smartphone space late. Microsoft and Intel working together on mixed reality is a very positive sign and historically, more has been accomplished with the two working together than against each other. "Intel and Microsoft were not aligned in smartphones or tablets and the result was negative for both. The result of this alignment will mean that there will be literally hundreds of millions of mixed reality end points with users’ interaction over augmented and virtual reality, mobile and stationary." ® Sponsored: 10 Reasons LinuxONE is the best choice for Linux workloads Tips and corrections 125 Comments More from The Register NooBaa wraps AWS S3 wool around Microsoft Azure Blob storage Upstart lets apps use on and off-prem storage in two shakes of a lamb's tail 2 Comments Microsoft joins the 1c/GB/month cloud storage caper 'Cool Blobs' restore ASAP, 99 per cent of the time 7 Comments Microsoft boffins: Who needs Intel CPUs when you've got FPGAs?

But Intel thinks its newest PC processor will get some hearts racing in a few months. At its Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco on Tuesday, Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich showed PCs powered by a seventh-generation Core processor in PCs handling some demanding chores -- editing high-resolution 4K GoPro video and playing a hot new first-person shooter game, Overwatch. It's "the highest performance CPU Intel has ever built. It'll make rich experiences available to everyone," Krzanich said. "We're shipping seventh-generation Core already to our PC partners and will launch devices to consumers this fall." The seventh-generation Core processor, code-named Kaby Lake, is the first PC chip to emerge since Intel slowed its "tick-tock" pace of processor development. It previously introduced new chip designs and new manufacturing technology in alternating years, but Kaby Lake just refines an existing design on an existing manufacturing process. The slower cadence isn't the only trouble for Intel. The steady improvement in processor clock speeds has largely stalled, PC sales are shrinking and consumers have flocked to smartphones powered by other companies' chips. But Krzanich is optimistic about Moore's Law, the observation named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore that the number of electronic components on a chip doubles every two years. "Moore's Law is far from dead," Krzanich said.

Graphics Cards Motherboards Cases/Cooling Processors Chipsets Memory Displays Systems Storage Mobile Networking Username: * Password: * Register | Password Reminder Home » News IDF 2016: Intel Project Alloy Promises Untethered VR and AR Experiences Subject: General Tech, Processors, Displays, Shows and Expos | August 16, 2016 - 01:50 PM | Ryan Shrout Tagged: VR, virtual reality, project alloy, Intel, augmented reality, AR At the opening keynote to this summer’s Intel Developer Forum, CEO Brian Krzanich announced a new initiative to enable a completely untether VR platform called Project Alloy. Using Intel processors and sensors the goal of Project Alloy is to move all of the necessary compute into the headset itself, including enough battery to power the device for a typical session, removing the need for a high powered PC and a truly cordless experience. This is indeed the obvious end-game for VR and AR, though Intel isn’t the first to demonstrate a working prototype. AMD showed the Sulon Q, an AMD FX-based system that was a wireless VR headset. It had real specs too, including a 2560x1440 OLED 90Hz display, 8GB of DDR3 memory, an AMD FX-8800P APU with R7 graphics embedded. Intel’s Project Alloy is currently using unknown hardware and won’t have a true prototype release until the second half of 2017. There is one key advantage that Intel has implemented with Alloy: RealSense cameras. The idea is simple but the implications are powerful. Intel demonstrated using your hands and even other real-world items to interact with the virtual world. RealSense cameras use depth sensing to tracking hands and fingers very accurately and with a device integrated into the headset and pointed out and down, Project Alloy prototypes will be able to “see” and track your hands, integrating them into the game and VR world in real-time. The demo that Intel put on during the keynote definitely showed the promise, but the implementation was clunky and less than what I expected from the company. Real hands just showed up in the game, rather than representing the hands with rendered hands that track accurately, and it definitely put a schism in the experience. Obviously it’s up to the application developer to determine how your hands would actually be represented, but it would have been better to show case that capability in the live demo.   Better than just tracking your hands, Project Alloy was able to track a dollar bill (why not a Benjamin Intel??!?) and use it to interact with a spinning lathe in the VR world. It interacted very accurately and with minimal latency – the potential for this kind of AR integration is expansive. Those same RealSense cameras and data is used to map the space around you, preventing you from running into things or people or cats in the room. This enables the first “multi-room” tracking capability, giving VR/AR users a new range of flexibility and usability. Though I did not get hands on with the Alloy prototype itself, the unit on-stage looked pretty heavy, pretty bulky. Comfort will obviously be important for any kind of head mounted display, and Intel has plenty of time to iterate on the design for the next year to get it right. Both AMD and NVIDIA have been talking up the importance of GPU compute to provide high quality VR experiences, so Intel has an uphill battle to prove that its solution, without the need for external power or additional processing, can truly provide the untethered experience we all desire. Source: PC Perspective Comments Post a comment August 16, 2016 | 03:25 PM - Posted by Anonymous (not verified) Really both AMD and Imagination Technologies(PowerVR Wizard) are getting their better than Intel GPU technology into wired/wireless VR headsets using APUs/SOCs and The PowerVR Wizard with the Ray Tracing units on the GPU will make for some very realistic lighting effects(1). AMD will probably have some Bristol Ridge SKUs to update that FX8800p first generation excavator product with a Bristol Ridge/DDR4 and a little more GPU performance in a headset wireless or otherwise. 2017 will bring on Zen/Polaris at 14nm and even more GCN CUs and ACE units to make for even better performance at a more affordable prices than any Intel offerings. I’m sure that SoftBank's ARM Holdings will have some Mali/Bifrost offerings to compete with both AMD and Imagination Technologies for the Headset with its own SOC/APU compute market for wired and wireless headsets with a little bit of their own compute to accelerate games driven from Tablet/Phones and even laptops more realistically than any Intel graphics IP. Nvidia is the big unanswered question in the VR headset integrated APU/SOC wired/wireless market with Nvidia canceling its update for its next generation Tegra powered Tablets, but Intel lacks the total GPU IP that Imagination Technologies, and AMD, Nvidia, and ARM has for low power using graphics with good performance metrics relative to Intel’s SKUs. That PowerVR Wizard GR6500's dedicated Ray Tracing hardware is going to put Imagination Technologies in the lead for self contained VR headsets with their own SOC/APU processing power at low wattage for the Mobile VR headset market. Apple really needs to get that PowerVR Ray Tracing hardware in its next iPad Tablet SKUs.

That and also it is much easier to introduce walled garden app store into these. reply August 17, 2016 | 04:16 AM - Posted by Anonymous (not verified) It was a neat demonstration, but previous testing of the Realsense devices available have shown they are not performant enough for inside-out head tracking for VR (tracking fidelity too low, jitter too high, latency too high). It may be this is a newer and more capable revision of the Realsense hardware, but I'd wait to actually test this device before betting on it. Intel seems to not want to release it themselves but rather sell it as a 'solution' to vendors, so that puts someone else on the hook to actually get positional tracking working to an acceptable degree (or more likely, drop it as a feature and just do Leap Motion-style hand tracking). reply Post new comment Your name: * E-mail: * The content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly.

By Mary Jo Foley for All About Microsoft | August 16, 2016 -- 17:16 GMT (10:16 PDT) | Topic: Windows 10 At the Intel Developer Forum, Microsoft officials provided more details and a roadmap outlining some of the steps the company will take to open the Windows Holographic Platform to various "mixed reality" devices. Microsoft is collaborating with Intel on a specification for "mixed-reality-ready" PCs and head-mounted displays (HMDs), said Windows and Devices Group chief Terry Myerson in an August 16 blog post. That spec will be the basis for Microsoft's hardware partners to build both consumer and business devices that can handle mixed reality. The plan is for Microsoft, Intel and other partners to release version 1 of the spec at the Windows Hardware Engineering Community (WinHEC) conference in Shenzhen. (That conference is now slated for December 2016; an earlier leak had it pegged for the first week in November.) IDF 2016 Intel lays out its 5G, IoT strategy Intel CEO Brian Krzanich unveils Project Alloy Microsoft fleshes out its Windows 10 mixed-reality roadmap Intel, ARM forge foundry partnership in bet on manufacturing prowess Microsoft extends again support for Windows 7, 8.1 Skylake-based devices Intel taking its six-core processors mainstream in 2018 Microsoft plans to release "an update to Windows 10" next year -- I'm assuming as part of or maybe as an add-on to Redstone 2, expected to be available in spring 2017 -- that will "enable mainstream PCs to run the Windows Holographic shell and associated mixed reality and universal Windows applications," Myerson also said in today's post. Microsoft officials said in June at Computex that the company wasn't just limiting the Windows 10 variant tuned to work with HoloLens -- known as the Windows Holographic platform -- to Microsoft's HoloLens augmented-reality goggles. Microsoft officials said at that time they would open up the Windows Holographic platform to any companies that want to build devices that can handle mixed reality. Mixed reality is the term for blending 2D and 3D in apps simultaneously. Mixed reality encompasses a spectrum of experiences, from virtual reality (VR) enhanced with holograms, to holographic computing devices enhanced with "real" life images. Microsoft is hoping its hardware partners will adapt the Windows Holographic platform so that virtual reality devices will be able to incorporate real-world objects, and augmented reality devices will incorporate holograms. Microsoft is pitching Windows Holographic as a way to get different AR/VR/mixed reality devices to be able to communicate cross-platform as the market matures. Microsoft officials also posted today a video of a real Windows 10 holographic experience, running on an inexpensive and tiny Intel NUC at 90 frames per second, according to the company's blog post. Update: And for those wondering, as I was, Intel's Project Alloy untethered VR headset, announced today at IDF, is an example of one of the devices that will work with the coming Windows 10 Holographic Shell, as Intel's press release mentions in passing. "Intel is collaborating with Microsoft to optimize Windows-based content and experiences on Intel-based VR devices such as Alloy," according to the release. "Intel will open the Alloy hardware and provide open APIs for the ecosystem, allowing developers and partners to create their own branded products from the Alloy design, in 2017," the release adds.

Credit: Intel More like this Intel experiments with 3D Xpoint as it ships SSDs to testers Micron reveals marketing details about 3D XPoint memory QuantX Intel lets slip roadmap for Optane SSDs with 1,000X performance Video SanDisk crams 200GB onto MicroSD Intel isn't yet shipping its Optane SSDs, but they soon will be available for testing in the cloud. This is good news for enterprise users, who are eagerly awaiting the new class of storage and memory shown to break SSD speed records. Optane is based on 3D Xpoint technology, which is 10 times faster than the technology in standard SSDs. It also can serve as a substitute to traditional DRAM, but software needs to be written so parts of Optane operate like memory tiers. Optane SSDs will be available at the end of the year to enterprises and gamers. Unfortunately for gamers, the cloud-based Optane test bed will be accessible for free only to enterprise users looking to test applications tied to financial transactions, machine learning, autonomous driving and other uses, Intel said. Optane offers many advantages, but applications will need to be written for the storage and memory structures. The blazing speed of Optane SSDs will allow them to cache data and provide in-memory data processing features. The caching feature will be important in gaming, where game levels can be pre-loaded on SSDs ahead of time, allowing for quicker load times. Intel plans to show how memory tiers can be designed in Optane SSDs with the help of software from ScaleMP, which provides virtualization tools for in-memory computing. ScaleMP typically provides tools for high-end computing. The test bed will help enterprises prepare applications that could be used once Optane SSDs start shipping. More details on access to Optane through the cloud will be provided at Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco this week. Optane is generating excitement from prospective users. Intel will ship Optane SSDs for laptops and 2-in-1s, as well as memory DIMMs based on 3D Xpoint, starting next year. The storage will be compatible with NVMe slots, which are used for SSDs today and work with systems running on CPUs not designed by Intel. Intel and Micron jointly developed 3D Xpoint technology. SSDs based on 3D Xpoint technology from Micron will be available next year to enterprise customers through storage companies.

Credit: Asus More like this Kaby Lake starts strong as Intel retools PC strategy Intel's new Kaby Lake chips for PC: Here's the company's vision Intel ships Kaby Lake chips, pointing to PC availability in a few months Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles Intel isn't known for its graphics processors, but the company is promising a big improvement with its 7th generation Core processors, code-named Kaby Lake. The Kaby Lake chips, which will succeed Skylake, will feature integrated 4K graphics processors, the company said at the Intel Developer Forum on Tuesday. Intel showed off Blizzard Entertainment's Overwatch shooter game running smoothly on a Dell XPS with a Kaby Lake chip during Intel CEO Brian Krzanich's keynote. Intel also showed off an HP 2-in-1 running 4K graphics. The chip will allow PCs to play premium 4K content smoothly, said an Intel representative demonstrating the PC. The chip will have hardware-accelerated 4K video decoding. While graphics will be smoother with Kaby Lake, you'll still need a separate graphics processor for virtual reality headsets and demanding games. Laptops based on Kaby Lake will ship this fall, Krzanich said during the keynote. Asus has already announced Transformer 3, a sleek 2-in-1 with Kaby Lake, and HP leaked the Kaby Lake Core i3-7100U chip in its upcoming Pavilion x360 m1 convertible PC. The chip has an HD Graphics 620 processor, which is capable of DirectX 12 gaming. Lenovo and Acer are announcing Kaby Lake devices ahead of the IFA trade show in Berlin next month. Kaby Lake's addition to Intel's chip lineup last year was unexpected and changed a tradition of two PC chip designs with every manufacturing process. After Broadwell and Skylake, it is the third Core chip design based on the 14-nanometer process. Kaby Lake continues Intel's practice of delivering yearly chip upgrades. It will be followed next year by the first 10-nm PC chips code-named Cannonlake.

Project Alloy, Project Aero, Euclid and more: Everything announced at IDF 2016 0 Tech Industry by Lori Grunin August 16, 2016 11:01 AM PDT @LoriGrunin Up Next Pokemon Go tracking finally goes live and actually works Intel, Microsoft jump into mixed reality with Project Alloy, and Windows Holographic tie-up Intel teams up with Microsoft on mixed reality, combining AR and VR into one environment using Windows Holographic. 1:58 Close Drag Intel's Developer Forum isn't as whizzy an event for consumers as Google's and Apple's similar events, mostly because unlike much of those developer events, Intel really is "inside" where you can't see it; it's all technology that will be inside the products of the future, in this case, Internet of Things (IoT), VR, artificial intelligence (AI) and self-driving cars. IDF16's theme: "The future is what you make." At the opening keynote, CEO Brian Krzanich took the stage to deliver an overview of Intel's take on "the experience of computing, visual intelligence, integration into products of the future, the cloud as a platform for innovation and how it expects to power the next generation of innovators." Here are the highlights. The event opened with a showcase of Intel technology powering musical instruments. First, the group Thud Rumble used its Invader smart mixer-powered turntables using Intel NUC (Next Unit of Computing) technology. They ran into minor technical difficulties. That was followed by an Intel Curie-enabled drum solo by someone wearing VR goggles (sorry I missed his name) with sensors on his feet and sticks, playing invisible (to us) drums. The most portable drum set ever. Then Kevin Doucette played a futuristic music device thingy with RealSense cameras on his hands, which emulated a virtual piano and a cello-sounding stringed instrument. A pianocello. At the same time. Want. Enlarge Image Intel CEO Brian Krzanich shows a drone at IDF 2016. Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET None of those Intel technologies are new, by the way. That moved into the keynote. Of course, it started with the usual look-how-wonderful-the-future-is-with-our-tech video highlighting VR, dubbed "Intel Merged Reality." Numbers, numbers, lots of developers in attendance. He showed how cumbersome and space-constrained current VR implementations are. Then we got a demo of how the company's new Project Alloy headset, equipped with RealSense cameras and essentially an onboard computer, makes VR wireless and self-contained. It's got 6 degrees of freedom, obstacle avoidance and multiroom tracking and you can introduce any real-world object into the scene (merged reality). And look, ma, I can see my hands! 27 Inside Project Alloy, Intel's wireless VR headset Terry Myerson, EVP of Windows and Devices group at Microsoft, discussed that company's HoloLens development and its mixed-reality software development partnership with Intel, Windows Holographic. It's a mixed-reality plug-and-play interface, and will be available next year on PCs running Windows 10. In the second half of 2107, Intel will open-source the Alloy hardware and the RealSense APIs. Then Krzanich moved on to existing projects of content creation for VR. Epic demonstrated an Unreal game engine editor operating in VR. Krzanich also showed the same Intel 360 Replay video that we saw at CES in January; new is a production studio in Los Angeles called TXL Labs. Next up, a sneak peek at its seventh-generation Core (code-named Kaby Lake) processors. They support hardware-accelerated 4K HEVC decoding and editing and improved graphics processing, at least for games. They're shipping now, and you can expect to see new devices with them this fall. Intel refers to the RealSense camera-enabled capabilities as "Visual Intelligence." Robots in the sky! And you can buy one of its obstacle-avoiding drones (video), first seen at CES, today. Project Aero is a reference board for creating your own sky robots. You can preorder starting today for $399. It also has a full drone reference design that will ship later in 2016 or early next year. Euclid is Intel's computing stick with Atom processor, RealSense camera and Linux, a controller designed to help develop on-the-ground robot-control systems. Krzanich then trotted out RealSense 400, a tiny new version of the camera with a doubled operating range. The "next big usage case" for Visual Intelligence = "the car of the future." Elmar Frickenstein, SVP and head of BMW's Autonomous Driving Program, was driven onto the stage by a car, natch. He repeated everything car folks usually say about what tech we still need for fully autonomous driving. On to the Internet of Things (IoT) and "THE COMING FLOOD OF DATA." This hits Intel in its sweet spot: processors. The new Knowledge Builder toolkit for developers provides access to the Curie's pattern-matching engine for real-time analysis of data derived from motion sensing on wearables. GE CEO Jeff Immelt discussed the business applications of the IoT (in this case, the "industrial internet"), notably how it can improve industrial productivity. The company gave a demonstration of its Predix technology powering a smart-LED light post with Intel sensors that sends metadata -- Krzanich made a point of stressing that it's metadata, not full tracking data -- for analyzing and managing people flow and traffic flow. For instance, delivering real-time parking information or air quality measurements. It can be extended to indoor spaces as well. Krzanich concluded with Joule, Intel's small next-generation DIY platform-on-a-board with RealSense cameras sized for glasses-size wearables. He brought out the winners of the company's "America's Greatest Makers" show with their gaming toothbrush from 2014, the Grush, which gamifies toothbrushing for kids. They said it's finally shipping by the holiday-shopping season. Aaaaand that's all folks.

The next milestone in 3D XPoint's journey to being a real product will be a cloud-based testbed for Optane SSDs. Intel will be giving enterprise customers free remote access to systems equipped with Optane SSDs so that they can benchmark how their software runs with 3D Xpoint-based storage and optimize it to take better advantage of the faster storage. By offering cloud-based access before even sampling Optane SSDs, Intel can keep 3D XPoint out of the hands of their competitors longer and perhaps make better use of limited supply while still enabling the software ecosystem to begin preparing for the revolution Intel is planning. However, this won't do much for customers who want to integrate and validate Optane SSDs with their existing hardware platforms and deployments. The cloud-based Optane testbed will be available by the end of the year, suggesting that we might not be seeing any Optane SSDs in the wild this year. But at the same time, the testbed would only be worth providing if its performance characteristics are going to be pretty close to that of the final Optane SSD products. Having announced the Optane testbed like this, Intel will probably be encouraging their partners to share their performance findings with the public, so we should at least get some semi-independent testing results in a few months time. In the meantime, Intel and ScaleMP will be demonstrating a use that Optane SSDs will be particularly well-suited for. ScaleMP's vSMP Foundation software family provides virtualization solutions for high performance computing applications. One of their specialities is providing VMs with far more virtual memory than the host system has DRAM, by transparently using NVMe SSDs—or even the DRAM and NVMe storage of other systems connected via Infiniband—to cache what doesn't fit in local DRAM. The latency advantages of 3D XPoint will make Optane SSDs far better swap devices than any flash-based SSDs, and the benefits should still be apparent even when some of that 3D XPoint memory is at the far end of an Infiniband link. ScaleMP and Intel have previously demonstrated that flash-based NVMe SSDs can be used as a cost-effective alternative to building a server with extreme amounts of DRAM, and with a performance penalty that can be acceptably small. With Optane SSDs that performance penalty should be significantly smaller, widening the range of applications that can make use of this strategy.   Intel will also be demonstrating Optane SSDs used to provide read caching for cloud application or database servers running on Open Compute hardware platforms.

Intel must really believe they have some special sauce. I look forward to learning more. Reply bartendalot - Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - link Intel believes it is a disruptive technology that will eliminate the need for DRAM. That's some special sauce there... Reply Guspaz - Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - link Huh? XPoint is still an order of magnitude slower than DRAM, and has 8 orders of magnitude less endurance, nothing in here leads me to believe they intend to replace DRAM. Supplement DRAM by turning primary memory into a two-tier system, on the other hand... Reply Vlad_Da_Great - Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - link @Guspaz. Endurance is irrelevant since the devices/hardware can easily achieve 5y or more on regular consumer type of usage. I believe the ROI will basically render the DRAM obsolete on that type of a metric. The speed will be replaced by energy consumption. The DRAM will not be completely avoided, but heavily suppressed. The DIMM's modules will hold only small part DRAM just enough for the OS to keep the essential data on it. Reply Cogman - Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - link DRAM is not regular consumer usage. DRAM Data changes extremely frequently. The reason these things can be used for swap is because the entire point of swap is to move currently inactive data out of main memory and into the swap. That is limited writing. If you replace all DRAM with this, then writing will go berserk. Last I checked, SSDs target somewhere around 1000->10000 writes per sector. In regular usage that isn't to big of an issue (this is why SSD controllers work hard to move data around and spread out writes). In a normal applications, that many writes is pretty much peanuts. DDR can pump around 17GB of data per second. As a swap, it makes sense. As main memory? No way you would do that. Reply Vlad_Da_Great - Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - link @Cogman. That is perfect for main memory on mobile devices, especially for notebooks. First it will combine the main memory RAM+SSD in one PCI-slot device, and second will increase the battery life about 5-10x, accounting NV factor and very low latency. So if the notebook can handle 9h of regular consumer type of work with those type of DIMMS is destined to hold for 2 days. The preliminary results show that current standards as SATA and PCI are too slow to allow the true speed to come to life. In the exceptionally intense I/O environment DRAM has no match, but those cases might be limited as the codes or the OS will improve. Reply SetiroN - Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - link Could you please stop talking about things you clearly have absolutely zero clue about? Reply Cogman - Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - link @SetiroN was that directed at me? If so, what would you say I'm wrong about? Reply SetiroN - Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - link Of course not. It was a reply to the clueless dude pulling imaginary computing out of his ass. Reply beginner99 - Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - link I see it makes sense in small mobile devices because one solution for storage and memory will save space but due to price will take years if this ever happens. However I fully disagree about battery life. The most important factor on most mobile devices is the display. We can see that now. 14/16 nmand did battery life dramatically increase vs the "bad" S810? Not really.

Now it's trying to avoid missing out on virtual reality. The chip giant hopes that VR, connected cars and other devices will play to its strengths. by Ina Fried Aug 16, 2016, 2:10pm EDT tweet share Linkedin Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, showing off the company’s Project Alloy virtual reality headset Intel There was a lot of talk about virtual reality as Intel kicked off its annual developer conference on Tuesday. CEO Brian Krzanich spent a good deal of time showing off a homegrown prototype device, Project Alloy, that features position tracking and the ability to merge the real and virtual worlds, all in a self-contained headset that doesn’t need to be tethered to a separate PC. Intel plans to freely share that design and is also working with Microsoft to bring holographic capabilities to all Windows 10 PCs by next year. Intel plans to make the designs for Project Alloy freely available to hardware makers. Intel Intel likes talking VR for a couple of reasons. First of all, virtual reality brings the tech world to Intel’s home turf, demanding all the processing power that its latest chips can provide. Right now the chip battle remains up for grabs. Intel has a central role in PC-centric devices like Facebook’s Oculus Rift and Microsoft’s HoloLens, while mobile headsets such as Samsung’s Gear VR and Google’s Daydream make use of the smartphone and its non-Intel mobile chip. There’s another reason Intel likes talking about VR. Actual reality has been a little rough for the world’s largest chipmaker over the last few years. Once the center of the tech world, Intel has seen its place sidelined as the world has shifted from PCs to smartphones and the chip giant has failed to keep pace. It has spent billions trying to get its chips into phones for little gain, with the mobile universe centered on chip designs from rival ARM. Sales, meanwhile, declined last year and the company announced plans to cut thousands of jobs. Intel is still a huge company, of course. Last year it took in $55 billion in revenue and made a hefty $11.4 billion in net income. If Intel is to return to growth, though, it needs to either shift into new areas or somehow bend the world back to its existing strengths. Intel is trying a little of both, spending a lot of money on tiny computing modules that could go in Internet of Things devices like robots, wearables and security systems. But it is also hoping that things like autonomous cars, virtual reality and smart cities will demand processing power that ARM-based mobile chips can’t provide. That’s where its annual developer conference comes in. In San Francisco, the company is pitching a record 6,000 developers on its vision of the tech future. Krzanich tapped GE chief Jeff Immelt as well as executives from BMW and Microsoft to bolster the argument. Rivals like Qualcomm and Nvidia are making a strong case that mobile chips, rather than PC processors, make more sense to power the cars, drones and connected appliances of the future. And despite record attendance, IDF has lost a fair amount of luster over the years as the PC has shifted from the center of the tech world to being just another device on the internet. Once upon a time, the Intel Developer Forum was the place to go to find out where the tech industry was headed. As the maker of nearly all the world’s PC chips, Intel was uniquely aware of what the industry would be capable of in a couple years’ time. So twice a year, reporters, analysts and techies headed to the California desert to see where the industry was going. More than a decade ago Intel moved things away from Palm Springs and back to Silicon Valley. These days, IDF is held in downtown San Francisco, a reflection of how much energy has shifted into the mobile economy and away from PC giants like Intel, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard. If there was a big positive to take away from Tuesday’s opening, it was that at least the PC giants understand their predicament. Analyst Patrick Moorhead said the fact that Intel and Microsoft appear to be on the same page is key. Microsoft and Intel talked up cooperation around virtual reality, including establishing a new set of guidelines so device makers can build a VR-ready system. "Historically, more has been accomplished with the two working together than against each other. Intel and Microsoft were not aligned in smartphones or tablets, and the result was negative for both," he said. recode_divider More From Recode Post-election ‘terror and hysteria’ over Trump is not justified, says Observer editor Ken Kurson Recode Daily: Facebook built a censorship tool that could help it get back into China Can the journalists who work for Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner still cover the White House fairly?

Resend activation e-mail Opposable Thumbs / Gaming & Entertainment Intel’s all-in-one Alloy VR headset doesn’t require a PC or smartphone "Mixed reality" device can see hands, objects, people with inside-out tracking. by Kyle Orland - Aug 16, 2016 6:10 pm UTC Login to bookmark 52 Intel The still-young virtual reality headset wars have a new competitor, though it's being sold as more of a "mixed reality" solution than purely VR. At the Intel Developer Forum today, the company announced Project Alloy, an untethered headset that packs everything into a single head-mounted display without the need for a PC or a mobile phone. In addition to the battery, display, and computing resources needed to run the headset, Project Alloy will also include Intel's Real Sense motion tracking system, which will use cameras and sensors to map the world around you and track your hands without the need for gloves or handheld controllers. The system can also see real-world objects and integrate them into the virtual world, as shown in a demo where the user opened a real door and saw his boss' face appear in the virtual world (hence the "mixed reality" moniker Intel stressed in its presentation). Alloy will be integrated with Microsoft's Windows Holographic platform, which will itself be available on all Windows 10 PCs next year. Intel also said it plans to release the Alloy hardware specs under an open source license at some point, letting others essentially use it as a reference design for their own hardware. The Alloy announcement immediately called to mind the similar AMD-powered Sulon Q headset, announced back in March as an all-in-one VR headset with inside-out untethered tracking. As with that headset, we're somewhat skeptical that Alloy will be able to deliver a powerful, high-fidelity VR experience without encountering weight and heat-dissipation issues. In any case, it's an ambitious direction for Intel to take and an interesting new development in what's shaping up to be a crowded headset marketplace.

Intel's Project Alloy… Look ma, no wires! Intel's Project Alloy gives VR full freedom of movement By Kevin Parrish — August 16, 2016 10:59 AM Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends During the Intel Developer Forum 2016 opening keynote on Tuesday, company CEO Brian Krzanich finally revealed the company’s virtual reality project, aka “Project Alloy.” The headset is completely untethered, meaning users can move about freely without cords, and without an additional PC and battery strapped to their back. It’s utterly self-contained and appears to be rather comfortable to wear, despite its current bulky size. That said, Project Alloy features a built-in battery that appears to reside on the backside of the device’s head strap. The only cord that was used during Intel’s keynote presentation was one to project the wearer’s viewpoint onto the big screen for all to see. Project Alloy does not require external sensors nor does it require controllers for moving and interacting with the environment. Instead, the headset relies on a pair of Intel RealSense sensors. Thanks to these sensors, wearers have a full six degrees of freedom within the virtual world. These sensors can track every movement, enabling room-scale mobile VR. One sensor mounted on the front can even “scan” real objects and bring them into the virtual realm in real time, such as the wearer’s hand or another person’s head. Related: Intel confirms 2016 arrival of 3D XPoint-based Optane SSD In a demo, the user approached a virtual X-ray machine with his real hand and saw the bones underneath. He then interacted with a virtual switch using his actual hand too. After that, the demo went on to reveal that Project Alloy supports multi-room environments, allowing the wearer to physically walk into the new virtual area. Because the headset has the RealSense sensor on the front, he doesn’t bump into actual physical objects, including the CEO of Intel standing in his space on stage. But users aren’t limited to just their hands. As previously stated, the RealSense sensor will bring in any object that can be used to interact with the environment. In the demo, the wearer used a real dollar bill to shave a virtual spinning object. You can actually see the wearer’s hand holding the dollar bill in the virtual realm, not a rendered stand-in. Right now, the headset looks rather bulky, with the main component firmly supported on the wearer’s face by the weighted battery on the back of his head. This unit is supposedly completely balanced, and will likely reduce in size as Intel fine-tunes the components within. Thus, because it’s self-contained, the Intel-powered computer resides inside the device, which likely resembles a NUC. That all said, Intel is expanding upon the foundation established by the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive by mixing the real world with a virtual environment. It’s the exact opposite of Microsoft’s HoloLens headset, which projects holograms into the user’s view of the real world. However, Krzanich indicated that Project Alloy would be able to bring the virtual into the real world at some point in the project’s future. Intel’s initial keynote opened up with the possibility of VR becoming so life-like it will be hard to distinguish it from the real world. That’s the road Intel plans to take with Project Alloy, and while the current system is capable of bringing real objects into VR, the “scans” aren’t particularly high resolution just yet. The project is still very much in development, but it’s a good indication of where virtual and mixed reality are heading.

As well as a processor, storage, and connectivity, Joule can be hooked up to a RealSense camera array for depth-sensing and motion tracking. To demonstrate just what you can do with an embedded computer like Joule, Intel brought out a set of PivotHead’s special safety glasses which are intended to make construction of things like jets safer and more efficient. The glasses have a camera, powered by Joule, which tracks whether screws are in the correct places and of the correct size: if they’re not, an audio warning is played to the technician wearing them. The idea is, Intel says, to make it effectively transparent to the user – until something helpful can be added. There’s no visible interface, no augmented reality overlays projected into the lenses; instead, the glasses watch silently until an alert needs to be made. The glasses can also trigger a VoIP call with a remote expert for further assistance. They’ve caught the attention of Airbus, too, which is looking at how it can use the Joule-powered system in its production facilities. Other potential applications include robots, drones, virtual reality and augmented reality wearables, and micro-scale servers, Intel says. Indeed, the technology has caught the attention of GE, who is using Intel’s embedded compute for its Current smart city lighting. By fitting cameras and processing into light posts, the system can track whether road crossings are being used, identify empty parking spots, and classify different types of road use. That data could be essential for autonomous cars, Intel suggests, helping guide such vehicles to empty spots in the city as they wait for another occupant. Much of Intel’s talk at its IDF 2016 developer conference in San Francisco, CA today has been around making full computers smaller and more readily integrated into other platforms. For instance, the chip company previewed an upcoming turnkey drone reference design, built around its $399 Aero ‘board, which includes RealSense for obstacle avoidance along with LTE connectivity for real-time video streaming. Euclid, meanwhile, does much the same as Aero does but on the ground, fitting an Atom processor, storage, memory, wireless connectivity, a battery, and a RealSense camera into a device roughly the size of an old-school USB webcam. Intel predicts it’ll end up the heart of many a DIY robotics project, complete with a simplistic drag-and-drop programming UI that lives in the browser. Finally, there’s Intel’s own Project Alloy “mixed reality” headset, a completely self-contained computer and VR wearable. The plans for making that will be released as open-source in the latter half of 2017. As for Joule, two versions will be offered, 570x and 550x, and it’ll go on sale from today at IDF 2016 with the 570x priced at $369.99. General shipments will kick off in September.

Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube Intel CEO Brian Krzanich today unveiled Project Alloy during his keynote at the 2016 Intel Developer Forum. Project Alloy is Intel’s all-in-one virtual reality platform which has all of the components required inside the headset itself allowing for a powerful VR experience without being tethered to a PC. Intel calls it a perfect example of merged reality. All of the computing power required for this headset is located in the headset itself. This provides the user with free range of motion, enabling them to utilize physical movement to explore a virtual environment. It leverages Intel’s RealSense technology to provide a merged reality experience. Users will be able to see their hands and people around them, being able to see elements from the real world but still being able to use their hands to interact with elements of a virtual world will provide a great merged reality experience. “Anybody can take the Alloy hardware, combine it with Windows Holographic, and build a world-class virtual reality system with any manufacturer they choose,” Krzanich said during his keynote. Intel is going to open up the Alloy hardware and provide APIs for the ecosystem next year which will enable developers and partners to create their own branded products using the Project Alloy reference design that Intel has unveiled today.

  Processors PC Cases Video Cards Motherboards Storage Mobile Memory Cooling Misc News Home | Forum | Shop | RSS Search Legit Reviews News  Project Alloy – Intel Merged Reality HMD For 1st Gen VR Project Alloy – Intel Merged Reality HMD For 1st Gen VR Posted by Nathan Kirsch | Tue, Aug 16, 2016 - 11:55 AM Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich today announced that chip maker giant has been working on their own Virtual Reality headset. Intel’s 1st Gen VR project is known as Project Alloy and it consists of an all-in-one virtual reality headset that allows you to enjoy VR untethered despite all the units at the show having a cable on them. Mr. KKrzanic said that the Project Alloy head mounted display (HMD) has compute, graphics, batteries, cameras and sensors all built-in, so it is a self-contained unit that doesn’t need to be plugged in for normal use. You don’t need to connect it to a computer, but it appears you’ll need to plug it in for charging or to connect it to a big screen. Intel Project Alloy uses RealSense cameras to ‘see’ the environment so that you won’t run into anything thanks to a ‘merged reality’ experience. Current VR headsets such as the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive require you to connect the headset to a PC that renders the graphics, so Intel Project Alloy differs by having everything worn on the head. This will of course cause the unit to be larger, but we all now that VR users don’t want to be cabled to a PC. Since you have no cables to drag around it means that you can more easily move around an environment. Moving from room to room in what Intel calls “room to room tracking.” You can also see your hands inside the virtual world with this merged reality solution. The images above show how you can ‘pull’ a lever in the VR world or cut something down on a lathe with just your fingers.  Windows Holographic for the win right? The first version of the Intel Project Alloy Spec will be released in December 2016 and the open platform will be available to partners sometime in the second half of 2017. Since Intel is going to open source the Project Alloy hardware it means anyone can take this general design for an HMD and release a product that works with Windows Holographic. Looks like we’ll have to wait for merged reality for a bit, but is this just another nail in the coffin for the PC? It looks like Intel is continuing to move away with the traditional desktop PC and is focusing on IoT, VR and datacenter solutions.

Called Project Euclid, the module is based on Intel's RealSense "perceptual computing" technology. It's a small, candy bar-sized stick that "brings sensors to any robot," said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich during the company's keynote. All the stuff you need to build robots, in a small, self-contained PC It runs Linux and has an Atom processor, a RealSense camera, motion sensors, onboard communications capabilities, and a detachable battery. Basically, it's meant to bring a bunch of things needed to build robotics into a small, self-contained PC. "We believe Euclid is just perfect for developers," Krzanich said. "It offers the ability to sense with RealSense, motion sensors, and software tools to use as well." It's unclear exactly when Project Euclid will be available (or, if Intel said it during the flurry of announcements this morning we missed it), but we'll update when we have more info. Update: Intel says Project Euclid will be available in the first quarter of 2017. Also, it uses the current generation of Intel's RealSense camera, not the upcoming RealSense 400 camera.

By Mary Jo Foley for All About Microsoft | August 16, 2016 -- 17:16 GMT (10:16 PDT) | Topic: Windows 10 At the Intel Developer Forum, Microsoft officials provided more details and a roadmap outlining some of the steps the company will take to open the Windows Holographic Platform to various "mixed reality" devices. Microsoft is collaborating with Intel on a specification for "mixed-reality-ready" PCs and head-mounted displays (HMDs), said Windows and Devices Group chief Terry Myerson in an August 16 blog post. That spec will be the basis for Microsoft's hardware partners to build both consumer and business devices that can handle mixed reality. The plan is for Microsoft, Intel and other partners to release version 1 of the spec at the Windows Hardware Engineering Community (WinHEC) conference in Shenzhen. (That conference is now slated for December 2016; an earlier leak had it pegged for the first week in November.) IDF 2016 Intel lays out its 5G, IoT strategy Intel CEO Brian Krzanich unveils Project Alloy Microsoft fleshes out its Windows 10 mixed-reality roadmap Intel, ARM forge foundry partnership in bet on manufacturing prowess Microsoft extends again support for Windows 7, 8.1 Skylake-based devices Intel taking its six-core processors mainstream in 2018 Microsoft plans to release "an update to Windows 10" next year -- I'm assuming as part of or maybe as an add-on to Redstone 2, expected to be available in spring 2017 -- that will "enable mainstream PCs to run the Windows Holographic shell and associated mixed reality and universal Windows applications," Myerson also said in today's post. Microsoft officials said in June at Computex that the company wasn't just limiting the Windows 10 variant tuned to work with HoloLens -- known as the Windows Holographic platform -- to Microsoft's HoloLens augmented-reality goggles. Microsoft officials said at that time they would open up the Windows Holographic platform to any companies that want to build devices that can handle mixed reality. Mixed reality is the term for blending 2D and 3D in apps simultaneously. Mixed reality encompasses a spectrum of experiences, from virtual reality (VR) enhanced with holograms, to holographic computing devices enhanced with "real" life images. Microsoft is hoping its hardware partners will adapt the Windows Holographic platform so that virtual reality devices will be able to incorporate real-world objects, and augmented reality devices will incorporate holograms. Microsoft is pitching Windows Holographic as a way to get different AR/VR/mixed reality devices to be able to communicate cross-platform as the market matures. Microsoft officials also posted today a video of a real Windows 10 holographic experience, running on an inexpensive and tiny Intel NUC at 90 frames per second, according to the company's blog post. Update: And for those wondering, as I was, Intel's Project Alloy untethered VR headset, announced today at IDF, is an example of one of the devices that will work with the coming Windows 10 Holographic Shell, as Intel's press release mentions in passing. "Intel is collaborating with Microsoft to optimize Windows-based content and experiences on Intel-based VR devices such as Alloy," according to the release. "Intel will open the Alloy hardware and provide open APIs for the ecosystem, allowing developers and partners to create their own branded products from the Alloy design, in 2017," the release adds.

At IDF 2016 today, the company’s annual developer conference in San Francisco, CA, Intel demonstrated its latest cameras and previewed a self-contained RealSense computer in a box the size of a candy bar. That’s Intel Euclid, a box that looks more like a peripheral like an old-school webcam than it does a PC. On the front there’s a RealSense depth-sensing camera array, while inside there’s an Intel Atom processor running Ubuntu Linux and a robotics OS. Intel has also squeezed in a variety of sensors like accelerometers, together with a battery and various radios. Intel sees Euclid as a starting point for developers looking to get started in computer vision on robots, much as its existing $399 Intel Aero platform does for drone smarts. Indeed, the on-stage demo saw Euclid clipped into a 3D printed robot and then, with a little drag and drop in the browser-based programming interface, able to follow a human around. Of course, RealSense shows up most often in laptops and tablets, and there Intel is pushing the latest generation, Camera 400. Compared to its predecessor, it has more than double the operating range and captures more than twice as many 3D points, while supporting both indoor and outdoor use. Arguably more important, though, is the extreme diet that Intel has put Camera 400 on. It’s the thinnest RealSense system to-date, which will allow it to fit into smaller bezels atop laptop screens, into slimmer tablets, and even into smartphones for Google Project Tango style motion tracking and indoor positioning. Meanwhile, at the end of the year there’ll be a new drone reference design, built around Intel Aero, which is effectively a turn-key platform for developers who don’t want to waste time piecing together motors, rotors, radios, and cameras. The new drone will basically combine Aero, a RealSense array, LTE connectivity for real-time streaming, and all the expected UAV hardware for flight. According to Intel, it should go on sale either in Q4 this year or Q1 2017. No word on pricing at this stage for either the drone reference design or Intel Euclid.

Intel and Microsoft think they can change that. Today at Intel's annual developers conference, Microsoft's Windows chief, Terry Myerson, announced a partnership with the chip maker that will make all future Windows 10 PCs able to support mixed reality applications. "All Windows 10 PCs next year will include a holographic shell," Myerson said, the same operating system that runs on the company's HoloLens headset. PCs will work with a head-mounted display, and run all Windows Holographic applications, Myerson said, allowing wearers to interact not just with 3D applications but also 2D apps. Microsoft will enable these apps through a future Windows update and the company's universal Windows app platform. Mixed reality was a prominent topic in the early part of Intel's keynote on Tuesday morning, with CEO Brian Krzanich also announcing Intel's Project Alloy, a reference design for next-generation VR experiences. "We believe the capability of Alloy and what it introduces is significant," Krzanich said. "It gives the opportunity to merge the physical and virtual world together."

The dream is real. Tether-free VR is here and Intel is behind it. With Project Alloy, Intel is hoping that some day in the distant future, we can ditch cables and start enjoying VR on a huge scale. But is it going to be any good? The bizarre video below is about as far away from the realities of Project Alloy we can get, so take a big pinch of salt here. Related: What is virtual reality? In on-stage demos at Intel's Developer Forum event, we saw a bit more of what the headset is capable of. You can see your real hands inside the VR headset, and all five fingers on each hand are tracked and can be used to interact with virtual objects. No gloves, no controllers. Not only that, any object in your hand can be used in the virtual world. In the demonstration, a dollar bill was used to sculpt a piece of gold. No external sensors are required at all: all that's needed is the headset and its built-in RealSense cameras. RealSense is the 3D camera tech Intel has been pushing for a couple of years and it's already useful for facial recognition, and now it's had a huge boost with VR hardware. Intel has now partnered with Microsoft to bring its Windows Holographic software to Project Alloy. In the second half of 2017, Intel will make the specification of Alloy open source, opening up the hardware to developers. If you get too close to a real-world object, such as a CEO of a major company, they'll appear inside your virtual world Actual specification details are thin on the ground, however it’s not surprising that Intel has been able to cram a VR experience into a headset. Its tiny NUC-branded PCs are about the same size as the front of the headset, and the Intel Core i7-6820HK processor found inside the top-spec models are more than powerful enough to do this. Intel says the final spec for a PCs that can work with Project Alloy will be revealed in December. First impressions Intel had to get on board the VR hype train with its own product; all of its rivals have already done so and to not have one in 2016 wouldn't look great to investors or enthusiastic consumers. Alloy will probably morph into an other type of VR unrelated to the sort of gaming experiences you get on the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, unless Intel can massively improve its own graphics processing capabilities. Consumer tether-free VR is still a long way off, but there are few companies better placed than Intel to make it a reality. But, ultimately, this is a compact PC you can strap to your face. Pricing hasn't been announced, but considering the base cost of an Intel NUC, which is likely the basis of Alloy, is over £500, this is not going to be something your or I will be buying any time soon. However, as a concept for developers to work with, it's very interesting indeed. Maybe don’t buy a VR backpack just yet... Video: Trusted Explains virtual reality 0 shares Read Comments Bugblatter August 16, 2016, 6:09 pm They need Nvidia's graphics grunt. AMD's isn't power-efficient enough and Intel's own is a bit limp. I think initially backpacks will be the way to get tether-free VR, especially as a 30 minute battery life (I'm guessing) just wouldn't be good enough. It's far easier for the shoulders to take the weight than the neck. Peter August 17, 2016, 9:49 pm But when your walking up those stairs to the house you'll be sat in your chair or pacing your room, you won't feel the splash as the waiter drops into the pool and it will still be a while before we have real-time photo realistic avatars to interact with. It will still be great fun but I feel Intel is seeking to raise expectations that won't be realised if ever for quite some time in a similar way to Microsoft's Hololens. Still if it does come to fruition a truly mind bending utterly bananas future of experiences awaits us. Kulti Vator August 18, 2016, 8:53 am Could be that whilst the headset is 'standalone' the images it serves up are sent wirelessly to it from a PC with a decent GPU. It's also possible that this headset is a contender for VR on the Xbox Scorpio - would certainly take the game to Sony by offering a truly wireless VR gaming experience - and the launch timeframes for both items line up pretty well... so maybe, just maybe. Bugblatter August 18, 2016, 5:27 pm What they're talking about here isn't wireless, all the hardware is contained in the headset. I think it was the Steam VR guys who said the major improvements needed in VR are to increase the resolution and to remove the tether, but unfortunately increasing the resolution means more data which makes it more difficult to lose the tether. I think they also need to work on the headset size and weight though. Basically the headset needs to be nothing but the display and possibly sensors (possibly audio too), and the display needs to be little laser beams painting the image directly onto our retinas. And that should keep us going until they've got the neural shunts sorted out :o) Kulti Vator August 18, 2016, 5:44 pm Yeah - that's what they said - but there's a slide from Intel that alludes to there being a minimum set of Windows 10 PC specs for this headset. This *may* indicate that the headset is standalone in the display sense, but is (or can be) driven by an external device? But, sadly, it may just be the specs of the mini-PC contained within the headset. Time will tell how this pans out - but Intel's own embedded GPU technology still lags behind dedicated chipsets from Nvidia and AMD and by some margin - so an all-Intel solution may not be the best performer. Eddie Battikha August 19, 2016, 3:41 am U gotta remember one thing Microsoft doesn't have the games, if they're having a hard time competing with PlayStation 4 then PSVR will be worse as Sony has way more games being made for PSVR. Kulti Vator August 19, 2016, 6:06 am Yeah, because MS tell the world what all their game studios are working on in their back rooms. Project Scorpio wont launch without some decent content.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | August 16, 2016 -- 16:43 GMT (09:43 PDT) | Topic: Intel Intel's Craig Raymond displays the Project Alloy virtual reality headset during the Day 1 keynote at the 2016 Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco on Tuesday, Aug. 16, 2016. Intel Corporation At the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich introduced the concept of "merged reality" with a new product called Project Alloy. Project Alloy "takes the cord off the virtual reality headset", said Krzanich, showcasing a self-contained virtual reality headset that contains compute, graphics, and batteries. It uses dual real-sense modules to track positioning. The "merged reality" platform allows the user to freely move around in the virtual world while also interacting with it. "We can do that with almost any object and we can flip that - we can take the virtual world into the real world," Krzanich said. Virtual reality, he said, has already "truly gone mainstream". Yet merged reality, he said, is "going to be a big driver in innovation because it's so different than anything else out there." Intel is partnering with Microsoft to bring the Windows Holographic platform to Project Alloy. Additionally, Intel plans to open source the hardware next year. Krzanich said it's not just technology that's changing -- "Intel is changing as well". He stressed four themes for the company: redefining the experience of computing, integrating visual intelligence into products of the future, making the cloud an unprecedented platform, and empowering the next generation of innovators. All that said, Krzanich said that "powerful microprocessing remains a central engine of tehcnology and innovation." The Seventh Generation Core processor is already shipping to Intel's PC partners, he said, and will launch with new devices to consumers this fall. Krzanich also showcased advances in RealSense visual computing. The RealSense Camera 400 is the smallest RealSense camera - just a few inches long and millimeters thick. Yet it more than doubles the number of 3D points captured, Krzanich said. He unveiled the Yuneek Typhoon H drone, equipped with a RealSense module that allows the drone to fly while avoiding obstacles. "We have a lot of confidence in the collision avoidance capabilities of this drone," he said. Meanwhile, Project Aero is an all-in-one board that enables a developer to build their own drone and launch applications on it. Also part of the RealSense family is Euclid - effectively a self-contained computer built for robotics. It has an atom processor, onboard communications, motion and position sensors and a battery. Taking the discussion surrounding visual intelligence further, Krzanich introduced Elmar Frickenstein, senior vice president of electronics for BMW Group, to the stage. BMW and Intel are partnering on self-driving cars. Frickenstein rolled out on stage in the passenger seat of an autonomous vehicle. He said that BMW is bringing autonomous standards to the industry, "so all developers worldwide can create new functions on the same framework."

Intel shows off all-in-one Project Alloy virtual reality headset Posted Aug 16, 2016 by Lucas Matney (@lucas_matney) 0 SHARES Next Story Apple plans to build a new R&D center in China Intel moved full-throttle into the VR space with the announcement of an all-in-one virtual reality headset alongside a new Intel Merged Reality platform at the Intel Developers Forum. An announcer teased the dramatic reveal with the phrase, “what if you could move freely without any restriction on what you do next?” Project Alloy is completely wireless, something that distinguishes it significantly from headsets like the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. The company’s headset is notable in that it is an all-on-one device with all of the cameras, sensors and input controls built-in. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich called virtual reality, “one of those fundamental shifts that redefines how we work, how we’re entertained, and how we communicate in the world.” Inside-out positional tracking is a huge project evolution and one that has yet to be cracked by existing head-mounted displays. Krzanich announced onstage that the headset has six-degrees-of-freedom, a technical term which means you’ll pretty much be able to move freely in VR without having your motions constricted. Project Alloy relies entirely on hand-tracking as input through its integrated sensors. The demo appeared a bit finicky onstage. The headset appears to be relying strongly on the tech from the company’s RealSense technology. RealSense trackers utilize a 1080p camera in addition to infrared cameras and lasers so in the demo onstage Intel was able to capture when people walked into the frame of the user’s virtual world. Other high-end virtual reality headsets have kept the tethered experience largely because of performance requirements. High frame rates and crisp screen resolutions have necessitated a bulky cord connecting the headset to a high-end PC, so it isn’t quite clear what corners Intel is cutting as specs of Project Alloy were not revealed onstage.

That means the headset contains the computational and graphics power necessary to create the virtual images and an internal battery for power, as well as 3D cameras and sensors powered by Intel's RealSense motion tracking tech. CEO Brian Krzanich says the device is capable of "merged reality," which blends images from the real world like handheld objects into virtual environments. In a demo onstage at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco, a Project Alloy wearer was able to use a dollar bill in his physical hand as a lathe to shave down a virtual block of gold in a VR environment. Krzanich was also brought into the VR scene, by way of Project Alloy's onboard cameras. This is the promise of mixed reality, he said, where virtual environments can integrate everything from our limbs and handheld objects to entire virtual representations of other people captured by cameras and sensors. "We believe the capability of Alloy and what it introduces is significant," Krzanich said. "It gives the opportunity to merge the physical and virtual world together." Intel plans on making Project Alloy open source next year to let third parties build headsets Intel says this type of merged reality technology should alleviate some concerns about VR headsets blocking out the real world and creating a potentially dangerous situation for users and other people in the room. This type of tech also removes the need for complex sensor setups or hand controllers, Intel says. Of course, Project Alloy doesn't seem as precise or high-definition as something like the HTC Vive using Valve's Lighthouse laser tracking system. However, it does represent a leap toward merging the type of cordless, lower-budget system we see with Samsung's Gear VR with a higher-end set of capabilities you'd more likely to get with the Oculus Rift. If merged reality sounds similar to the type of tech found in Microsoft's HoloLens, you would not be wrong. The HoloLens is considered augmented reality, where virtual images are blended in with the real world, and Microsoft uses the term mixed reality to describe the effect. The idea is to let you maneuver physical spaces as you would normally as 3D objects are created out of light. So the HoloLens in a way achieves a similar effect on the other end of the spectrum as Project Alloy — one focuses on AR, the other VR. Intel and Microsoft are teaming up for mixed reality To cement this idea, Windows chief Terry Myerson came out onstage at IDF today to announce that the Windows Holographic platform, with which developers can make and run mixed reality apps, will come to all Windows 10 PCs next year. That means that any VR or AR headset, and not just the HoloLens, will be able to run 3D and even standard, 2D apps designed for Windows 10, Myerson said. Intel and Microsoft are working together to release specifications for mixed reality-ready PCs and head-mounted displays. Intel also plans to open source the Allow hardware next year, alongside its RealSense application programming interface (API) so third-party manufacturers can develop headsets of their own that run on Windows 10 and tap into Intel tech. "Anybody can take the Alloy hardware, combine it with Windows Holographic, and build a world-class virtual reality system with any manufacturer they choose," Krzanich said.

Shown off for the first time at IDF 2016, the company’s developer conference in San Francisco, CA, today, Project Alloy looks at first glance like a regular – albeit bulky – headset, though that size is because it’s actually a complete PC, too. Project Alloy also supports what Intel is referring to multi-room tracking, moving from space to space in a home or office. At the front of the headset there’s a RealSense camera array, while at the back there are batteries built into the rear of the head strap. 6-DOF motion sensors inside Project Alloy can track where you move, rather than requiring external sensors as something like HTC Vive demands. Rather than a gamepad controller, meanwhile, the RealSense camera is used for full depth sensing and real-time tracking of all five fingers on each hand. In fact, your hands show up as floating, disembodied limbs in the center of your view. You can even bring in objects from the real world – Intel demonstrated it with a dollar bill, clutched in the hand – and, if people or objects are close enough, they’ll be included in the digitized environment too. “If you’re going to untether and walk freely in the house,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich explained, “you’ve got to be able to avoid obstacles.” Intel is working with Microsoft to use Windows Holographic, the same platform that powers Microsoft’s own HoloLens headset, to support Project Alloy too. As of 2017, an update for all Windows 10 PCs will bring Windows Holographic support, allowing them to power the interface and experience when a VR headset is plugged in. Both of the companies are working – with partners – on a common mixed-reality specification, though we won’t see version one of that until December 2016. It shouldn’t be especially demanding, though: Microsoft’s mixed reality demonstration was powered by one of Intel’s tiny NUC PCs, capable of running 90 frames per second VR. As of the second half of 2017, meanwhile, Intel says it plans to open-source the Project Alloy hardware design. That’ll mean any company will be able to create their own mixed reality headset built on the platform.

RealSense trackers utilize a 1080p camera in addition to infrared cameras and lasers so in the demo onstage Intel was able to capture when people walked into the frame of the user’s virtual world. Other high-end virtual reality headsets have kept the tethered experience largely because of performance requirements. High frame rates and crisp screen resolutions have necessitated a bulky cord connecting the headset to a high-end PC, so it isn’t quite clear what corners Intel is cutting as specs of Project Alloy were not revealed onstage.

Intel also announced that it is going to open source the Alloy hardware in the second half of 2017 so that “anyone can combine the Project Alloy hardware with Windows Holographic platform,” Krzanich said onstage. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Intel Founded 1968 Overview Intel designs, manufactures, and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide.

CEO Brian Krzanich Intel cannot afford to miss out on the next wave of tech innovation, as it did with mobile. If you believe Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Apple's Tim Cook, then virtual reality, artificial intelligence and the internet of things will underpin the next generation of computing platforms, and this time Intel CEO Brian Krzanich wants to be right there with them. It is on these new growth opportunities, and not the company's flagging legacy PC business or mobile misses, that Krzanich is expected to focus his keynote address at Intel's Developer Forum on Tuesday at 9 a.m. Pacific. Six thousand developers will attend the event, now in its 20th year, at San Francisco's Moscone Center. Intel rode the PC revolution over the past several decades to become the world's biggest semiconductor company, but the shrinking market — which makes up half of its business — is now weighing it down. The company's stock has traded roughly flat since January, as the shares of rival Qualcomm, whose fortunes are closely tied to mobile, have surged almost 25 percent year to date. (The Nasdaq has gained around 5 percent since the start of the year.) As in prior years, the focus at the conference will be getting the message out there that Intel has a lot of opportunities beyond its existing business, said MKM Partners analyst Ian Ing. "They are trying to position Intel as enabling technology that can help transform individual lives, as well as enterprise technologies," said Ing. Like other aging tech giants, Intel is banking on the shift to cloud computing and growth of internet companies like Facebook and Amazon to help drive future growth. The Santa Clara, California-based company already has almost all of the market for server microprocessors, a segment that increased quarterly revenue 5 percent year over year, according to Intel's most recent earnings report. "Growth in new areas of the data center can be the key driver of growth," said Canaccord Genuity analyst Matt Ramsay. But as growth in smartphone sales slows, companies like Qualcomm and Samsung are eyeing that business as well and Intel cannot afford to rest on its laurels. The internet of things promises to connect a whole new set of devices to the cloud and Intel wants to make so-called end-to-end solutions — from the sensors on the ground to servers in the cloud — to collect and analyze all that data. Krzanich will highlight the use of Intel's sensors in drones and autonomous cars and tout events for developers to get hands-on experience with the company's newest technology. For example, drone pilots will demonstrate how computer vision brings obstacle avoidance, autonomous capabilities and "follow me" features to the Yuneec Typhoon H drone, the first drone to be powered by Intel RealSense camera technology. Attendees will be able to run along with the drone as it successfully navigates typical park obstacles. The company recently announced a new partnership with BMW and MobilEye and Krzanich has said it expects the average autonomous car to generate 40 gigabytes of data a minute in 2020. "Their play on machine learning — deep learning — is to process all the collection points and be able to take all that data and process it on the servers through analytics," said Ing. Last week, the company announced plans to acquire Nervana Systems, to advance its AI portfolio and Krzanich is expected to share updates about the foundation Intel is building for artificial intelligence. "Instead of programming an Intel chip with very specific code, you teach a computer to act like a human being," said Ing. Virtual reality and augmented reality will also feature in Krzanich's keynote and demos. The company may unveil an augmented reality headset, also leveraging its RealSense 3-D camera technology. That said, VR and AR technology is likely to continue to make up a very small portion of Intel's business over the near term, said Ing. "It's a check box to them, it's not like a tremendous growth driver," said Ing. Don't expect to hear too much at IDF about Intel's wearables strategy, an area where it competes for business most directly with ARM. Though this is an area where Krzanich had tried to aggressively win — buying smartwatch maker Basis Peak and developing chip technology to be embedded in wearable devices — the company has suffered as the adoption of wearable devices has been slow. It recently announced it would recall all Basis Peak smartwatches due to an overheating issue. Analysts will be watching closely for any hints on how its widely anticipated new partnership with Apple will impact the business. Intel is expected to win some share of Apple's modem chip purchases for the iPhone 7 and any updates shared by senior management will be closely regarded. Neither Intel nor Apple have confirmed the partnership, but Qualcomm's sales projections suggest it expects to lose some of this business. "Expect increased confidence in the wireless modem business with the upcoming partial win in the iPhone 7," said Ramsay. This mobile foothold is "tremendously helpful" to Intel, said Ing. The question, going forward, is whether Intel can leverage this expected mobile foothold in the iPhone 7 modem into more business. Silicon integration is very important for smartphone customers and Qualcomm is not giving Apple the integration the company wants, he said. "Apple is probably the most important customer to serve in smartphones," he said. "They could become a really good supplier to Apple if they do the right things."

News so far Project Alloy The first keynote of IDF had plenty of announcements surrounding Intel's sensors and chips. The biggest news of the night was the reveal of a new tether-free VR headset concept called Project Alloy. You can read more about it in our explainer. Kaby Lake We also got a few (very few, in fact) details about Intel's upcoming Kaby Lake. We saw two laptops running Kaby Lake on stage and we're now starting to get an understanding of what they're going to be capable of. RealSense Intel launched a new version of its RealSense hardware, called Euclid, a tiny all-in-one RealSense module that can connect to other devices such as Intel's own custom-made robot that it demonstrated on stage. It's essentially like giving robots super-powerful eyes. Scary. Intel also launched RealSense 400, a tiny version of its original RealSense module. It doesn't look small enough to fit into a smartphone, but it'll certainly take up less space in the next generation of laptops to have it installed. Joule Intel Joule is a new 'Maker Board' similar to the Raspberry Pi but very much an adult piece of kit. It has, you guessed it, support for RealSense as well as a host of other hardware features to allow developers and inventors to quickly create prototypes of new products without having to manufacture custom hardware. It comes equipped with an Intel Atom T5000 CPU and 3GB of memory, as well as built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1. What to expect for the rest of IDF 2016 Just because IDF is a developer event – clue’s in the name – doesn’t mean that it’s going to be devoid of product announcements and demonstrations. While Intel is obviously focused on its other businesses, including servers and cloud computing, the company is still keen to present itself as a consumer brand that can keep up with future trends. Last year, we saw everything from dancing robotic spiders to BMX riders and a whole bunch in between. Intel’s chips are found in devices from tiny sensors to laptops, desktops, and (to an extent) phones – things we all use every day. But the company still struggles to stand out in the Wild West of consumer electronics, having fallen behind the likes of Qualcomm and Samsung when it comes to brand awareness. With that in mind, any announcements relating to either mobile or wearable products would be pretty big news. Related: Intel Core i processors explained We might see more from Intel’s ridiculously fast Optane memory, which has the potential to turn solid-state storage into something as fast as RAM. This is no mean feat, as the reason why RAM is so fast is because it’s incredibly volatile, so to get the same speed as RAM into a long-term storage device would be extremely impressive. Rumours are pointing towards a Q1 2017 launch, with product announcements being made at IDF. However, don’t expect to see this tech trickle down to consumer laptops for several years – right now, this will be kit for data centres only. Related: Best SSDs for your PC build Away from these product announcements, expect Intel to highlight its prowess in the world of augmented reality, virtual reality, wearables, smart home products and drones. Many of the things shown on stage might never make it into the wider world, but they will represent the sort of technology manufacturers will be able to develop with Intel chips inside. We’ll probably see more of Intel RealSense, too, which has finally started to come into its own. The 3D camera technology found a really handy use case in the form of a security feature in Windows Hello, and works brilliantly well on the Microsoft Surface Pro 4. Finally, Intel will almost certainly talk about AI. Google, Microsoft and Facebook have all made huge pushes into various forms of AI, and while Intel is almost certainly part of the hardware of several of these projects, we’d expect it to show off a project of its own, if only to prove its master of its own destiny. There'll likely be even more announcements at IDF 2016, and while we don't expect an Apple-esque 'one more thing', there may still be a major surprise. Stay tuned.

SAN FRANCISCO—It can't be easy to be Intel these days. The processor giant fueled itself for decades on the constant improvement and evolution of Moore's Law, and helped propel the PC industry from relative obscurity to major technological power player. But now that smartphones are replacing traditional computers as consumers' devices of choice, and considering how much difficulty the company has had making lasting inroads into the mobile space, what is in Intel's immediate—and more distant—future? Chances are, we'll see the latest answers to that question here this week, at the Intel Developer Forum (IDF) at the Moscone Center. The annual event is the place to learn the ins and outs of Intel's chips and everything associated with them. Though Intel is not expected to announce a major new processor development this year, we will undoubtedly receive a glimpse into Intel's strategies for surmounting the difficult challenges before it and remaining relevant in this constantly changing world. If there's going to be a single overarching theme to Intel's presentations in lieu of a new "tick" or "tock," it's going to be within the Internet of Things (IoT) space. At several recent IDFs, Intel has gone to great lengths to show how it's going to be at the center of everything, and there's no reason there won't be more of that at the 2016 show. We're going to see the most current visions (or, at any rate, expectations) of how these still fairly compacted areas of technology are going to spread out to even more corners of our lives and usher us all into an even more connected existence. Everything else Intel is working on is a part of this, after all, and from its processing cores to the final products to the different glues required to make everything work as it's intended (such as 5G mobile networks, one suspects), the company is going to want to make sure we're all well aware of where it's going. Among those destinations, virtual reality (VR) would seem to be a likely first stop. Though it's been hovering along the periphery of the industry for a while, it's only this year, with the consumer releases of the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive headsets, that it's really gone mainstream. But if VR is adding a (literal) new dimension to how you play games and otherwise interact with your computer, doing it in a big (or at least bigger–than–Google Cardboard) way means you need a lot of oomph underneath. If Intel can prove—or, better yet, demonstrate—what it has to offer consumers who want to cut in on the bleeding edge of VR, it may become as much a part of the VR discussion as graphics purveyors AMD and Nvidia have made themselves with their latest round of video cards designed specifically for it. What about drones? These personal flying devices are poised to change how companies interact with their customers and how we explore (and photograph) our environment. Right now, though, most drones are pretty dumb—they possess some tools for avoiding collisions and returning to safety when they're in danger of crashing, but they're limited. Last year at IDF, Intel made a big deal of the RealSense Technology that made it easier for systems to detect objects' (and people's) locations in 3D space, and although that was touted mainly for its fun and security potential, it's something that would also seem ideal for drones. Intel has a few activities along these lines scheduled for this year, which suggests there might be some new advancements that could send us soaring into the future faster than we thought. //Related Articles Intel: 5G Is Not Just Faster, It's Smarter One thing's for sure, though: The "old" Intel isn't going away without a fight. However speedily the new model may be coming, it's not here yet—and we still need real computers for plenty of important purposes. So while everything may be about to change, there's also going to be some attention, most likely from Intel's partners, paid to the way certain things are going to stay the same. From components to connection technologies to new developments in memory and NAND (many of which Intel has spearheaded with 3D Xpoint and Optane), there will unquestionably be plenty of time spent explaining why crucial elements of the computer experience aren't going anywhere—but are, indeed, about to get a lot better. Maybe most crucial: artificial intelligence and machine learning. With its announcement last week of its intention to buy deep-learning start-up Nervana, Intel signaled that it has major interest in this space. And with its processor background, Intel is better positioned than almost any other company to lead the way. Not that doing so would be easy, of course, as AI and so many of its other most visible areas of research will require a lot of power behind the scene in terms of data center and cloud computing. That Intel has already announced this IDF will focus on those areas, too, is not surprising. What precisely will result from all this remains to be seen. If 2016 follows the example of previous years, the keynote addresses (this year being given by CEO Brian Krzanich on Tuesday and Murthy Renduchintala and Diane Bryant on Wednesday) will be structured with technology demonstrations, products, surprise guests, and more that are geared toward tying everything else together. True, Intel has made a lot of big promises in recent years that haven't (or, at least, haven't yet) come to full fruition. But can you blame anyone at the company for wanting to ensure that, whatever comes down the line next, it has Intel inside?

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Intel is leaving PCs behind to focus on VR and IoT at Intel Developer Forum that is taking place this week. Intel Highlights At IDF 2016 According to PCWorld, personal computers (PCs) were for decades at the center of Intel's business. However, this has lately changed and the high-tech company is not focusing on PCs anymore. Personal computers are no longer viewed as a priority by the company. Artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR) and self-driving cars are becoming now the fields of interest for Intel. This is the message that tech analysts expect Intel to deliver at Intel Developer Forum, starting on Tuesday, August 16. Unlike the past years, Intel will not present a lot of laptops and desktops running upcoming processors. The attendees at IDF will most probably be able to try instead AR and VR headsets, check on cool wearable devices, see robots roaming the floor and drones fly around. At IDF the chip-maker will also show field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) that are reprogrammable processors for cars, servers and IoT devices. Intel will also show Remote EyeSight, its own version of Microsoft HoloLens. Other VR and AR announcements will focus around its RealSense 3D camera that is able to measure distances, recognize objects and track gestures. Intel Changing Priorities Until recently, PCs have been the main focus of Intel's operations. But the shrinking PC market has pushed the company to change its priorities. In April, the high-tech company changed its business strategy. Intel has started to rebuild itself around the fast-growing markets of Internet of Things (IoT) servers and connectivity. The change in Intel's business strategy has been a painful decision. The company had also to make changes in its operations and production facilities. As part of the restructuring, it has to lay off 12,000 people. Soon after, Intel also decided to give up its pursuit of the mobile chip market that cost the company billions of dollars. According to USA Today, last week's purchase of Nervana Systems will support Intel's aim to achieve a much stronger presence in the emerging market for deep learning applications. Over the next decade or so, deep learning can help benefit many fields, from autonomous driving to digital personal assistants to scientific discovery  Related Articles Intel Acquires Itseez Computer Vision Startup Intel Gives Up On Atom Projects Intel Sees The Future In Cloud Technology TagsIntel, IDF, Intel Developer Forum, IoT, VR, internet of things, virtual reality Get the Most Popular iTechPost Stories in a Weekly Newsletter © 2016 iTech Post All rights reserved.

Technology Intel Developer Forum Spotlights Apple-, Google-, Tesla-Rivaling Segments Intel, which held its 2016 Developer Forum in April in Shenzhen, China, holds its Developer Conference this week in San Francisco. (Intel) ALLISON GATLIN 8/15/2016 Reprints No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) will follow up the BMX bikers and mechanical spiders that populated last year's Intel Developer Conference with a fresh focus this week on autonomous driving, virtual reality and machine learning. The red-hot growth drivers have Intel rivaling fellow tech giants such as Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Tesla Motors (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO). Chipmakers are scrambling to target the next growth vector, as smartphone sales slow amid saturation. IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom stock is ranked No. 1 in IBD's 41-company Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless industry group, with an IBD Composite Rating of 99, meaning it performs in the top 1% of all stocks. Broadcom is winning, analysts say, with its penchant for M&A. Get the IBD Stock Checkup here. IBD's 39-company Electronic-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group is up 10% this year amid the virtual reality and autonomous driving bonanza. Intel stock is flat for the year, but it's 6% extended from a 32.85 entry point out of a flat base achieved June 23. By the closing bell on the stock market today, Intel shares ended trading up 1% to 34.91. The 2016 Intel Developer Conference is set to kick off Tuesday, with CEO Brian Krzanich's keynote. The San Francisco conference will run through Thursday at the Moscone Center West. Last year, Krzanich's keynote featured a BMX biker outfitted with Intel's Curie chip, a six-axis sensor capable of capturing motion data from the handlebars and seat, as well as speed. This year, the company says Krzanich will share Intel's latest innovations and product demonstrations. Wednesday's keynotes are slated to highlight connected-world and data center/cloud infrastructure innovations. Both fit in well with the event's overarching theme -- virtual reality, autonomous driving, machine learning and the coming 5G broadband era. More than 140 businesses are expected to attend the three-day conference. On Thursday, Krzanich will also kick off the Intel SoC FPGA Developers Forum with a discussion of the importance of field-programmable gate arrays in the smart world. This event will be co-located within the Developers Conference. It will focus on FPGAs within the Internet of Things, data center, cloud computing, networking, industrial and automotive segments. Intel's FPGA unit stems largely from its Altera acquisition last year, with competitors that include Xilinx (XLNX).

[Related: Partners: Microsoft Extension Of Windows End-Of-Life Policies 'Great News'] Partners said they would like to see real-life use cases and new technology that will help them figure out how to tap into the many opportunities that IoT creates. Jon Bach, president of Puget Systems, a Kent, Wash.-based Intel system builder partner, said he hopes to learn more about Intel’s strategy around 5G – the next phase of the mobile telecommunications standard that could feed all the device needs as part of IoT – in addition to any high-performance computing news. “On the IoT side, I'd expect Intel to talk more about their 5G plans,” said Bach. “The big one, across [high-performance computing] and enthusiast, is Optane [solid state drives].  There is a lot of anticipation for that, from everything from content creation to scientific computing.” Intel over the spring outlined a future with more investments in data center, cloud and Internet of Things as it aims to lessen its dependence on the PC market. As the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company makes this shift in strategy, partners will have a more important role than ever, Maurits Tichelman, Intel's general manager, worldwide reseller channel, told CRN in June. The shift in strategy is in part because of a stagnant PC market: Intel in the beginning of the year lowered its PC market expectations, saying it expects the market to decline in the high single digits in 2016. Meanwhile, the company's data center segment, which grew 5 percent year over year in the second quarter, as well as its Internet of Things segment, which grew 2 percent year over year, are becoming increasingly lucrative markets.  "Looking at IoT and data center, there are many more new business models being developed where Intel technology can be at the core and heart of solutions," Tichelman told CRN in June. "But we want to make sure that our channel stays close to us so we can learn from our channel and can keep developing great products, not only for today but for the future."

Intel Kaby Lake Support Added To Beignet OpenCL Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 16 August 2016 at 08:53 AM EDT. Add A Comment Intel's Beignet project for providing open-source OpenCL support for Intel HD/Iris Graphics hardware on Linux now has support for upcoming Kaby Lake processors. With the work that landed today by Intel's Yang Rong, there is the run-time support and back-end support. The code is closely derived from Beignet's existing Skylake "Gen 9" support due to not many architectural differences with Kaby Lake. Intel is expected to officially release Kaby Lake in late 2016 or there's been even some rumors not until early 2017 at CES. Kaby Lake is bringing HEVC Main10 and VP9 10-bit hardware video decoding support, HDCP 2.2, native USB 3.1 Gen2, and faster graphics/video playback support. Intel Open-Source Technology Center developers have been working on the Kaby Lake Linux support for quite a number of months already. With the latest Git code of the Linux kernel, Mesa, etc, things appear to be mostly in place. So assuming you are using a Q3~Q4'2016 Linux distribution, the out-of-the-box Kaby Lake experience will hopefully be good at launch time. Of course, there will be tests on Phoronix when the launch occurs.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion Intel No Longer Holding PCs Priority; AR, VR, Artifical Intelligence Are In? Intel Developer Forum 2016 Discussions and Updates By Mariel Peralta Aug 16, 2016 | 2:12 AM Intel has spoken during the Intel Developer Forum 2016 (IDF 2016) that they will no longer be prioritizing PCs in the future. During this year's IDF 2016, Intel has mapped out the future by saying that PCs will no longer be at the forefront of their business. Instead, they will be redirecting their efforts towards technology that involve augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), artificial intelligence and more. No More PCs and Laptops from Intel? Intel has decided earlier this year that they will be shifting their focus away from PCs to make way for new technology. This means that IDF events in the future may no longer have upcoming desktop computers, laptops and PC chips, PC World reports. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit The company will be going for markets dedicated to connectivity, internet-of-things (IoT), servers and more. Last April, Intel had to let go of more than 12,000 of its employees after a massive company restructuring. Intel to Announce AR/VR Headsets at IDF 2016 Intel will be showcasing their chip-making skills by showcasing their chips used for IoT, VR and AR headsets as well as their RealSense 3D camera. Computer World notes that the company will not be focusing too much on their newest PC processor, Kaby Lake, but will hold a demo as its release date is nearing. Additionally, Intel will be unveiling their new Atom chips intended for robots, drones and IoT devices instead of tablets and smartphones. While PCs make up of more than half of Intel's revenue, it is their intention to breach the chip-making industry as it is rumored that they have failed to get on to the smartphone market train. Maneuvering in the highly-competitive field is not easy for Intel. SFGate noted that the company has four main focuses - PCs, mobile, Internet-of-Things and servers. Intel is doing well in the chip industry, but its competitors are also catching up. They hope to sell processors to businesses tied to cloud-computing as most devices now require backups more than ever due to the constant expansion of data sizes and storage. Do you think Intel will permanently veer away from focusing on PCs in their business? Will this be a good move on their part? Let us know what you think in the comments below.

Miller August 15, 2016 10 Comments One of the biggest themes at hardware technology conferences this year is that we are on the verge of a dramatic change in the way systems store and access data. One of the biggest themes at hardware technology conferences this year is that we are on the verge of a dramatic change in the way systems store and access data. Sure, we've seen memory get faster over time, and seen flash storage supplement or even replace hard drives in many applications, but new "storage class memory" promises an even more fundamental change. This topic has been gaining attention at lots of conferences this year, as we get closer to Intel and Micron shipping products based on their 3D XPoint memory. It was a big topic at last week's Flash Memory Summit. For years—pretty much since the dawn of computing—we've had two basic ways to store things. Short-term storage is fast, relatively expensive, and volatile, meaning when the power goes out, the data goes away. This has mostly been dynamic random access memory (DRAM), and the amount you can attach to a computer is limited. Also, pretty much since the dawn of transistor-based CPUs, we've also had static random access memory (SRAM) built into the CPU itself, which is even faster, even more expensive, and available in only relatively tiny amounts. We've also had persistent storage—whether punch cards, tapes, hard drives, or flash storage, which is much less expensive but also much slower and typically available in much larger capacity. The "holy grail" for the memory industry would be to come up with something that has the speed of DRAM but the capacity, cost, and persistence of NAND flash memory. That remains just an idea, though. Fantasy. The shift from SATA to faster interfaces such as SAS and PCI-Express using the NVMe protocol has made SSDs much faster, but nowhere near the speed of DRAM. Non-volatile DIMMs (NV-DIMMs), which put flash memory on the faster memory bus, are attempting to bridge the gap while work continues on emerging forms of memory such as 3D XPoint and other phase-change devices, ReRAM (resistive RAM) and STT-MRAM (Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic RAM). At the Flash Memory Summit, it seemed like almost every speaker was showing a graph talking about how new "storage class memory" or "persistent memory" fit into the hierarchy of storage in a system. This includes Storage Network Industry Association (SNIA) in the slide above and Western Digital in the one at the top of the post. (Note that no one is talking about tape or even Blu-Ray used for archival storage). SNIA is pushing a standard for NV-DIMMs as something that could be added to systems today. This is meant to be an industry standard with various different underlying technologies. It could be used with a combination of NAND flash and battery-backed DRAM today, so it would be as fast as DRAM but still persistent, if more expensive than DRAM. The most obvious candidate for a large amount of persistent memory in the relatively near term is 3D XPoint memory, a phase-change memory being developed by Intel and Micron. Intel had earlier said that it expected to sell Optane SSDs with this memory by the end of the year under the Optane brand with DIMMs featuring the technology sometime later. At the show Micron announced it would be branding its products under the name QuantX, and focusing on the NVMe standard for connecting such drives to the main system. Micron said its drives could deliver more than 10 times the number of input/output operations (IOPs) than NAND, and provide more than 4 times the memory footprint of DRAM. Intel did a presentation detailing the advantages of the NVMe standard, noting that the overhead of the traditional SAS and SATA busses for hard drives has become a bottleneck in SSD performance; and how moving to the new connection standard would have a good performance improvement for traditional NAND flash SSDs, but was crucial for the new memories, as they are so much faster. Neither Intel nor Micron has given exact capacities or pricing yet, but have talked in the past about how it should eventually be between DRAM and NAND flash pricing. Several analysts speculated that the manufacturing cost of 3D XPoint today is actually higher than DRAM, but most believe that will change if the technology can reach a high enough volume. There are other technologies contending to become mainstream alternative memories. STT MRAM exists in small volumes today, used mostly in very specialized environments which require very durable, long lasting memory in rather small amounts. Today such memory offers much faster writes than NAND, but with very limited capacity, only up to about 256 megabits. For comparison, the NAND manufacturers are talking about 256Gb and 512Gb (or 64GB) chips. Everspin has promised a 1Gb version by the end of the year. It's easy to imagine this getting more popular, but the capacity probably isn't enough for wide-scale deployment. Fujitsu has discussed ferrorelectric random access memory (FRAM), essentially a non-volatile kind of RAM, but it's only been shown in very small densities. A variety of companies are working on variants of Resistive RAM (ReRAM), and indeed this is the technology that WD (which now includes what used to be SanDisk ) said looks most promising for storage-class memory. But it's unclear when such technologies will hit the market. One big issue facing all of these kinds of memories is developing the systems that can really take advantage of them. Current systems—everything from the applications to the operating systems to the interconnects among memory systems—are designed for the traditional division between memory operated with loads and stores, and persistent storage programmed in blocks. All that will have to change for any of these technologies to become mainstream. A number of speakers discussed possible early applications, with Huawei talking about cognitive computing and Micron discussing financial service applications—all of which tend to want huge amounts of data in relatively fast memory. It will be fascinating to see how this plays out over the next few years. Back to top By Michael J. Miller Michael J. Miller's Forward Thinking Blog: forwardthinking.pcmag.com Michael J.

We are hearing that the first version of XPoint chips can only be used for SSDs. A second, more developed version is needed to make XPoint for DIMMs. That means XPoint DIMMs may not appear until 2018, which would give competing non-volatile DIMMs more time within which to establish themselves. If true, this means Diablo and Netlist get more breathing space. Intel’s Optane SSDs employ an Intel ASIC as part of their control function. We are informed that this ASIC’s design, which was started some time ago, made assumptions about the characteristics of the media which have not been borne out as the XPoint chips have been delivered from the IMTF Lehi plant. Our source said this controller area problem has contributed to the XPoint SSD’s relatively poor performance advantage over NAND SSDs, a mere 10X performance boost instead of the potential 1,000 times better than NAND. This may delay Intel’s Optane XPoint SSD production availability until 2017, the source claimed. An Intel spokesperson said: "3D XPoint technology is in production and Intel has early samples with customers. Intel’s CEO recently stated during the Q2 earnings call, Optane SSDs will start to ship at the end of this year with 3D XPoint DIMMs following next year.

Hammond Jim Miles Paul Craig Roberts David Swanson Select Page Dead Mice, No Roars: The Jordanian Intelligence Service (Mukhaabaraat) By Siraj Davis | Aug 12, 2016 | Essays, Middle East, Politics | 2 | US President Barack Obama with Jordan's King Abdullah II at the White House on April 21, 2009 (Pete Souza/White House) While the Western mainstream media hail Jordan's Mukhaabaraat as a valuable ally in the fight against terrorism, the truth is quite different. Download this essay (PDF) A retinue of Western journalists have been heralding the daring HUMANINT (Human Intelligence) savvy Jordanian Mukhaabaraat (correct transliteration is with double ‘a’s after the consonants ‘h’ and ‘r’) or GID (General Directorate of Intelligence), which—though unorthodox—is what few pundits aver is the precious missing jigsaw on the bewildering puzzle board contra terrorism. This formidable ally converses in the same argot as the elusive enemy and is accustomed to the enemy’s terrain and culture, since the opposition derives from their backyard. The redoubtable GID also has unquestionable Western loyalties. In Foreign Policy, Shane Harris titled his article in honor of the GID, “The Mouse that Roars.”[1] David Ignatius of the Washington Post described them as “fearless” and excelling in a “meticulous tradecraft.”[2] He furthered that former head of the Mukhaabaraat, General Saad “Pasha” Kheir, was a “genius” and “superstar.”[3] Curtis Ryan lauded them within The Middle East Centre Blog as, “considered to be among the most efficient and capable intelligence services in the region.”[4] Leonardo DeCaprio’s film “Body of Lies” engrossed into our minds the paragon of unmatched canny skills the GID possesses. Like a bright shining light at the end of a gloomy desert, glimmering off the armor of a modern Jordanian clad knight; the red, white, and green warriors of King Abdullah II, the Jordanian Mukhaabaraat, is constantly buttressed as the noble, trustworthy, and honorable solution to the malignant Islamic State enigma. The only prognathous problem is… this isn’t true. Human Rights Record The GID’s “Knight’s Tale” innuendo has promulgated a disturbing human rights incubus. Its ‘unorthodox’ tactics entail forcibly removing fingernails during interrogation, while Amnesty International has reported the seamy GID dangling prisoners upside down by rope or handcuffs simultaneously striking sensitive foot soles and fragile body limbs with old cables, rusted pipes, sharp whips, etc. Threats with umbrages and merciless punishment against family members of detainees is also the norm. The preceding is aimed at dragooning the confessio est regina probationum. For example, Jordanian Palestinian activist, Amer Jubran, is serving 10 years after signing a confession under such Middle Ages’ justice. Also, the Mukhaabaraat in tandem with the US’s Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) regularly detains suspects—some innocent like Khalid El Masri-incommunicado without alerting legal representation, friends, or family.[5] Although King Abdullah II incredulously lauded the Hashemite Kingdom’s human rights record in 2015, the National Centre for Human Rights complained of persistent secretive imprisonment and the GID’s contrapuntal practice of due process.[6] This still hasn’t changed today.[7] Other coercive ‘chivalry’ employed by the GID involves days-length deprivation of bathroom privileges, refusal of food and water, and extinguishing cigarettes upon interviewees. [8] Human Rights Watch has documented well over hundreds of eerie interviews, meticulously detailing widespread torture and rendition against victims who were never even formally charged. [9] GID’s Arch Nemeses: Free Speech, Thought, and Privacy The Mukhaabaraat’s dripping tentacles aren’t solely gripping victims within its black-site dungeons. This Kraken tenons its slimy suckers over the opened mouths of everyone, except those visiting a dentist, suffocating freedom of expression into a 6th to 14th century European dark abyss. For example, Sameer Al-Qudah was incarcerated after the GID discreetly filmed his public recital of a benign poem mocking the superficiality of Jordanian politics. Another frontier the Mukhaabaraat wrecks merciless havoc is the internet-stifling in Don Quixote tittup-its persistent deadly arch nemeses, freedom of speech and thought and privacy. According to Edward Snowden’s whistleblowing documents, Jordan ranks 3rd in the Middle East for the amount of internet data collected for the National Security Agency (NSA) and CIA.[10] When not collecting its pelf of data, the GID is the pit-bull against Roman derived Lese Majeste (6 months in prison is the punishment for insulting the King of Jordan, as with Muhammed Saeed Baker in 2014) and criticisms of Islam (punishment up to 3 years in prison, as with Nasser Qamash in 2003).[11] It also enforces popular opinion on the Hashemite Kingdom’s oppressive domestic and manipulative foreign policies. And it additionally enmeshes and punishes critics of certain Arab illuminati for quotidian public criticism. The sundry examples are plentiful asinine and utterly appalling. And journalists are also not immune. In one instance, twelve Iraqi journalists were arrested in Amman, Jordan for criticizing Jordan’s foreign policy matters with Iraq. Journalist Zaki Bani Irshad was imprisoned 2 years in the Hashemite Kingdom for impolite comments against the UAE government. Tareq Abu al-Ragheb—a T.V. anchor for Al-Haqiqah International—was jailed for rudely urging Arab governments to aid Gaza and Palestine, while journalists Nidal Salameh was apprehended for condemning Israel’s callous bombing campaigns on Gaza, and Jamal Ayub for verbally waving his finger at Saudi Arabia’s aerial destruction of Yemen. In addition, Osama Al-Ramini—the editor for Al Balad News—was mysteriously bastilled, raising numerous eye brows, for unspecified slander against an unidentified plaintiff. Al Rai reporter Ghazi Mrayat was hauled off for factually reporting on the 2015 Irbid terrorism plot in violation of a gag order, which was never issued to his media outlet. More, an entire news staff at Jafra News was sheep-herded together and immured for poking fun at Qatar’s prince. The shameful emetic saga goes on with more intimidated casts and an even more perplexed audience.[12] Even publicly pronouncing personal religious decisions on Facebook is a danger to Jordan’s National Security. One journalist for Al Ghad News was handcuffed at the Queen Rania International Airport when he arrived from Lebanon. This non-anchorite’s offense against Jordan’s National Security, he informed the Lebanese public that he converted from Sunni to Shia Islam.[13] In tandem with the Public Security Department, the capricious GID has successfully uplifted the eccentrically repressive Hashemite Kingdom to number 140 out of 180 countries in international rankings for press freedom. In 2013, an open letter to King Abdullah II by approximately 25 international entities, implored the Hashemite Kingdom to begin respecting journalists’ rights.[14] The supercilious GID is no doubt a modern 17th century replica of French Benigne Dauvergne de Saint Mars while the Jordanian media and bloggers represent a Marchioly. When not Go-Joe deporting Christian missionaries for aiding helpless refugees, Facebook pages and internet websites are patrolled by Mukhaabaraat Templers.[15] Any exiguity and provocative criticism of Jordan caught in its electronic seine, is the obligation of the online presence to immediately erase. The GID’s bullying even extends to Jordanian publicists being regularly contacted on what is permissible to publish.[16] For example, Al Ghad News once refused—after a warning—to run criticism of the King by a prominent journalist. If warnings and occasional bribery fail, extra-judicial physical violence or exorbitant fines or precarious criminal prosecution or making one a social/financial pariah is the retort.[17] For example, Al Medina News was threatened with criminal prosecution if it did not retract a report of Syrian aircraft violating Jordan’s airspace. Occasionally, a reason is not even needed. Muhanned Khatib’s ATV News channel was, without warning or justification, shoved off the air by the Jordanian Mukhaabaraat.[18] Additionally, similar to Rob Pinto of South Florida, journalists who file official grievances discover their GID assailants unpunished, while themselves being ultimately prosecuted in reprimand.[19] Recently, Canadian blogger Ahmad Shahwan has been the epitome of such preceding antics as his pertinacious diatribes and polemics of Jordanian society and politics has resulted in a persistent media smear campaign, his Facebook page removed from the internet, and physical altercations by Jordanian expats in Canada—all of which has only aggrandized his status.[20] In 2014, Jordan passed legislation making it a criminal offense to publish criticism on the GID, Public Security Office, or military, without permission from the GID. If all the preceding mechanisms fail, the celerity Mukhaabaraat will just block a vituperative website. It blocked 300 websites in 2013.[21] The aforementioned dotage of incorrigible trajectory by the GID doesn’t seem to be abating either, as 2015 has marked the worst year of repression in the Hashemite Kingdom according to The Committee to Protect Journalists. More detentions of journalists have occurred in 2015 than prior, as veteran journalist Yahia Shukkeir averred, “I’ve never felt a greater chilling effect in the past 30 years.”[22] Illusion of Democracy The Jordanian Mukhaabaraat’s veiled infiltration and bureaucratic dominance within all facets of the Hashemite kingdom produces a legerdemain yet deceptive illusion of Democracy to the less perspicacious, as the ventriloquist Edgar Bergen’s mussitating presence beside a puppet. The fear of the GID is palpable among the average Samaritan as one past frustrated protestor demanded the Mukhaabaraat cease “intervention in all aspects of Jordanian life.”[23] The GID’s totalitarian embedding engenders its ability to meticulously vet appointments and significantly affect the performance of duties within affluent positions of Jordanian society.[24] And even the Jordanian Parliament is not excluded. For example, (PM) parliamentary member Mohammed Atieh was denied the right by the GID to form an organization for single parents, rebutted the position of President of the Parliament, and also was ordered to remove graffiti decoration his family playfully spray-painted on his home’s wall.[25] Former PM and GID agent, Mahmoud Al-Kharabsheh, admitted the Jordanian intelligence affects 90 percent of the Parliament’s decisions.[26] In another example, American citizen and member of Jordan Parliament, Mohammed Shawabakeh, barefacedly pulled out a brobdingnagian firearm in an attempt to kill a TV host on live television for insulting the Mukhaabaraat. He was never reprimanded, censured, or investigated. When a reporter inquired as to if he was even concerned of punishment by Jordan’s Parliament he retorted, “What Parliament? This is a Parliament that most of its members were practically appointed by the Mukhaabaraat, and where its Speaker give guns as gifts to his MP allies.” Shawabkeh has also been convicted in Santa Fe, New Mexico, of fraud.[27] Additionally, author Katy Montoya evinced in Jadaliyya that civil societies, humanitarian and human rights monitoring groups, some NGOs and charity organizations, and all sinecures are obligated to show obeisance to the GID.[28] Such preceding entities not only need the GID’s permission to operate, but also have been entirely restructured in leadership or completely dissolved upon the whims of the GID.[29] In a sense of comfortability similar to a Daesh (a.k.a. the Islamic State, ISIS, or ISIL) terrorist fulfilling the role of a high school guidance counselor, the sole human rights organization in Jordan is the National Centre for Human Rights, which was founded by former GID head Ahmad Al-Obeidat in 2002. Obeidat has a long, atrociously repugnant record of human rights violations, too.[30] Likewise, the sole major entity in charge of investigating corruption in Jordan, the Anti-Corruption Commission, is a thrall to the GID.[31] In consequence to such aforementioned contamination in Jordanian society, the stygian Mukhaabaraat circumvents blatant repression, when it may manipulate “embedded authoritarianism” within bureaucracy, denying passports and necessary documents or feigning incompetence in job duties, as author Alan George explained, dissembled in a recondite despotism “masked beneath the veneer of visible democratic institutions and practices.”[32] Web of Corruption The Jordanian reform protests sparked in a volatile 2010 was mostly organized by the conservative Muslim Brotherhood, which the GID has recently dissolved by closing all of its offices in April 2016, and also augmented by a smaller leftist spectrum. Those forces aimed its bulls-eye on the endemic and pernicious corruption within the Hashemite Kingdom that the Mukhaabaraat, with its own vast financial budget working in collaboration and fully integrated with Jordanian businesses, largely contributes. The GID’s deep beneficence to corruption is interpolated into Jordan’s origin, with King Hussein bin Talal’s trusted advisors Abdel Salam Al Majali and Ash Sharif Zaid Ibn Shakir, the latter also a former Director of the GID. They, including other impudent ministers and GID, harassed land owners with their political power purchasing prepossessing Jordanian real estate at discounted prices, yet sold them on the international market for extremely exorbitant amounts.[33] Another former Head of Intelligence Mohammed Al-Thahabi was convicted of corruption and a conflated list of 51 journalists he bribed was espied, but never was investigated by The Journalists Association or the government.[34] Journalists who do complain against the prevarication of corruption, are extra-judicially targeted. Such as Jamal Al-Muhtasib of Jerasa News, whose online criticism of corruption landed him in jail.[35] Another intelligence chief, Samih Al-Battikhi, was convicted in the courts of corruption and sentenced to two years of imprisonment, under house arrest, in his ‘villa’ of Aqaba.[36] In April of 2015, one Mukhaabaraat agent entered the GID headquarters and robbed his senior officer.[37] In June 2016, the CIA reported guns transferred to Jordanian intelligence for Syrian rebels were sold on the black market.[38] According to a 2016 poll by CNN, corruption has risen 75 percent in Jordan since the Arab Spring. Currently media attention on the emetic corruption has dissipated and taken a back seat to tendentious National Security interests in the War of Terrorism.[39] Ironically, corruption with earthquake relief funds was probably one of the precipitating reasons and portents Anastasio “Tachito” Somoza DeBayle was eventually ousted as president of Nicaragua by the FSLN insurgency in 1963. Mukhaabaraat’s Follies The Jordanian Mukhaabaraat’s effectiveness arrogated in DeCaprio’s Body of Lies is fictional, yet the title likely an accurate description. The progenitors of the preceding mirage most likely were the creators of Edward Lansdale’s The Quiet American. Perhaps the cadging and aggrandizing of Jordan’s GID by Western pundits is deeply entertaining and emotionally exhilarating to a Chandni Chowk to China audience, but I never was a fan of films like Johnny English. I’ve always liked documentaries more. Discussion with Western ‘savants’ occasionally lead to the Jordanian Mukhaabaraat warned the US of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, yet fail to append that approximately eight other nations adumbrated this tragedy as well.[40] This same intelligence who couldn’t deter the rise of ISIS founder Abu Musab Zarqawi in Zarqa Jordan, yet was completely willing to shield Al Qaeda Sheikhs Abu Qatada, Abu Muhamed Al Maqdisi (Assem Barqawi), Abu Sayyaf (Muhammed Shalabi), Hamza Mansour, and others like Raghad Hussein (Saddam Hussein’s daughter) from international prosecution for supporting terrorism, but also couldn’t predict the Arab Spring. Additionally, the GID often passes flawed Intel to its Western counterparts. For example, on Zarqawi, the GID once claimed the calumny that the ‘Iranian backed’ insurgent, who hates all Shia Muslims, was limping in consequence to an injury, until Zarqawi was sighted walking normally. Then, he was the executioner of Pennsylvania’s Nicholas Berg. A video adduced Berg’s killer as taller than Zarqawi and slicing open Berg’s throat with the right hand, instead of the GID’s profile of a left-handed Zarqawi. Western ‘erudites’ also expostulate the hyperbole that the sedulous GID’s Intel led to the successful assassination of Zarqawi. Yet, former President George Bush indicated “years of near-misses and misleads” of a farraginous trial and error methodology, eventually led to his incapacitation.[41] Later, details revealed an unmanned drone shadowing Zarqawi’s spiritual advisor Sheikh Abdul Rahmanm, was the actual determinant.[42] What isn’t stressed enough is the suspicion attached to the numerous times the GID’s Intel on Zarqawi’s exact whereabouts, concluded with Western forces’ forays ‘barely’ missing him. The truth is the Mukhaabaraat’s efficacy couldn’t thwart the assassination of U.S. diplomat Lawrence Foley in 2002. The GID even reduced the sentence of his killer, Abu Sayyaf, to four years of incarceration. Nor could it halt the 2005 Hotel bombings in Amman, Jordan.[43] And it wasn’t keen enough to prevent gunmen opening fire on tourists twice, one conflagration in Central Amman and the other in Al Hashamiyah Square between 2006 and 2008. Nor could it thwart the attempted bombing of US State Department diplomats’ vehicles in Sahab, or an Israeli diplomatic motorcade on the Dead Sea highway in 2010.[44] The Mukhaabaraat even handed the CIA an Al Qaeda infiltrator in 2009, Humam Al Khalil Abu-Malal Al Balawi, who murdered seven CIA agents in Afghanistan.[45] The GID also miserably failed a prisoner swap of Al Qaeda prisoner Sajida Al Rishawi for Japanese journalist Kenji Goto and Jordanian pilot Muath Kasasbeh in 2015. Goto was in Tal Abyad at the Syrian-Turkish border awaiting such final approval, before the silence by the Jordanian Mukhaabaraat—interpreted as a refusal—promulgated Goto’s beheading and Kasasbeh’s immolation by Daesh.[46] In addition, the GID’s shaky and foppish Intel to US Special forces wasn’t valuable enough to preclude two unsuccessful attempts to rescue Kasasbeh in Raqqaa, Syria.[47] Its phatic Intel also wasn’t sufficiently accurate to avert Jordan’s Air force bombing and killing Daesh’s American hostage, Kayla Mueller.[48] It was also incommensurate to deter a plethora of Jordanian parliamentary members’ sons from joining Daesh. And it remained cricketing silent, when Ibrahim Hussein Hagirat was decapitated for spying for the Mukhaabaraat.[49] In fact, some of the CIA weapons sold on the black market by the GID were even used to kill two American contractors in November 2015, while the GID remained motionless and silent like a statue when the ‘lone wolf’ killer’s ribald tribe ceremoniously expiated the shooter’s actions with chants of “death to America” at his funeral.[50] Just as it fulminates like a statue to fractious sheikhs’ and mullahs’ sermons, demanding the death of Shia Muslims and Jews and the destruction of Israel and America, across the Kingdom. After all of the above, the amazingly preposterous bravado of some journalists toward the contumacious GID is best exemplified in the comic fact that after revealing the debauchery that the Jordan intelligence sold CIA weapons on the black market, some news establishments are now proudly announcing with barefaced agog that Russia and the US will begin sharing nuclear technology with the Hashemite Kingdom. I hope that stays off the black market. While Western ‘scholars’ cull the banal and specious tautology that Jordan’s dearth of significant terrorist incidents in a decade of turmoil in the war-torn region is an acclimation of the Mukhaabaraat’s efficacy, they persistently neglect the gossamer and unavoidable fact that Jordan is ranked number one in foreign Daesh recruits battling in Syria and Iraq.[51] Of course there is no terrorism inside the Hashemite refuge. When a nation deports its scurf of criminals, it has less crime. When it exports its scurf of terrorists, it has less terrorism. The real problems, as some analysts and Jordan government officials have conceded, won’t commence until the conflicts in Iraq and Syria abates, and those fighters return. There are signs now unraveling which are showing the glass chin of the GID. The city of Maan has witnessed continuous incidents of separatist resistance against the Hashemite monarchy while the ridiculous Jordan media in a transparent logomachist game has been tumidly assuaging these events as “common criminals” with RPGs, high-powered machine guns, and IEDs. In July of last year, a Jerash man was caught with approximately 40 kilos of explosives intending to bomb masjids across the Hashemite Kingdom. 2015 has reigned in a higher concern for explosive ordinance landing in northern Jordan from Syria and has witnessed more attacks on security personnel, while Daesh has ceremoniously on occasions taken pictures of itself at Jordan’s border in Syria.[52] In March this year, security forces exchanged gunfire with Daesh in the city of Irbid, for the first time in decades.[53] Within the last three months, Daesh used an explosive laden vehicle to attack the borders of Jordan and Syria and the Jordanian government arrested a Daesh cell in Southern Jordan. However, a few journalists are reporting they are actually arresting ISIS cells weekly in media blackout silence. And unlike the December 2015 terrorist plot to kill GID agents in Al Rusayfah, five GID agents were actually killed in Baqaa Palestinian refugee camp last month.[54] 2015 and 2016 represents a huge spike in numbers and frequency of Daesh activities in Jordan in juxtaposition with the past, which culminates in the deserved query by Michael Rubin in Commentary Magazine “Is ISIS Targeting Jordan?”, in which he justifiably concludes that “ISIS has kept its powder dry with regard to Jordan, but that may be coming to an end.”[55] Conclusion The security situation in the Hashemite Kingdom has severely deteriorated within my five-year stay in the country. A large cusp of the conundrum, based upon my research and experience, derives from the reprobate GID with which the prating King Abdullah II has close relations. Its murky human rights record places an apartheid wall of distrust and bitterness between the fearful population and itself, resulting in what even the US Department of State capitulates as a consensus of the “citizen’s inability to change their government peacefully.”[56] Without peaceful means, a people will resort to asperity violence inevitably. Additionally, the GID’s guillotine choke on journalistic rights thwarts the ability for the average Samaritan to participate in remedying the problems every society throughout history experiences. Instead, it destroys the trust between the former and latter, while simultaneously augmenting apathy among citizens. Great journalism of the past includes such examples as Harper’s Weekly Thomas Nast ridding New York of corruption, Charles Duhigg of the New York Times ascertaining a 25 percent raise for exploited Apple iPhone workers in China, Alan Judd of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution exposing and stopping cheating on exams across the United States, etc.[57] Such wheels of change aren’t turning in consequence to the GID. Thirdly, the doctrinaire GID’s illusion of democracy—by controlling every aspect of society—augments obsequiousness and betrayal while atrophying creativity and talent. Those with traits of the former are promoted and those blessed with the latter, are punished and become pariahs. This is not beneficial for any society. It also creates a status quo wherein democratic ideals are not sincerely embraced by the people, but manipulated and vitiated for an individual’s own selfish ends. Next, the GID’s participation in and phlegmatic winking at the corruption within the Hashemite Kingdom is enabling the Muslim Brotherhood and extremist groups to become more popular, thus presenting a considerable challenge which likely will implode soon. Corruption is a benchmark for the overthrow of many dictators throughout history. Jordan is not immune. Finally, the mirage of the GID’s valuable intelligence gathering is unworthy of all its hyperbolic praise. If Saad “Pasha” Kheir was as good as Ignatius lauded, he’s dead, and it’s clear that there isn’t one like him today. I have to concur with Nathan Hodge on Ignatius: “we need journalists and columnists who are willing to probe deep, and present uncomfortable truths. Too bad in Ignatius we’ve got a stenographer to power, instead.”[58] Worse, the GID is a questionable ally, both untrustworthy and often a false paladin mistaken in its information. The GID’s HUMANINT efficacy is best summarized by writer Mohammed I. Aslam in Foreign Policy Journal: “some of their [GID] terrorism-related assessments have been found to be something akin to a dog’s breakfast of unsupported and politically motivated accusations.”[59] The GID’s Stalin hale grip over Jordanian society has temporarily stymied insurgency, which has more to do with exporting terrorists, but it has failed for a decade to change the US State Department’s descant classification of Jordan as a high risk nation for terrorism, while the security situation has been slowly deteriorating. The answer to the question of “Why?” is that the GID is its own worst enemy. It refuses to correct the above criticisms, always citing security concerns of sedition as immunity, when the above criticisms are absolutely inseparable from the security of the Hashemite Kingdom. Either the Mukhaabaraat is a Bucephalus trotting toward a precipice because a panjandrum King Abdullah II is no Alexander, or that Alexander is in reality a narcissistically blind midget Napoleon acting the beautiful role of a potentate Baghdad Bob, deceiving the entire international community. I am inclined to opine the latter. As one former GID confided to me once paraphrase, “Nothing happens in the Kingdom without our King’s approval.” I also disagree with Shane Harris’ depiction of the GID as a mouse that roars. First, I’ve never known of such possibility. Second, I witnessed many rats in my time within the gallimaufry of Jordan, but heard no roars. There were a lot of terrorists and terrorist sympathizers there though, and that includes a snake pit of them within the GID. All the friendly and tough mice must have been already swallowed when I arrived in Jordan five years ago. Although Jordan is the better of many Arab nations, I am with Michael Rubin of Commentary Magazine; it’s about to get worse in the Hashemite Kingdom … and quickly. Since the King spends most of his time on a plane outside of Jordan, he shouldn’t fret. I’m just sincerely concerned for the good people I’ve met there.

Wireless base station functions rely on a Central Unit (CU) that processes data and Distributed Units (DU) that send and receive radio waves. NFV C-RAN solution is enabled by software on Intel Architecture that functions as the CU. The CU controls multiple DU on a centralized basis, making it possible to flexibly control radio wave output from the DU in line with data volumes. By transferring selected data processing functions from the CU to DU, the NFV C-RAN solution also enables tolerance levels for communications delays between CU and DU to be relaxed. This enables Ethernet to be used as the interface between the CU and DU instead of the conventional Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI). As a result, the volume of data exchanged between the CU and DU can be reduced to less than one tenth, compared to existing C-RAN architecture. By maintaining the same level of performance, even if connecting the CU and DU via lower capacity networks, this will enable communications carriers to develop the high performance networks they need for 5G whilst keeping capital investment to a minimum. "NEC launched a range of innovative SDN/NFV solutions on the market ahead of our competitors," said Nozomu Watanabe, General Manager, Mobile Radio Access Network Division, NEC Corporation. "Looking forward, NEC will capitalize on its NFV C-RAN solutions and Management and Orchestration solutions in order to contribute to the highly efficient facility operations that are necessary for 5G." "Intel is collaborating with global operators and telecom equipment manufacturers to develop more intelligent and agile networks that lay a foundation for 5G. Innovations in areas like cloud RAN offer increased flexibility to support a breadth of new use cases and will help accelerate progress toward 5G," said Sandra Rivera, vice president and general manager of Intel's Network Platforms Group. NEC and Intel will be running dynamic demonstrations and showcasing the effectiveness of this NFV C-RAN solution at the Intel Developer Forum 2016 (IDF 2016) in San Francisco from August 16 to 18.

 The man Intel paid $25 million to poach from Qualcomm will make his first big stage appearance this week Eugene Kim Aug. 15, 2016, 8:43 PM 12,336 facebook linkedin twitter email print Murthy RenduchintalaIntel Venkata "Murthy" Renduchintala, Intel's No. 2 guy behind CEO Brian Krzanich, will finally get to show the world why he's worth $25 million when he gives a keynote at Intel's annual Developers Conference this week. Intel paid roughly $25 million last year to steal him from rival Qualcomm and put him in charge of the company's PC, mobile, and Internet of Things units, essentially putting him in charge of almost every business not building data center chips. But despite his high rank, Renduchintala has not made any public speeches for the company so far. Even internally, not many employees have seen him speak in public, according to some of the current and former employees we've spoken to. That makes him one of the most mysterious but powerful executives in tech. In addition to all the business groups he controls, Renduchintala was also given a big show of support by Krzanich in April, when he told investors that Renduchintala would be in charge of reviewing the final reorganization plan, which includes a 12,000 layoff, the largest in company history. It's unclear what exactly Renduchintala will talk about during his keynote scheduled for Wednesday morning, but he'll most certainly share his vision for all the businesses he runs. According to Intel's website, Renduchintala will "discuss innovations that will drive the next revolution in technology as we shift to a truly connected world such as pervasive computing, cloud-like capabilities for compute, analytics and storage, and connectivity as the lifeblood of the Internet of Things." That sounds like pretty much the same message he shared in a blog post in May when he wrote about his thoughts on why he joined Intel and where he sees the company headed in the future. Perhaps a lot of people will also tune in to see his stage presence to see if he's fit to lead Intel's transformation, which is upsetting a lot of current and former employees. Intel's annual developer conference, called Intel Developer Forum (IDF), will kick off Tuesday morning with Krzanich's keynote speech. He's expected to discuss a wide array of things including how machine learning and drones, as well as autonomous cars fit into Intel's broader strategy moving forward. Here are some of the biggest events taking place during IDF.

Intel’s Andy Grove (right) shakes hands with Microsoft’s Bill Gates in Burlingame in 1992. Photo: PAUL SAKUMA, AP Intel looks for new uses for its paranoia 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Andy Grove, the renowned CEO of Intel who died in March, coined a phrase beloved in Silicon Valley: “Only the paranoid survive.” That sounds cool, if you like your capitalism fierce. That idea, however, turns out to have some significant downsides. Intel is the world’s biggest semiconductor company because when Grove was in charge, it dominated the personal computer industry and was an important player in the associated business in computer servers. Today, the PC market is shrinking, hurting the Santa Clara company’s profit. The server-chip industry is still strong, thanks to the rise of cloud computing at companies such as Facebook and Google. Cloud companies engineer server chips in ways that make powerful and flexible systems used by millions of people. But Intel missed joining a number of other markets that did not look like the PC business, particularly smartphones. It is scrambling for a place in sensors (or what is called the Internet of things), wireless networking, autonomous vehicles and other hot areas, as computing spreads from traditional computers to nearly every machine. “The mistake was, when you grow with great leadership and great success, your paranoia is focused on the one thing that is delivering that,” Brian Krzanich, Intel’s current CEO, said in an interview. From PC-dominated computing, he said, we are now “where computing is constantly shifting.” Krzanich says he is still a strong believer in paranoia, but he must turn that vigilant anxiety in a lot of directions at once. Cloud computing may be Intel’s core, but Krzanich has to feed it from chips in many markets. The effect of those changes will be seen this week as Intel holds its Developer Forum at Moscone Center in San Francisco. The conference is where the hard-core geeks of computing gather to hear about what’s coming in the realms of processing power, memory and other technology that enables the modern world. Giant tech trade shows like the International CES, held in Las Vegas every January, are focused on hot products. Developer events may be nerd-fests, but they say more about the technology world, and where a company hopes to be in two or three years. At the Developer Forum, Krzanich will deliver a keynote speech, in which he is expected to dwell on topics like virtual reality, sensors and artificial intelligence, which was in the news last week when Intel bought an AI startup, Nervana Systems, that has technology that will be used in Intel’s data-center chips. Shifting gears for the giant chip company is no easy task. “Intel has four main business lines — PCs, mobile, Internet of things and servers — and it’s hitting on one of them,” said Patrick Gelsinger, a longtime Intel executive who is now CEO of VMware. The factories where Intel builds chips “now cost $10 billion, at least,” each to set up, he said, “and the competition is catching up.” In April, Intel announced it would cut its workforce by 12,000 people, about 11 percent of workers. About a quarter of the executives who report to Krzanich come from other companies, a big deal at a place where leaders rise through the ranks over decades. In his speech, Krzanich may stay away from talking about wearable devices. Last month, Intel withdrew a health-monitoring watch that had some nice capabilities but sometimes burned its wearers’ skin. Even so, Krzanich said, the heart-monitoring capabilities of that watch will find their way into a device Intel plans to make with New Balance. The part he is looking forward to, Kraznich said, is a one-hour question-and-answer session with 200 elite developers. “It’s a much broader group” than even a couple of years ago, he said. “People writing for machine learning and AI, networking chips, how virtual reality feeds into PCs.” Even in decline, PC chips still make up half of Intel’s revenue. If these things catch on, Intel will sell more chips to those businesses and create new demand for cloud computing, because most devices are now connected to the cloud. Even so, another pillar of the Intel mythology, the unchanging nature of Moore’s Law, is getting revised. Named for Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, it states that a chip’s power doubles every 18 to 24 months without a rise in costs. Grove’s paranoia championed and fed on Moore’s Law, as Intel strove to achieve profit from that computing cadence. Silicon Valley treats Moore’s Law as if it is immutable, and with even more reverence than it does paranoia. But it was not a scientific law; it was always an observation about the behavior of a market for computers and software, which paid off at a rate to justify increasing investment in making chips. It is changing, Krzanich said, because phones, sensors and cloud systems develop at different rates. “It’s lengthened to 24 to 36 months,” he said, and expanded into other areas. That is why Intel is in the wireless and networking fields, and is working on a new kind of three-dimensional memory chip, which Krzanich said would be out at the end of this year, that can speed performance of big-data-type calculations seven-fold. There would be a historical precedent to that shift. Years ago, Intel’s main business was in memory chips, a market that collapsed three decades ago, leading the company to move toward making number-crunching processors for PCs. That shift, which arguably saved the company, was the lesson that led to Grove’s paranoia. Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

Photo: Bloomberg Andy Grove, the renowned chief executive of Intel, who died in March, coined a phrase beloved in Silicon Valley: “Only the paranoid survive.” That sounds cool, if you like your capitalism fierce. That idea, however, turns out to have some significant downsides. Intel is the world’s biggest semiconductor company because when Grove was in charge, it dominated the personal computer industry and was an important player in the associated business in computer servers. Today, the PC market is shrinking, hurting Intel’s profits. The server-chip industry is still strong, thanks to the rise of cloud computing at companies such as Facebook and Google. Cloud companies engineer server chips in ways that make powerful and flexible systems used by millions of people. But Intel missed joining a number of other markets that did not look like the PC business, particularly smartphones. It is scrambling for a place in sensors (or what is called the Internet of things), wireless networking, autonomous vehicles and other hot areas, as computing spreads from traditional computers to nearly every machine. “The mistake was, when you grow with great leadership and great success, your paranoia is focused on the one thing that is delivering that,” Brian Krzanich, Intel’s current chief executive, said in an interview. From PC-dominated computing, he said, we are now “where computing is constantly shifting.” Krzanich says he is still a strong believer in paranoia, but he must turn that vigilant anxiety in a lot of directions at once. Cloud computing may be Intel’s core, but Krzanich has to feed it from chips in many markets. The effect of those changes will be seen this week as Intel holds its Developer Forum in San Francisco. The conference is where the hardcore geeks of computing gather to hear about what’s coming in the realms of processing power, memory and other technology that enables the modern world. Giant tech trade shows like the International CES, held in Las Vegas every January, are focused on hot products. Developer events may be nerd-fests, but they say more about the technology world, and where a company hopes to be in two or three years. At the Developer Forum, Krzanich will deliver a keynote speech, in which he is expected to dwell on topics like virtual reality, sensors and artificial intelligence, which was in the news last week when Intel bought an AI start-up, Nervana Systems, that has technology that will be used in Intel’s data-center chips. In his speech, Krzanich may stay away from talking about wearable devices. Last month, Intel withdrew a health-monitoring watch that had some nice capabilities but sometimes burned its wearers’ skin. Even so, Krzanich said, the heart-monitoring capabilities of that watch will find their way into a device Intel plans to make with the athletics brand New Balance. If these things catch on, Intel will sell more chips to those businesses and create new demand for cloud computing, because most devices are now connected to the cloud. Even so, another pillar of the Intel mythology, the unchanging nature of Moore’s Law, is getting revised. Named for the Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, it states that a chip’s power doubles every 18-24 months without a rise in costs. Grove’s paranoia championed and fed on Moore’s Law, as Intel strove to achieve profit from that computing cadence. Silicon Valley treats Moore’s Law as if it is immutable, and with even more reverence than it does paranoia. But it was not a scientific law; it was always an observation about the behaviour of a market for computers and software, which paid off at a rate to justify increasing investment in making chips. It is changing, Krzanich said, because phones, sensors and cloud systems develop at different rates. “It’s lengthened to 24 to 36 months,” he said. “The performance of the ecosystem is much more than Moore’s Law.” That is why Intel is in the wireless and networking fields, and is working on a new kind of three-dimensional memory chip, which Krzanich said would be out at the end of this year, that can speed performance of big-data-type calculations sevenfold. ©2016/THE NEW YORK TIMES Quentin Hardy Topics: IntelBrian Krzanichtechnologyprocessorsprofit More from this Section Alpha Corp. plans Mumbai entry with up to Rs2,000 crore investment Shapoorji Pallonji to buy 100 acres land in affordable housing push Airlines brace for demonetisation headwinds by advancing flash sales GVK Airport in talks to raise $200 million to refinance loans Endura Mass maker Medinn Belle in talks with PE funds to sell 40% stake Editor's Picks New income tax rules to curb unaccounted cash The richest 1% of Indians now own 58.4% of wealth Reliance Jio fails to hit subscriber base of Airtel, Idea, Vodafone: analysts Tracking demonetisation: Our reading list India may gain from Donald Trump’s TPP pullout threat First Published: Tue, Aug 16 2016. 12 50 AM IST Latest News Alpha Corp. plans Mumbai entry with up to Rs2,000 crore investment NITI Aayog calls for targeted power subsidy, privatization of all discoms Maximum e-wallet transactions in 25-35 age group: data Editor's Picks New income tax rules to curb unaccounted cash The richest 1% of Indians now own 58.4% of wealth Reliance Jio fails to hit subscriber base of Airtel, Idea, Vodafone: analysts Latest News NITI Aayog calls for targeted power subsidy, privatization of all discoms Maximum e-wallet transactions in 25-35 age group: data Globalization is alive and well Rupee volatility Final norms for insolvency professionals Mint On Sunday The dilemma of Draupadī’s disrobing The prodigals return to Neroca US elections: How slogans can make or break a candidate Now, the crowd can bankroll your research How to maximize judicial time Home Companies Opinion Industry Politics Consumer Lounge Multimedia Money Sitemap Subscribe Contact Us Mint Code Privacy policy Terms of Use Advertising Mint Apps About Us Syndication Mint on Sunday RSS Hindustan Times Desimartini Copyright © 2016 HT Media Ltd.

Credit: Intel More like this Intel's Atom chips for cars and IoT could shed ugly mobile past Intel's siloed business units unify around IoT and connectivity How Intel plans to change servers as it breaks away from PCs Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles For decades, PCs were at the center of Intel's business. Not anymore. Self-driving cars, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence are more attractive to Intel, which no longer views PCs as a priority. That's the message the company will try to deliver at Intel Developer Forum, starting on Tuesday. IDF attendees will see drones fly around and robots roaming the floor, and they will be able to try on cool wearables and VR and AR (augmented reality) headsets. Unlike past years, attendees won't be wowed with a lot of blazing laptops and desktops running upcoming PC processors. Instead, Intel will provide an insight into its internet-of-things and data-center strategies.  PCs have been at the heart of Intel's operations, but that's changing. In April, the company started rebuilding itself around the fast-growing markets of servers, IoT, and connectivity, with the shrinking PC market becoming a lower priority. It was a painful decision. The company laid off 12,000 people as part of the restructuring. Soon after, it jettisoned its pursuit of the mobile chip market, a doomed effort that cost the company billions of dollars. Top Intel executives want the water-cooler talk among their employees to be about the new areas of focus, not about PCs. If the employees buy into the new focus areas, the change to a new Intel will be swift and successful, executives have said. At IDF, the chip-maker will highlight virtual reality, IoT, and machine learning. Intel will show FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays), which are reprogrammable chips for servers, cars, and IoT devices. "I still think we will see a little about their PC plans, but more on IoT and the data center," said Patrick Moorhead, president at Moorhead Insights and Strategy. Intel won't spend a lot of time talking about its upcoming PC processors code-named Kaby Lake, which succeed the current crop of Skylake chips. However, Intel will likely demonstrate Kaby Lake PCs because the chip release is close. Asus and HP are readying products with the chips, and Lenovo and Acer will announce Kaby Lake PCs ahead of the IFA show in Berlin next month. Intel will show off VR and AR headsets developed both internally and by partners. The company will show what seems like its version of Microsoft HoloLens, called Remote EyeSight, a set of head-worn AR smart glasses for remote collaboration. Many of the VR and AR announcements will focus around its RealSense 3D camera, which can recognize objects, measure distances, and like Microsoft's Kinect, track gestures. PCs still generate the most revenue for the company but ultimately could be replaced by data-center products like server chips and networking and storage equipment. Servers are involved in machine learning and in analyzing data sent from IoT devices, which will be a big focus at the show. Intel will announce new Atom chips for IoT devices, drones and robots. Atom chips previously designed for smartphones and tablets are being reassigned to IoT devices like information kiosks, digital advertising signs, casino machines, and ATMs. Intel is tying server chip sales to the number of IoT devices sold, said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. With more IoT devices sold, more server chips will be needed to analyze information in the cloud, he said. Intel will also discuss its burgeoning AI strategy, which got a boost last week when it announced plans to acquire Nervana Systems, which offers deep-learning software and chip technology. Intel is trying to catch with its competition on machine learning. Nvidia's GPUs drive machine learning at companies like Facebook and Google, and companies like KnuPath and Numenta offer specialized deep-learning chips. Google has announced such a chip called Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), which it is using internally. On the last day of IDF, Intel is hosting a sideline conference called ISDF (Intel SoC FGPA Developer Forum), which, oddly, has rival ARM as a sponsor. These sessions will be targeted at developers working with FPGAs from Altera, which was acquired by Intel for $16.7 billion last year. Intel wants to put FPGAs in servers, storage devices, cars, IoT devices, robots, and drones.

Intel Graphics Driver SVM Support Back To Being Worked On Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 15 August 2016 at 01:16 PM EDT. 5 Comments Intel Open-Source Technology Center developers are back to working on SVM support for the Intel i915 DRM driver. Jesse Barnes had begun working on SVM support several months ago, but he since left Intel. Intel's Mika Kuoppala has now picked up this work and has sent out revised patches. Jesse Barnes presented on Intel DRM SVM support back at FOSDEM 2016 to cover this pointer sharing between the CPU and GPU, pointer sharing with buffers, pointer sharing with a bufferless API, and other functionality. Those Intel SVM slides from the graphics context are here in PDF form. The revised SVM support patches were mailed out today on the intel-gfx list. Hopefully they'll be ready for merging in Linux ~4.9. 5 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Daniel Cooper , @danielwcooper 08.12.16 in Opinion Comments 555 Shares Share Tweet Share Save If recent reports are to be believed, Jawbone is in serious trouble after missing a payment to a creditor. Sources close to the company have denied it, but this isn't the first time we've heard such rumors. The Information reported earlier this week that the firm is running out of money and has put itself up for sale. If that's the case, then I can think of the perfect suitor: Intel. After all, the chipmaker has both the money and a smartwatch division in need of a win, while Jawbone has arguably the best fitness app on the market. From the position of an armchair quarterback, it's a match made in heaven -- at least on paper. Why is Jawbone's mobile app worth saving? Up, by Jawbone, is an iOS and Android app that seems more determined than its rivals to help you develop healthful habits. The key selling point is that it will proactively do things to help you reach the goals that you've set. Motivation, after all, is the key to sticking with life changes, but most apps assume you're capable of pushing yourself every morning. As well as eschewing the usual 10,000-step target for something more tailored to your body type, it offers something beyond just inactivity alerts. Up is great for proactively identifying problems in your activity patterns over longer periods of time and suggesting ways to remedy it. For instance, if you spend a long week sitting down, it'll give you a prod to counter that laziness. Basically, the advice is more personalized than an hourly buzz to the wrist. On the surface, Up is friendly and unthreatening with clean, colorful, easy-to-read graphs. Its unintimidating design belies a hidden strength, with the more granular data hidden away unless you want to see it. If want to closely examine your stats much more exhaustively, you can do so in the trends menu, which lets you compare two sets of data against one another over time. So, for instance, if wanted to look for a correlation between calorie burn and sleep, or carbs consumed vs. resting heart rate, you could. Intel has great hardware and bad software. Jawbone has the opposite problem. Merging the two together would see two fine products become one class leader. There's also a robust social component that lets you compete with friends and colleagues in so-called duels, or just keep an eye on their progress. Many apps don't have much in the way of social features, and there's little to create a sense of community with your friends. With Up, meanwhile, Duels allow you to engage in one-on-one challenges that'll see you and a friend going head-to-head. There's also diet tracking, which is clumsy in practice, but still effective for making you more aware of what you're eating. More than once I wanted more detail on outlining portions, since it's hard to quantify "1.5 servings" of bolognese sauce. Why Intel needs it Until a few weeks ago, the Basis Peak was one of the best -- and most underrated -- wearables in the market. Unfortunately, the company found that a handful of devices were overheating and burning users' skin, which forced Intel to issue a recall. Earlier this week I outlined what otherwise made the Peak such a great device. Rather than trying to replicate the experience of a smartphone on your wrist, it stuck to the basics: fitness and sleep tracking, smartphone notifications, not to mention vibrating alarms. Hell, it was even able to automatically detect exercise down to the type of action you were doing. That made it effective and seamless, with a battery that could last almost a working week between charges. But, thanks to these overheating concerns, Peak has been taken off the market, and may never return. But what Basis can do in hardware can't be overstated: Its main issue (aside from dodgy batteries) was that its companion app was awful. As good as the watch was, the app was ugly, unfriendly and designed for gym nerds who obsessed over minutiae. Intel has great hardware and bad software. Jawbone has the opposite problem. Merging the two together would see two fine products become one class leader. Then there's the fact that Intel really could do with a hit, something that will help the company with its long-overdue reinvention. Intel's fate has always been inexorably bound to that of the PC market, and as people buy fewer desktops and laptops, its financial dominance will begin to wither. Back in 2013, then-CEO Paul Otellini admitted that it was a mistake not to build ARM-designed chips for smartphones, namely the iPhone. The move effectively tied Intel to the mast of a sinking ship and allowed Samsung, Qualcomm and TSMC to become the chipmakers of the 21st century. Earlier this year, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich conceded that the company will have to fire 12,000 people as it begins to refocus. Intel is making inroads into other businesses, like consumer hardware -- wearables and drones -- as well as the internet of things. Buying Jawbone would give it a quirky, reasonably decent consumer hardware maker that could benefit from Intel's backing. It also, crucially, has the Up app, and Up is such a good piece of software that it could form the center of Intel's wearables universe. Intel is also one of the few companies that could afford to buy Jawbone. The struggling company raised $165 million at the start of the year, and at the time was valued at around a billion. Even with banks cutting their expectations for Jawbone, it'll still cost Intel a few hundred million to pick up the business, but that's pocket change for a company that still generates $1.3 billion in quarterly profit. Why this is all a fantasy For starters, spending hundreds of millions on a company to get at one component of its business makes iffy sense to most CEOs. As we've seen with Snapchat and Instagram Stories, if you're really committed to building a competing product, you can easily build something similar in-house. I'm not suggesting Intel rip off the concept behind Up -- just that it wouldn't be the first time such a thing has happened. Intel could, theoretically, hire some software designers and build a comparable app for significantly less than Jawbone's asking price. (Though to be fair, it hasn't yet.) Jawbone doesn't make much sense as an acquisition target because of the baggage it carries as a troubled company. It has constantly overpromised and underdelivered on its devices and struggled to produce reliable hardware. Search for any combination of "Jawbone," "Up" and "broken" and you'll find the internet awash with disgruntled users. The Jawbone patent portfolio isn't worth much either, now that judges have ruled several of them invalid in the company's ongoing lawsuit with Fitbit. Plus, Intel would have to deal with the messy business of deconstructing Jawbone to get at the meat it really wants. That would require layoffs (expensive, bad PR) and sales (time-sapping) that it could otherwise avoid. Plus, it would inherit a Bluetooth audio division that's tangential to Intel's current and future plans. Besides, Jawbone has reportedly already tried several times to sell its speaker arm, so Intel would likely have to sell it at a knock-down rate. Fundamentally, this is pure speculation on my part, and Jawbone has too many problems to make a rescue worthwhile. But it deserves repeating that the Up software is a great app that deserves to live on in the face of whatever corporate drama is unfolding at Jawbone. It'd be nice if some white knight would come and rescue Up from possible death. And it'd be especially nice if Intel were the one on the back of the horse.

Intel's battle for relevance USA TODAY 15/08/2016 Bob O'Donnell © Remy Gabalda, AFP Getty Images Intel has released its mid-year diversity numbers, which show only slight changes from late 2015 despite the tech company's $300 million to drastically change the makeup of its workforce. FOSTER CITY, Calif.— It’s an interesting situation. The company that arguably started and dominated the intelligent devices market for decades now finds itself in the role of an underdog, just as we’re entering an era when the number of smart, computing-capable, connected things is exploding all around us. But that’s exactly the position that Silicon Valley stalwart Intel finds itself in on the eve of its big annual Intel Developer Forum (IDF), being held in San Francisco this week. Intel’s long-term strength, of course, has been providing the vast majority of the computing brains (the CPU) for the PC market. After several years of declining PC shipments, however, that legacy advantage has turned into a disadvantage, even despite signs that commercial PC shipments could be on the rebound. Earlier in the year the company announced large layoffs and an intentional focus away from PCs, which still made up about 55% of the company’s revenues in its last quarterly earnings. One of the biggest issues is that the company infamously missed the mobile market opportunity, particularly with smartphones. For literally billions of people around the world, smartphones have become their primary computing device, and Intel has had little impact there to date, even despite purchasing cellular radio manufacturer Infineon back in 2011. Now, however, there are increasing signs that smartphone shipments have also started to peak — ironically, just as rumors are increasing that Intel may have won at least some of the cellular radio business in Apple’s next iPhone — so the race is on to discover the next big tech opportunity. The problem for Intel, and many other tech companies, is that there is no obvious choice as to what that “next big thing” will be. Instead, it’s becoming increasingly clear that there’s going to be a highly splintered range of many different, but generally much smaller opportunities in tech. In that context, Intel is expected to highlight its progress on a range of new initiatives at IDF this week, notably 5G, deep learning and cloud computing, several of which can take advantage of major purchases the company has made fairly recently. In the case of 5G, Intel is hoping to leverage not only their growing strength around cellular modems, but even more importantly, the move to software-defined network infrastructure. Major telecom carriers, such as AT&T, are aggressively working towards updating much of their core equipment as they migrate towards the new wireless standard, and that creates an opportunity for Intel-powered open hardware to replace proprietary equipment from vendors like Cisco Systems. Last week’s purchase of Nervana Systems gives Intel a much stronger presence in the growing market for deep learning applications. Fields ranging from scientific discovery to digital personal assistants to autonomous driving and much more are expected to greatly benefit from deep learning over the next decade or so. With Nervana, Intel is gaining blueprints to a new deep learning “accelerator” chip that should prove useful in cloud-based computing applications and even individual devices longer term. Speaking of cloud computing, Intel is also hoping to highlight its growing data center business and advancements from last year’s Altera purchase at IDF this week. The FPGA (field programmable gate array) customizable chip technology that Intel acquired as part of that deal is supposed to have a big benefit for several types of cloud-based applications and services, but its impact to the bottom-line has been minimal to date. Not all of Intel’s efforts to integrate new companies, products and technologies recently have been successful, however. After the company purchased Basis Science a little over two years ago, for example, they made a big push into wearables. Just a few weeks ago, the company seemingly gave up on the effort, though. They recalled all existing Basis smartwatches because of a potential defect that they were unable to fix which could cause burns on the wrist of users and offered no options for replacement. They also announced that they were shutting down the data service for the smartwatch at the end of this year. Like many other maturing tech companies, including Apple, Intel is in the process of transitioning its business from one that’s been heavily weighted towards a legacy market that has likely peaked, to one that’s more focused on smaller, but growing opportunities. The path for Intel to remain relevant won’t be an easy one, despite the company’s incredibly robust, though little-appreciated chip manufacturing capabilities. But they are making the moves to keep their presence known even after Moore’s Law becomes history.

The London Summer School focuses on health and wellbeing this year as part of an annual pan-European programme. Jonny Hancox, Health and Life Sciences Group at Intel, said: “Successful companies rely on having markets for which their products are relevant. Therefore, it is essential to have boots on the ground – teams who work with scientists, researchers, clinicians and tech start-ups to help support their activities with great computing experiences. In this way, Intel supporting EIT Digital events benefits everyone because it helps encourage the next wave of technological innovation, whilst also ensuring that computing technology is tuned to modern workloads.” The school encourages both EIT Digital Master School students and external entrants from academia and industry to apply their skills and experiences of the wellbeing market, developing a better understanding of how ideas become viable commercial solutions. UK director of EIT Digital Dennis Moynihan added: “We’re thrilled to host this diverse, creative, and vibrant set of students at this year’s London Health and Wellbeing Summer School. Having met the attendees, I’m confident that we’re looking at entrepreneurial leaders of tomorrow. On behalf of my EIT Digital colleagues, we’re proud we can play a role in shaping their future. EIT Digital is committed to helping learners build innovation and entrepreneurial skills, not only to create great opportunities for individuals but also to help ensure a strong pool of technical talent for cutting-edge European companies.” EIT Digital contributes to the EU’s Horizon 2020 principles by addressing societal challenges and funding innovation.

Used with permission In May, we reported on an Embedded Linux Conference talk by Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) Executive Director Mike Richmond on the potential for interoperability between the OCF’s IoTivity IoT framework and the AllSeen Alliance’s AllJoyn spec. We also looked at how the OCF has evolved from the earlier Open Interconnect Consortium (OIC) and acquired the assets of the Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) Forum. Here, we examine another ELC 2016 talk about the specifics of those integrations, as well as other changes planned for the IoTivity 2.0 release due later this year. The Iotivity 2.0 talk (see full video below) was presented by Vijay Kesavan, a Senior Member of Technical Staff in the Communication and Devices Group at Intel Corp. Kesavan is a seed contributor to the core IoTivity library, and currently serves as the Business Development Task Group chair for OCF. Speaking shortly after the release of IoTivity 1.1, Kesavan told the ELC audience about plans to support new platforms and IoT ecosystems in v2.0. He also explained how the OCF is exploring usage profiles beyond home automation in domains like automotive and industrial. Joining the IoTivity Party: iOS, Windows, UPnP, and Arduino 101 IoTivity currently supports Linux, including specific Ubuntu and Android support, as well as Arduino. Version 2.0 will expand that to Windows and iOS. For iOS, the OCF is essentially doing what it did for Android: adding support in the “upper stack built on C++” rather than the lower C-based stack, in order to expose IoTivity to the iOS API, said Kesavan. The Windows integration will be more substantial. “We’re porting IoTivity to Windows so it can build upon Visual Studio 2013,” he said. New hardware targets will include Intel’s Arduino 101 board. Arduino 101 runs the Arduino IDE on the Intel-developed, open source Zephyr OS, which itself runs on an Intel Curie module based on an Intel Quark SE chip. “Zephyr and IoTivity have the same data model, but the APIs are not yet compatible,” said Kesavan. IoTivity 2.0 will also support Samsung’s Linux-ready Artik embedded modules. Integrating IoT ecosystems is a more challenging problem. Much of v2.0 is about supporting legacy UPnP devices. “We’re doing a lot of work in protocol translations, exposing UPnP devices using a plugin mechanism,” said Kesavan. “A UPnP device will essentially be discovered and seen as an OCF device.” In the future, the OCF will translate IoTivity’s REST APIs to UPnP’s SOAP/XML representations, he added. There are also plans to integrate the UPnP AV data model directly to IoTivity to support audio and video. IoTivity 2.0 will also include “some work” in interoperability with AllJoyn, although in v2.0, this work will not be as comprehensive as the UPnP integration. “There will be an AllJoyn plugin that maps AllJoyn into the OCF model and talks to AllJoyn routers, and maybe talk to some of the thinner devices like lightbulbs,” said Kesavan. Additionally, IoTivity 2.0 will include the beginnings of interoperability with EEBus, a European IoT spec for energy management in homes and smart buildings. Specific device integration will also be provided for IoT device families like Nest, LIFX, and Hue. Presumably, the Nest support would include some integration with Nest’s Weave IoT protocol, but Kesavan did not go into specifics. NodeJS and Group Management The big news for developers in v2.0 is the support for NodeJS at the API level. There will also be better group management features, making it easier to create and manage conceptual groups of IoT devices, and detailing “how you add and remove devices and add security,” said Kesavan. Other new developer-focused features will include Pub/Sub integration, more cloud extensions, and better tools and documentation. When asked whether IoTivity would expand to different transport protocols beyond its Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) to support HTTP, Kesavan said there were “no plans for 2.0 but we’re looking into it.” Finally, IotTvity 2.0 will feature end user improvements including better support for “network onboarding” of tools. “This will make it easier for end users to add a device to a WiFi or BLE network,” said Kesavan. New Industrial Domains: Supply Chain, Automotive, and More For future release, the OCF is beginning to look beyond the smart home to new industrial domains with very specific usage requirements. In the shipping business, for example, there are considerable questions about how IoTivity could be modified to support asset tracking and smart logistics in the supply chain. “The industry wants to move beyond bar codes to add smart sensors that continuously monitor shipments,” said Kesavan. Sensors are being implemented first for high value goods and perishables like vaccines and food that need to maintain consistent temperature and other conditions. “Today, you don’t know about the quality of the goods until you open the box,” said Kesavan. “But if you knew the temperature threshold was being breached closer to the time it happened, you could take action earlier. We’ll see coin-cell driven sensors attached to boxes and pallets to measure things like temperature, shock, and humidity. At each step, that data can be read and aggregated through a gateway to the cloud.” Industrial supply chains present challenges like scale, density, and quality of service that are less common in the home. “If you have all these boxes all transmitting status over BLE or ZigBee, how do manage interference?” said Kesavan. “We can have gateways coordinate with each other on load balancing, handoffs, and channel allocations.” The OCF is looking into how to integrate DDS for quality of service, and how to operate on highly constrained devices. “We’ll also need to look at better security at both the device and hierarchical level,” he added. Other domains under evaluation include medical and automotive. In automotive, the OCF is working with both the Automotive Grade Linux (AGL) and GENIVI standards organizations. “The next step will be creating an automotive profile for IoTivity,” said Kesavan. “We’ll look at how you integrate wearables, and communicate between the car and a home gateway, including scheduling smart charging. We’ll look at how we talk to various automotive buses, as well as other cars or infrastructure using V2V or V2I.” As the OCF’s industrial workgroups pull together requirements for these and other domains, they need more participants with domain experience. “Please join the OCF,” said Kesavan. “We need your expertise.” Log in or register to post comments Print This Like  (0 likes) 1 Comments Comments WhizzSystems | August 16, 2016 Permalink An IoT Gateway is able to perform various tasks including the likes of device connectivity, translations of protocols, processing and filtering of data among many others.  Log in or register to post comments 1 Like Like Leave this field blank Click Here!

Vine Report HOME U.S. SCIENCE/HEALTH WORLD ENTERTAINMENT TECH LIFE&STYLE Subscriptions Home TECH Microsoft Surface Book 2 release date, specs: hinge to be replaced Hercules Reyes Aug 17, 2016 5:17 AM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton)A Microsoft logo is seen at a pop-up site in New York. Microsoft is set to release a new Surface Book, called the Surface Book 2, and it is expected that the device would be delivering improvements on both its hardware and design. In terms of power and specs, it is expected that the upcoming Surface Book 2 laptop/tablet hybrid would be running under the new Intel Kaby Lake series of chipsets. The successor to Intel's current Skylake series have yet to be released but the new chipsets may come in just in time for the rumored release of the Surface Book 2 which is said to be sometime this fall. The new Intel Kaby Lake chipsets offer more power and processing capabilities than its predecessor. Due to the power of the Kaby Lake processor, the Surface Book 2 is expected to support a resolution that reaches up to 4K Ultra HD, as well as support of virtual reality (VR) gaming and highly detailed 3D graphics for gaming and video playback purposes. On the other hand, in terms of the device's new physical design, it was said that Microsoft would be ditching the troublesome hinge featured on the first generation Surface Book. The said hinge was supposed to be what would enable to device to transform from being a laptop to a tablet with full Windows 10 capabilities. However, it became one of the most criticized aspects due to the gap that the hinge leaves on the device when it is folded. It has allowed for dust and dirt to enter the device when it is stored, not to mention that some users have found the gap to be unpleasant looking, if not ugly. This would be changed, according to reports, to something called the Dynamic-Fulcrum hinge. While no word was given as to how this new design might look like, it was promised that Microsoft would be reinventing the hinge system of the Surface Book 2 and will look for more ways to improve on it.

Last year the focus was on the new Skylake microarchitecture, and this year we have down on our list a number of 3D XPoint and Xeon Phi discussions and announcements. One of the first to contact us with their IDF news was ASRock Rack, the server arm of ASRock, about their high-density Xeon Phi solution. Overview of Xeon Phi X200, Knights Landing The Xeon Phi many-core platform is transitioning from an add-in card to stand-alone processor, with the latest Knights Landing generation offering up to 72 high performance cores (now a couple of generations away from a pure Atom core) with combined high-bandwidth MCDRAM and the potential for Intel Omnipath support directly on the package. We covered the discussion and launch of Knights Landing last year at Supercomputing15, and saw some preview customer systems at Computex a couple of months ago, however the mix of ISC16 and IDF16 has most of the enterprise consumer-focused system releases surrounding Knights Landing. For a segment of Xeon Phi customers, density is important. Pack ‘em, rack ‘em and stack ‘em is the end goal, and the 2U4N-F/X200 aims to do just that. The 2U server uses half-width modules to fit in four separate systems in the chassis, each with an X200 Xeon Phi CPU, six DIMM slots with support for DDR4 2400/2133 RDIMM/LRDIMM, four 2.5-inch storage slots (either 4xSATA/SAS or 2xNVMe+2xSATA/SAS), two PCIe 3. X2 slots, one M.2 slot, a combination 1600W 80 PLUS Platinum redundant (1+1) power supply for the four nodes, two GbE Intel i350 network ports and integrated IPMI 2.0 (via AST2400) with KVM and a dedicated LAN port. P1 Socket for Xeon Phi, seen at Supercomputing15 Xeon Phi uses Intel’s P1 socket, which we saw back at Supercomputing15 and has been characterised in recent media as the LGA-3647 socket. At this point in time, Intel has only confirmed this socket for Xeon Phi use, and other use cases are not yet verified. ASRock Rack states that their platform on show at IDF16 this week will support all the main Xeon Phi X200 CPUs, and they have support in the works for Omni-path associated SKUs. Professional users interested in ASRock’s high-density platform will have to get in contact with their regional branch for more information and pricing.

Reply p1esk - Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - link Actually, it seems like the Asrock link has been corrected, now it says there are two GLAN ports, which I assume mean 1GbE. However, and more importantly, these processors support Intel Omni-Path networking technology, and the link mentions QSFP 28 connectors for 100GbE networking. I don't see any QSFP connectors anywhere in the pictures though. Reply Shadowmaster625 - Monday, August 15, 2016 - link Everyone knows its "pack ‘em, stack ‘em and then rack ‘em" Reply Mr Perfect - Monday, August 15, 2016 - link I'm not at all surprised that this has a VGA port on it for compatibility with existing infrastructure, but can't they offer a modern port too? It seems that we're stuck in a loop where all the consumers are using VGA because there's nothing else available, and manufacturers are only offering VGA because that's what all the consumers are using.

An example is Boston's new Venom workstation, the 2501-0P, which sports the latest Xeon E5-2600 v4 processors along with faster 2,400MHz DDR4 RAM. But that's not its only claim to fame, and there's a lot more under the hood to make workstation buyers sit up and take notice of what the 2501-0P has to offer. Thinking inside the box Often given scant attention by prospective purchasers, the chassis housing this particular Venom is surprisingly compact for a workstation -- particularly a dual-socket one. More than that, a good deal of thought has gone into the design to make it both look the part and take best advantage of what the new Xeon processors have to offer, especially through the use of liquid cooling technology. Clocked at up to 3GHz and with a TDP as high as 160 watts per processor, the v4 Xeons can get really hot, so instead of passive heatsinks, closed-loop CoolIT ECO III technology is employed with a radiator and a pair of large-diameter fans to push unwanted heat out of the top of the chassis. This, in turn, features a magnetically attached mesh cover for ease of cleaning, with another pop-out filter grill at the front of the tower servicing the needs of two more fans positioned to direct cooling airflow through the storage bays. Closed-loop liquid cooling keeps the Venom 2501-OP's powerful Xeon processors at a comfortable temperature. Image: Alan Stevens/ZDNet There's lots of room here, with bays for six 3.5-inch and four 2.5-inch drives plus a couple of external bays, one of which holds a Blu-Ray rewriter. You get a 1000-Watt power supply to cope with all this, complete with modular cabling to help keep it neat and tidy. The end result is a well-configured workstation that keeps its cool without being unduly noisy, generating little more than an industrious 'hum' most of the time. Performance to go Based around a stock Supermicro motherboard and Intel C612 chipset, any of the new v4 Xeons can be specified. Our review system featured a couple of E5-2690 v4 chips. Sporting 14 cores (28 threads) each, this 2.6-3.5GHz processor has a TDP of 135W and is a good choice for both demanding analytic and graphical workloads. Buyers on a budget can save money by opting for one of the more modest SKUs, while those after the ultimate in performance can splash out to get more cores and threads with 22/44 available on the 2.2-3.6GHz E5-2699 v4, for example. Another option would be a higher clock speed by opting for the 3.0-3.5GHz E5-2687W v4, although this only has 12 cores and can hit 160W and, on balance, may not deliver the same level of performance of slower-clocked alternatives. Top ZDNET Reviews Dell Latitude 11 5000 7.9 Apple iPhone 7 Plus 9.3 Amazon Echo 9.0 Google Pixel XL Phone 8.0 Eight DIMM slots to take up to a terabyte of 2,400MHz DDR4 RAM are provided and, filled with 16GB ECC modules, gave us a more than decent 128GB. Together with the 28 cores and 56 threads in the Xeons, this enabled the Venom 2501-0P to turn in some impressive benchmark figures, including a score of 68733 for the 64-bit Geekbench 3 suite -- the highest we've seen for a workstation to date: Two E5-2690 v4 Xeon processors helped the Venom 2501-0P post an impressive Geekbench 3 result. Image: Alan Stevens/ZDNet Of course, fast processors by themselves are of limited value unless the other components are able to keep pace. The graphics subsystem is particularly important here, and with no CPU-integrated graphics controller a plug-in GPU card is required. Boston uses an Nvidia Quadro M4000 as the default offering on the Venom 2501-0P. Graphics are handled by an Nvidia Quadro M4000 card. Image: Alan Stevens/ZDNet A mid-range GPU designed specifically for workstation applications, this graphics card has 1664 CUDA processing cores and 8GB of GDDR5 memory. It also features four DisplayPort interfaces each able to handle a 4K display (4,096x2,160 at 60Hz with 30-bit colour) and, again, performed well in our benchmarks. Running Cinebench R15, for example, it enabled the Venom 2501-0P to achieve just under 160fps (frames per second) when running the OpenGL benchmark. The mid-range Nvidia Quadro 4000 helped the Venom 2501-OP to an impressive score on the Cinebench R15 OpenGL test. Image: Alan Stevens/ZDNet A good choice for a wide range of CAD/CAM and other graphically intensive applications, more demanding buyers can opt for even better productivity by upgrading to Nvidia's latest ultra-quick Quadro M6000. A 2-slot card, this comes with 3,084 CUDA processing cores and either 12GB or 24GB of GDDR5 memory, making for a real beast of a GPU that can really accelerate video processing. However, it's a far from a free ride, the Quadro 6000 bumping the Venom 2501-0P's price up by a massive £3,000 (ex. VAT). Capacity and speed Boston has also opted for a slightly different approach to the storage inside its new Venom. For large amounts of data the usual hard disks are employed, the default configuration being two 2TB SATA drives cabled to the on-board controller and configured as a mirrored pair (RAID 1). The boot drive, however, is a flash SSD, which is fast becoming a standard option these days. On the Venom it's not an ordinary SSD interfaced using the on-board SATA controller, but an NVMe (Non Volatile Memory express) drive that plugs into a PCIe slot for much faster communication with the processors using four lanes of the PCI Express 3.0 bus. Intel's NVMe-based SSD 750. Image: Alan Stevens/ZDNet Predicted to, ultimately, supersede SATA and SAS altogether, NVMe drives are only just starting to hit the mainstream and, as with any new technology, carry a price premium. As such Boston has opted for a relatively modest 400GB Intel SSD 750 for the Venom, the idea being that it will be used primarily for the operating system and high-performance temporary storage of drawings, models and other work in progress. Because it uses four PCIe lanes, the NVMe drive is rated as up to four times as quick as the equivalent SATA SSD; in our tests it really sparked up the performance of this Venom workstation. Other features worth noting include two GbE network interfaces for LAN connectivity, six USB 3.0 ports and built-in RealTek audio as standard. Together these add the final finishing touches to what in our tests proved itself to be a well-configured yet compact workstation. Capable of handling a wide range of applications, from CAD/CAM and digital content editing to high-end data analytics and visualisation, the Boston Venom 2501-0P has all the right features and high performance technologies needed to make the most of the latest Xeon v4 processors.

peteris.rocks Blog About My Dell XPS 15 Review My review of Dell XPS 15 9550 (2016) FHD 1080p Last updated on August 16, 2016 #1 on Hacker News for an hour on August 15, 2016 I treated myself to a Dell XPS 15 9550. I got it when my previous laptop had an issue with the screen after 2.5 years of use. This is my experience with Dell XPS 15 after one month of daily use. Specs Requirements Design & build Display Battery Keyboard & touchpad Summary What I like What I don't like Alternatives Conclusion Specs Intel Core i7-6700HQ 6th gen Skylake at 2.6 GHz, up to 3.5 GHz with 6 MB cache 16 GB RAM (2x8GB) 2133MHz DDR4 512 GB SSD PCIe NVME M.2 by Toshiba NVIDIA GeForce 960M 2 GB DDR5 15.6" 1080p (1920x1080 aka Full HD/FHD) matte (anti-glare) display, non touch 84W 6-Cell Lithium-Ion battery, lasts ~6-8 hours backlit UK keyboard, 1.3mm travel, no numpad, no Home/End/PgUp/PgDown keys Weight: 2 kg (4.4 lbs) USB 3.0 (2x), Thunderbolt (1x), SD card reader (SD, SDHC, SDXC), lock slot, HDMI Mini, headphone 3.5mm jack You can also pay a bit extra and get a model with 32 GB RAM and 1 TB SSD. Requirements I am a software developer and use virtual machines extensively. This is why I wanted an i7, that extra RAM and an SSD was a must. I don't play games but I've gotten into video editing and this is the reason I needed a dedicated graphics card. I also like to train some neural networks for educational purposes, so I was looking for NVIDIA graphics cards with CUDA support. Paying extra and getting a laptop with a 1080p three years ago was a very good decision. I still believe having a good screen with a high resolution is even more important than the choice of the CPU. None of my laptops have ever lasted more than 3 hours on battery power, so I finally wanted one with a good battery life. Finally, my last laptop had a good design and that's what I wanted this time as well. It had to look somewhat professional in a business setting and hopefully not like a gaming laptop. Design & build Dell XPS Infinity Edge looks very, very good. No complaints there. It is also lightweight about 2 kg. It's amazing how much power you can squeeze into such a small form factor. Imagine describing this laptop and what it can do to someone 30 years ago. This laptop has a 15.6" display but thanks to the very thin bezels, its size is more like that of a 14" laptop. The laptop is also quiet (fans are not spinning) most of the time when I'm surfing the web, watching videos and doing web programming or even light compiling. One thing that I did not expect and am very annoyed about is coil whine. It's there and I can hear it when the fans are not spinning and it's quiet in the room. Disabling Intel Skylake power saving states in BIOS seemed to reduce it somewhat but it was still there. This laptop attracts your oily fingerprints like crazy. The lid is acceptable but the carbon fiber palm rest and the touchpad can look ridiculous in day light. The screen also attracts dust but not much more than other laptops that I've had. I've gotten small, barely noticeable scratches on the sides of the laptop (mostly near the USB ports) during one month of daily use. When I shake the laptop lightly with care, I can hear something move inside the laptop. Coupled with the problems I've noticed and the fact that many other people have sent their units to be replaced, this laptop does not feel reliable to me. Display Dell XPS 15 offers a choice between a 1080p and 4k display. I got a model with a 1080p display for two primary & one less important reason: the screen was matte (anti-glare) battery lasts longer no problems with scaling While the 4k screen seems to be fantastic (excellent color accuracy, touch screen, 4k resolution), I am very happy with my choice. While the better color accuracy would have been useful, it is not that important to me yet. The touch screen is nice but I can live without it. I also don't have a use for the 4k resolution and am happy to avoid problems that come with scaling in Windows. The biggest win for me, however, was the increased battery life over 4k (reportedly extra 2-3 hours) and the anti-glare screen which I am used to. There are a few problems with the screen, however. First, the screen will noticeably flicker on white background when the brightness is less than 30%. I guess this was expected (I saw it mentioned in an online review when I noticed it). What was not expected was electric buzzing sounds caused by Intel Graphics drivers when the screen is redrawn e.g. when scrolling websites. Apparently, when you uninstall the drivers the buzzing goes away. Intel has released a new version of their drivers which makes the buzzing slightly less noticeable but it is still there. If you are in a room all alone and there is no noise and the fans are not spinning, you can hear this buzzing, other than that it is not too obvious but it's still there. I changed the color profile to the one provided by notebookcheck.net because there seemed to be something wrong with the default profile. Battery It feels great not having to take a charger with me when I go out to work (10 AM - 6 PM with a lunch break inbetween) and still having some juice left (unless I'm doing something very CPU heavy). I would say that I get about 6-8 hours of battery life. It'd be 8 hours if I just surf the web, some light document processing and not much more. Charging is fast and you can even configure it in the BIOS to have faster charging (it gets to something like 60% quick and then it's slower) but sacrifice battery longevity or just have a sensible tradeoff which is the default. The charger is very slim. It's got a nice design and it is also light. There's a light on the power cable when it's plugged in which is kind of nice which saves time when looking for it. One downside is that I'd say the light is a little too bright so I sometimes put a small napkin over it if I'm charging it at night in the same room I'm sleeping. Another minor quirk is that if you are charging the laptop while it's on, the fans will not be quiet even if there's no load on the computer. What I don't like about this laptop is that there is no indicator light that it's turned on when the lid is closed. Normally you would never need such a light, but the problem is that this laptop can wake up randomly and if it's in your bag it can overheat. And there is no way to tell if it's on. At one point I could not suspend it, it would resume automatically in 5 seconds or immediately restart when I tried to shut it down. What helped me was to hold the power button for 10 seconds and that seemed to help. It hasn't occurred again since then. As for preventing it in the future, I configured Windows 10 to never wake up automatically (disabled updates, scheduler tasks, modified battery saver plans, etc.). When the laptop is turned on, plugged in and charging three white lights are on (power button, charger cable and on the side of the laptop in front of the touch pad). Keyboard & touchpad The keyboard is not good. It's not bad but it's not good. Lots of people in their reviews have said that they would not write a book on this keyboard. Even though there is space, there are no Home/End keys and the arrow keys are tiny. I have remapped the PrtScr key to Home and the Insert key to Delete. But these keys are very far from the arrow keys which is not good for writing and editing code. One month in and I, like many others, have a squeaky spacebar key. Very annoying since I press it all the time. I've gotten some dirty looks because of it in the silent room at the library. The touch pad is very nice. Apparently, it's one of the nicest other people have used but to me it seems good just like many other track pads. Summary There were many problems that I noticed with this laptop initially, problems that should not exist when you pay this much for a laptop. As a result, while the laptop is fantastic, it does not feel reliable at all. I am worried it will not last long. I do hope I am wrong though. What I like screen touchpad design light weight powerful specs battery life charging time charger size light on charger speakers are ok quiet What I don't like spacebar squeaks coil whine screen redraw buzzing screen flicker at < 30% brightness random wake up no indicator if it's on when the lid is closed fans are spinning when charging no home/end keys tiny arrow keys keyboard is not good attracts fingerprints like crazy & also dust not super easy to open does not feel reliable Alternatives These are the alternatives that I considered. MSI GS60 Ghost Pro - gaming laptop, better graphics, worse battery, nice keyboard Asus ROG G501VW - good alternative but gaming laptop Asus Zenbook Pro UX501VW - bad touchpad positioning, no 16 GB RAM Lenovo Ideapad Y700 - cheaper but bulkier Dell XPS 15 won because it looked so damn nice. Conclusion I can't in my good conscience recommend this laptop because of the coil whine, buzzing and spacebar squeak. The laptop also does not feel reliable. If you do decide to get one, I suggest having a backup laptop ready just in case. When these kinks are fixed and they use the next generation NVIDIA graphics card, then I would recommend it with no hesitation. Other than that, it's a good laptop and ignoring these quirks and if you get a good unit it is a good looking and powerful laptop to have.

The latest Intel diversity report would appear to follow the trend of similar reports from many companies in Silicon Valley and elsewhere, with an increase in the number of women and minorities in employment, but not as big an increase as would have been hoped. This is despite the company’s figures showing that, since December 2014, the percentage of staff being hired from diverse backgrounds – including women and ethnic minorities – has increased by 11.5pc. At the beginning of 2015, Intel announced that it was taking the obvious lack of diversity within the tech sector seriously. with a new $300m fund, with the company’s CEO, Brian Krzanich, describing it as a “bold statement”. However, its overall representation of women among its US staff has increased by only 0.6pc in the past year, while the number of women in its newest recruits has actually fallen by 0.1pc on 2015. The biggest percentage rise among women employees within Intel has been among its senior staff, with a rise of 1.7pc. Retention proving difficult Better results have been found among what the company calls underrepresented minorities (URM) as, since December 2014, the number of URM staff hired has increased by 4.1pc. Yet in a similar trend to the number of women hired, URM recruitment among graduates and younger people has fallen by 0.4pc on last year. Also, the figure for its overall URM representation has fallen by 0.1pc on last year, but has returned to the same level as December 2014. When breaking down what URMs are being hired by Intel, it appears that, despite greater numbers of staff being hired from the Hispanic community – growing from 7.4pc of hires to 8.1pc – the percentage of Hispanic people working in the company has dropped by 0.4pc on 2015. While it is certainly not easy to turn around years of company culture, Intel has revealed that there is now 99pc pay equity for URMs, while in 2015, the company said that it had achieved pay equity between men and women.

Krzanich unveiled the early prototype version of the headset while on stage and showed off a demo of how the headset would work in "merged reality," where users manipulate real-world objects with their hands. Krzanich touted this kind of VR application as the future of communication, entertainment and work. Essentially, users could put the headset on and operate within a virtual reality universe while still being able to use their hands to do other tasks. "We believe the capability of Alloy and what it introduces is significant," Krzanich said. "It gives the opportunity to merge the physical and virtual world together." The headset uses built-in RealSense cameras, also developed by Intel, so that they can use their hands within the virtual reality space to do a variety of activities. In the demo, the presenter was able to bend his fingers so he could pull levers and use real world objects to accomplish certain actions in VR. Right now, the two VR headsets available to consumers right now (Oculus and Vive) use wires that connect to a PC as well as controllers. Krzanich said that wires limit the users' ability to enjoy VR outside of the computer space and that desire to be more mobile lead to the development of Project Alloy. Intel is looking for partners to work with, but said that won't be until late 2017 when the headset and technology are further developed. The company also didn't set a price for the headset or the chip technology, which it is also willing to sell to partners and other developers within the VR industry.

Share (0) facebook twitter googleplus linkedin Transcript Announced the latest [UNKNOWN] in that family. I'm pleased to announce to you today Joule, the newest in highest performance maker platform Intel has made. This platform combines powerful computer vision, a vast hardware and software ecosystem Choice of operating systems and a complete suite of software tools. Joule will seamlessly transition from prototype to scale. Whether you're innovating in robotics, machine visioning, intelligent gateways, almost any application can be done best with Joule. And I'd like to invite Diana on stage to show you just want Jewel can do with our demo here. Hey, Diana. Hey Brian, how you doing? So this isn't quite as big as Jeff's jet engine, but I'm getting closer, so what do you have here for us? All right, well after all that high tech you've been showing, I'd like to talk about safety glasses. But not just any safety glasses, these are from Pivot Head and they contain an integrated high quality camera. We've augmented their solution with Intel Jewel and Airbox is experimenting with this platform for their Future Factory project. With the Advanced Computer Vision capabilities, we're able to provide realtime feedback to factory workers as they go about their tasks. An Intel Jules, small sized, and more power envelop make this light weight device that can easily wear all day. And we're doing a computation right on Intel Jules so there's no need for additional connectivity. So an example and why I brought this little plane segment here, Brian I know your expertise with drones is well known but I think maybe it's been a while since you've tried to construct a full fledged aircraft? Luckily nobody's riding in the jumbo jet I built. So there's no worries there. All right. I'll save comment on that but tens of thousands of bolts. Many different sizes, shapes, colors, materials. You want to make sure the right bolt is in the right location. So you can do a quality [INAUDIBLE] at the end of final assembly. Another alterative might be to take something that the workers are wearing already, the safety glasses because they're for safety, and actually do a bolt verification in real time as they're going through their tasks. We take a look? Sure. Now this is meant to be an audio input to you, correct? Correct, yes. So you can see When I put the glasses on here and then we'll putting video up on the screen. But this is just so you can see what I'm seeing. Or you can see what the glasses are seeing. The workers themselves they're not seeing any video they're just going through their normal job wearing their safety glasses, doing the various bolt insertions. You can see we're scanning the patterns here. So the glasses are continuously scanning looking for any potential bolt mismatches, but the workers are just doing their job as usual. They don't have to do anything different. The glasses will keep an eye on things and if the glasses see that there are any potential bolt mismatches, they will alert. Error in positions one and two. Like that, they will alert me with an audio notification just letting me know. So, I'm not changing anything. I'm just getting alerts to warn me that there might be a mismatch. And it will also give me the option to have a remote call, voice over IP call with a remote expert who can actually see what I'm seeing and provide additional guidance if necessary. So very straight forward doesn't really change the worker's jobs but just helps them ensure 100% accuracy on the bolts So you think about the efficiency right, real time tracking of work projects like this and 100% tracking. Every bolt inspected, basically. I like that in a plane. Yeah, basically that'll give me a lot more confidence in the next jet I fly in as a result. Thank you very much for showing us this morning, Dara. Thank you, Brian.

Share (0) facebook twitter googleplus linkedin Transcript And our vision of virtual reality, this whole mixed reality world, is really aligning quite nicely with Microsoft. So we decided to make this groundbreaking partnership and talk about that this morning. I'd like to have Craig show us a little bit of what the Broadwell E system is really capable of doing and editing a virtual reality world. Hi Craig. Hi Brian. I'm over here. Brian, hi. Sorry about that. In the world again, you know? [INAUDIBLE] But yeah. So let's show this amazing performance that we have on our newest extreme ten core processor. And to do that, I wanted to show off a brand new piece of software from Epic which is an unreal game engine editor. And so, you have all the tools in the unreal engine, but the change that we have in new as a free release is that it's completely editable within VR. So let's go ahead and take a look at what that looks like here. And wow, I'm in the middle of a VR enabled world. So as I'm editing my little room here I can go ahead and have all the tools To be able to get around, add assets, like if I wanna go ahead and put a chair down here, I can go ahead and do that. I can go ahead and easily change colors and textures. And as a matter of fact, I can even delete things and move them around. So as a developer this gives me a really unique experience that I don't have to go ahead and guess on what my users are gonna be seeing. I can develop in 1st person the same perspective that my users are gonna be using this sort of content. So, it looks like I have my room the way that I want it. However, what I really wanna do is rebake the lighting to finalize the scene. So, as I've removed some things over here I'm actually seeing this shadows and everything. So, I can change Back and see the whole dynamic lighting for the scene. But this is really CPU intensive, so we're actually doing a complete light render on all of the changes that we just did. So as a developer, we're really showing how this performance is gonna help you get to time to market and finish your projects. And to illustrate that point, over here, I have a sixth-generation core 6700K, our latest and greatest. Quadcore and I'm gonna go ahead and I have them in identical spot here and same objects to the scene. Now I'm just gonna go ahead and remake the lighting here in both. So, I'll start the 6700 here first. Okay, and now I'll move over to our Bradwell. And as this guy starts making our scene here I'm gonna bring up the progress bar so we can see the progress as it goes through. And just like that 20, 50, 60 done. So- I almost made it to 10%. Yeah, You're gonna take a little while on that one. So, we're looking at way over two x and this just a small sample size. So, in core count alone we're really seeing a huge improvement that's only gonna increase to delta as we add more and more items To our virtual world. But here's the best part, this is just one feature in re-baking the lighting and re-rendering it. And we're talking about something a developer does 30 to 50 times a day. So, if you wanna talk about a development cycle for your standard game, Brian, that's weeks possibly months of time that we can save in just CPU cut down by using our ten processors. So, For you media creationists out there, our newest extreme 10-core processor is the processor for you for VR, and beyond.

Facebook Twitter Google RSS Cloud Mobile Social Big Data Bleeding Edge Columns Get McAfee’d Dr. Bitcoin smartworld Future Data City of Paradigm Masthead Send Us a News Tip Select Page Intel plunges deeper into virtual reality, Internet of Things at IDF by Robert Hof | Aug 16, 2016 | 0 comments After mostly missing the last technology wave — mobile computing — Intel Corp. today charged full-bore into what it views as the next big tech markets: virtual reality and the Internet of Things. In a marquee announcement, the chipmaker announced a self-contained virtual-reality headset called Project Alloy to kick off its Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco, its annual three-day conference for software and hardware developers and other partners. In addition, Intel said it’s working with Microsoft Corp. to make holographic interfaces using Intel technologies available on Windows 10 personal computers next year. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich (pictured above), pitched Intel’s version of VR that is intended to blend the virtual world and the real world, or more specifically VR and AR, or augmented reality. “We’re driving toward a “merged reality,” he said as he announced that Intel is building a new production studio in Los Angeles using the technology. “We believe it’s a game changer for virtual reality.” In particular, Project Alloy, which is intended as a prototype that other companies would manufacture, will allow for headsets that allow for six degrees of mobility. That means much more freedom to move around in virtual spaces with a better awareness of the real world without external sensors for guidance — which would avoid, for instance, as one Intel staffer demonstrating it onstage put it, “injuring the CEO of a Fortune 500 company.” Alloy headsets also will use cameras with Intel’s RealSense motion and depth sensing technology to allow for more accurate position tracking. In addition, Alloy will enable more natural manipulation of objects in virtual environments using only one’s hands rather than separate controllers. Intel demonstrated how the headset will show one’s hands as well as the image of another real person in the room, though both examples looked like works in progress (photo below). Not least, the headset won’t have to be tethered to a PC like Facebook’s admittedly more powerful Oculus Rift. Intel plans to make the technology freely available via open source next year. Krzanich, whose company is under pressure to find new growth markets as sales of PCs using its iconic microprocessors have declined, also signaled a broader foray into the Internet of Things. He unveiled Joule, a high-end computing platform on a small circuit board that Intel says will deliver “human-like senses” to any number of smart devices. Joule enables developers to create and run a new generation of IoT devices, ranging from a robot that can converse with people to a smart motorcycle helmet with head-up Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) capability to industrial sensor devices from General Electric. GE Chief Executive Jeffrey R. Immelt took the stage to announce his company is working with Intel on a number of fronts, including a “smart” light pole that can collect data on pedestrian movements to manage traffic flows or data on changes in parking spaces. “Industrial productivity has declined of late,” he said. “Old IT tools are not really doing it later. We need to do better.” Intel also announced Project Aero, a platform for developing drones that can use RealSense cameras. And Elmar Frickenstein, senior vice president and head of BMW’s Autonomous Driving Program, was driven onto the stage by an autonomous car to demonstrate the need for what he said was an in-car “supercomputer” powered by high-end Intel-powered chips. Finally, Krzanich trotted out the 2014 winners of its America’s Greatest Makers show to demonstrate a smart toothbrush called Grush that will be out later this year. A boy brushed with it while a game-like screen (shown below) showed which teeth were getting brushed as a way to ensure proper technique. Screen showing real-time brushing using Grush smart toothbrush. “Together we’re going to introduce some of the greatest changes in technology in a long time,” Krzanich, who has been Intel’s CEO since mid-2013, told the audience of some 6,000 developers. Intel’s continuing focus on VR and the Internet of Things, which has been underway for at least a couple of years, reflects the multi-pronged push by Intel to make its chips more relevant in a fast-changing market for computers and other devices. VR systems and autonomous cars both demand powerful processors, Intel’s traditional strength. At the same time, Internet of Things applications such as wearables, robots and industrial sensors require not only untold numbers of chips that only a few chipmakers have the capacity to build, but also access to cloud computing powered by massive data centers also powered chiefly today by Intel processors. RELATED:  Nokia enhances the VR broadcast ecosystem with OZO Live and the OZO Player SDK Despite the keynote’s focus on flashy new technologies, Krzanich notably spent more time than he has in recent year’s events on how the PC, and in particular Intel processors, remain at the center of the future of technology. “A powerful microprocessor remains an essential component of innovation,” he said while previewing the seventh-generation four-processor-core chips that will be out in PCs late this year. “PCs are still the biggest revenue and profit driver for Intel,” said Patrick Moorhead, president of Moor Insights & Strategy. “The keynote was an authentic representation of what Intel is and where it wants to be.” Nonetheless, many of the newer technologies will take years to go mainstream. In the meantime, Intel must contend with declining PC sales — 5 percent in the second quarter, according to Gartner Inc. Although that’s a slower decline than in recent quarters, Intel’s recently reported second-quarter sales rose only 3 percent from a year ago, to $13.5 billion, causing its shares to swoon. And that came three months after Intel announced plans to cut 12,000 employees, or 11 percent of its staff. Lately, Intel has been focusing more on selling processors for servers in data centers and private and to public cloud computing providers, as well as chips for mobile devices and sensor networks for the developing Internet of Things market. But the growth of those markets also fell short of expectations in the most recent quarter. Intel largely missed the boat on chips for mobile devices to those made using ARM Holdings  technology as well as chips from Qualcomm. In fact, today Intel essentially conceded as much by announcing a deal with ARM to allow its customers to make ARM chips using a new production process in Intel factories next year. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich helps demonstrate the Project Alloy VR headset, showing the wearer’s own hands on the screen at right. Last week, Intel also sought to shore up its chips aimed at machine learning, a fast-growing branch of artificial intelligence that’s driving advances in speech and image recognition, with the acquisition of Nervana Systems Inc. Not least, Intel has bet on a new memory chip, due out later this year in partnership with Micron Technology Inc., that is much denser and faster than current technology allows. Making any of those bets pay off will be challenging — especially with another fundamental shift looming. Moore’s Law, an observation by Intel cofounder Gordon Moore that the speed of chips doubles every couple of years for the same price, is getting forcibly changed by Intel and others. Intel has signaled that it’s slowing the pace of performance gains in favor of chips that don’t use as much power–a quality key for both small devices like smartphones and other mobile devices but also for data centers crammed with hundreds or thousands of power-hungry servers. Krzanich spent little time on its data center and cloud initiatives, apparently leaving that to Wednesday’s morning keynote featuring Diane Bryant, Intel’s executive vice president and general manager of its data center group. But he did speak to the necessity of powerful back-end data centers and cloud computing to handle rapidly escalating amounts of data. By 2020, he said, the 1.5 gigabytes a day that average Internet users will create will be dwarfed by the 4,000 GB a day that each autonomous vehicle creates or the 1 million GB smart factories will deal with. All that data, he said, will require a coordinated system from edge devices to cloud computing to bring under control and use. Jean Bozman, principal analyst at Hurwitz & Associates, said it was important that Intel acknowledged the importance of this “end to end” system.

Vetr Crowd Thinks AMD Is Running Hot Oppenheimer & Co.bullish on valuations at Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet, Netflix (Seeking Alpha) Members of Rage Against the Machine, Public Enemy and Cypress Hill (Tom Morello, Brad Wilk, Chuck D, DJ Lord and B-Real) formed a supergroup called Prophets of Rage. After much anticipation, the "elite task force of revolutionary musicians determined to confront this mountain of election year bullshit” finally announced the date (August 26) for its debut EP, "The Party's Over." The five-track EP will be available for pre-order one week before its launch, and a couple of tracks will be released via Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) Music's Beats 1 radio station on August 18 and August 25. Related Link: Dr. Dre, Music Icon And Entrepreneur, Hits 15 Million Record Sales Benzinga took a look into the popularity of the groups the musicians integrated prior to Prophets of Rage. Album Sales Rage Against the Machine has sold more than 16 million records worldwide. Cypress Hill was the first Latino American hip hop group to get a platinum record, and has sold more than 18 million albums worldwide. Public Enemy, which became just the fourth hip-hop group to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hallf Of Fame, has three platinum albums to its name. YouTube Views If YouTube can be used as an indicator or proxy of a band's popularity, we can certainly conclude all three bands are widely followed. Cypress Hill's most viewed video, "Insane In The Brain," boasts more than 45.66 million visits, and its top three videos total more than 110 million. For Public Enemy, the view count reaches 8.64 million and 7.79 million for its two most popular tracks. Rage Against The Machine has 42.33 million views for its top video, "Killing In The Name," and another 19.11 million for a live version of the song. Given the popularity of these artists, one can only expect great things from Prophets of Rage. Brace yourselves for some confrontational, politically-charged music.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter Intel, which gets the majority of its revenue from making personal-computer processors, has failed to gain ground in the larger and faster-growing phone market -- the stronghold of ARM’s technology. Under Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich, Intel is trying to persuade other chipmakers to use its factories for their production. Adding licenses for ARM’s technology could open up that business to fabricating chips based on those designs for companies such as Qualcomm Inc. and Apple Inc., which now have their chips produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and others. Intel’s embrace of the competing technology comes as the PC market continues to decline and growth in the lucrative server-chip market slows. The Santa Clara, California-based company began offering foundry services -- outsourced manufacturing -- under Krzanich’s predecessor, Paul Otellini, but hadn’t announced any major customers placing orders in large volume. Indicating that those fortunes may be changing, Intel announced that LG Electronics Inc., South Korea’s second-biggest phone maker behind Samsung Electronics Co., will use Intel’s foundry business to manufacture 10 nanometer mobile-phone parts. Separately, Intel said it won’t use extreme ultraviolet lithography as a manufacturing technique in its 10-nanometer production. The technology isn’t ready for the next generation of production, 7 nanometer, Intel also said, and the company won’t use the chipmaking technique until it delivers the promised efficiency. ASML Holding NV is the main manufacturer of EUV machinery and has been trying to make it ready for full use for more than a decade. ASML’s stock fell as much as 3.5 percent in U.S. trading Tuesday following the comments by Mark Bohr, Intel’s head of process architecture. “I can’t say whether it’s a year from now or three years from now,” Bohr said of the technique at the Intel conference. “I am hopeful.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The idea is futuristic — ditching the screen and projecting Windows 10 onto your walls and furniture — but it wasn’t clear how long it would actually take for it to become reality. At the 2016 Intel Developer Forum, Terry Myerson announced that Windows Holographic will become part of the desktop platform next year. That means any Windows 10 PC will be able to hook up to a HoloLens — or, in theory, other devices that support Windows Holographic — and immediately work. That’s an important step forward. While the HoloLens is currently available, it’s very much a development kit. Users must install specific software to make it work, and apps aren’t easy to come by. Windows Holographic will change that. Related: Israel using Microsoft’s HoloLens to help soldiers on battlefield, train personnel Like VR headsets, Windows Holographic will require a PC with a certain amount of heft to run correctly. Intel and Microsoft will work together to develop a standard set of system requirements, so users know whether they can take part in the fun. They did show the Skull Canyon NUC as an example of a compatible computer, so devices without a dedicated graphics chip may not be left out in the cold (which makes sense, given Intel’s love of its own integrated graphics hardware). The final specifications of the standard will be announced in December of 2016. You won’t have to wait long to find out more about Windows Holographic. Development kits have been in engineers’ hands for months now, and a mid-2017 release means Insiders may put hands on it before the end of the year. Microsoft already announced the HTC Vive as a supported device, thanks to the 720p webcam in the front. We have one in the Digital Trends office, so expect a hands-on with the next generation of operating systems as soon as it’s available.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Windows Holographic, Microsoft’s cross-platform software for VR/AR headsets and PCs, will arrive on Windows 10 computers starting next year. The company announced the news on Tuesday at the Intel Developer Forum while revealing a few new details about the ambitious project. Windows Holographic experience available for mainstream #Windows10 PCs next year: https://t.co/zZLapEkYishttps://t.co/mz7lGNk5hK — Windows (@Windows) August 16, 2016 Microsoft says it plans to release a Windows 10 update that adds the Windows Holographic shell to “mainstream” Windows 10 PCs. The update will make it possible to multitask by running 2D and 3D style apps at the same time. The company also promises six degrees of freedom in virtual space, which should cover the full range of three-dimensional motion. Intel and Microsoft are working together to establish the spec requirements for PCs and head mounted displays to support Windows Holographic. The companies also revealed that the software can run on a relatively cheap and small Intel computer at 90 frames per second. We still don’t know the exact requirements, but Microsoft says it plans to release a v1 spec in December. Windows Holographic could help bridge the gap between various VR and AR devices, making it possible to communicate in virtual space whether you’re using an Oculus Rift a HoloLens or something else entirely. It still seems like a pretty far-out concept, but it looks like we’ll see Windows Holographic in action within the next year or so.

Separately, Microsoft Corp. is going to update its Windows 10 software with Windows Holographic capabilities to help move VR more into the mainstream, according to Microsoft Executive Vice President Terry Myerson, who spoke at the Intel conference. Krzanich is trying to get his company’s products into new markets to make up for the personal computer industry’s slump. Intel still gets the majority of its revenue from that market, which is on course to end this year 100 million units smaller than its peak in 2011. It’s also been missing targets in the lucrative server chip business, which had been propping up the chipmaker’s earnings. Like many other chip company chief executives, Krzanich said he’s focusing on the growing market for adding computing to everyday devices, called the Internet of Things. Though that unit has grown, it still only accounts for about 4 percent of the company’s total sales. Krzanich showed off new chips and computer boards and sensors aimed at firing up that business. One will provide the computing and communications guts of drones, making it easier for designers of autonomous versions of the small aircraft to quickly build consumer and industrial products. For those that don’t want to do the building themselves, Intel will offer a complete drone kit. The Intel CEO also spoke with an executive from BMW AG, about the need for increasing computing within cars as they progress toward full autonomy. The German automaker has partnered with Intel to try to develop industry-standard parts that will speed up progress toward that goal.

The “shell” will allow users to enjoy Windows 10 on a virtual reality headset such as the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. Basically, you will be able to enjoy the full power of Windows 10 right on your virtual reality headset, and use some of the main features in Windows 10 such as Universal Windows Apps on their VR headsets. Microsoft is yet to announce when exactly the feature will be available for Windows 10 PCs, but we will let you know once it’s available. For those wondering, Microsoft stated that the new shell will be available to all Windows 10 PCs. Some links in the article may not be viewable as you are using an AdBlocker.

Microsoft, Apple, Intel and Salesforce have joined the likes of Walmart and Unilever in ponying up hundreds of millions — or even billions — to buy technology companies in recent months in what can only be described as a feeding frenzy. The list of names scooped up by these buyers reads like a who’s who of high-profile Internet services: LinkedIn, Yahoo, Dollar Shave Club, Jet.com. Others like Twitter, Pandora and Lyft are said to be acquisition targets too. The spree comes as public companies such as LinkedIn and Twitter get hammered for failing to meet Wall Street’s demands for growth, and startups face a volatile market for going public with increased pressure from investors to be profitable. All of the sudden, some public and private tech companies are more interested in ditching Wall Street for the lucrative embrace of a bigger company. And the big companies, once skittish about sky high valuations in tech, are now all too happy to swoop in. “2016 will go down as the year of the lack of the tech IPO and a market of incredibly robust M&A activity,” says Daniel O’Keefe, general partner at Technology Crossover Ventures, an investor in Dollar Shave Club, which sold to Unilever for close to $1 billion. Not a single tech company went public in the first quarter of 2016 and just nine have had IPOs so far this year, according to data from Renaissance Capital. Mergers and acquisitions, on the other hand, are soaring. Deals to buy private tech companies have totaled $318 billion for the year so far, significantly outpacing the $250 billion spent on tech M&A through the first three full quarters of 2015, according to data from PitchBook. And according to O’Keefe, “I don’t think we’re done yet.” Venture capitalists and analysts point to a combination of factors setting the stage for more acquisitions: deflated valuations at certain private and public tech companies; low interest rates that make borrowing to finance deals easier; and corporations with loads of cash on hand. “You’ve got a lot of the large tech companies that have been doing well. They have a lot of cash and they have a lot of shareholder pressure to do something with that cash,” says James Gellert, CEO of Rapid Ratings, an independent research firm. At the same time, the pool of potential buyers increasingly includes tech and non-tech companies whose interests converge in areas like online shopping and self-driving cars. Some of the biggest startup acquisitions of the year came from outside traditional tech companies: General Motors spent a reported $1 billion buying Cruise Automation for autonomous vehicles; Unilever spent about as much on Dollar Shave Club; and Walmart agreed to buy shopping site Jet.com for $3.3 billion. “You have gone through an environment where neither side was buying. Now both the technology companies and the industrial companies are competing for assets,” says Harry Weller, a partner at New Enterprise Associates, one of the largest investors in Jet. That, Weller says, should only continue as more and more companies look to tap into technologies like artificial intelligence, cloud computing and robotics. Two years ago, some of these same companies might have refused to sell, or simply been too pricey for buyers to justify, thanks to a flood of private capital pouring into startups at high valuations from VCs and mutual funds. “I think we can all say with certainty that it was a robust pricing environment,” says O’Keefe. “I sensed corporates pulling back a bit in that environment.” Fast forward two years — through a turbulent global market, a clogged IPO pipeline and prominent companies like Square forced to go public at lower valuations — and startups finally start to lower their expectations for how much they’re worth. As Jeff Epstein, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, an early investor in LinkedIn, puts it, “Sometimes it takes two or three years for people to psychologically adjust to the new pricing levels.” This German bank is charging customers to hold their deposits Global central banks dump U.S. debt at record pace Related Posts ‘NFL Sunday Ticket’ expands deal to nearly all college students Apple’s board calls diversity proposal ‘unduly burdensome and not necessary’ This device can diagnose malaria in 5 seconds Gogo plane Wi-Fi blocks YouTube (and can read your email) Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

Pericom will display these products at IDF, Moscone Center, San Francisco, CA, August 16-18, 2016 at Booth # 620. Networking control plane processors and embedded processor applications often need PCI Express® (PCIe®) port expansion technology to handle the newest and most complex data plane and embedded multi-function designs. Pericom has added four new packet switches based on the PCIe 2.0 specification, ranging from 8 port/8 lanes to 16 port/24 lanes. These latest additions provide advanced power saving and management, DMA (Direct Memory Access), and are optimized to provide cost effective port expansion across a wide range of networking and embedded applications. "As a PCI-SIG® member, Pericom holds an important role in the success of PCIe technology," said Al Yanes, PCI-SIG chairman and president. "The company's support of PCIe solutions helps the PCI Express ecosystem attain applicability within an increasing range of platforms in the market." Many of the latest server and storage platforms utilize multiple high speed protocols, such as 10Gbps USB 3.1 and PCIe 3.0 technology at 8Gbps, 10GbE, and 12Gbps SAS3. Pericom has added two multi-protocol linear redriver ICs to its signal integrity solutions family that can handle all 3 protocols and meet link training and standards compliance specifications from 8Gbps to 12Gbps. The new parts offer flow through pinout, low power, and 2 or 8 fully independent user programmable channels of signal boost to extend high speed traces or cables in server and storage platforms. Pericom is also the first to offer a fully linear 2 channel USB 3.1 redriver that supports both 10Gbps (USB 3.1 GEN2) and 5Gbps (USB 3.1 GEN1) speeds. Additional new switch products for server and storage platforms include two I2C multiplexers (MUX) that offer 1:4 and 1:8 fan-out capability of the I2C bus, with any combination of downstream ports selectable. These parts add flexibility to I2C bus designs in more complex platforms where the I2C bus is also tasked to provide I/O functionality as well as legacy I2C control. A new 14bit SSD switch is ONFI3 compliant, optimized for supporting high capacity SSD memory modules through fast enable and select timing. Moreover, five new PCIe 3.0 very low power clock generators and buffers offering user programmable slew rate and supporting x2/x4/x8 outputs, expand the timing product portfolio for server, storage, and embedded platforms. "Pericom's new product roadmap continues to benefit our processor chipset partners," said Andy Tsong, division manager for Pericom products. "We enable and maximize the new features that are used by platform designers. For example, PCI Express technology continues to demand new timing, switching, conditioning, and routing solutions, and Pericom's focus and roadmaps support all of these necessary functions."

Published in Wearables Intel gets into VR by Nick Farrell on16 August 2016 Tweet font size decrease font size increase font size Print Email IDF 2016 cranks up After its mobile  plan did not work out so well, Chipzilla is doing what every large company which has run out of ideas is doing and getting into virtual reality. To be fair, early arrivals at the Intel Developer Forum did hear Intel executives muttering about other tech such as self-driving cars and artificial intelligence. But VR seems to be getting the headlines as the outfit is less interested in PCs or mobile, which was once another buzzword. IDF attendees will see drones fly around and robots roaming the floor, and they cab try on wearables and VR and AR headsets. What they are not seeing is cool laptops or PCs  Intel does not appear to have given up entirely on its internet-of-things plans it has shifted its Atom chips to IoT devices, drones and robots information kiosks, digital advertising signs, casino machines, and ATMs. Intel is expected to will show off FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays), which are reprogrammable chips for servers, cars, and IoT devices.Patrick Moorhead, president at Moorhead Insights and Strategy is expecting to see lmore IoT and the data centre. Kaby Lake, which succeed the current crop of Skylake chips,might get a demo because the chip release is close and Asus and HP are readying products with the chips, and Lenovo and Acer will announce Kaby Lake PCs ahead of the IFA show in Berlin next month. But   VR and AR headsets developed both internally and by partners seems to be where Intel is enthusiastically going. Chipzilla will show its version of Microsoft HoloLens, called Remote EyeSight, a set of head-worn AR smart glasses for remote collaboration. There will be  VR and AR announcements will focus around its RealSense 3D camera, which can recognise objects, measure distances, and like Microsoft's Kinect, track gestures. Meawhile while making a pile of cash from PCs, Intel is talking about server chips which will power IoT networks. Intel expected to be putting out more server chips to analyze information in the cloud.. On the last day of IDF, Intel is hosting a sideline conference called ISDF (Intel SoC FGPA Developer Forum), which is sponsored by  ARM. These sessions will be targeted at developers working with FPGAs from Altera, which was acquired by Intel for $16.7 billion last year.   Last modified on 17 August 2016 Rate this item 1 2 3 4 5 (2 votes) Tagged under Intel vr Internet of things idf 2016 More in this category: « Intel’s IoT plans going the way of mobile Intel shows off Alloy VR display » back to top <a href='http://www.fudzilla.com/openx/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a5c9c53f&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'><img src='http://www.fudzilla.com/openx/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=14&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a5c9c53f' border='0' alt='' /></a> <a href='http://www.fudzilla.com/openx/www/delivery/ck.php?n=aab6e204&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'><img src='http://www.fudzilla.com/openx/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=7&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=aab6e204' border='0' alt='' /></a>
