Qatalyst will begin a formal sales process to find a buyer for NXP, said the people, asking not to be identified because the information is private. In addition to Qualcomm, Avago Technologies Ltd., Intel Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co. are the most likely to be interested, one of the people said. NXP may also hire a co-adviser, another person said. While NXP has grown quickly via its purchase of Freescale Semiconductor at the end of last year, it’s still relatively small compared with companies such as Qualcomm, Intel and the more rapidly expanding Broadcom Ltd. NXP is projected to have more than $9 billion in revenue this year. NXP Chief Executive Officer Rich Clemmer and his board, who successfully brought the company back to the public markets in 2010, may be tempted by an offer to become part of a bigger company as industrywide costs of production rise and customer lists shrink. Representatives of NXP, Qatalyst, Broadcom and Intel declined to comment. A representative for Samsung didn’t respond to requests for comment. Qualcomm’s Options NXP is one of several companies that San Diego-based Qualcomm, the largest maker of chips for mobile phones, has been studying as it determines if and how to put its offshore cash to use, people familiar with the matter said Friday. Qualcomm is also considering a handful of other large acquisitions, both domestic and international targets, the people said. Talks between NXP and Qualcomm are still preliminary, people with knowledge of the matter said.  Qualcomm is under pressure from shareholders who want the company to put its industry-leading $30 billion of cash to work, said a person familiar with the considerations. Management hasn’t yet decided whether to stick with its policy of smaller acquisitions to plug gaps in technology or to pursue a large deal that would transform the company, the person said. Combining with NXP would create a company with technology that would place it at the center of the growing push to bring more electronics and automation to cars, according to Vijay Rakesh, an analyst at Mizuho Securities. He upgraded his rating on Qualcomm to buy and is predicting the stock will rise to $75. The shares closed Friday at $68.50. “We believe a deal here makes significant strategic and financial sense,” he wrote. “The move to automotive transforms the narrative on Qualcomm from handsets to automotive, a secular growth road map with connectivity, mobility, and services platforms.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

About Us Archives Advertise Technique Search for: Home Search for: Home News Opinions Consensus Opinion Letters to the Editor Political Cartoon Life Entertainment Sports Time Out Blogs Technocrats Advertising Talking CEED with Benton-Johnson By Keely Mruk on September 30, 2016 Leave a reply Tweet Felicia Benton-Johnson serves as Director of Diversity for Tech’s College of Engineering, a job she has held since 2004. As such, she also heads Tech’s Center for Engineering Education and Diversity, or CEED. This program works with entities, both inside the Tech community and otherwise, to promote a more diverse landscape in Tech’s engineering programs. The Technique was able to sit down with Benton-Johnson to discuss CEED and the impact it has on students. Technique: Could you give an overview of some of the services that CEED provides students? Benton-Johnson: Okay, so, CEED is the Center for Engineering Education and Diversity. We give students retention support, some one-on-one tutoring and mentoring, financial support, academic advising and career opportunities, like connecting students with corporate entities. The most important thing for us is we’re really big on building relationships with everyone we touch. The students, even parents, and corporate entities. We try and create a safe space for students to come and interact with us. There are five people who are on staff here and we like to make sure that if one of us isn’t available, someone else is, and they can go in, give a student a hug, give them a pat on the back, give them sort of a push when they need the motivation to keep going. We call ourselves the safe space, a home away from home for students. Technique: What part of your job do you enjoy the most? Benton-Johnson: To be honest, the students. When people say “what do you enjoy the least,” definitely the meetings. But yeah, the students, especially when you see things come full circle. For example, we have a summer engineering institute and the students are here for three weeks. This happens as early as when they’re rising juniors in high school, and it’s so cool that we see them now, in the end, when they are graduating from college. It’s really crazy. We see students that we’ve met as a freshman and now they’re in Ph.D. programs. Or when they come back from industry. We have a lot of students who come back from industry and they come in all the time and they come by to say “Hi” — that type of thing. You see what you’ve done when students come back. Or they come back in smiling and they just tell you, “Oh my gosh I did so good on this test or this project,” and it’s really cool to see. Technique: Is there any particular program that CEED runs that you are the proudest of? Benton-Johnson: Most proud of? Well there’s more than one project that we have in this initiative. The partnership with Intel, we became a partner with Intel last year. They gifted us $5.5 million over the next five years to increase the number of underrepresented minorities across engineering and technology. With that, it has enabled us to increase the number of students that we’ve impacted. For one we’ve expanded our peer to peer program, so now we’re supporting 120 students in that. Across the college of engineering and college of sciences and computing. That’s where we do a peer mentoring approach with upperclassmen mentoring underclassmen within the same major. And then we also have graduate students who mentor the mentors. Also the partnership with Intel has enabled us to support more students financially. So we have what’s called “retaining inspirational students in engineering and technology;” we call it RISE. RISE is for your nontraditional student who is pursuing engineering or technology, sometimes a graduate student, and they are resilient in pursuing their degree. So these students are nontraditional, someone who did not come to college straight out of high school, someone who may be married or is a first generation student. But they all have a strong work ethic and a drive to give back. RISE has enabled us to more than double the number of students that we are supporting financially, and we are really proud of that. The other thing is our summer engineering institute, which is the three-week residential program I spoke of. We started that in 2008. Since then, over 92 percent of the students who participated in that have gone on to pursue STEM degrees. We have a number of programs, I can’t really just tag one, we’re proud of a good number of them. Technique: That is certainly understandable. You are doing great things here. Benton-Johnson: Yeah, and we’re excited about that, having good people makes a big difference. We wouldn’t be able to do this with people who aren’t committed to the students and to making sure they obtain their degrees. Even for [engineering] students who we meet and who later decide to change their major, they are still a part of the CEED family. Technique: Are there any new programs that CEED is looking to start? Benton-Johnson: So, one thing that we realized is that graduate students need support as well. This year, we’re looking to start a graduate program similar to our peer-to-peer mentoring, where we are going to have support for graduate students. It will have different workshops, focused on professional development or how to get through masters or Ph.D. programs. … These workshops would answer questions like, “Should I go into academia versus industry?” We will try to get faculty involved in the mentoring aspect as well. Technique: What have you enjoyed about working on a college campus? Benton-Johnson: It keeps me young. I also love the innovation and the intellect … always keeping abreast of what is new and current in the academic arena. Technique: Would you say Tech has a different campus culture than other campuses that you have been at? Benton-Johnson: Oh yes, definitely yes, for sure. The campus culture is one of innovation, it’s one of camaraderie. I see students all of the time coming in. Just this Friday, I had a conversation with two students and they said, “we just started our own business.” Here, you get a lot of that — where students are starting start-ups, you know, that’s nothing out of the norm. I really love that about Tech. Then too, it’s so diverse, in every sense of the word. In socioeconomics, culture, language, you know. People may not say it’s diverse in the sense of majors because engineering is the 800-pound-gorilla, but even the engineers are very multidisciplinary. They reach over into the other colleges and look to work with other students to build businesses or work on projects. Technique: What brought you to Tech? Benton-Johnson: So, I actually was a chemistry teacher, and I wanted to go into higher education. I wanted to get out of the classroom and do something different. I started out as a diversity coordinator for an engineering research center, called GTech,  back in 2004. I got here and I just loved it. It just blended everything that my background is. The science, the education piece, the administrative and leadership piece, as well as diversity. It was just a really nice blend. Every day is something new. That’s the one thing I really love about working in academia. Every day is just completely different. Every day is nowhere near the same. That’s the other thing I really, really like. I’m blessed to do something that I’m passionate about. This is something I get up for in the morning, I love coming to work. It’s something I can do every day, all day because it’s always different. Technique: When you were little, what did you want to do when you grew up? Benton-Johnson: Oh my gosh … this is really interesting … my mom was a teacher, and I was like, “I do not want to be a teacher. I do not. I do not. I do not want to be a teacher.” So I was actually going to school to be an optometrist. I did a dual degree in biology and chemistry for my undergraduate degree, and then I went onto optometry school. All my life since I was little, even in middle school because I wore glasses, I was like, “I am going to be an eye doctor.” That was what I wanted to do, and once I got there I realized, “Oh, this is not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.” I ended up being, where am I, I’m in higher ed. I’m in education. I’ve taught in K-12 and I’ve taught higher ed on the education side, teaching students who were pursuing their doctorates. So I did education and higher education, but this is a different side that I like being on. I feel like I am right where I’m supposed to be. Technique: What do you get from this job that you didn’t get from working as a teacher or in higher education. Benton-Johnson: I get to have more input in the administration piece, and in directing the vision the way I want things to go.  In the class room, I’m more passing the knowledge onto students. But now, it’s kind of like directing the programs that support the knowledge and inventing programs that support the knowledge base. Technique: What do you like to do in your free time? Benton-Johnson: I love to watch a good movie or show. That’s my free time. When I have it, I mean I have kids so I’m always running around doing sports or traveling for work. But just kind of like students, when I get the time I enjoy it. I also love to listen to music. Technique: What do you like to listen to? Benton-Johnson: Jazz and blues, though blues is probably my favorite. Technique: Do you have anything you like to do in or around Atlanta? Benton-Johnson: I really can’t stand the traffic, and my favorite season is the fall. So then, I love to go to the park, watch the leaves, look at the colors. Driving down the highway, when there isn’t any traffic of course, and looking at all of the different colors on the trees.  I just love fall. Technique: What are some things that a lot of students don’t know that you wish they did? Benton-Johnson: So the things that I give to them all of the time: This too shall pass. You’ve got this. You can get it done. We wouldn’t admit you to Georgia Tech if you can’t get it done. Right now it doesn’t seem like you can see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it’s there. With age comes wisdom. The things you stress out about now, you won’t later. For students, especially Georgia Tech students, they have to take a small time to do something that they enjoy to get refueled and reenergize to hit the books back again. They always seem like they are saying they can’t take the time, but they don’t realize that [not taking the time] impacts them being able to focus. It’s just stressing them out. So if they take time, step away from it, and do something that they enjoy, they will get reenergized, refueled to tackle it again with a different perspective, and through a different lens. I’m also really big on persistence, trying to stay persistent. Learn from your failures and stay persistent. Once again remember that this too shall pass. As one of my good friends says, “It gets greater later.” Technique: It’s very inspiring to listen to someone speak so passionately about their job. Benton-Johnson: It’s very rewarding. I don’t think I could see myself doing anything else. Touching lives. Seeing them. It’s so funny when they get older and they come back and they have babies. I think “Oh my gosh, I feel so old.” But it’s a good thing. I’m waiting on that day, when one of my students brings their child to me, and they’re in the summer engineering institute, or coming to Tech as a freshman. That’ll be the real “ahhh” moment.

Skip to content Hackaday Primary Menu Home Blog Hackaday.io Store Hackaday Prize Submit About November 18, 2016 Very, Very Tiny X86 Systems 99 Comments by: Brian Benchoff September 30, 2016 The most interesting market for Intel in recent years has been very, very small form factor PCs. ARM is eating them alive, of course, but there are still places where very small and very low power x86 boards make sense. The latest release from SolidRun is the smallest we’ve seen yet. The SolidPC Q4 is one of the smallest x86 implementation you can find. It’s based around the MicroSoM, a module even smaller than a Raspberry Pi, and built around a carrier board that has all the ports you could ever want from the tiniest PC ever. The SolidPC Q4 is technically only a carrier board featuring a microSD slot, Displayport, HDMI 1.4B, two RJ45 ports with the option for PoE, three USB 3.0 Host ports, jacks for mic and stereo sound, and an M.2 2230 connector for a wireless module. The interesting part of this launch is the MicroSoM, a System on Module based on Intel’s Braswell architecture. Two models are offered, based on the quad-core Atom E8000 and the Pentium N3710. Both modules feature up to 8GB of DDR3L RAM and 4GB of eMMC Flash. The interesting part of this launch is the MicroSoM, a System on Module based on Intel’s Braswell architecture. Two models are offered, based on the quad-core Atom E8000 and the Pentium N3710. Both modules feature up to 8GB of DDR3L RAM and 4GB of eMMC Flash. The size of these modules is 52.8mm by 40mm, or just a shade larger than the stick-of-gum-sized Raspberry Pi Zero. The SolidPC isn’t intended to be a Raspberry Pi competitor. While those cheap ARM boards are finding a lot of great uses in industry, they’re no replacement for a small, x86 single board computer. The pricing for this module starts at $157 according to the product literature, with a topped out configuration running somewhere between $300 and $350, depending on options like a heatsink, enclosure, or power adapter. If you want a small single board computer with drivers for everything, there aren’t many other options: you certainly wouldn’t pick a no-name Allwinner board.

Always a challenge when the mind runs on the cranial equivalent of 30pin SIMMs… ;) Hey, hey, it could be worse — banks of individual DRAM chips were a thing, once, too — and before that, was SRAM, which –IMO– was significantly superior in all areas except for cost. Faster than period DRAM, cycle for cycle, and it didn’t have that little amnesia problem that DRAM has when somebody forgets to hit up the refresh line every so often… of course it was more expensive… and that’s how DRAM won that battle. For the record, I’m a bit of a Commodore nut, and, yes, I know, they used DRAM — and it makes me sore in the head to think about it. They were being cheap, and –quite sadly– cheap sells better than good, and it has for some time. I’m a strong believer in keeping accountants out of engineering ;) …wow, that went off topic fast.

Throw all of that in a cheap case and PSU and you have the same power at a cheaper price point. Now, if size does matter, you’d probably bite the bullet and pay the premium. But at that point, unless you just really need x86 there are equally capable ARM boards out there for a fraction of the cost of this one.

Where can I get an ARM board that has video out, a good ethernet connection, Good USB 2.0 support, video out, 4 sata ports, and a PCI slot?. I can find an x86 board that supports that for under $60 with power supply and ram. Even if you are running Linux x86 tends to offer you better software support and higher performance. Sure Pis are nice and small and even cheap but the wired network support and USB performance tend to be pretty bad. Forget about using them as NAS or even a router. Sure ARMS are good chips but a small cheap X86 that supports Windows, Linux, BSD and so on could be a really popular board. I have to wonder if any project that used an X86 over a pi could get on hack a day.

Their documentation sucks, and last time I looked they provided no way of actually using those I/O-pins that are connected to the Intel CPU, even though they bring them out on a header, and running Linux on a Lattepanda is a waste because the bluetooth- and WiFi-peripherals aren’t supported and so on. The Udoo x86 ( https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/udoo/udoo-x86-the-most-powerful-maker-board-ever/description ) is in pretty much every possible way a more compelling product, with higher-quality documentation, a much more experienced team behind it, more connectivity-options and so on and so forth.

As for the cheap end, with those lousy slow A4s and Celerons, I’m telling my folks that the $299 special, with only 4GB RAM, isn’t going to be any faster than their 5 year old mid range machines, which they’ve already got 8GB in probably. SSD isn’t really going to sell a new machine, they’re $80 for a usable size and you can stick them in anything and get same benefits. Mostly I think it’s because intel shot itself in the foot with maintaining high pricing on i5 and i7 due to AMD not being so competitive, which means they keep slipping weaksauce units under them to try and move anything at all. It’s like that late 80s, early 90s era when 386/486 were stratospheric pricing, but nobody cared apart from the CAD people because all the everyday stuff ran on DOS on a 1986 Turbo XT just fine.

Infokiosks, ATMs, even some electronic billboards use such systems. And most of the software is legacy, so there is no point in changing to x64 architecture. It’s like with the banks that still use COBOL because it was cheaper to maintain the code and hardware than doing an upgrade. Which turned out to be a really stupid idea as COBOL programmers are going the way of dinosaurs and Dodos… Report comment Reply MS-BOSS says: October 1, 2016 at 6:26 am He probably meant “why use disgustingly overpriced x86 when we may use any cheap ARM for the same purpose”, not “hell, why use x86 when there is x64”.

I just said you could never offer me enough to get me interested in COBOL again – try the grave yard there are lots of COBOL programmers there. Report comment Reply RÖB says: October 1, 2016 at 11:32 am PS: The COBOL runs on a virtual machine with DOS and communicates out via virtual serial port. That virtual machine is within another virtual machine that runs Linux and connect the virtual serial to TCP/IP and that virtual machine is within a version of windows server. Nightmare Much? Report comment Moryc says: October 1, 2016 at 1:19 pm Sysadmin who made that setup either collects Matryoshkas or is a big fan of Inception… Report comment RÖB says: October 1, 2016 at 4:33 pm @[Moryc] I would guess that over time successive sysadmis who are not COBOL programmers have just dealt with the issue as best they can. The original software (COBOL) obviously ran in DOS and most likely used Direct Port Interfacing via DMA, IRQ and Port Number. This method of interfacing is not possible on a modern OS and hence the virtualization of such and old operating system as DOS. This is more common that you may think. I have a name brand JTAG programmer here and it looks like someone who did the coding died and left a puzzle behind. The original code did much same thing and required Port Mapped IO. Their solution is mind boggling and here is how it goes. The programmer consists of a USB to Serial (JTAG) bridge followed by a large FPGA with lots of SD RAM and then a hardware JTAG interface for the target device. When you plug it in it is a USB to Serial (JTAG) bridge that is used to program the FPGA to be an X86 compatible system with the basic code to boot from serial. Then it disconnects and re-connects as it boots from plain serial and the synthesis platform is loaded. Then the connection cycles again and then it acts as a plain USB to Serial bridge and the HDL file to be synthesized is sent via the serial connection. It then syntheses the HDL file on the hardware virtualized x86 and programs the target device via a HDL encoded Mapped port to JTAG hardware interface. So when you plug it in you get the windows sounds for USB connect / disconnect several times and that led me to work out why. It seems that they lost the source code and comments. No problem! just fix it software virtualized hardware platform that runs the original compiled code.

Buying this thing to run a DOS application would be a poor choice because you would be paying for may houses to pull a very small cart and the horses would eat too much, making running time small if you have to carry food. Then you have to deal with more waste and the horses could never get up speed because the cart is too small. Really, what application would require a quad core in such a small form factor. You would need to be processing a lot of input, much more input than you could fit through Ethernet. Perhaps image processing or something like that but seriously I can think of exactly ZERO applications that would warrant such CPU power and if I could think of one then I would choose something cheaper. Small form factors are good for portable devices and portable devices run on batteries and this thing would need a truck battery.

The pricing for this module starts at $157 according to the product literature, with a topped out configuration running somewhere between $300 and $350 The differentiating applications for a small overpriced x86 single board computer are almost none compared to cheap ARM boards. Something that runs Windows isn’t an application. It has to do something. What can these x86 boards do significantly better than a $20 ARM board? Where’s the value? Sure there’s old legacy DOS/windows applications, but those were written at a time when there was little choice other than x86. The x86 “pc architecture” was never chosen for its features or excellent design, but for its relative low cost and mass production. Now there’s better alternatives, making the “pc architecture” for embedded designs a dinosaur. Windows CE is dead. Embedded x86 is dead. Move on. > If you want a small single board computer with drivers for everything, there aren’t many other options: you certainly wouldn’t pick a no-name Allwinner board. Define “divers for everything”. All Allwinner boards run Linux, and most of the kernel is open (with the exception of the Mali GPU, which is ARM IP, not Allwinner). But the same is true for x86. Open source graphics drivers are sketchy on PC architecture at best. Sure you can always download a vendor supplied BLOB (often only for windows), but that’s no different than Allwinner/Mali. And all x86 boards are hindered by the horrible UEFI and PC BIOS, making even some versions of windows impossible to use. Obtaining Windows drivers does not mean “drivers for everything”. Also an Orange Pi One is $13 shipped. You can get 10 of them and still be less than the starting price for this x86 board. And if you’re application is legacy DOS or Win3.1/Win95, DOSBox emulation works nicely. Raspberry Pi also has closed graphics drivers, but that’s not a deal breaker. There are many options. What is few are the compelling reasons to continue to use x86.

Vortex86 DX3 (specs at http://www.vortex86.com/?p=264) immediately comes to mind, RDC EmKore DS too (specs at http://www.rdc.com.tw/?route=home/emk albeit more focused to commercial applications). Those two SOCs are good for embedded shenanigans, but have certainly weak specs for a full-blown actual desktop OS… just imagine if they’ve gained momentum 5 years ago. Like Espressif that was another IC maker in a sea of manufacturers, and their game was “uplifted” by their very consumers ’cause of a nice product with potential, I cannot stop thinking that those two missed the maker & IoT bandwagon miserably. Maybe we could have had a way better Quark-alike SoC years before Intel also said me-too, or user friendly modules with half the Q4 size running Windows/Linux/YouNameIt effortlesly. Sigh.

Will the refreshed MacBook Pro break free from Intel chips? by Chris Smith 30 September 2016 0 shares Read Comments Apple is reportedly considering ditching Intel processors for the rumoured MacBook Pro refresh, thought to the coming next month. According to reports, the hotly-anticipated machine could feature an AMD Zen APU. According to Italian website bits and chips, Intel’s Kaby Lake and Coffee Lake units are not progressing as fast as hoped, prompting Apple to consider a different solution. The report says, AMD may have been tapped to create a custom SoC design for the new MacBook Pro. It is already thought AMD may leak the Polaris 10 GPU into the new MacBook so AMD could be doubling up here. Recent reports suggest Apple will announce the new MacBook Pro in late October, after it was left out of September’s iPhone 7 announcement. The laptop is rumoured to feature a touch-sensitive OLED panel to replace the current function keys. It is also thought the company could ditch the MagSafe charging solution for USB-C, a la the 12-inch Retina MacBook.

Chip maker Intel’s own ten-nanometer chips are due in second half of 2017. Speaking at a tech symposium in the northern Taiwanese city of Hsinchu, TSMC CEO Mark Liu said that his company recently started research and development (R&D) work for a cutting-edge five-nanomenter process technology, Nikkei reported Friday. The semiconductor foundry will also start trial production of seven-nanometer chips in small quantities in the first quarter of 2017. It’s recently started work on five-nanometer chips and has assigned 300 to 400 engineers to develop a three-nanometer technology. Plus, TSMC is currently researching a two-nanometer process. TSMC’s R&D budget increased substantially from $690 million in 2009 to $2.1 billion in 2015. For all of 2016, it’s allocated $10 billion for capital expenditure. TSMC built the A9 chip along with Samsung and is exclusively producing the latest A10 Fusion chip for the iPhone 7 on its 16-nanometer process. The company is also rumored to have secured a contract to build ‘A11’ chips for 2017 iPhones. Were Apple to swap out Intel in Macs for in-house designed CPUs based on iPhone and iPad chips, as it’s been suggested, TSMC’s should have its sophisticated manufacturing technology ready to make it happen and help Apple beat Intel at its own game.

I’d never even thought they could really bring it down so low… Hussain Alsanona Think of 2 nm then. Wow mind blowing to be honest Rolf Bause Dude, when I went to middle school 80-90nm were the norm 😀 In the meanwhile they passed this limit where even the wave length of light was starting to get a problem (used for the etching process) and they now basically need to trick physics a little with the stencils, in order to even still get it to work. And we now surpassed all of this for a long time already and they still manage to make it thinner and thinner… that’s what I was mainly talking about 😀 armyk Custom made chips with 10nm in Macs? That would blow competitors away… Ruturaj A 10nm mobile chip (what apple has) won’t be even near 4th generation 22nm i7. armyk You know based on? Ruturaj I don’t know how much powerful they will be, same as you don’t know if they will blow away competition. But I made a guess, given performance of current ARM processors, A10 chip and x86 chips. armyk Well I am positive they can design top of the range ARM processor and if they can manufacture with 10nm, they will have advantage. Then it is just matter of scaling. Ruturaj Sure I am positive they can design top of the range ARM processor and they will do it on 10nm. But ARM processors are not scalable, that’s why AMD have octa core processors but didn’t do as well as Intel’s dual core. But lets see. eqHullabaloo While technically TSMC will have their 10nm process out before intel from what I understand TSMC’s version of 10nm process will be larger than intels 10nm process. What TSMC is calling 10nm will have poorer transistor density compared to what intel is calling 10nm. The reason I wanted to point this out is that you can’t compare the two directly. I don’t want to get all technical on exact details, but if you’re really curious someone else who’s more knowledgeable in wafer fabrication would be able to explain it. mrgerbik TSMC process different then Intel’s.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 30, 2016 at 8:49AM Image source: Intel.  Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is something of a rare, if not unique, phenomenon within the chip industry. The company brings in an extraordinary amount of revenue -- $55.4 billion in 2015 -- at an extremely robust gross profit margin of over 60%. That favorable combination makes Intel one of the most profitable chip companies in the world, raking in a whopping $14 billion in operating profit and $11.4 billion in net income in 2015. Because of the importance of Intel's gross profit margin to the company's overall profitability, it's worth taking a look at some of the key factors that influence this figure. Here are two big ones that come to mind. Product features and competitiveness Former Intel Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said it best on the company's second quarter earnings call back in July 2015: For us, the key is to have great products, and that's why we're adding this third wave of products. At the first approximation, that's the best correlation of gross margin is when you've got leadership products, you tend to have a healthy gross margin. Indeed, Intel's personal computer and server/data center processor products usually offer best-in-class performance and power efficiency. Furthermore, Intel has done a good job over the years of continuing to integrate additional features and technologies that previously required separate chips, allowing the company to capture additional value with its offerings. If Intel can continue to field feature-rich products that deliver unmatched efficiency and performance, it should continue to command robust margins. However, if Intel slips (or competitors execute really well), then the company's gross profit margins would be at risk. Product cost structure Gross profit margin is a function of both the amount that a company can charge per-unit and the manufacturing costs per-unit of a given product. Having competitive features and performance enables Intel to command relatively high prices for its products. However, if the company can only achieve that product competitiveness by blowing up its cost structure, then its margins see no improvement. A good rule of thumb is that, assuming all else equal, a larger chip is going to be more expensive to manufacture than a smaller chip. What Intel has worked to do for quite some time is to develop different variants of its products targeted at different price and performance points. More expensive, higher-performance chips tend to be larger -- as they usually pack in additional processor cores, graphics, and so on -- while lower-cost, lower-performance chips tend to be smaller. Building multiple variants of a chip to target different price points does require additional research and development spending, but at the unit and revenue scale that the chipmaker operates in, the additional spending is more than offset by the gross profit margin benefit from building "right-sized" products for each segment. That said, chip size isn't the only thing that affects cost structure. Intel owns and operates its own chip manufacturing plants and spends significantly to develop the manufacturing processes to actually build those chips. The yield rates that Intel achieves with these manufacturing technologies directly affect a chip's cost structure. Remember, if you assume wafer cost is fixed, and if you assume the number of chips per wafer is fixed -- dependent on the size of the chip -- then the cost of those chips depends on how many of those come off the wafer usable, since better yields mean more salable chips for a given wafer cost.

Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Sep 30, 2016 at 9:45AM Image source: AMD. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has made meaningful progress this year. It launched Polaris, its line of mainstream graphics cards that aim to win back market share from rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Various financial maneuvers, including multiple joint ventures and a stock offering, have strengthened the company's balance sheet. And a return to non-GAAP operating profitability during the second quarter signaled that the worst may be over. The second phase of AMD's comeback will begin next year. Zen, the company's upcoming CPU architecture, will launch early in the year, with PC variants coming first, followed by server variants, and finally APUs. Vega, AMD's upcoming high-end GPU, is expected to begin shipping in the first half of the year, with the goal of challenging NVIDIA in the high-end of the GPU market after years of playing second fiddle. While AMD's turnaround seems to be picking up steam, both Zen and Vega will need to be successful for the company to reach its full potential. Why Zen is important Expectations are high leading up to Zen's release. AMD has promised significant performance improvements that should at the very least narrow the gap between its own products and those of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). According to AMD, Zen will boost instructions per cycle by 40% compared to the previous generation of CPUs, a major increase enabled by a host of improvements. Image source: AMD. Winning back share in the PC market will be the first goal. Zen will focus on the high-end of the market at launch, with AMD aiming to peel away profitable market share from Intel. With the PC market as a whole continuing to slump, going after the high-end gives the company the best chance at returning to profitability. The server market is equally important for AMD. Intel currently dominates the market for server CPUs, with AMD's market share essentially rounding down to zero. AMD estimates that the total addressable market is around $18 billion, so even clawing back 5% of the market from Intel would significantly boost AMD's top line. Intel won't give up market share without a fight, but AMD's server business can't really get any worse. Zen doesn't need to be better than Intel's products for AMD to win back some market share, but it does need to close the performance gap. If Zen lives up to the hype, AMD's turnaround will continue to gain momentum. If it doesn't, returning to sustainable profitability will be tough. Why Vega is important Image source: AMD. While Polaris aims squarely at the mainstream portion of the graphics card market, Vega, which is expected to launch during the first half of 2017, will be AMD's re-entry into the high-end of the market. Ever since NVIDIA launched the GTX 970 and GTX 980 in late 2014, the company has dominated the market for expensive, and highly profitable, graphics cards. Vega will be AMD's attempt to appeal to the high-end gaming PC market. NVIDIA has a head start, launching the GTX 1070 and GTX 1080 earlier this year. Higher-end variants are expected to be released in the coming months as well, including a rumored GTX 1080 Ti. NVIDIA's next-gen GPU, Volta, is unlikely to be launched earlier than the second half of 2017, but AMD's Vega will be launching into a market dominated by NVIDIA. Vega will need to be disruptive in order to pry away high-end market share from NVIDIA. If AMD succeeds in producing a viable challenger to NVIDIA's high-end cards, the company's graphics business could become more profitable compared to a scenario where the company only succeeds in winning back mainstream market share. For AMD, 2016 was important, but 2017 will be a critical year as well. The fate of AMD's nascent turnaround will be determined by the success of Zen and Vega.

An Easy Way To Try Intel & RADV Vulkan Drivers On Fedora 24 Written by Michael Larabel in Fedora on 30 September 2016 at 09:19 AM EDT. 15 Comments Fedora 25 should have good support for the open-source Vulkan Linux drivers (particularly if it lands the next Mesa release) while Fedora 24 users can now more easily play with the latest Mesa Git RADV and Intel ANV Vulkan drivers via a new repository. A Phoronix reader has setup a Fedora Copr repository that is building Intel's Vulkan driver from Mesa Git plus the RADV Radeon Vulkan driver re-based from its source (David Airlie's semi-interesting GitHub branch). Fedora COPR, for the uninformed, is the distribution's equivalent to Ubuntu PPA repositories. From a Fedora 24 box, when running dnf copr enable mystro256/vulkan-git users can then run dnf install mesa-libvulkan-intel or dnf install mesa-libvulkan-radeon to fetch the Intel and/or Radeon drivers, respectively. More details on this repository for the Git Vulkan drivers on F24 can be found here. The same user is also maintaining an amd-staging-kernel repo to have the very latest AMDGPU DRM testing code. Of course, with either repository, use with caution.

Chalayan’s SS17 collection and runway show featured connected, wearable accessories powered by Intel technology, including never-before-seen glasses and belts. Designed to improve awareness and pro-active management of stress levels, the accessories demonstrate another way of how fashion and technology can come together in the midst of the current trend for health trackers and wearables. Powered by the Intel® CurieTM module, a tiny, low- power hardware product, the glasses gather biometric data from the wearer, using sensors that monitor brainwave, heart rate and breathing data to infer stress in real time. During the presentation the wearer’s biometric data was then sent to the model’s belt using Bluetooth, which using the Intel® Compute Stick, a tiny computing device, captured the data from the glasses and translated the information into visualizations that interpret the wearer’s stress level. These visualizations are projected by the belt onto a wall as the models move down the runway.  The projected visualizations then remind the wearer to try and reduce stress levels where needed, with the imagery changing in real-time to correspondence with the body’s response.  Intel and Chalayan showed five studies of the unique glasses and belts, which following Paris Fashion Week will be on display at the Design Museum’s “Fear and Love: Reactions to a Complex World” exhibition in London starting in November.  #fashion-week #news #afp Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Best Buy’s pre-Black Friday 2016 sale is live right now – here are the 20 best deals BGR News iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech Walmart’s pre-Black Friday sale starts right now – here are the best deals so far BGR News New hybrid console takes Nintendo on the go Yahoo Tech Microsoft cuts top Xbox One games by 40% in Black Friday deals The Verge This smart crib will help your baby sleep safely through the night Yahoo Tech Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo News Network
Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Internet New Ethernet standards will offer up to 5Gbps performance using cables you already own New Ethernet standards will offer up to 5Gbps performance using cables you already own By Joel Hruska on September 30, 2016 at 7:30 am Comment Consumer Ethernet performance has been stuck at gigabit speeds for nearly 20 years. Apple was the first company to ship gigabit Ethernet in motherboards. Intel’s 875P chipset popularized the feature in the PC market by connecting the Ethernet controller to the northbridge, thereby offering improved performance. Thirteen years later, gigabit is still the standard for wired Ethernet — but that might be about to change, thanks to a new wired networking standard from the IEEE 802.3bz task force. There are multiple reasons why we’ve been stuck on gigabit for as long as we have. 10GbE requires more expensive cabling — either fiber optic cable in some cases, or more expensive Cat6a or Cat7 cabling for others. It’s not as backwards-compatible with previous standards (half-duplex operation isn’t supported), and routers, switches, and network cards that can support 10GbE are all far more expensive than their gigabit counterparts. But one simple reason gigabit Ethernet has stuck around so long is that it’s taken a long time for the average home network to demand enough bandwidth to saturate it. That’s slowly starting to change. Wireless performance improvements, the increased popularity of media streaming, and the slow rollout of gigabit fiber across the US (thanks in part to Google) are all signs that in the long run, we’re going to need a faster standard. The two new IEEE standards, known as 2.5GBASE-T and 5GBASE-T, should satisfy that need. These two standards were specifically created to use 10GbE signaling, but at a rate that would be compatible with existing runs of Cat5e and Cat6 cable out to 100 meters. The 2.5Gbps standard can run on Cat5e out to 100 meters, while the 5Gbps standard requires Cat6 cable to run 100 meters. Both should be far easier — and cheaper — to bring to market than current 10GbE technologies. Image by Wikipedia This is still a long-term rollout for most of us. Typical homes and small offices pull more data from the internet than across local networks, and the vast majority of Americans don’t have access to gigabit yet. Home and small office networks may also still require new hardware to take advantage of the standard. Many lower-end routers and switches that advertise themselves as gigabit capable only support that standard on a single port rather than across the entire device. Still, the nature of a standard is to be forward-looking. Technically proficient consumers who build their own networks could still see immediate performance improvements from higher-speed networking cards and gear, and newer wireless standards are already capable of challenging gigabit wired performance. Hopefully the appearance of the new 2.5GbE and 5GbE standards will spur companies like Intel and AMD to start work on compatible chipsets.

It is of course referring to the upcoming Intel 7th Generation Core processors, also referred to as Kaby Lake processors. Intel launched its 7th Generation Core processors exactly a month ago – but only for laptops and other compact form factor devices. That first release of Kaby Lake processors was of the Y-Series and U-Series chips. We don't have an exact date for the launch of Kaby Lake CPUs for desktops but it is generally thought that these chips will launch and become available in January. So it looks like we still have a three months plus wait for desktop Kaby Lake CPUs. Nevertheless, it's great to see a major motherboard manufacturer get all their current modern motherboards ready for Intel's next generation processors in advance. MSI says that all the BIOS updates are now made available for download via the official MSI support website. The new BIOS files bring "better performance and compatibility using the latest Intel processors with better specification and higher frequencies" says MSI. I don't have an MSI motherboard but downloaded one of the new BIOS files, apparently updated on 22nd Sept, to see if there was any further information in the traditional accompanying 'readme.txt' file. All the release note said was "This BIOS fixes the following problem of the previous version: Supported next generation new Intel CPU." (This was for the MSI Z170A GAMING M5 - see pic above). The full list of Kaby Lake supporting motherboards with the new BIOS update file downloadable is embedded below. With the compatibility being the only addition to this BIOS file I would probably wait until I had bought a Kaby Lake chip, in January or beyond, before applying any of these BIOS updates. Looking at the frequency of BIOS updates for the GAMING M5 it (and other models) could easily receive another BIOS update by that time.

After all Sandy Bridge motherboards worked with Ivy Bridge with BIOS update, and Haswell boards worked with broadwell with a BIOS update. If any of the companies do not support Kaby Lake on the 100 chipset boards, they are just being lazy and not caring about their customer.

By B. Saimin   AMD’s a custom, SOC Design with HBM2 Memory System. For a long time Apple MacBook Pro series has been featuring a mix of U and H series processors, Usually, both tiers get their graphics updated with performance extent around in the same time but with Kaby Lake, the High-performance models might be challenging. There are rumors that Intel would be starting a new line of CPU family known as Kaby Lake. These CPUs will be available in several variants. Where, MacBook Pro’s looking for reliable and faster graphics performance and that does not seem to be the case in with Intel new processors   Picture, Hassan Mujtaba AMD may offer latest Zen Architecture custom chips in 2018. Then Apple prefer to use AMD products if Intel unable to meet their requirements in the graphics. AMD even may take advantage and by featuring their latest GCN Cores and add High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), (cache /system subsystem) for Apple.                                                                                                                 AMD’s HBM chip, Google AMD’s new processor is a Hybrid (combination of two different elements) with a highest and faster performance.  APU is mix of CPU and GPU in one.    Swiss naval flag   The GPU is graphic processing unit, which occasionally called visual processing unit (VPU), is specific for electronic circuit designed to rapidly control and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer and makes ready for output to a display.  On the other hand   GeForce 6600GT (NV43) GPU   Where the word VPU came from being challenged, Nvidia got interest on the term GPU in 1999 and marketed the GeForce 256 as “ the world first Graphics processing Unit”, it was introduced as a single- chip processor combined with transform, lighting, triangle setup/ clipping and layout engines.

As they weigh their court challenges, the pair contend that the EU neglected to flag a shift in emphasis in the investigation, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Their appeals would be reminiscent of Intel Corp.’s complaint that the EU trampled on its rights in a separate probe nearly a decade ago. EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager’s team insists there was never a U-turn and that it kept Apple and Ireland up to date with developments from the time the probe was opened in 2014 through Aug. 30 -- when Ireland was ordered to claw back the proceeds of alleged sweetheart tax deals. “The defender, the member state, has the right to know exactly what are the objections and if the objections change,” said Jacques Derenne, a Brussels-based lawyer at Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton LLP. “If it’s confirmed that the final decision addresses issues, facts and even legal interpretations that have not been discussed with the member state, there is a problem.” In an order that reverberated across the Atlantic, the EU slapped Apple with the multi-billion euro bill, saying Ireland granted unfair deals that reduced the company’s effective corporate tax rate to as little as 0.005 percent in 2014. The U.S. Treasury hit back, saying the EU was making itself a "supra-national tax authority" that could threaten global tax reform efforts. The 0.005 percent figure cited by the commission is “extremely misleading and deceptive,” Apple said in a note to investors this month. “We paid $400 million in corporate income taxes in Ireland in 2014 -- considerably more than the commission’s figure suggests.” But during the Apple case, scrutiny of the company’s tax affairs in Ireland appeared to shift from so-called transfer pricing arrangements on transactions between units which are used to calculate taxable profit, according to the people familiar with the investigation. The final decision focused on how Apple allocated almost all its European sales profits to what the EU said were “head offices” not subject to tax. Transfer pricing wasn’t mentioned in last month’s press release. Apple says none of its units was ever exempt from tax -- and that under the law they are subject to deferred U.S. tax. While the commission denies a change in approach occurred, Apple and the Irish government were rebuffed repeatedly when they sought fuller information on the supposed U-turn, the people said. Sought Answers Apple and Ireland first got wind of the change of direction in November 2014 when the EU sought answers on intellectual property issues. Both separately asked officials to explain what the investigation was now focusing on without getting clear information, the people said. Even a January meeting between Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook and Vestager failed to get answers. For Apple’s general counsel, Bruce Sewell, the affair may stir up unhappy memories from his time at Intel, which faced a record antitrust fine for thwarting smaller chipmakers. “The commission changed course a number of times and has taken all sorts of steps to obscure that fact from us and from the Irish,” Sewell told reporters immediately after the EU decision on Apple last month. "We were not given the opportunity to defend this case in the way that we should’ve been." Kept Abreast Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said that it kept Apple and Ireland abreast during the investigation that was formally opened in June 2014.

Those rulings "endorsed an internal allocation of profits within Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe, between their respective head offices and branches, allowing Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe to pay very little tax on its profits." Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan has said he was only informed of the vast amount of back taxes he would be ordered to collect from Apple, hours before Vestager told reporters in Brussels that the iPhone maker got illegal tax advantages. Apple declined to comment beyond referring to Sewell’s earlier remarks. Ireland’s finance ministry also declined to comment. Changed Emphasis Philip Andrews, a lawyer at McCann FitzGerald in Dublin who isn’t involved in the case, said the information the EU has made public so far -- a June 2014 letter to the Irish government when the case was opened and a press release last month -- do show a change in emphasis. "It’s clear the commission has changed its theory of harm, at least from the press release," he said. "The rationale does appear to be different from the case that was pursued" initially in 2014 "which focused on whether the transfer pricing followed arms length" guidelines on how goods and services are transferred between units of a company. "There was certainly a surprise when the press release came out and Vestager announced a figure," Andrews said. "The commission kept that quite secret until the very last moment." But even if the probe did change, it may be hard to prove that the commission broke any rules of procedure with the way it handled the case. The bloc’s state-aid law sets far fewer limits on regulators than antitrust and merger probes where there are strict deadlines and clearer rules on what information companies are entitled to see. Main Target Even though Apple will also appeal, from a procedural point of view, under the EU’s state-aid rules, member states and not companies are the main target. Vestager’s team focused on Ireland for granting unfair tax advantages to Apple, which meant the company’s role was largely confined to supplying investigators with information they wanted. Technically, that also means only Ireland had a formal right to defense as the case unfolded and could attempt to argue at the EU court that its rights had been breached. In reality, both are in it together, with full cooperation and disclosure between Apple and the Dublin government. Ireland has just over two months from the Aug. 30 decision to lodge an appeal at the EU’s General Court. Apple must wait a bit longer for the commission’s decision to be made public before it can submit its own challenge. Cook has subsequently blasted the EU order as "total political crap" in an interview with the Irish Independent. But whether judges at the EU’s General Court -- the first EU tribunal to hear the appeals -- will agree remains to be seen. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

View Latest Posts >>> Pedophile Terrorism is Running Rampant in America By Preston James, Ph.D on September 29, 2016 All Lives Matter ~ Similar to the Pennsylvania Appalachian Belt, the Minnesota Strip feeds kids into the national Sex-Trafficking Network to slake the World's never-ending thirst for angelic-looking Sex Toys by  Preston James $200 Sometimes Minnesota nice isn’t as nice as you might think. Right now there is a local and high level cover-up of major sex trafficking of minors in Minnesota. Some of the young girls are being sold for as little as $200.00 USD. Many have been taken out of state for purposes of prostitution, obvious White Slavery crimes which are federal felonies, kept in bondage with induced drug addictions and serious threats. About 90% of the sex trafficking that starts in Minnesota is associated with Black Pimps. Political Correctness and recent concern with the George Soros’ secretly-backed “Black Lives Matter” (which is actually led by Intel assets) tends to motivate local LE to want to avoid any energetic investigations. White USG officials at moderately high to very high levels run the actual deployment of these compromise ops, while the black pimps do most of the procurement. In past years, when Gary McGaughey was head of Vice at the Minneapolis Police Department, he and Detective Rothstein worked the case now known as the “Minnesota Connection“. Through their efforts, and some honest, standup FBI agents like themselves, they were able to arrest and gain convictions with long jail sentences for 11 of the 12 top human-trafficking pimps in America. Detective Gary McGaughey had an impeccable record and, after he and Detective Rothstein assembled the case against Hubert Humphrey for taking illegal payments from the Milk Industry, the Secret Shadow Government deployed numerous means that destroyed Detective McGaughey and his family. This incredible hero died a broken man, never to be honored for his amazing Law Enforcement achievements for the community, or for what a standup, honorable and honest police officer he was. His career was a gift to the whole community of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Do middle class Americans have feet of clay because they are victims of their own self-induced mind-kontrol prison of Political Correctness? Are we unwilling to address Sex-Trafficking and the actual causes of blatant urban crime, which is always a secret systemic consequence of high-level government, LE and Intel corruption? Detective McGaughey was known for frequently making the following claim about how human compromise operations were accomplished: “I know enough about vice to know that everybody has a chink in their armor”. To effectively human compromise someone all Intel has to do is find it and exploit it by providing the proper custom designed temptation. I am presenting this difficult truth here because, like many in LE, good black people are very frustrated that white America is like a giant with feet of clay that refuses to go after the real criminals at every level, including the black gangs, the black pimps, the white CIA drug traffickers and warmongers within the USG, Intel and the Pentagon. The majority of middle aged blacks are pro law-and-order, and desire whites to get over their guilt and take on these criminal black pimps that prey on their young girls and boys, as well as they want them to prosecute all the black and white crooks in DC (and there are a lot that need to be prosecuted). Most adult blacks are just like middle class whites, they want law and order in their communities. Most of the High level pedophile Honey traps are run by this Satanic pedophile network with the help of the Mossad, the CIA and all covered up by the FBI. Some of the young sex-trafficked victims are used as Intel honey traps to set a snare from which numerous Members of Congressman and high Military and Corporate Officials can be blackmailed and controlled. Some end up used exclusively in Satanic pedophile networks for Honey Traps used by Intel such as was described in the Book The Franklin Cover Up by Attorney John DeCamp, a personal friend of former CIA Director William Colby who was murdered after he retired. These Intel related “Honey Trap” human compromise operations are the specialty of the CIA, MI-5&6 and the Mossad. Naturally the FBI’s top managers at the Washington Field Office (WFO) are charged with keeping all these operations covered up FOREVER by using any means necessary, and this is of course authorized under so-called “national security”. Omaha ring kidnaps Johnny Gosch from his paper route and he later shows up in a photo Any good FBI agent who starts investigating these crimes, finds the investigation is immediately taken over by the WFO, and he is pulled out of it. Local Law Enforcement who get too inquisitive or try to do their jobs get stepped on in various ways to the degree necessary and are told that the investigation is now being handled by the Feds and they are no longer needed. Like with so many other USG and Intel linked RICO crime, the FBI refuses to fully investigate Intel-linked sex-trafficking and Honey Trap human compromise operations at any level. A member of the privileged elite with then underage Virginia Roberts photographed in early 2001 (file photo) Make no mistake about it, this sex trafficking in Minnesota (as well as most other sex trafficking in America) is linked to a very large worldwide, satanic-linked, organized crime pedophile network, which hides in the shadows and in secret societies. This satanic pedophile network uses Intel agencies, specifically the FBI, to keep it covered up under so-called “national security”, which is invoked to prevent exposure and public outrage. When you get right down to it, whenever national security is invoked these days, it is not referring to protecting the security of the USA, but is actually all about protecting the security, power and standing of the Rothschild Khazarian Mafia and their appointed Doofuses and Cutouts in high positions of Authority. This story of sex trafficking is the “tip of the iceberg” and involves law enforcement at all levels, failing to act for fear of retaliation and because of high level interference. It also involves Minnesota State Legislators who are refusing to take action despite numerous individuals, including one retired Law Enforcement expert, contacting them with evidence of these major crimes against children and adolescent minors. US Congressman Erik Paulsen–Doing the best he can with limited knowledge of “human compromise operations” by the various Intel agencies which are used to control politicians and USG and Corporate officials. Erik Paulsen a good man and a very well-meaning Minnesota Member of the US Congress. He has done his best, and has made an effort to fight sex-trafficking legislatively. Actually, Congressman Paulsen is one of the few good guys in Congress, who has been trying to stop this horrendous crime of sex trafficking. It is like trying to swim up a waterfall because the “fix is in” at the highest levels of government, the Pentagon and Intel with those Select few that sit at the top of the Establishment Hierarchy (EH). Sadly despite his consultations with an honest Minneapolis Vice Detective who nears retirement, he appears to not understand the way this problem must be approached to be effective in greatly reducing it and even stopping it. I sent Congressman Paulsen a request that he meet with America’s top expert of sex trafficking, prostitution and pedophilia, retired LE Detective James Rothstein (NYCPD Gold Shield Retired), and offered to facilitate the meeting. I knew such a consultation would be necessary for him to be adequately briefed on the extent of this problem of sex trafficking in Minnesota and nationwide; and without help, his actions would be doomed. And that seems to have been the case. Representative Paulson never contacted or met with Detective Rothstein. Maybe his staff screened out my request and he never got it, who knows what happened? Congressman Paulsen went on to propose legislation in the US House of Representatives entitled, “Stop Exploitation through Sex Trafficking (HR 159). This was passed in the House and sent to the Senate as (S166) where it was sent to the Judicial Committee, where it sits inactive now. Sadly, I must report that, even if passed in the US Senate as S166, HR159 is a lightweight effort with no chance of success in stopping the now rampant sex trafficking, which is a very big deal in Minnesota, as well as many other states too. Detective Rothstein has authored a draft resolution that, if adopted as law in the states, would deal a direct blow to sex trafficking by attacking the root cause of the cover up. According to a Congressional rating services, this Bill HR159/S166 has a probability of becoming passed and signed into law of about 26%, not very promising. And if passed it could never be effective anyway. _________ Proposed Solution Detective Rothstein has an excellent solution to this problem of human sex trafficking, which should be enacted into all State Laws. As Mayor his city passed a Resolution that is designed to serve as model legislation for every State of the Union. This would have real teeth if passed and implemented as State law. He has been fighting to expose all this for many years, and especially since he retired from the NYCPD, where he was a Gold Shield Detective assigned to “15 man special projects team” that also worked for the NY State Crime Commission on very sensitive matters, such as this subject. After retirement from the NYCPD as a Gold Shield Detective, Detective Rothstein eventually moved back to his home town in Minnesota and became mayor. In an effort to set a new standard for fighting Sex Trafficking, his city passed the first adequate solution to human sex trafficking — a resolution that needs to become law in every state. RESOLUTION 2014 08 ResolutionOnHumanTrafficking by yanira on Scribd _________ Detective Rothstein’s background Det. James Rothstein, NYCPD Gold Shield, Police Intel, NY Crime Commission Special Squad (now retired). America’s No. 1 expert in sex trafficking, organized pedophile human compromise ops and illegal narcotics trafficking. Responsible for the prosecution and conviction of more high level human compromise criminals than any other LE person in America. Det. Rothstein is a totally stand up man who can be trusted and has a distinguished record that is unmatched. Detective Rothstein’s background in LE involved operating at a very high level with involvement in numerous highly sensitive national security related and covered up crimes, including the international satanic and Intel linked sex Trafficking and pedophile network. During this time, the detective made numerous trips to Minnesota investigating the Minnesota Pipeline to NYC for sex trafficking and prostitution with Gary McGaughey and other ethical, stand up detectives in the Minneapolis Police Department. After retirement, Detective Rothstein moved back to his Minnesota home town to become the Mayor. He exposed the pedophile priests at St. John’s Abbey, and has continued his fight to expose the whole human sex trafficking pedophile network. Detective James Rothstein is a totally standup man, has served the NYCPD, the State of New York and all of America with great distinction. His accomplishments in LE and Police Intel would fill a book. In fact, Rothstein has a book that is pretty much complete and will be published in the not too distant future. I have read the first drafts, and I can tell you it is spellbinding to say the least. It is not an exaggeration to state that Detective Rothstein is by far the top expert on sex trafficking, organized pedophilia and drug trafficking in America. Detective Rothstein’s favorite phrase based on witnessing many years of cover ups and unwillingness for the authorities to deal with all the crimes of human compromise of politicians, and USG and corporate officials: “In our politically correct, feel-good society, there is no place for truth or for honesty.” Rothstein, a German Catholic served the NY State Crime Commission under Governor Hugh Carey as part of a special anti-corruption squad that traveled all over America investigating and arresting pedophiles. At one time, as many as 100 NYCPD Detectives were assigned to this squad. What Detective Rothstein found out was that many of these children sex trafficked from Minnesota and other locations ended up under the control of a powerful satanic linked pedophile network linked to Intel, the Establishment Hierarchy (EH), and the Secret Shadow Government (SSG). Image from April 28, 2015 Press Conference Nineteen Monk Offenders from Saint John’s Abbey in Collegeville, Minnesota (USA) It turns out many of these sex traffickers were actually pedophiles who were either working with the CIA or serving as their “protected informants”. And most of these offenders are protected because they played an important part in setting up “honey traps” to human-compromise corporate leaders, and elected or appointed USG and high state officials. Most of their work was intended to compromise weak, perverted DC politicians, and this should be no surprise to many who know how DC really works. Detective Rothstein’s career at the NYCPD was illustrious, with many national security related situations, some of which became publicized, such as the time he saved Marita Lorenz’s life and arrested Frank Sturgiss, aka Frank Fiorini, the notorious Watergate Burglar and JFK Assassination Op40 trigger-man at Dealey Plaza that terrible day 11-22-63. Detective Rothstein has continued investigating corruption since his retirement from the NYCPD and has done everything he can to expose the pedophile Priest crimes of St. John’s Abbey in Collegeville, Minnesota. St. John’s University is a separate institution and should in no way be blamed for these incredibly serious crimes of St. John’s Abbey. St. John’s Abbey should be sued into bankruptcy, with all its proceeds given to past victims and their surviving families. So far they have been protected by the local police, the FBI and the CIA. The term surviving families is appropriate here because there have been un-prosecuted murders associated with St. John’s Abbey due to police inaction. There are many secret victims of this St. John’s Abbey Pedophilia who have never come forward, and numerous suicides of victims who tried to tell, but no one would believe them. Most parents who have been told years later by their child about being abused by a St. Johns Abbey Priest have had great difficulty fathoming that their own Priest could be so two-faced and evil inside, when trusted to be alone with parish children, but then to harm them and betray their trust so seriously. Personally I would like to see St. John’s Abbey bankrupted for what they have done, completely remodeled or even torn down, and transformed into a wellness and healing center for the victims and surviving families of these Pedophile Priests of St. Johns Abbey. Even though some have died of old age and were never exposed, there are still those who have skated for their crimes against young children, and some of these still at St. John’s Abbey un-confronted, un-prosecuted and not publicly identified. _______________ Related Posts: Army Special Forces soldiers killed in Jordan were working for the CIA Motorola is Dead but Donbass lives on A Timeline of CIA Atrocities Covert strikes on Assad back on US table to prevent ‘fall of Aleppo’ – report Doctors of Death: Syrian doctors in the US and their CIA-ISIS ties The views expressed herein are the views of the author exclusively and not necessarily the views of VT, VT authors, affiliates, advertisers, sponsors, partners, technicians, or the Veterans Today Network and its assigns.

Log in to Reply JS  October 2, 2016 at 5:43 pm Dr James, Minnesota and Minneapolis/St Paul have very high numbers of American Indian women and children who are sexually trafficked and murdered, and the picture isn’t complete without mentioning them. Many are stolen from the reservations, many from city streets, and many from the child welfare/foster care system. Log in to Reply Preston James, Ph.D  October 3, 2016 at 9:46 am Very good point and so true. Fortunately there is now someone that is going to appropriately address this major problem as a separate issue in addition to Detective Rothstein. But everyone must do everything reasonably possible to expose this great evil perpetrated against Indians in Minnesota. It must be fully exposed and stopped. Right now these crimes often ending in murder are covered up. This is disgusting and must stop. The biggest power available is the mothers. If they organize they can apply more political pressure than any other group to expose this and stop it. Cosmodrome  October 2, 2016 at 8:49 am Good article! And that Resolution is a great document. Log in to Reply Preston James, Ph.D  October 2, 2016 at 10:37 am Yes, and it is based on many years of active police work by Detective Rothstein, some which involved some of the most sensitive investigation into government and Intel operations related to this involving those who are responsible for these human compromise crimes in the first place.

Yesterday was the 2 year anniversary of my daughter’s murder. All law enforcement at all levels have been complicit and negligent for years as I tried to get my daughter and granddaughter rescued. The link I posted outlines those efforts. Preston James, Ph.D  October 2, 2016 at 10:32 am So sorry to hear of your great loss. Sadly this happens to many mothers in America every years as so many children kidnapped by the sex traffickers end up murdered. Detective James Rothstein consulted with the most respected judicial experts and human behavioral experts and discussed how to stop this. He told me that the best solution they could come up with was that the Mothers had to organize and apply massive political pressure to do this and this was probably the only solution that can work right now. jensingr  October 3, 2016 at 5:38 pm I am sorry too Debra, thanks for your bravery.

Emma Yacht  October 5, 2016 at 10:05 am It occurred to me to present this petition here to help transmute some energy. “Bless, O Lord, the alters of the persecuted ones for their Highest Good in the multiverse in the name of Jesus Christ, Christos. And Heavenly Father, bind the energy of the blessed alters; make it so for time and all Eternity on every planet in every timeline in every Multiverse on every plane and in every Dimension and beyond, in the name of Jesus Christ, Christos. And heavenly Father, disintegrate the dna and disintegrate the rna of the energy-bound and blessed alters for Time and All Eternity on every Planet in every Timeline in every Multiverse on every Plane and in every dimension and beyond, in the name of Jesus Christ, Christos. And heavenly Father, remove the disintegrated dna and disintegrated rna and bound energy of the blessed alters to one dimensional points; make it so for Time and all Eternity on every planet in every timeline in every Multiverse on every plane and in every dimension and beyond, in the name of Jesus Christ, Christos. And heavenly Father, take the one dimensional points containing the disintegrated dna and disintegrated rna and bound energy of the blessed alters and put the points into black holes and annihilate the one-dimensional points inside the black holes; make it so for Time and all Eternity on every Planet in every Timeline in every Multiverse on every Plane and in every Dimension and Beyond, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, Christos, Amen.” jensingr  September 30, 2016 at 4:21 pm This goes on in most states at the highest levels and there has been a push to make sex with children a “personal sexual preference” …. Slowly but surely, the perverted satanic agenda is creeping into being the”‘norm”. The temples of Baal being set up everywhere is next. Log in to Reply JohninMK  September 30, 2016 at 7:40 am It seems remarkable that Detective Rothstein is still alive to tell the tale. A very brave man indeed. Log in to Reply Preston James, Ph.D  September 30, 2016 at 8:49 am Yes, but he has strong friends and allies in some very high places. He has always been a stand up man, someone whose word is always kept and who has proved many times he can be trusted by informants and even those he arrested. He always played by the rules and has been fair and square. Actually he has had the biggest most loyal informants one could ever imagine because of this. His book when it comes out will detail this and why he has been trusted and revered so much by informants, many whom he rescued and protected from this sex trafficking and prostitution horror. To this very day much of this network of informants is intact and functioning. Numerous FBI agents have come to him over the years who were assigned to investigate these crimes and they would ask him, “how far can I go before I lose my job or get sent to Butte Montana chasing stolen cars?” He always would advise them the ways they could do the most good without losing their jobs. The WFO has always been the main cover up agent in all this just like it is now with so many high level crimes by the RKM and the super-elite deviants who use the law and the USG to protect themselves, often invoking so-called national security which is only their own security and has nothing to do with real security of America or We The People. wjabbe  September 30, 2016 at 2:47 am My late Mother and Father were both born in the State of Minnesota; she in St. Paul to immigrant parents from Denmark and Norway and he in a small town to parents with roots to Germany. With the exception of picking potatoes in the hot sun, and the cold weather, they loved this State. They would have been very upset at reading this excellent but disturbing report on evil activities in their birthplace. I am frankly glad they are not alive to read the article because it is so upsetting. Thanks to Dr. James for a very powerful but disturbing report. Every time we think our government may have reached rock bottom, we discover it was a false floor. The Catholic Church is also a world wide criminal enterprise which should be banned from operating in our country. My Mother was a high school English teacher and Librarian; my Father was a mechanical engineer; both graduated from the University of Minnesota one of the top universities in the world. They would have regarded the disclosures in this article as evil and disgraceful to all mankind. This is one of Dr. James most powerful articles yet.

Log in to Reply Preston James, Ph.D  September 29, 2016 at 8:47 pm Great comment Khalid Talaat. And usually the hard truths are very politically incorrect. concernedvet5  October 1, 2016 at 9:39 am When stopping “political correctness” gets the most thunderous applause at Trump rallys, more so than terrorism, the wall, or anything else…I know we have a problem with definition of terms. That term can mean anything to anyone at anytime. Its a relative term, so it behooves anyone writing about it to DEFINE exactly what they mean when they bring it up. Stating that homosexuality is involved in this is nothing new. What is “politically incorrect” about saying that? Are all homosexuals involved in human trafficking? Not so by a long shot. So why is the term PC used to unecessarily obscure this conversation about literal vampirism? The truth is that this issue is about structures of hidden power that have existed on this planet for a long time, and the factions to be concerned at this moment are ones that base thier actions and beliefs on vampirism. Instead of empowering themselves from the abundant energy of the planet and cosmos, they feed off of the literal energy, fear and and blood of other humans. Satanic cults do this. Every war can be also easily used as a ritual sacrifice because of the energy generated by the spilling of blood…making this planet a very popular feeding ground with several entiites. Those in these factions are men, women, straight, gay, and all shades in between. Its about the actions, not about the race or sexual orientation. Not focused on PC or not being PC…just focused on being correct. Emma Yacht  October 1, 2016 at 11:47 am Dear Concerned, what is politically incorrect is to name blacks as being involved in crime in America to any extent.Additionally, I read your comment that you propose absolving Gays of sexual predation. Is that what you intend?Because, I think that Political Correctness is literally defined as what you just did, which was to come along & lecture someone else about definition of terms in a flurry of semantics.You are implying that the Gays are no more involved with pedophilia than straights,(with “Oh, no… it’s just the vampires who do it”) but many readers are on to your scheme, & are oh so very sick of the satanic hogwash embodied in your argument.Because, here’s the problem–anytime that someone comes along & “lectures” anyone else about “What they should think & HOW they should think” with the catchall “define your terms” decoy, is attempting to subvert the larger conversation to Methodology rather than the intransigent Problem itself.Now, you say it’s spiritual vampirism & not the innocent gays, who,despite their movement’s protestations to the contrary, have all along been happily part of a larger FrankfurtSchool Conquest-of-America Agenda via the LGBTIQ Movement-but numerous Gays can not even admit that fact to themselves, since they themselves have fallen victim to mind-kontrol by the Matrix.Americans easily distinguish between homosexuals and pedophiles.. no problem.Anyone who defends pedophiles by deflecting culpability as you do makes me question their motive. Agin  October 1, 2016 at 2:23 pm Dear Emma Yacht, there are different levels of communication going on here (I am not necessarily disagreeing with you.) Concernedvet5 is addressing a specific level (of communication) which is related to a previous article from Dr. J on the switch to the esoteric. You will have to speak a language that they will understand. Many of these groups are Saturnic (as in devouring their young). I was in a discussion with a member of one of these groups in which I asked why he would prey on the weak (women or children). “Evil” is considered a human concept for the mundanes. He asked whether I felt rape or pedophilia was “evil”. I told him it is a disease for which True eviL (Live) is the cure. He correctly understood that as a death sentence. I leave this to whom it may concern: “There is a 6th principle too, though it is not part of the (sanskrit) Tan. It is connected to the Abyss, it is a defender, though it really seems more like a Child: Innocence. This Innocence is like a “sparkle in the Eye of the Great Dark” like a shining diamond child, metaphorically speaking. ALL Black or LHP magicians KNOW this! NONE would harm it!” Emma Yacht  October 1, 2016 at 3:37 pm Very interesting Agin. I admit that I don’t use the lingua franca that you two are using. I don’t know how you would align your Defender that springs from the Abyss to this pedophile problem. In my understanding, if we who are eternal souls continue to turn our backs on the idiotic harvesting of nonconsenting “young blood”, then we are culpable. Notwithstanding the sparkle in the eye of the great Dark, there are forces that bow to no star or “sparkle” and these forces will emanate from Source (the source of light and dark which is also the source of thinking about light and dark), both in the quantum intelligence multiverse and the atomic carbon manifestation of the multiverse, and these forces shall bind and disintegrate the rogue harvesters in every dimension and beyond, and in every imagined or nonimagined timeline of the Oneness. That’s the best way I can explain it without getting into the methodology. The current fractal holographic units will be rolled up and there will be consequences for the actors and their ephemeral props, but I sincerely doubt that the rogue harvesters will receive cosmic Tony Awards for their playacting. They just won’t be invited back, due to their lower harmonic frequency which is being phased out due to obsolescence. Diesel Chadron  October 1, 2016 at 5:33 pm Khalid, your contribution is right on. I have 3 uncle’s who were victims of this crap (two from Catholic church). Two are gay. Of the two molested in Catholic church, one actually got married with kids and denies anything happened at their private weekend getaways. The other is openly gay, ‘bottom boy’. Both are very damaged, prone to cruelty. Agin  October 1, 2016 at 9:36 pm Emma Yacht: Darkness is the absence of *visible* light. Therefore one could say that Darkness IS Light that is not visible.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 29, 2016 at 5:19PM Image source: Intel.  The year 2012 wasn't great for microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). The company, which at the time derived 64% of its revenue from the sale of chips that go into personal computers, was blindsided as sales of personal computers unexpectedly began to slump. The cause of this deterioration was widely believed to be due to potential personal computer customers opting instead to purchase tablets like Apple's iPad.  The significant shortfall in demand for Intel's chips led the chip-maker to incur what are called "excess capacity charges" as it cut production of PC chips. Indeed, according to Intel's then-Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith, factory utilization during the company's fourth quarter 2012 earnings call were "below 50%." Remember, it costs billions of dollars to build these chip factories. The costs of these factories shows up in the income statement as depreciation, which adds to a company's cost-of-goods sold. The more revenue that a company can pump out of a factory in a given quarter, the higher the company's gross margins should be as those fixed depreciation costs are spread across a greater number of units.  So, when a company's factories are sitting there half-idle, the company is still bearing the full brunt of those depreciation charges while bringing in much lower revenue. Obviously, excess capacity isn't good. To this day, there are still some investors who believe that Intel's chip manufacturing facilities are substantially under-utilized and that the company needs to succeed in new growth markets in order to fill those factories. That's just not true. Some background Capacity planning for a given manufacturing technology is something that is done well in advance of the start of production. Indeed, on Intel's January 2013 earnings call, Smith told investors that the money that the company would be spending on capital equipment throughout 2013 would be in support of "the peak of 14-nanometer" unit demand as well as the "start of the ramp of the 10 [nanometer technology]." This means that it's up to management to try to make their best guesses today as to what kind of unit demand it will see at least a year out. Forecasting these things correctly is tough, especially when the majority of a company's unit demand is expected to come from highly volatile market segments. To make things even harder, there can be very severe consequences to either substantially under-shooting or over-shooting demand expectations. Over-shooting (at least by too much -- Intel has indicated in the past that it intentionally builds some extra capacity, which Smith referred to as "white space," in order to handle potentially better-than-expected demand) means unproductive (and thus costly) capacity.  This hurts margins and ultimately eats into profits.  Under-shooting means that the company won't be able to satisfy all of the demand for its products, which means revenue (and profits) left on the table.  With that in mind, we're now in a good position to understand why the "excess capacity myth" is just that -- a myth. Intel has brought down capacity substantially In the table below, I show Intel's capital expenditures from 2012 through 2015 as well as its projected capital expenditures in 2016 for logic products (Intel says it will be spending about $1.5 billion on non-volatile memory related production capacity, so I've excluded this): Year Logic capital expenditures (in $billions) 2012 11 2013 10.7 2014 10.1 2015 7.3 2016 8 Data source: Intel. Notice that there has been a clear trend downward in the company's capital spending over the last several years. This reduction in spending reflects the reality that Intel is selling far fewer personal computer processors today than it used to, so it doesn't need to build out as much capacity. Further, if we take a look at the following slide from Intel's 2015 investor meeting, we see that the reductions in overall capital spending actually mask the true reduction in logic capacity related spending: Image source: Intel. Intel's capacity related spending dropped sharply in 2013 relative to 2012 (when it became clear that tablets were eating into the personal computer market) and stayed about flat in 2014. Intel then reported a large drop in capacity spending in 2015 and is expecting to see a modest increase in 2016. The trend, however, is clear: spending on capacity has come down quite a bit over the last several years. This reduction in capacity-related spending is indicative of Intel right-sizing the amount of capacity it puts in to make sure that it can keep its factories at reasonably high utilization rates. And, given that the company's gross profit margins over the last couple of years have been quite high (higher utilization usually means better margins, lower utilization hurts margins), it's quite unlikely that Intel has substantial amounts of capacity sitting there idle.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

By 2020, there will be more than 50 billion connected devices and 200 billion sensors, and they will generate tens of zeta-bytes of data. With unprecedented data abundance, big data presents transformative opportunities yet brings significant challenges for businesses to exploit the data. Bringing the Information Together: Data Integration In addition to the enormous volume, big data comes from variety of sources. How to bring the data together and provide users with a unified view becomes significantly important. Data integration helps address the need and is nothing new. Early architectures for integrating data from heterogeneous databases include Integrated Public Use Microdata Series designed by University of Minnesota (IPUMS), mediated schema, semantic integration, and more. With big data growing rapidly and traditional systems unable to keep up, organizations started adopting data lake solutions like Apache Hadoop for data integration. A Data Lake helps create one repository for data in an organization, including structured data, semi-structured data, unstructured data, and binary data. The organization then expands its data lake with data processing and analytics capabilities to derive business insight. As data lakes are adopted, a new problem surfaces: the organization has existing systems which have been used for insight and decision making, so how can it bring these insights together? A data hub tries to address this problem by delivering a unified platform that can bring diverse data sources together and enable users to gain insight from a collection of frameworks for data processing, interactive analytics, and real time processing. Getting the Right Information: Data Governance Effective use of data integration for decision-making relies on more than having the best data lake or data hub architecture. For transportation, finance services, manufacturing, or other verticals, data comes from real-time and continuous feeding; the data is naturally messy. It is challenging for organizations to identify the “relevant” and “trustworthy” information. It requires continuous governance of the data coming in. The data needs to be well understood; noise and abnormality need to be removed; and the data needs to become meaningful to the problem being analyzed. Enterprise-grade data governance helps address several aspects: auditability, metadata and taxonomy management and data lifecycle management. Auditability ensures consistent ways to track data access, data origin and data usage. Metadata provides description of other data, e.g. attributes that define or describe a document. Taxonomy categorizes the data into hierarchical relationship. Successful metadata and taxonomy management ensure data is managed in a consistent way in the data lake/hub and provide a meaningful context for understanding their values. Data lifecycle management tracks the data from ingestion, storage, recovery and backup to retirement, ensures data is of high quality and is accessible to relevant users.   A Data Lake helps create one repository for data in an organization, including structured data, semi-structured data, unstructured data, and binary data   Generating Real Time Insight: Streaming Technologies Great data means nothing if it does not deliver the needed business insight. Data analytics have been broadly used by organizations to gain insight for improving efficiency, outperforming competitions, and creating growth opportunities. However, with fast growth of IOT and connected devices, organizations are no longer satisfied with back-end analytics itself. There is a clear trend to have end-to-end real time analytics, which instantly brings information from sources together with decisions. Financial services, healthcare, transportation and other sectors are accelerating investment in streaming analytics from client to cloud and the data center. Apache Spark, Apache Flink, and Apache Storm* are open source examples supporting streaming analytics.  Streaming analytics allows continuous ingestion of live streaming data from IOT or other connected devices, provides faster insights, and performs actions promptly before the data loses its value. For example, the financial industry with its wide range of products, services, and customer interaction channels, have seen fraud risks increase tremendously. Financial institutions are turning to streaming technologies for exploiting and analyzing huge volume of data instantly in order to identify and stop fraudulent behavior. Streaming analytics also opens the opportunity for healthcare providers to constantly monitor the health situation of patients, diagnose and detect disease at the earliest signs as well as bring prompt and personalized treatment. Companies like Intel have been working with healthcare providers on collaborative cancer cloud and genomics analytics. Making the Insight Adaptive: Webscale Artificial Intelligence Big data analytics needs to analyze large collections of data, extract complex data representations, and inference patterns in order to generate the insight. As the data volume, variety, velocity, and veracity grow exponentially, it is becoming more complicated to discover the patterns. Artificial Intelligence (AI), thanks to its abilities inspired by biological processes for hierarchical learning and layered data abstraction, helps address these problems. AI has been in place for decades, yet has not gained significant momentum until recent years due to inadequate compute power and inadequate data volume. Training performance has been a conventional area for improving AI. However, the bigger challenge for AI in big data analytics is to improve its scalability, e.g. its data scalability, model scalability, and node scalability.  When organizations apply AI to big data infrastructure, it’s found that the need to resolve the scalability is more urgent than improving the training performance. There have been some good attempts in improving the scalability. A few years ago, Google developed a software framework, DistBelief, to train a deep learning model with billions of parameters using tens of thousands of CPU cores for speech recognition and computer vision. In addition to model and compute scalability, DistBelief also supported data parallelism. In recent years, Intel reported its collaboration with customers to improve modeling and data scalability thru Apache Spark, resulting in machine learning capability running on 100s or even 1000s of CPU servers, with tens of billions of unique features, and/or billions of edge graphs.  Another need from these organizations is an end to end pipeline for AI, from data ingestion, data management, feature management, feature engineering, to model training and validation, for simplifying AI implementation on big data infrastructure. Summary Ninety percent of the data in the world today was generated in past few years. The power of big data is that it can process large and complex data sets very fast and generate better insight than conventional methods. Having an effective analytics solution for insight takes well-designed data integration, data governance, streaming, AI, and holistically optimized solution stack. Although Data analytics has not reached maturity, thanks to fast technology advancement, real-time and meaningful insight it has become possible to make efficient business decisions that improve our lives.  Read Also 'What-If IT: A Management Must in Uncertain Times' Lokesh Jindal, GM, IT Business Management, CA Technologies Why WebRTC is Critical to Your Communications Strategy Dan Cunningham, CTO, ReadyTalk Embracing JavaScript for Web development and beyond Aaron Gette, CIO, The Bay Club Company Preparing for the possibilities of the Internet of Things Daniel Sholler, VP Platform and Technology, Infor Data Integration Special Edition UPCOMING ISSUE Nominate Now WHITEPAPERS Disaster Recovery Services Disaster Recovery Guide: DR in Virtualized Environments Contract Management The Ideal Buyers Guide To Contract Management Software Disruption is Dead - Why Users Are the Inspiration for True Innovation?

We all have precious information, and we all need to store it somewhere. What happens when you’re not around your computer? For system administrators, physicians, lawyers, and journalists, protecting information is critically important. Sometimes it is even a life or death matter. And yet, when it comes to the computing hardware we all use everyday, most of us don’t even take the simple precautions that we use to protect our money. ORWL was created to bridge this gap and bring hardened physical security to personal computing. Features & Specifications Processor: Intel Skylake M3 (without vPro) or M7 (with vPro) Graphics: Integrated Intel 515 chipset supports 4K output Ports: 2X USB 3.0 Type C, 1X micro HDMI Power: External power adapter connects to either USB 3.0 port Memory: 8 GB Storage: 120 or 480 GB SSD with automatic AES 256-bit encryption Connectivity: Bluetooth 4.1, Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac Operating Systems: Ubuntu and other GNU/Linux systems, Windows 10 Secure Microcontroller: MAX32550 DeepCover Secure Cortex-M3 with projected 6-month unplugged battery life Authentication: NFC + BLE key fob and user password Dimensions: 130 mm diameter, 30 mm height, 400 g weight Datasheet: PDF (3.79 MB) Physically Secure Among information security professionals, it’s a truism that once somebody has physical access to your computer, it’s game over. Software exploits to steal data take a lot of time, money, and/or skill to pull off, and are only fleetingly effective before the vulnerability is patched. On the other hand, there are many fast, cheap, and easy ways to steal data once an adversary has physical access to your computer. The internals of a desktop or laptop computer are easily accessed and tapped for information, not to mention the myriad ways computer peripherals can hide malicious eavesdropping devices or otherwise be corrupted to work against you. This is where ORWL comes in. ORWL was designed specifically to prevent undetected tampering with any of its electrical components, including the entire motherboard and storage drive. When tampering is detected, ORWL immediately and irrevocably erases all your data, even if it is unplugged at the time. Secure Microcontroller A battery-backed secure microcontroller (MAX32550 DeepCover Secure Cortex-M3) is integrated into the motherboard. It verifies the integrity of all firmware prior to boot, controls the power to rest of the Intel platform that runs the operating system, interfaces directly to an OLED display and NFC and BLE gateway for communicating with the secure key fob, and constantly monitors a dedicated inertial measurement unit, the active mesh (see below), the internal temperature, and input power voltage for any tampering. The battery itself is projected to last about six months without being connected to power. This chip was chosen because it is powerful (108 MHz Cortex M3) and offers the highest level of security, with features that you simply cannot reproduce with general purpose microcontrollers. These features include: side channel scan protection, flip-flop based key storage, encrypted SNVRAM, glitching protection, crypto acceleration, die shield with dynamic fault detection, temperature monitoring, integrated real-time clock, true random number generation, and dedicated tamper-sensor mesh monitoring. Encrypted Drive ORWL’s solid state drive, an Intel SSD 540s Series, natively supports full drive encryption. The drive’s cryptographic key is generated and stored inside the secure microcontroller. The secure microcontroller provides this key to the SSD only after verifying the integrity of the system. Upon any tampering, the secure microcontroller instantly erases the encryption key, causing all data on the SSD to be irrevocably lost. Enveloping Active Mesh The entire ORWL system is encased in an active clamshell mesh formed by laser direct structuring (LDS), a technique for creating a resin material with finely printed circuitry designed to shatter when drilled. This mesh prevents access to any hardware component. LDS is a tamper-proofing technology used for many high security applications in banking, aerospace, defense – including hardware security modules (HSMs), security tokens, automated teller machines (ATMs), telecom crypto-key protection, defense electronics, and medical devices. Opening the clamshell will relieve pressure switches, which will cause the secure microcontroller to delete the SSD’s encryption key. The secure microcontroller constantly monitors the mesh by sending random data through it and measuring the impedance of each trace. Drilling or cutting the LDS clamshell breaks the continuity of the printed circuit, again resulting in the deletion of the encryption key. Shorting, bypassing, or otherwise changing the geometry of any of the traces will result in an impedance change, which similarly results in the deletion of the encryption key. The traces of the printed circuit are microns thick, have a nominal width of 0.3 mm, and a nominal spacing of 0.5 mm. You can always carefully open the clamshell yourself if you want to know what’s inside, but not without destroying the encryption key. After closing it, you will have to generate a new SSD encryption key and reinstall the entire system. Secure Key Fob Each ORWL comes with a key fob that uses the same authentication technology as smart-cards, with an added ability to detect proximity. After the initial pairing of the key fob with the ORWL to generate a shared secret, the key fob’s near field communication (NFC) is used to authenticate the user, at which point the key fob’s uses Bluetooth (BLE) to monitor whether or not the user is within range. Once a user goes out of range, ORWL will lock, requiring the key fob’s NFC authentication to unlock. The key fob is built around the STMicroelectronics ST54D a secure chipset conforming to ISO/IEC 14443 Type A running in card emulation mode. This controller handles NFC communication and includes several security features, such as a protected memory space and an on-die mesh that will trigger data erasure if tampered with. Within ORWL itself, a NXP CLRC663 chipset is used for NFC communciation and is controlled directly by the Maxim secure microcontroller. Communication between key fob and computer is encrypted and codes (including UUID) are synchronously updated on a regular basis. We will publish our source code for the NFC and BLE chipsets and provide support to develop custom solutions on them. OLED Display ORWL has an onboard OLED display for indicating its state: powered down, locked, and unlocked. The OLED display is entirely controlled by the secure microcontroller and is inaccessible from the operating system. More Information Much more detailed information about ORWL, its subsystems and components, and the design decisions that went into them can be found on our ever evolving wiki and in the ORWL product requirements document (PRD). Security Certification We are actively pursuing getting ORWL certified as a cryptographic module under a US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Federal Information Processing Standard known as FIPS 140-2. This is the standard under which the US government, financial institutions, health care providers, and other regulated industries store and process sensitive data. FIPS 140-2 Security Level 4 The FIPS 140-2 specification, defines four levels of certification, with level four being the most stringent: Security Level 4 provides the highest level of security defined in this standard. At this security level, the physical security mechanisms provide a complete envelope of protection around the cryptographic module with the intent of detecting and responding to all unauthorized attempts at physical access. Penetration of the cryptographic module enclosure from any direction has a very high probability of being detected, resulting in the immediate zeroization of all plaintext CSPs. Security Level 4 cryptographic modules are useful for operation in physically unprotected environments. Security Level 4 also protects a cryptographic module against a security compromise due to environmental conditions or fluctuations outside of the module’s normal operating ranges for voltage and temperature. Intentional excursions beyond the normal operating ranges may be used by an attacker to thwart a cryptographic module’s defenses. A cryptographic module is required to either include special environmental protection features designed to detect fluctuations and zeroize CSPs, or to undergo rigorous environmental failure testing to provide a reasonable assurance that the module will not be affected by fluctuations outside of the normal operating range in a manner that can compromise the security of the module. We are working toward and believe we have a very good chance of achieving FIPS 140-2 Security Level 4 certification, which would make ORWL the first personal computer to be so certified. Third-party Penetration Testing Complying with the certification requirements of FIPS 140-2 Security Level 4 is a complex, often lengthy process that takes highly specialized knowledge. To audit our work and guide us toward certification, we have engaged Penumbra Security, a NIST-accredited information security firm specializing in FIPS 140-2 compliance testing. Penumbra’s initial audit of ORWL has already resulted in several improvements to the design. We intend to continue working with Penumbra throughout the certification process. Open Source Security through obscurity is not security. We want the inner workings of ORWL to be transparent, so that it can receive the inspection necessary to build real trust. You shouldn’t need to take our word on how secure ORWL really is - you should be able to see for yourself. ORWL is a complex product, with many pieces that could possibly be open sourced. As such, we are still working through exactly which licenses will be used and how best to make available all the information. We will make updates on this page in the coming days. Here’s what we know and are committed to at this point: We will make available all source schematic and layout files, not just PDFs and Gerber files. We will make available all software under our control, including BIOS firmware, secure controller firmware, and key fob firmware. In order to maintain a competitive manufacturing advantage, some, but not all, of the source we make available will be released under a non-commercial license. For example, we will likely release the PCB layout source files under a non-commercial license, but the BIOS firmware will not have that restriction. For those sources not under our control, in particular the datasheet for the secure controller, we will work closely with our partners to make as much information available as possible. We are open to feedback! Please contact us with any comments, suggestions, or questions. Sign up for reminder emails above and watch this space for updates. We anticipate having all licenses sorted out very soon. Enclosures, Assembly, and Rack-mounting ORWL is available with a glass enclosure (as shown in most of the images on this page), a plastic enclosure that is roughly the same dimensions as the glass enclosure, and bare without any enclosure. ORWL with a plastic enclosure The glass enclosure is heat formed, then machined and polished. The glass is 2.8 mm thick and chemically hardened, so that it will not accidentally break when dropped: the target drop resilience is 0.6 meter onto marble. ORWL is designed to be easily (though carefully) disassembled and reassembled. Disassembling ORWL will erase the encryption key, rendering encrypted user data inaccessible. You will have to regenerate an SSD key and install a new operating system. That said, and because you should have backups of your data anyway, disassembly is possible provided you are careful. We cannot assume liability if you were to break the shield or any other part while disassembling. For ease of assembly, the screws are all identical: black, same length, with a Torx T8 head. Up to three bare ORWLs without any enclosures can be mounted to a specially made 1U rackmount chassis. ORWL’s key fob behavior can be configured to accommodate server use. ORWL rackmount chassis Limited Edition Aluminum Carrying Case As a small token of our appreciation for our early backers’ help getting ORWL off the ground, all ORWL units ordered during the campaign will include at no additional charge an aluminum carrying case with custom foam cutouts for securely and stylishly transporting ORWL and all its accessories. Dimensions: 12.5” x 5” x 9” Weight (fully loaded): 3.9 lbs Why Intel? Isn’t x86 Considered Harmful? This project is about having a standard, physically secure computer that anyone can use – as open as we can make it. All these concepts are important, and they mean that x86 and flawless out-of-the-box Windows support are not optional. There are reasons everyone is using x86, even in the security community and in governmental agencies around the world: compatibility, performance, and security. Make no mistake, some of us own Yeeloongs, and others are veterans of the silicon industry. We would love to ship a completely free and usable desktop processor, but we know very well that there is no alternative. Some people seem to think that switching to AMD can solve problems related Intel’s Management Engine (ME), microcode, or SMM. It doesn’t, as there are equivalents of these technologies in all recent x86 processors. Qubes OS Qubes OS is widely considered to be one of the most secure operating systems available. It relies on compartmentalizing the operating system into virtual machines so that, for example, an exploit in your browser doesn’t affect pieces outside your browser, such as your keyboard and mouse. ORWL meets all the minimum and recommended system requirements for running Qubes OS, including a processor that supports VT-x and VT-d. We offer Qubes OS as one of the pre-installed operating system options. Alternative BIOS We will not ship machines with Boot Guard “Verified Boot” activated. While we do implement a firmware verification mechanism on the microcontroller, you can choose to provision your own signing keys or not to use it at all. Firmware Verification, Reflashing, and Hacking ORWL is designed to be hackable. We will provide instructions on the ORWL wiki detailing how to perform various firmware verification, reflashing, and modification, as well as replacing parts such as the SSD. Of course, by design, opening ORWL results in all data being lost, thereby requiring a full system reinstallation. Specific Attacks and Mitigations The following are some of the specific attacks ORWL protects against. Cold Boot Attacks: Cold boot attacks consist of removing the DRAM or power-cycling the machine in order to read the memory content. The DRAM is often chilled to slow down the loss of information that occurs when the cells are no longer refreshed. Mitigations: The DRAM is soldered, and protected by the active clamshell mesh. Cooling down the secure microcontroller will trigger a tamper event, erasure of the encryption key, and system power down. Encryption keys are only stored in the main memory by the UEFI for an extremely short time before they are passed to the SED, and are securely memset’ed long before the OS is booted. When the machine is put in sleep mode while the user is away, the key is not stored in the main memory nor in the SED controller memory. To prevent other kinds of attacks on the memory content, the entire RAM is wiped before the OS is booted. UEFI etc. Attacks: UEFI BIOS, SMM attacks, and all sorts of platform vulnerabilities allow an attacker to run very privileged code that is both invisible to the OS and capable of achieving persistence by modifying the SPI flash. The UEFI image can also be modified by physical access to the component. Mitigations: We are in direct contact with the UEFI vendor and will work on patching public vulnerabilities. In the event that an attacker is able to exploit an SMM, UEFI, or platform vulnerability, there is no vector for persistence. The SPI flash Write Protection is controlled by the secure microcontroller, and the update process can be tied to a specific key fob or pin. The SPI flash content is also verified at every boot, before the Intel subsystem even receives power. Finally the external verification process allows you to easily read the flash and verify it. DMA Attacks: External DMA attacks over PCIe or Firewire can allow an attacker to read the memory content while the machine is running. Mitigations: We do not expose DMA-capable ports externally. For internal ports, the SED we selected is not PCIe capable. The Intel processor also supports VT-d, allowing you to block this class of attacks from software. Interdiction Attacks: The device is intercepted during shipping, modified, then forwarded to its destination. Mitigations: The system PIN will be shipped under separate cover, as is done with credit card or debit card PINs. If the device is opened for tampering prior to arrival, the root of trust (SSD encryption key) is deleted. Replacing this requires a paired key fob and the PIN. The result is that the owner will not be able to successfully boot the device if it’s been tampered with in this way. Because you have visibility into firmware, most software implants are very risky to use for your attackers. The hardware is protected by the shield, and the OLED screen that is the only exposed component is protected by a dedicated mesh. The screen’s flexible flat cable has a mesh on both sides, and is just as long as required. The space between the glass enclosure and the shield is also minimized. USB Fuzzing Attacks: A malicious USB device is inserted into an external USB port and used to find and exploit vulnerabilities in the USB host’s drivers. Mitigations: When the key fob is out of range (e.g., the user leaves the room with the key fob), ORWL goes into a lock down mode in which the data lines for all external USB ports are disconnected, which renders connected USB devices ineffective. Relay Attacks: An adversary steals an ORWL and replaces it with a replica, which then relays communication between the key fob and the original ORWL in order to unlock the original. Mitigations: ORWL employs time-of-flight analysis to detect relay attacks and rotating keys to foil them outright. Manufacturing Plan We’ve manufactured and tested several design and engineering iterations of ORWL prototypes. We are now ready for the first production run. If this campaign successfully reaches its funding goal, we will start production and wrap up what BIOS development remains to make ORWL feature complete. We (Design Shift) have years of experience in product design, engineering, and manufacturing, with full-time staff in both our Menlo Park and Taipei offices. Our manufacturing partner for ORWL is Taiwan-based Quanta Computer, one of the world’s largest computer manufacturers. We are also working directly with many of our suppliers, such as Intel, STMicroelectronics, and Maxim. Risks & Challenges Our team and partners have copious experience mitigating the supply chain risks inherent in manufacturing any nontrivial product and have taken the same care with ORWL. On our website, you can see some of the products we’ve previously designed and brought to market, such as the X1 Digital Camera, Clover point-of-sale system, and the Robin by Nextbit smartphone. The biggest risk in bringing ORWL to life is not whether it can be done, but how long it will take. We’ve laid out a conservative delivery schedule, but of course there may be surprises along the way that change that schedule. The biggest risk in this regard is the remaining BIOS development. While we have already made significant strides in the BIOS, there are some features that are not yet complete. In preparation for finishing the BIOS, we are currently in talks with a professional BIOS development team. Regardless of how the production schedule evolves over time, we commit to publicly and transparently communicating ORWL’s production status together with updated estimates of the delivery schedule.

Wait a couple of years for second-gen Small fry Scale offers single-node HCI boxen for the ROBO crowd Data management services have to get proactive – Acronis Comment Objective Analysis analyst Jim Handy has come up with a theory which he claims explains why Intel and Micron’s 3d XPoint memory will not meet its original performance claims. As Intel marketing droids have said, there is a difference between raw media access latency and SSD product access latency. Handy takes a (heh heh) handy SNIA chart graphically explaining this and modifies it to look at a PCIe MLC NAND SSD and a potential NVME XPoint SSD. In his report Handy approximates how the NAND SSD data read access time is taken up by six elements which the IO access has to traverse: Tread - time from the application processor putting out a memory address to the media chip returning valid data xfer - time to transfer data from chip to SSD output pins Misc - internal housekeeping; address translation; average garbage collection time Link Xfer - time to transfer data across PCIe interface Platform + adapter - time to travel from host’s IO port to processor pins Software - time for host’s operating system IO stack to perform read operation Here’s Handy’s chart: Our modified Jim Handy modification of SNIA SSD latency delay graphic. The horizontal axis shows access time in microseconds and we should firstly note that it is illustrative rather than accurate in a detailed timing sense. Take that on-board and look at the final three elements on the top SSD bar: link xfr, platform + adapter, and software. These elements are separate and independent from what happens on the SSD itself. The third point is that a change from NAND to XPoint media will affect the first three elements. A NAND-to-XPoint media shift may radically reduce these three items but won’t affect the other three, with the result that they contribute a proportionally larger part to the access latency. The chart compares NAND and XPoint PCIe SSDs. Handy makes the point that XPoint DIMMs will be much faster than XPoint SSDs, as indeed NAND DIMMs are faster than NAND SSDs. This will further reduce the Link XFer and Platform + adapter contributions to access latency, leaving the (larger) software contribution unaffected. Operating system and application software changes will be needed to sidestep the current OS IO stack and more direct access to the data presented by an XPoint DIMM, he claims. Such changes will also benefit NAND DIMMs, of course. Intel is also being criticised for seemingly over-stating XPoint’s endurance and density compared to NAND, and this explanation about why XPoint SSD latency is so slow doesn’t explain the differences between the original density and endurance claims and the newer ones now appearing. Intel said last week: "We stand by the performance figures we have shared publicly to date for both Intel Optane SSDs, pre-production and prototype versions, as well as 3D XPoint memory media. System level performance is determined by the full collection of components, with media being only one of these components. We are seeing great improvements over NAND-based SSDs – up to 10x throughput and 4x latency reductions – in prototype SSD hardware. Intel Optane technology-based SSDs will be Intel’s highest performance and endurance SSDs when they come to market. We will disclose final product performance and specifications at the products’ launch in coming months.” When we raised the supposed speed issue with the firm, an Intel spokesperson said: "Intel is not going to comment further on this topic at this time." ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 11 Comments More from The Register Peglar on the hoof: Micron flash and XPoint VP legs it Exits loss-making company for pastures new Micron sets a canary to watch over its stock in case of takeover Poison pill filing sparks speculation about aggressive buy-out action 5 Comments Micron, VMware, Supermicro, Nexenta doodle array designs Cosy club comes up with flashy little reference architecture Intel and Micron's XPoint: Is it PCM?

Santa Clara, CA – WEBWIRE – Thursday, September 29, 2016 Female comedian superstar Amy Schumer knocked electronic dance music (EDM) DJ Armin van Buuren off of the list to become the most dangerous celebrity to search for online, according to Intel Security. Now in its 10th year, the McAfee Most Dangerous Celebrities study, published by Intel Security, researched a broad list of well-known figures including actors, comedians, musicians, TV hosts, athletes and more. This research uncovers which celebrities generate the most dangerous search results that could expose fans to viruses and malware while searching for the latest information on todays pop culture icons. Amy Schumer is considered to be one of the most popular female comedians who is also known for her work as a writer, actress and producer. Now Schumer can add first female comedian to take the No.1 spot on the McAfee Most Dangerous Celebrities study to her list of achievements. Justin Bieber came in hot on her heels at No. 2, followed by Today and The Voice host Carson Daly (No. 3). Schumer is also accompanied by comedian peers in the top 10 with Chris Hardwick (No. 7) and Daniel Tosh (No. 8). Former rapper turned Hollywood A-lister Will Smith is joined by chart-topping musicians such as Rihanna (No. 5), Miley Cyrus (No. 6), Selena Gomez (No. 9) and Kesha (No. 10), rounding out the top 10 list. Savvy cybercriminals continue to leverage consumers ongoing fascination with celebrity news  such as award and TV shows as well as movie premieres, album releases, celebrity breakups and more  to entice unsuspecting fans to visit sites loaded with malware that can steal passwords and personal information. The study conducted by Intel Security highlights the various ways hackers can take advantage of consumers interest around pop culture news, the risks of their online behavior and how to best protect themselves from potential threats. Consumers today remain fascinated with celebrity culture and go online to find the latest pop culture news, said Gary Davis, chief consumer security evangelist at Intel Security. With this craving for real-time information, many search and click without considering potential security risks. Cybercriminals know this and take advantage of this behavior by attempting to lead them to unsafe sites loaded with malware. As a result, consumers need to understand what precautions to take to enable safe online experiences. A Search for Amy Schumer Torrent Results in a 33 Percent Chance of Connecting to a Malicious Website Amy Schumer topping the list highlights the trend of more people looking to cut the cord and move away from cable TV. Consumers are now, more than ever, streaming videos, TV shows and movies online. As file sharing and torrent use continues to grow in popularity, its no surprise that TV and movies are a target for cybercriminals seeking to create malicious files. The top 10 celebrities from this years study with the highest risk percentages include: Position         Celebrity                    Percentage 1                      Amy Schumer            16.11% 2                      Justin Bieber              15.00% 3                      Carson Daly               13.44% 4                      Will Smith                   13.44% 5                      Rihanna                      13.33% 6                      Miley Cyrus                12.67% 7                      Chris Hardwick           12.56% 8                      Daniel Tosh                11.56% 9                      Selena Gomez           11.11% 10                    Kesha                         11.11% Crowded with Comedians Kicking off her world tour this fall, comedian Amy Schumer tops the list as the Most Dangerous Celebrity  coming in at No. 1. Chris Hardwick (No. 7) of Funcomfortable fame and Daniel Tosh (No. 8) were also among the top 10, while Nikki Glaser (No. 15) and Kevin Hart (No. 25) made the top 25. Other funny females to make the list include: Grace Helbig (No. 26), Mindy Kaling (No. 30), Kristen Wiig (No. 52), Chelsea Handler (No. 54) and Ellen DeGeneres (No. 57). Musicians Top the Charts This years riskiest celebrities included some of the most sensational, chart-topping pop artists such as Justin Bieber (No. 2), Rihanna (No. 5), Miley Cyrus (No. 6), Selena Gomez (No. 9) and Kesha (10). Pop, rap, hip-hop and a bit of country were represented by Drake (No. 13), Katy Perry (No. 14), Jason Aldean (No. 16), Justin Timberlake (No. 17), Jennifer Lopez (No. 18), Lady Gaga (No. 19), Nicki Minaj (No. 20), Iggy Azalea (No. 27), Beyoncé (No. 28) and Usher (No. 29) as they rounded out the top 30. Late Night TV Shows Today show anchor and The Voice host Carson Daly is the third Most Dangerous Celebrity, while late night hosts Seth Meyers (No. 11) and Conan OBrien (No. 12) cracked the top 15. Host James Corden, widely known for his popular Carpool Karaoke, landed at No. 23, followed by John Oliver at No. 24 and Jimmy Kimmel at No. 32  previously No. 1 in 2014 and No. 26 in 2015. Bill Maher rounds out the list at No. 34. The Voice Coaches Make the Cut Three of the four celebrity coaches on The Voice this season, along with the host, are all in the top 50. Miley Cyrus leads the pack (No. 6), followed by Adam Levine (No. 41) and Blake Shelton (No. 66), as well as his girlfriend and rotating coach Gwen Stefani (No. 49). Blake Sheltons fellow country superstars Jason Aldean (No. 16) and Luke Bryan (No. 39) are not far behind. How to Search Safely Think before you click! Are you looking for the latest episode of Amy Schumers TV show, Inside Amy Schumer? Dont click on that third-party link. Instead, get your content directly from the original source at comedycentral.com to ensure you arent clicking on anything that could be malicious. Use caution when searching for torrent. This term is by far the riskiest search term. Cybercriminals can use torrents to embed malware within authentic files making it difficult to determine if a file is safe. Its best to avoid using torrents especially when there are so many legitimate streaming options available. Keep your personal information personal. Cybercriminals are always looking for ways to steal your personal information. If you receive a request to enter information like your credit card, email, home address or social media login dont give it out thoughtlessly. Do your research and ensure its not a phishing or scam attempt that could lead to identity theft Browse safely using protection like McAfee® WebAdvisor software. WebAdvisor will help keep you safe from malicious websites by helping to identify potentially risky sites. A complimentary version of the software can be downloaded at mcafee.com/mcafeewebadvisor Use cross device protection. Consumers need to protect all facets of their digital lives regardless of where they are, what device they use or where they store their personal data. Use solutions that work across all your devices to deliver protection against threats, such as malware, hacking and phishing attacks.

If you do decide to search for information on a major event or celebrity in the news, make sure your entire households devices have protection, such as McAfee LiveSafe service, which helps protect most PCs, Macs and tablets and smartphones. It also includes malware detection software, McAfee® Mobile Security, to better protect your smartphone or tablet from many types of malware. Survey Methodology Intel Security conducted the study using McAfee® WebAdvisor site ratings to determine the number of risky sites generated by searches, on Google*, Bing* and Yahoo!*, that included a celebrity name and commonly searched terms (noted below) likely to yield malware. From that, an overall risk percentage was calculated for each celebrity. Most dangerous means that these celebrities are likely popular search subjects. McAfee SiteAdvisor technology helps protect users from malicious websites and browser exploits. SiteAdvisor technology tests and rates nearly every internet website it finds, and uses red, yellow and green icons to indicate the websites risk level. Ratings are created by using patented advanced technology to conduct automated website tests and works with Internet Explorer*, Chrome* and Firefox*. Search terms included: Celeb name + Torrent Celeb name + Free MP4 Celeb name + HD download The results indicated the percentage of risk of running into online threats  if a user clicked all the results generated by the terms. Fans clicking on sites deemed risky and downloading files including photos and videos from those sites may also be prone to downloading viruses and malware.

Lynch has already said he plans to stay on for the next administration, but other highlights include the state of recruiting for the elite IT office: “I think that it’s changed a lot. In the early days, I think that you had to tell the story of who we are. A lot of times now, we’ll show up and they’ve at least heard of either [the U.S. Digital Service], the HealthCare.gov story or they’ll have heard of Defense Digitial Service.” Story Continued Below He also talked about the thing that most surprised him at the Defense Department. “My biggest lesson learned is that there is simply no way that we can continue to function without having nerds in the room. I believe that to my core,” he said. That we live in a world where all of these things that we created are now run by, and eaten by, software. We make decisions that are so critically important to the safety of the American people and the men and women who are defending the country, all those systems have to work perfectly and we’re making decisions where there’s not a nerd in the room. And that is — it’s not OK.” The full interview — including Lynch’s favorite lightsaber color — is here for Pros. HAPPY THURSDAY and welcome to Morning Cybersecurity!

But team info is below, and be generous with them, please! COMEY ON DIY PHONE HACKING — FBI Director James Comey told a House panel Wednesday that the bureau might have to occasionally rely on others to help agents hack into locked phones at times, but that there’s some value in doing it in-house. Rep. Darrell Issa asked whether the FBI could also rely on the NSA. “That’s a reasonable question,” Comey replied. “It may be part of the solution. The real challenge is in using those techniques in the bulk of our work. Because it becomes public and exposed. But that has to be an important part of the conversation.” Likewise, while Comey said the FBI could again use contractors — as it did in breaking into the phone of a terrorist in San Bernardino — it’s also developing its own capabilities. “Whether that’s the best solution — it doesn’t strike me as the best solution — but we are, and I’ve asked for more money in the ’17 budget, trying to invest in building those capabilities, so when we really need to be able to get into a device, we can. It’s not scalable, and I’m not sure it would be thrilling to companies like Apple to know we’re investing money to try and figure out how to hack into their stuff.” MINI Q&A WITH MCAFEE’S CHRIS YOUNG — This month, tech giant Intel agreed to sell a majority stake in its cybersecurity business to investment firm TPG and restore independence to veteran security company McAfee, a transition that’s expected to go into effect early next year. MC spoke with Chris Young, who will head up the newly independent McAfee. Below are some exchanges, edited for length. What will be different under the new arrangement? The difference for us is, we’ll be 100 percent focused on cybersecurity. Intel has been great, but it does a lot of things, and cyber is one of them where Intel plays. This is going to allow us to continue to work closely, but as a standalone company, all we will do is cybersecurity. What should the next president focus on? No. 1, the federal government needs to be investing in cybersecurity talent and training. The Obama administration has introduced some good programs in this space, and we think we can expand that. The next one is international cooperation. We’re pretty quiet around what we do across borders in cybersecurity. We’re probably going to see more standards, more ways to internationally cooperate around threat information sharing. What threats are you thinking about most? The topic area I’m very interested in as I look forward is the convergence of new order types of attack categories with the penetration of security in our physical being. Ransomware converging with the Internet of Things creates a whole new set of attack scenarios that go beyond our traditional data breach view of the world. Physical safety threatened by a cyberattack is where I’m thinking. LAWMAKER: MAKE IT EASIER TO GET A CYBER JOB — Rep. Derek Kilmer on Wednesday asked the Homeland Security Department to heed a recommendation from a think tank and industry report to reduce the minimum credentials needed for a cybersecurity gig. Most cyber jobs, according to the joint report from Intel Security and the Center for Strategic and International Studies, require a bachelor’s degree, but cyber skills aren’t always picked up via traditional education. “I encourage the department to examine whether it would be possible to develop a cybersecurity hiring approach which permits the federal government to access professionals with critically needed skill sets who otherwise might be excluded from consideration,” Kilmer wrote in a letter to Secretary Jeh Johnson. NO THANKS, TOO RISKY — More than 15 million voters are so afraid of cyberattacks compromising November’s elections that they are considering not voting, according to a survey that cybersecurity firm Carbon Black will release today. The survey, released one month after an FBI flash alert about attacks on voter registration databases in Arizona and Illinois, found that 36 percent of voters thought their voter information was insecure. Carbon Black co-founder Ben Johnson told MC that his team was surprised how many people said they might not vote due to hacking fears. “We did the report really to drive awareness,” he said. “We are glad that people are waking up to the fact that there is a lot of risk.” The report urges states to implement paper audit trails for electronic voting machines, some models of which have been shown to be easily hackable. “We come from very intelligence community backgrounds,” said Johnson, a former NSA operator, “and we have had lots of experiences in the past where, if we had physical access to any kind of device, it was only a matter of time before we got in.” CYBER IS DARK AND FULL OF TERRORS — Digital attacks are increasingly exploiting the Internet of Things as it grows, according to a new report from Darktrace. The cybersecurity firm’s 2016 threat report, out today, delves into six real-world threats and trends. “With the cyber black market reaching maturation, the barrier to entry for would-be attackers is lower than ever. All industries are now being targeted by non-traditional attacks, particularly by sophisticated software that blends into the background of day-to-day network activity. Artificial intelligence is now being deployed by attackers to emulate legitimate user behaviors, automatically. Cyber warfare has become an arms race,” the report states. NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH VENTURE BROS. — Two “enterprising” cyber criminals are outsourcing aspects of their illicit business to pilfer credit card information in the United States and Nordic countries, FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence reveal in a report out today. Nicknamed the “Vendetta Brothers,” the group partners with other cyber criminals to employ a variety of tactics — including “brick and mortar” methods like deploying physical skimmers — to capture payment card data. The outsourcing makes it harder for law enforcement to pin down who exactly is responsible, concluded FireEye’s report. MORE JOURNALISTS TARGETED — Russian hackers have been discovered targeting the citizen-journalism website Bellingcat, which gained attention reporting on a Russian missile launcher used to shoot down Malaysian Airlines Flight 17. After running those stories, three Bellingcat researchers received spearphishing emails that tried to trick them into giving up their Gmail passwords. The security firm ThreatConnect analyzed the messages and determined they were consistent with the “tactics, techniques and procedures” of the hacking group “Fancy Bear,” which has been tied to Russia’s military intelligence service. Fancy Bear is also suspected in the hack of the Democratic National Committee. “As evidenced by these efforts and the attack on the World Anti-Doping Agency, organizations that negatively impact Russia’s image can expect Russian cyber operations intended to retaliate publicly or privately, influence, or otherwise maliciously affect them,” ThreatConnect’s team wrote in a blog post. ENERGY’S CYBER RISKS: Per our friends at POLITICO Europe: Energy companies have seen a massive increase in successful cyberattacks over the past year, and they need to address the risks in order to maintain their security and keep their businesses resilient, according to a report the World Energy Council released today. As the energy industry grows more interconnected and digitized, thanks to smart grids and other devices, it also becomes a more attractive target for cyberattacks. The worst case scenario? Infrastructure shutdowns, economic and financial disruptions and even deaths and massive environmental damage, it says. On the plus side, awareness has grown over the past three years, with more than 30 countries putting “ambitious” cyber plans and strategies in place, Christoph Frei, the World Energy Council’s secretary general, said in a statement.

Search Box Loading... Semiconductor Today : the first choice for professionals who demand timely, focused, top-quality coverage of the compound semiconductor industry. FREE Registration Home News Archive Features Directory Recruitment Events About Us Advertising Contribute News 29 September 2016 Siva Power recruits former First Solar and Intel veteran Bruce Sohn as vice-chairman Copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) thin-film solar module developer Siva Power of San Clara, CA, USA has hired solar executive Bruce Sohn as vice-chairman of its board. Sohn was previously the key executive in the growth of cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin-film photovoltaic module maker First Solar Inc of Tempe, AZ, USA into an internationally recognized solar company, and he has also held leadership positions at Intel Corp. Sohn started at First Solar in 2003, serving on its board and guiding the firm through its formative years of growth. In 2007 Sohn became First Solar's president, leading it from the pre-revenue stage to a multi-billion-dollar enterprise. Under Sohn's leadership, First Solar achieved three historic solar milestones: the first Company to manufacture at under $1/watt, the first company to ship more than 1 GW of production annually and the first company to develop and engineer, procure, and construct (EPC) over 1 GW of utility-scale projects. Previously, Sohn worked at Intel for 24 years, where he played a leadership role in developing, engineering and manufacturing semiconductor technologies. At Intel he was a crucial part of the start-up team at five fabs, managed two of its largest fabs, and was program manager for the firm's conversion to 300mm wafers. Sohn graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) with a degree in engineering, was a Clean Energy Ambassador to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and chaired the US Commerce Department's Manufacturing Council for the Obama Administration.  "It was under his leadership that First Solar, the only American thin-film PV success story, became what it is today," comments Siva Power's CEO Brad Mattson. "His guidance and leadership will be invaluable to Siva," he adds. "Siva has made impressive progress on its advanced thin film technology," says Sohn. "While the solar industry has steadily improved its position as a leading generator of clean, renewable energy, we are still at the threshold of the upcoming growth phase," he adds. "Terrawatts of clean power are yet to be installed and there is opportunity to make thin-film solar the lowest-cost, most environmentally friendly solution." Siva says that its roadmap will deliver lower electricity costs through advanced technology, scale, operational execution and an effective business strategy. Siva raised funds earlier this year to build a pilot line at its Silicon Valley headquarters, where it will produce CIGS modules based on its proprietary technology and manufacturing processes.  "Bruce's extensive experience in growing and managing large teams, and in global manufacturing capability, will prove to be a huge asset to Siva Power as we take our next step into giga-scale manufacturing," Mattson reckons.

Intel to spin off cybersecurity unit McAfee by Staff Writers Washington (AFP) Sept 7, 2016 US tech giant Intel announced plans Wednesday to spin off its cybersecurity operations as an independent company under the name McAfee. The move comes six years after Intel announced the acquisition of McAfee, one of the leading antivirus software companies at the time. An Intel statement said the spinoff would be made with the investment group TPG, which would own 51 percent of McAfee, leaving Intel with 49 percent and valuing the group at $4.2 billion. Intel chief Brian Krzanich said in a statement that "security remains important in everything we do at Intel and going forward we will continue to integrate industry-leading security and privacy capabilities in our products from the cloud to billions of smart, connected computing devices." The new group will be one of the world's largest pure-play cybersecurity companies, and frees Intel to focus on new priorities such as wearables and other connected devices. "We believe that McAfee will thrive as an independent company. With TPG's investment, along with continued support from Intel, McAfee will sharpen its focus and become even more agile in its response to today's rapidly evolving security sector," said Jim Coulter, co-founder and co-chief executive of TPG. Chris Young, who heads the unit, will be CEO of the new company. Intel announced the $7.68 billion deal for McAfee in 2010 and closed the deal in 2011. The group is no longer affiliated with founder John McAfee, who was a fugitive from authorities in Central America and more recently made a run for the US presidency.

Gadgets 11 0 0 September 28, 2016 MacBook Air, MacBook Pro 2016 To Arrive In October? Erika Miranda Analysts revealed that the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 2016 will most probably be released in the market this coming October. Speaking with Forbes, IHS Securities analyst Rhoda Alexander revealed that there is a high possibility that new MacBook laptops will be out in the market — or at least, unveiled by Apple — either by late September or in October. According to Alexander, both the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro have entered production during the second quarter of the year which means it will be ready for release by the end of the third quarter to the beginning of the last quarter of 2016. “Production started in the second calendar quarter on refreshes of the 13.3-inch and 15.4-inch MacBook Pro [and] the 13.3-inch MacBook Air.” Since there is very little time left for September, Forbes is speculating that the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro will be slated for release in October. Tech Times noted that the prediction is possible considering that Apple is currently on a roll with the successful release and retail of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. However, the outlet also noted that while some may be happy that new MacBook laptops are coming, there are still a couple of major drawbacks in the matter. Since the IHS projection claims that production of the Apple laptops have already begun, there is a good chance that the device will not have the highly anticipated Intel Kaby Lake under the hood. Alexander echoes this idea, saying that “given the timing of the start of production, inclusion of [Intel’s] Kaby Lake chip appears unlikely.” Of course, some may continue to hope that the new Intel chip will still make it to the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro though the IHS analyst believes otherwise. In August, Intel unveiled its Kaby Lake processor which Anand Tech pegged to be a chip for better graphics performance while the Skylake processor which would most likely power the upcoming MacBook laptops is still undergoing several modifications. Intel’s 7th generation of Core CPUs are coming later this year https://t.co/q42Ncnv3nk pic.twitter.com/2sKuRIOv8U — Engadget (@engadget) May 31, 2016 Channel Pro compared the two and confirmed that the Kaby Lake chips are indeed better in terms of a “more optimized design.” However, analyst Daniel Matte told Forbes that there is also the possibility that Apple would be adding an option for MacBook Air and MacBook Pro users to opt for AMD’s latest “Polaris” graphics processors. Aside from that, Tech Times revealed that the MacBook Air is rumored to have an additional feature called the Pencil Trackpad based on a patent titled “Stylus with inertial sensor” that Apple filed back in November last year. Based on the description of the feature, Apple intends to add a stylus compatibility feature to the MacBook Air that could function in a lot of ways as described below. “Inertial sensor input may be gathered when operating the stylus in one or more inertial sensor input modes such as an air mouse mode, a rotational controller mode, a joystick mode, and/or other inertial sensor input modes.” [Image by Apple] In terms of size, the MacBook Air is slated to be a 15-inch laptop instead of the previously rumored 11-inch one which basically indicates Apple’s plan to make this particular line of laptops be bigger in the future. Additional features include a USB Type-C port, more RAM, enhanced batteries and cooling components, and a thinner design. Meanwhile, there is still a great chance that Apple is not giving up on the MacBook Pro 2016 though everything should still be taken with a grain of salt considering that there has been no official announcement on the matter yet.

The Universal Stylus Initiative (USI) encourages touchscreen device makers and software developers to support a newly standardized peripheral interface. The USI standard (1.0) measures stylus user characteristics — like pressure, color and stroke width — and communicates these to the tablet or smartphone host. The use of a standard interface, developers believe, will dramatically expand to use of stylus-dependent applications. A consortium of computer hardware and software makers announced Thursday (September 22) their support for a stylus peripheral standard. The Universal Stylus Initiative (USI 1.0) standard describes a handheld computer stylus interface, intended to work with any USI-enabled tablet or touchscreen. Supporters of the standard include computer industry heavyweights Dell, Lenovo, HP and Intel. “Our goal was to have a single, universal stylus capable of operating with all the touchscreen devices that a consumer owns or uses in the workplace — whether tablet, 2-in-1, or smartphone,” said Peter Mueller, an Intel VP and chairman of the USI. “One USI stylus will talk to many different devices.” A stylus interface standard will increase the use of these peripherals, and expand the applications for them, Mueller believes. The application of styluses with tablets has thus far been something of a niche. Many drivers may be familiar with the tablet-based forms filled out by service reps at an automobile service center. Other use cases include drawing and graphics rendering — even handwriting recognition and analysis. Photo editing will be a major growth driver, suggests graphics industry analyst Jon Peddie of Jon Peddie Research. In these applications, the editor can use a stylus to highlight an object on screen with all the precision his hand will allow. The popularity of stylus applications like this could catapult the stylus market from 100 million units in 2015 to as much as 300 million in 2018, Peddie suggests. The stylus, Jon Peddie reminds, is the latest computer peripheral device to get industry-wide attention — behind the keyboard, mouse, voice recognition hardware, and touch pads. This is surprising considering that human beings learned to write with pens, long before they learned to work computers. What is miraculous, Peddie suggests, is that more than 30 companies got together on a new interface standard. One stylus, many channels In operation, the USI standard defines the communication method — the wireless protocol — by which the stylus sends data about its operation to the smart phone or tablet host. The data includes information such as pressure levels, stroke width or color (selectable with button presses on the pen) or eraser operation. The USI technology makes use of the existing touch sensor (capacitance changes) in smart phones, tablets and notebook PCs, minimizing the cost of a new peripheral. http://www.universalstylus.org/ The communications protocol, used to identify peripherals to the USI host, is fast and flexible, says Peter Mueller. Like wireless Ethernet, transmitter will seek the carrier frequency which ensures the best communication for any particular setting. USI System comprises of a USI-compatible touch controller and stylus. It defines the communication between an active stylus and a touch controller. (Source: Universal Stylus Initiative) Areas standardized by USI members include the stylus discovery mechanism, the packet formats required to communicate key information (such as pressure, button info), and mechanisms for vendor extensions. Areas NOT specified by the standard include the stylus’ industrial design (its look-and-feel), the hardware/firmware implementation in the touch controller, and the software APIs for stylus data access. The standard offers many avenues for vendor differentiation (see Table). Areas to Standardize Not Specified by USI stylus discovery mechanism stylus industrial design / look and feel packet formats to communicate key information (such as pressure, button info) hardware/firmware implementation in touch controller or stylus IC facilitate low-cost as well as high-end,  premium implementations touch sensor technology mechanism for vendor extensions software APIs for Stylus data access In addition to Intel, HP, and Dell, electronics industry notables supporting the Initiative include Sharp, Asus, LG and Lenovo. Touch controller makers include Parade Technologies, Silicon Integrated Systems, Raydium Semiconductor and STMicroelectronics. Touch pen makers include Wacom, Atmel, and Synaptics, among others. This group has enough momentum, Peter Mueller suggests, to bring USI products to market by the end of next year, or the beginning of 2018. Influential suppliers on the sidelines regarding USI include Apple, who typically uses proprietary solutions for their product appeal, and Microsoft, which has an investment proprietary pens for its Surface Pro computers.     Email This Print Comment Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] Be the first to post a comment regarding this story.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Apple’s relied on Intel chips to power its Mac computers since 2005, but that partnership could be coming to an end. A bit of code in macOS Sierra suggests the Cupertino company is gearing up to use its ARM-based processors instead. The macOS kernel, which Dutch site TechTastic took some time to dig through, adds support for a new CPU family called “ARM Hurricane.” Apple’s given its recent ARM-based Ax chips similar codenames (A7 was Cyclone, A8 was Typhoon and A9 was Twister).  Hurricane might be an unannounced sequel, or it might even be the A10 Fusion processor introduced with the iPhone 7. The A10 Fusion chip is Apple’s first model with a quad-core design, packing two cores for high-performance tasks and two energy efficient cores for regular activities. Based on recent benchmarks, the A10 Fusion even rivals the Intel Core M chip used to power the 12-inch MacBook. That means it’s not out of the question that new MacBooks could rely on an A-series chip. There’s one more bit of evidence. TechTastic notes that macOS Sierra also changes the way developers submit third-party Mac apps. Basically, it allows Apple to automatically convert those apps between platforms. That could make it possible to easily switch all apps to work with an ARM-based chip without requiring each developer to resubmit their software. Apple is expected to unveil new MacBooks next month, which could provide the company with a perfect opportunity to announce the big switch. Cupertino hasn’t confirmed plans for another event yet, but we’ll let you know as soon as the invitations go out.

By 2020, there will be 1.4 million computer-related jobs available. U.S. graduates are only on track to fill about 29 percent of them and women are expected to only take 3 percent of those jobs. On national and local levels, efforts are gaining to not only boost STEM (Science Technology Engineering Math) curriculum in K-12 systems, but to also help girls understand there’s a prosperous career path awaiting them in technology. That’s the drive behind the Girls Who Code program, a national effort to expose sixth to eighth grade girls to computer programming and coding. Girls Who Code started as an experiment with 20 girls in New York and has now impacted the lives of 10,000 girls in 42 states. In Chandler, the effort kicked off in October 2014 and is set to offer its third installment at the downtown Chandler Public Library where it began. With the help of an Intel sponsorship and company volunteers - real in-the-trenches women coders - teaching the classes, about 20 middle school girls each fall are catching a glimpse of something that is passing so many of their peers by. “We’ve really been excited about partnering with Intel. … We feel like the whole experience is instrumental in helping girls to feel more comfortable with the sciences and technology,” Kris Sherman, assistant library manager at Chandler Public Library, said. Making An Impact Statistics from the Girls Who Code website indicate that between ages six and 12, 66 percent of girls express an interest in computers. That number drops to 32 percent between the years of 13 and 17 and by the time these young women become college freshmen only 4 percent of computer science majors are female. Working with youth, Sherman has seen the disconnect first-hand. “They seem to be pretty excited when they’re younger, but somewhere along the way they gravitate towards different interests,” she added. “STEM careers like engineering and coding become accessible to students when they actually get to experience it first hand and programs like Girls Who Code take learning to a whole new level because students get to create their own ideas,” said Intel’s Arizona Director of Public Affairs Carlos Contreras. Girls Who Code is a project-based club environment where middle school girls are encouraged to make new friends while exploring the world of coding. Nikki Moreno, now a valley ninth grader, went through the Chandler Public Library Girls Who Code program the first two times it was offered. The 40-hour (20, 2-hour sessions) curriculum started with work on simple MIT-developed open source coding software called Scratch. At first, Moreno and her peers built simple memory games and learned how to use code to make small characters on a screen move. Eventually, the curriculum progressed to using JavaScript, which was more difficult, she admitted. But the capabilities greatly increased, too. “I enjoyed exploring stuff on my own. … We also got to make … secret codes,” she said. “It was pretty cool. I might take a class later.” Moreno is considering a career in either psychology or marine biology. If she opts for the latter, she said, she would consider taking a robotics class in the future “to apply robotics … to go underwater and maybe help clean up the oceans.” Her mother, Deborah Moreno, who also works as a library assistant in the youth services division of Chandler Public Library, was impressed with how quickly her daughter picked up the concepts. “What I thought was really interesting was that the programs they were using in the class were really user friendly, and she was able to come home to teach her brother a lot of what she was learning in the class,” Deborah added. In less than two years, the program has gained strong word-of-mouth recognition. “Now that we’ve done this a couple times, we’re getting a lot of emails and phone calls from parents who want to know when the class starts,” Deborah said, “and now we’re starting to see siblings of those girls who went to the first two.” “We’re seeing new friendships made in Girls Who Code sessions,” Sherman added. “There’s a comfort level and talent is being grown.” In addition to receiving instruction from Intel mentors and actual working engineers, students aren’t the only winners in the experience. The Intel Involved Matching Grant Program also pays Chandler Public Library $10 per hour for all Intel employee volunteer hours. This effort generated $2,330 for the Friends of Chandler Public Library in 2015. For more information about the Intel Involved Matching Grant Program, click here.

The new spec enables hardware makers to eliminate traditional 3.5mm mini-jacks from their devices and use USB-C ports to connect headsets and other audio equipment. Makers of peripherals can also build their audio solutions, which use USB-C instead of traditional analog connectors. Developers of the standard hope that elimination of mini-jacks will help to make devices slimmer, smarter and less power hungry. The industry, led by Intel and some other companies, has been mulling about replacing the traditional 3.5mm mini-jack connector for some time now. The main motives for replacement were necessity to simplify internal architecture of devices by removing analog and some audio processing components from the inside (which leads to further miniaturization), minimize the number of external connectors, improve power management as well as to add smart features to headsets and other audio equipment. We discussed USB Type-C Audio Technology briefly earlier this year and mentioned that this is not the first time that the industry has tried to use USB instead of the good-old mini-jack. The important difference between contemporary initiative and attempts in the past is the fact that today the primary goal is to replace the 3.5mm jack in portable devices. As reported, the USB Audio Device Class 3.0 specification supports both analog and digital audio. Analog audio is easy to implement and it does not impact data transfers and other functionality of USB-C cables since it uses the two secondary bus (SBU) pins. Some device makers may find the analog audio feature of the standard to be a relatively simple way to add certain smart capabilities to their headsets without major redesign of hosts. While analog USB-C audio will not help to shrink dimensions of portables, it could be particularly useful for non-mobile devices, where miniaturization is not crucial, but where port space is at a premium or where additional features either make sense (infotainment, sport equipment, etc.) or are fundamental (VR HMDs). The USB ADC 3.0 defines minimum interoperability across analog and digital devices in order to avoid confusion of end-users because of incompatibility. In fact, all ADC 3.0-compliant hosts should support the so-called headset adapter devices, which allow to connect analog headsets to USB-C. However, digital audio is one of the primary reasons why companies like Intel wanted to develop the USB-C audio tech in the first place, hence, expect them to promote it. According to the USB ADC 3.0 standard, digital USB-C headphones will feature special multi-function processing units (MPUs), which will, to a large degree, define the feature set and quality of headsets. The MPUs will handle host and sink synchronization (this is a key challenge for digital USB audio), digital-to-analog conversion, low-latency active noise cancellation, acoustic echo canceling, equalization, microphone automatic gain control, volume control and others. Such chips will also contain programmable amplifiers and pre-amplifiers, which are currently located inside devices. Besides, USB ADC 3.0-compatible MPUs will also support USB Audio Type-III and Type-IV formats (the latest compressed formats), but will retain compatibility with formats supported by ADC 1.0 and 2.0. Finally, among the mandated things set to be supported by USB-C Audio devices are new Power Domains (allows devices to put certain domains in sleep mode when not in use) as well as BADD (basic audio device definition) 3.0 features for saving power and simplified discovery and management of various audio equipment (each type of devices has its own BADD profile). Over the past few months, Conexant has introduced three USB-C Audio MPUs (1, 2) for headsets, docking stations and other equipment. Assuming that these chips are compliant with the USB ADC 3.0 specs from a hardware standpoint, and the software is ready, actual devices featuring USB-C Audio could arrive in the coming months. Pricing of the first USB ADC 3.0-compliant MPUs is unknown, but in general MPU ICs do not cost too much. Moreover, as developers adopt smaller process technologies and a larger number of such chips hit the market, their prices are going to decline. In the end, it will be interesting to see where digital headphone prices end up. The MPUs will definitely add to the total bill of materials for a set of headphones, but at the same time they add new functionality as well, so the big question is how manufacturers then factor all of that into device pricing. A number of companies, including Apple and LeEco, have already introduced smartphones that do not use traditional mini-jacks, and Google added support for USB DAC devices to Android over a year ago. The finalization of the USB ADC 3.0 spec, introduction of USB-C audio ICs, as well as design decisions of smartphone makers demonstrate that the industry is trying to eliminate 3.5mm jacks from mobile devices. The big question is whether the rest of the industry plans to do the same. It is true that portables are primary devices for music listening for many people. However, there are tens of applications which still rely on analog connectors, and hundreds of millions of people who use them either to consume or create content. To eradicate 3.5mm jacks completely, USB-C Audio promoters will have to work with thousands of vendors and this takes time. Consequently, it is too early to say that this is the end for the good-old mini-jack. Images by Conexant, USB IF.

All this does is move what was in the phone to a stupid dongle. Screw apple and moto for doing this. Reply DanNeely - Friday, September 30, 2016 - link What you're forgetting is that since your phone maker is the one who will be blamed for the battery not lasting long enough is that outside of extreme budget models they're likely to spend the extra $0.50 on the BoM for a high power efficiency DAC. The tiny company in China who manufactured the cheap no-name dongle you bought on Amazon. Not so much. Reply ImSpartacus - Friday, September 30, 2016 - link Oh god. I didn't think about this. Fuck. This is not good. Reply __Miguel_ - Monday, October 03, 2016 - link Of course it's not. USB-C audio is nice, and all, but it's just a cash grab. The only people who would benefit from it, i.e. audiophiles (because normal headphones will not benefit an iota from being USB-C in the first place, they're too small and/or made with parts not able to capture the extra clarity the dedicated DAC would allow), have been using external USB DACs for years, now. They'll probably have a little bit less latency, but that's about it. Everyone else will either A) buy USB-C headphones, thus having to spend more money for something they already had, especially because since USB-C can handle analog audio, you might just be getting some "premium" USB-C headphones that are basically analog headphones with a USB-C plug; or B) have to fumble with fragile USB-C to 3.5mm adapters, again having to spend more money, potentially multiple times, with zero gains. AND, while this is happening, you'll either have to choose if you want to charge your phone or listen to music, or lug around a USB-C hub (because let's face it, the odds of at least 2 fully-functional - i.e., with all services offered by the phone over USB-C on both - USB-C ports on a phone are slim to none), which is utterly ridiculous, not to mention expensive. Reply dsumanik - Monday, October 03, 2016 - link Hey smartphone makers, there is a very real and lucrative business opportunity for you here... simply hang on to the audio jack and refuse to buy into this scam, customers will reward you with sales. Reply damianrobertjones - Friday, October 07, 2016 - link "outside of extreme budget models they're likely to spend the extra $0.50 on the BoM for a high power efficiency DAC" Do you mean, "outside of extreme budget models they're likely to NOT spend the extra $0.50 on the BoM for a high power efficiency DAC" These companies don't care. When making a million phones 0.50 is a LOT of cash. Reply MobiusStrip - Saturday, October 01, 2016 - link This is an offensive and anti-customer scam to be sure. So now we have redundant DACs in EVERYTHING. The phones have to have DACs in them to provide sound to their own speakers... so Apple hasn't offloaded the work at all; it simply blocked access to it. And now many manufacturers will repeat Apple's blunder of blocking access to the sole power port with this asinine audio dongle? Want to listen to music on your road trip? NOPE.

That’s exactly the conclusion one could reach by looking closely at code strings in the macOS Sierra kernel, discovered by Dutch outlet TechTastic.nl. It’s very peculiar that Apple would add support for ARM technology to macOS Sierra. As you know, all Macs manufactured since 2005 run Intel chips. The Apple appears to be implementing support for ARM chips in the Mac operating system could mean that first ARM-based Macs might appear this year. As TechTastic.nl states, developers no longer submit fully compiled binaries. Instead, intermediary bit code is submitted which Apple uses to compile the binary code for the specific CPU architecture. Should Apple release an ARM-based Mac, developers wouldn’t need to re-submit their existing code nor would they need to add any ARM-specific code in order for their apps to run natively on ARM-based hardware. “It is probably also one of the reasons why legacy applications have recently been removed from the App Store,” speculates the publication. The macOS Sierra kernel indicates support for the ARM Hurricane family. Now, ARM’s existing blueprints make no mention of the Hurricane CPU so this is most likely Apple’s internal code-name for a custom ARM-based CPU architecture. Starting with the A7 chip in the iPhone 5s, Apple stopped implementing ARM’s off-the-shelf CPU parts in favor of 64-bit CPU cores which are compatible with the ARM instruction set but are designed in-house from scratch. With the A7 onward, Apple started naming these custom-built CPUs. The A7 microarchitecture was code-named “Cyclone”, the A8’s CPU is called “Typhoon” and the A9 uses “Twister” CPU. The A10 Fusion is Apple’s first ARM-compatible mobile chip that uses four CPU cores, two for high-performance task and two highly energy-efficient cores for tasks that don’t require the full power. The idea of an ARM-powered Mac dates back to 2012, when Bloomberg reported that Apple was exploring ways to replace Intel processors in Macs with a desktop version of in-house designed A-series chips that power iPhones and iPads. “Apple engineers have grown confident that the chip designs used for its mobile devices will one day be powerful enough to run its desktops and laptops,” said Bloomberg. And in 2014, former head of the Macintosh division Jean-Louis Gassée hinted that the first ARM-based Macs could appear in 2017. “Apple’s drive to own all layers of the stack continues unabated years after Steve’s passing,” he wrote. “As a recent example, Apple created its own Swift programming language that complements its Xcode IDE and Clang/LLVM compiler infrastructure.” All iOS device processors use CPUs based on ARM’s power-sipping technology. Gassée explained: If we follow this line of reasoning, the advantages of ARM-based processors vs. x86 devices become even more compelling: lower cost, better power dissipation, natural integration with the rest of the machine. For years, Intel has argued that its superior semiconductor design and manufacturing technology would eventually overcome the complexity downsides of the x86 architecture. But that “eventually” is getting a bit stale. Other than a few showcase design wins that have never amounted to much in the real world, x86 devices continue to lose to ARM-derived SoC (System On a Chip) designs. Therefore, an ARM-based Mac notebook would theoretically have a much longer battery life than any existing MacBook with an Intel chip. With its own custom-designed Mac processor Apple would no longer be dependent on Intel’s slowing roadmap. More importantly, it would be able to refresh Macs once per year because any future A-series processors for computers would likely be on the same annual release cycle as the iPhone and iPad chips. Does that make any sense to you guys?

Imad Ghandour He didn’t remind you, he corrected you It coincided with the release of OS X Leopard which was in ’05 Martin Can I correct you too, a 10.4 revision was the first OS to power the Intel Mac, so it *preceed* the release of OS X Leopard (which was in 2007).

It’s ok now? 😉 Agneev Mukherjee Yeah, appreciate your reply. Ara Rezaee I could see this happening for the Macbook, and maybe mbAir David Gillooly They may try out the technology in a MacBook Air first to give it extreme battery life. This would differentiate it from MBPs and MacBooks. Guy This wouldn’t be something Apple would do lightly. This is an “all-in” kind of move for the Mac. It would also explain why the long wait between updates for the entire line. Shameer Mulji doesn’t explain anything at all. Just pure speculation Guy Until it’s actually announced (if ever) of course it’s speculation. The only point was Apple would switch the entire line IF they did this David Wilson Wow there sure is a lot of nitpicking about verb choice in this comment feed … Kira Kinski Moving to ARM will be the beginning of the end of the Mac as we know it. iOS is a joke. It’s power and flexibility pales in comparison to macOS, even though that too has been dumbed down considerably in recent years. OTOH, Apple could add an ARM chip to the motherboard for about nothing and it would be cool having an option to boot up or run multiple architectures natively. One box to rule them all. Of course, Apple could also factor macOS to run on ARM, but that too reduces its utility. It’s still a Wintel world out there, pure and simple. Chris Yes. This would be the end…just like when Apple moved from OS X from PPC to Intel. chamers No, moving to a more standard, open architecture was a beginning. Moving to a closed architecture is the end. Chris Which part of Intel’s architecture is open? Don’t confuse widely used with “open”. TheLouisXXI Intel doesn’t have locked bootloaders for one and most OS’s run on Intel CPU’s and Intel still has the fastest chips to date. Given any ARM CPU or GPU is still at maybe PS2 levels for graphics Reed Harston Sorry, but both your previous comment and this one are widely misinformed. First, the GPUs in modern mobile devices have much better graphics than the PS2. Remember that the PS2 only output 480p and that current phones may have 1080p or 1440p screens, which is about 7 or 12 times as many pixels, respectively, as the PS2 put out. And their graphics are even more fluid and better looking as well. They are MUCH better than a PS2. Besides, even if you feel like ARM GPUs are slow, whoever builds the SoC with an ARM CPU in it can use whichever GPU they wish and there are plenty of other GPU options out there which are better than ARM’s GPUs. Second, what are you even talking about locked bootloaders? How are bootloaders on ARM devices ‘locked’? I have a Raspberry Pi and it has a ARM chip. And it can run Windows, Linus, whatever. So long as it is compiled for ARM. So I have no idea what you are trying to imply. Guy Why are you confusing an operating system with hardware? iOS does exactly what Apple has intended for it to do. macOS on an ARM chip would look and work like…well, macOS. Apple most likely would not add an ARM chip to an Intel-based Mac, what would be the point?They added Windows support because while running on native X86 processors it made no sense to not offer it. However my guess is that fewer and fewer people are doing so these days. I stopped after the last time MS borked my legally acquired Windows 7 Pro after doing something crazy like adding more drives to the Mac Pro it was on. Wasn’t even part of Windows, but added storage for OS X. They did it the first time and after 3 hours, grudgingly gave me a new license key. When they did it again (I had the audacity to swap out my main drive with OS X), I just wiped it and added it to the rest of the computer again. Once Apple hits some magic number with fewer Boot Camp installs, I imagine they could decide that they could do it and impact very few people. Kira Kinski Nah. I know the difference between hardware and software. I also know that iOS is a UI abomination, and that mindset has permeated macOS in recent years. That is my greatest fear of Apple moving solely to ARM. I personally care little for Wintel compatibility, but it is comforting to know it exists and opens the Mac up to far more possibilities since the world is mainly Wintel. Why restrict it to ARM analogous to the PPC days, other than to close the box a little tighter, once again? That being said, Intel does need to do something about its own space. It’s long in the tooth and their mobile efforts have failed to date. And don’t even get me going on Apple hardware today. There’s not a single Mac I care to purchase, for the first time going back to the Apple II. Everybody has their own needs and desires, and many consumers feel different about Apple today than me. I get that. elvisizer Your greatest fear from a proposed cpu architecture change is that UI design in macOS will follow iOS? Those two things have absolutely nothing to do with each other, you know. at all. As you yourself said, the UI design of iOS has migrated into macOS over the last few years, despite macs not using arm cpu’s. prl99 What you seem to not understand is that iOS has nothing to do with macOS when it comes to running a Mac. Just because they use a lot of the same code doesn’t mean macOS will only use the iOS UI. As for Apple’s A-series CPUs, check out their Geekbench scores; 3304 single core, 5339 multi-core. This is for a simple 2+2 core miniature SOC. The 4GHz iMac only has a single core score of 5181. Multi-core scores are faster because the Intel CPUs have more cores. There’s nothing stopping Apple from designing a quad or 8-core A-series CPU, running it a normal speed while adding either an internal multi-core GPU or external graphics card. As for your disfavor with Apple hardware, fine. Why are you even commenting when you don’t care? Imad Ghandour Agreed prl99 Actually, it’s an iOS and Android world along with linux. Wintel is going away even though businesses refuse to accept it. Think about it …. Reed Harston I don’t think Windows is going anywhere soon on the desktop/laptop. They failed to gain any ground on mobile but they still rule the ‘traditional’ computer. That isn’t to say that someday Windows might not exist but that would take a radical change that most people aren’t ready to take yet. Remember that phones and tablets are largely tethered to PCs to offload pictures and so on. As for the Intel half of ‘Wintel’, however, I think that they may go out of style even faster than Windows. ARM chips are becoming very impressive and their architecture has always been much more simple and power efficient, despite Intel’s rather amazing work to improve the efficiency of their incredibly complex x86 CPUs. When Apple (I don’t think it is an ‘if’) moves to ARM then other companies may start taking courage to do the same and Microsoft could easily port Windows to ARM as well. You can already install Windows on a Raspberry Pi actually and that has a ARM processor. And with the push to move Windows apps to the Windows store on Windows 10 like with the App Store in macOS they may easily do the same thing that Apple is currently doing and release their software onto both platforms without any extra work for the developers. JerryO What I would like to see is Apple release Rack based servers again. Competing against HP and Dell for Amazon/Ebay/Goog’s business. Currently, Intel Processors consume way too much power. A large server farm (i.e. GOOG, et. al.) consumes lots of energy – which costs companies $$$. Imagine Apple ARM based servers. Couple this with Cisco, IBM, Deloitte, et. al. support for the Enterprise – Apple can open up one more multi-billion $ business overnight. Rowan09 Test it out on the iPad Pro and iPhones first to see how it performs. Guy Chances are in house they have done so Geoffrey Spencer I hope they keep the Pro series with Intel chips. I use VMWare Fusion (or you can use Parallels) to work on Windows projects. ARM could be used but that would be emulators and that is a no-go for most people like me. Guy IF Apple did this, it would be across the board Reed Harston I agree that it would be across the board but it would also likely be in stages as was the PowerPC -> Intel jump. The Pro was the last to be released because the chips weren’t ready for it yet. The same is likely going to be true if/when they make this jump. Profesional workstations depend just as much on the proper software, if not more, as they do on great hardware. With the right software it is actually possible to edit HD video on the MacBook just as well or faster as on a workstation with the wrong software. Point is, the software for what professionals do is also going to have to be updated to work properly on ARM before the Pro can be updated, and that may take some time. Releasing iMacs and Mac Minis first would give the developers a warning that they need to start getting their software ready for an ARM based Mac workstation. Then when Apple releases the Pro everyone should be a bit more ready. Of course Apple may do something radical and different but that is what I would expect. aalberti I don’t think so, it’s not necessary. For the Apps running on different processors will be transparent with the LLVM stack, so Apple can keep both lines of processors Guy They could but probably wouldn’t. It makes no sense for Apple to keep two separate lines (processor related anyway) of Macs going. The Pro market isn’t big enough on it’s own to make it worthwhile Reed Harston Read my comment below first for my thoughts on releasing the timeline for releasing an ARM based Mac Pro. As far as working on Windows projects I commented above that I wouldn’t be surprised if Microsoft releases a version of Windows that can be installed on ARM as well (they already do actually, it is just a cut down version), so you would still be able to use Windows on your Mac. Just not work on x86 projects for legacy computers. Denver Morgan This could also mean OS X on an iPad like device. lattermanstudio That’s what I was thinking……. an evolution to one OS on all devices…. that way can finally catch up with what’s been happening with Windoze tablets that run standard Windoze apps…. somethings that Apple can’t offer right now due to the processor differences……. they are stuck in a corner and need to take drastic steps to enter the modern world. ……. now…. they may come up with a clever way to dual boot iOS/macOS or create some kind of new Finder that you can choose macOS-mode or iOS-mode depending your needs/liking… Reed Harston Apple not putting macOS on the iPad has nothing to do with the processor differences actually. Recompiling code to run on a different architecture isn’t as simple as flipping a switch but it isn’t that hard either. The bigger problem is making macOS and your favorite software work on a touchscreen. Your idea of having two modes, one for macOS and one for iOS, just exacerbates the problem. There is no easy or pretty way to make one OS work on both platforms. Windows 8 was meant to unite both platforms but instead it was universally hated by all. One OS to rule them all didn’t really work out very well for them. The problem is that mouse and keyboard oriented UIs are bad for touch screens and touch oriented UIs are just funky and out of place when you have a mouse. That is because on touch screens buttons have to be large and easy to press with a big finger, where a mouse pointer is small and much more precise. I can see the hardware converging more and more internally but I personally think the different OSes and UIs are going to remain. I prefer macOS for its power and I prefer iOS for my wife for its simplicity. sassymacgeek People always assume that Apple wants to put ARM into MacBooks which I agree would be great for certain aspects particularly cost and battery life (but perhaps not for cross platform development) but they fail to recognize that Apple could also be planning to have OSX for iPad Pros. It is also a possibility as long as we are guessing. Lit Why would they switch to an underpowered chip? That’s suicide. The only thing I can think of is to increase profit margins, which would be a typical Cook move. Reed Harston Before you go off and say ‘underpowered’ do your homework. The iPhone 7 has higher single and multi core GeekBench scores than the Intel powered MacBook 2016. Of course there is more to usability than benchmark scores, but that is still very telling. And there is the fact that the iPhone 7 has a minuscule battery compared to the MacBook yet it gets much better battery life (yes, the display affects it greatly I know but still you can’t help but be impressed). Of course you could say the MacBook is underpowered as well, but I would argue it is just fine and that other laptops are more powerful than they need to be. At least for the average user anyway. Even power users like me could get by just fine with the MacBook since it has an amazing SSD in it. Point being, using an ARM chip isn’t that farfetched an idea to me at all. mrgerbik there is no comparison when comparing A10 vs an i5 or i7 – its like a sports car vs a family sedan ItzSky_05 If you take the most powerful ARM processor and compare it with the most consumer grade processor, there’s no point of comparison (Apple A10 vs Intel Core i7-6700k or even the Intel Core I7-6700HQ). ARM is still underpowered, but looks like it’s getting stronger every time. For a portable or unpowered device like the Macbook, is a great idea. CaffeinePizza Or since iOS and macOS share the same Darwin kernel….. Reed Harston +1 While I do think that there is something to be said for Apple deciding to got to custom ARM chips in the Macs I agree that at least for the time being you (and the others who commented the same as you) are most likely right. macOS and iOS share a kernel so they may have likely just found a reference to the CPU in the iPhone 7. rockdude094 Maybe its hinting an iPad type device that runs Mac OS Shameer Mulji Good point. Many are assuming that Apple is building an ARM-based Mac but instead they may be working to port macOS to iPad Pro. Imad Ghandour tl;dr; Would be a downside to introduce this: 1-No more windows compatibility 2-Cant game 3-Unless big innovation is done 4-Doubtful …in more detail below I wouldn’t like this because it would render mac’s unable to run windows side by side with the Macintosh operating system, unless Apple finds some kind of workaround with drivers that would make this possible; which is doubtful. Even then, apps that would run on this ‘tweaked’ windows infrastructure, mainly games in this case for me at least, would be virtually ‘unrunnable’ because they are built to either run on AMD and Nvidia GPUs or either on AMD and Intel CPUs. Doubtful that they will support Apple’s ARM architecture since developers still barely support running games on Macs all together; basically there is little reason for them to change their minds as Apple is focused on Enterprise and Creative consumer-base rather than the avid casual gamer user-base instead. This is all true, unless Apple probably produces some rendition of a mac that is a graphics powerhouse that might reignite the idea of possibly gaming on a mac; very possible since this is seen today with the iPhone. However, as I said twice before, I find this very doubtful because, if this was a considered goal we would have seen Apple take a jab at this market earlier; until today only their high end MacBooks have a discrete graphics cards which are situated mainly for video editing rather than gaming all together. Unfortunate really. lattermanstudio i think it the end of an era where most (if not all) Apple computers can also run Windows natively. Back in the day…. Apple switched to Intel for a number of reasons…… PPC chips where having development issues, there was a big demand for Windows apps being able to run on our ofiice Mac…. in the end it was all about $$$ ……. same thing now….. Apple looks kinda weak when you compare it’s “pro” ipad series with and windows tablet that runs native windows apps ON a tablet….. it’s not very elegant in the Apple world…. they need to be able to offer a seamless experience ….. they can’t that unless they change and have ‘one’ OS….. things need to change…… Reed Harston You have good points but I think there are some things to consider. 1. As I have mentioned in other comments, I think that Windows on ARM isn’t too far out. It already exists for Raspberry Pi, which is ARM based. Also, as someone else commented there are likely fewer and fewer people using Windows on their Macs so even if it doesn’t work anymore (though I still believe it will) then it may not be missed very much by the masses. I know I wouldn’t care much. 2. ??? First, Macs aren’t widely regarded as ‘for gaming’ anyway. Second, switching to ARM CPUs doesn’t mean you won’t be able to use an AMD or Nvidia GPU. Two different things altogether. As for games running on ARM, anything from the App Store won’t care what CPU you have since Apple recompiles apps on the fly, so those games won’t even notice any change. As far as Windows gaming goes though you are right. You’ll just have to put together a gaming PC for those games, and even if Apple doesn’t switch from intel to ARM that would probably be best anyway since Macs don’t have great support for all the latest hardware, since you obviously only seem to care about games and nothing else which is not what Macs are made for (which you’ve said yourself). 3. I honestly don’t know what to say to this. Obviously the whole jump to ARM would take some innovation so that is a given. And they are already on the way there actually. All of Apple’s iOS devices run ARM so running macOS on ARM would be a piece of cake (Linux already runs equally well on either x86 or ARM or PowerPC or MIPS or whatever). And Apple has already set up the App Store to accept apps in a state that allows Apple to compile the app for the CPU of the device the app will be installed on, so that means no more work for the developers. 4. Doubtful? Maybe. Possible? Likely. I think it is more a question of ‘when’ then ‘if’ at this point. Having one type of CPU architecture in all their devices would make a lot of things easier for Apple in the long run. Imad Ghandour Just to touch on a point that I believe I didn’t make clear. I don’t use my mac specially to game. I actually bought my mac in order to Video Edit in the fly on Adobe Premiere and FCPX; gaming for me is a compliment to that experience. The reason I believe that people say that Macs aren’t meant for gaming is that 1- There is an abysmal support for games on macOS 2-Most MacBooks don’t come with a discrete graphics card, evens the ones that do, although satisfy photo editing and video editing very well, cannot game which I find weird honestly. I don’t game seriously just a bit of Overwatch and couple of other titles here and there and my mac serves me well. However, most of my games rely on windows (only reason I have the OS installed) and it would be a shame to want to uogeade in the future and lose this privilege. Even games that are cross-platform run better on windows due to their initial aim to use Direct-X as the main API instead of Open-GL or I guess now Metal. So losing the ability to run windows is a letdown. If Apple can facilitate and smooth transition (which would be possible obviously with macOS as you mentioned) for boot camp as well, odds are very low though, that would be great. Don’t get me wrong I do think switching to Apples own designed ARM is a great idea as there own chips have proven to easily outperform intel chips in the past, again just desappointed on compatibility. pjp “…developers no longer submit fully compiled binaries.” “Instead, intermediary bit code is submitted which Apple uses to compile the binary code for the specific CPU architecture. Should Apple release an ARM-based Mac, developers wouldn’t need to re-submit their existing code nor would they need to add any ARM-specific code in order for their apps to run natively on ARM-based hardware.” This isn’t true. Bitcode is for iOS apps, not Mac apps. Reed Harston Correct, but do you think it is much of a stretch for Apple to do the same for Mac apps? It would take practically no extra work for the developers to support this in their apps, if any at all. All Apple would have to do is flip a switch on their end and voila. The Mac app store will behave like the iOS App Store. Will Collier I’ve been expecting this for a while. Makes Apple independent of Intel, and kills Hackintoshes in one swell foop. (I’m opposed, FWIW.) lattermanstudio yup….. would kill the Hackintosh……. not good – but at the same time I can see why it makes sense to them in the long run……… hey…… you can ‘still’ make a Hackintosh and run OSX 10.12 and below…… nothing wrong with that 🙂 lattermanstudio Bye bye to Mac that also run WinDoze but that’s no big loss. We may finally see ipads that run OSX….. that would be great 🙂 Leslie Bee With extra cores (maybe 9) at 3-7nm, ARM could probably replace Intel entirely by around 2020. Apple would love to boost profits, and jettison Intel and eventually all other non-Apple chips in all their products. The future is coming whether we like it or not. Everybody wants to rule the world, especially Apple. Reed Harston I don’t think ARM needs that many more cores in order to replace Intel. ARM chips are generally seen as slower because they are. We only see 1 to 2.5 GHz ARM chips because that is as fast as they can get before melting the phones and tablets they are most used in. Intel chips regularly clock up to 4GHz or more in high end machines. I don’t doubt that ARM chips could reach the same speeds as Intel chips do in a full sized laptop or desktop computers. Then they would be very completive and most likely more power efficient to boot. Of course Apple is looking to improve their bottom line more than anything but I also think that if they do make this move it would simplify a lot of things for them overall. It would mean only one architecture to support on their OS and apps (which would mean more resources for more debugging and better software). And it would also mean that Apple would have more control over the pace of their hardware upgrades as well. I agree, whatever happens is going to happen and there isn’t anything we can do to make Apple change their minds. Frank CHEN That’s why the name “FUSION”. The question is will we have an iOS like macbook or a osX like ipad pro. Shameer Mulji my bet is on the former. Niklaus Mikaelson I guess My iapd pro is getting macos Johny Burns So many amoebas are biting on the TMZ reporters. Typical Kardashian story. ARM tried in the Chromebooks thru the Linux distro flavor, and Intel uses the weakest and cheapest silicon there. Apple has around 10 more years to catch to what Intel has right now. Not to mention HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus, Sams, Huawei, Xiaomi are pissing all over iMacs. Apple got butt hurt when Intel stop providing them with custom made silicon. Dell already got a Kaby Lake chips, and Apple is now on the back of the bus. mrgerbik Comparing current ARM builds to current x86 is like comparing a Nissan Sentra to a McLaren F1. For everyday computing the speed is reasonable enough, but for any serious workloads, x86 is still the champ by far. aalberti LLVM was architecture independent from the start. I supposed intermediate code (bitcode) was the way to go for distribution, with a JIT compiler specific for the installed chip on the computer. They took a long time, but it seems they’re finally headed there. It is certainly doable and even very efficient. Jorge Rivera Yes, it does make sense. Additionally, macOS and iOS may merge and this is why one can find those references in the include files. It is the beginning of implementing a vision for future Apple devices as they become more homogeneous. Jon Allen Time to look at windows again. Apple, its been a good decade. Sentinel64 Well….this line of thought ( Apple going ARM across their entire portfolio ) has a little more credence when you realize that Intel has recently bowed out of the phone and tablet CPU market. For the last 3-4 years Intel has poured BILLIONS of dollars into the mobile space trying to dislodge the stranglehold that ARM has in that market. They quite literally were seeing BILLIONS in losses due to rebates and marketing given to phone manufacturers to entice them to start using Intel CPU’s instead of ARM. This would be Intel’s ATOM line of CPUs. It was a spectacular failure. So this year they announced they are out of the phone and tablet business and are concentrating the ATOM line for 2in1 Hybrids and cheap laptops on the Windows side of things. Read that again…..OUT of the PHONE and TABLET business. Now….where is Apple making the most money from but the PHONE and TABLET business? So…..just like a decade ago when the PowerPC alliance was failing to bring the innovations needed to Apple, not only in the desktop division but particularly in the laptop division forcing Apple rightfully at the time to go Intel, Intel is now stagnating and ARM chips have advanced enough to become viable replacements across the entire Apple portfolio from desktops to mobile. I think 2017 is a good year to see an ARM based Apple Air laptop. 2018 sees an ENTIRE mobile portfolio ( all laptops, phones, tablets and watch ) go ARM and in the 2019-2020 timeframe the first ARM based Apple desktop. Just my humble opinion. iAndroHacker Does it mean that i can dual-boot Android Nougat ARM version? yeah cool right? lol. just saying La Vida Leica …or macOS running on iPad Pros. Frank Moolah This should be no surprise that Apple is trying to be independent from Intel (can’t blame ’em) but banking on ARM at it’s current state would be a crapshoot. Not ready, not even for 2017 Anthony Randazzo or it could be that they are slowing combining the iOS and macOS code base so that there is less to manage, and soon iOS may be running macOS as its core. Another option is a more affordable netbook style Apple Baltazar It could make sense to go with in-house ARMs. Most tasks now are not CPU bound. I’d argue unless you are high-end gaming, science/CAD, content creation, we are getting to the point that for many people their Chomebooks or iPads are able to do everything they want. Hopefully they keep the Pro line and 27″ iMac line with Intel and OS X. I’d disagree that Apple has been held back by Intel’s cpu timeline. No updates on: Mac Pro, MacMini, Apple Display, etc. Carson Wotell It’s probably the arm t1 chip apple integrated into the new macbook pros John Smith WHOA, WHOA, WHOA The Touch Bar on the new MBP is powered by an ARM processor, wouldn’t that account for the code???????????   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines Early MacBook Pro adopters confused by misidentified graphics in System Profiler Twitter for iPhone and iPad gains support for rich notifications on iOS 10 Teardown confirms both 13″ and 15″ Touch Bar MacBook Pros have non-removable SSDs Google revamps Play Newsstand, adds For You recommendations, rich media, web app & more Apple launches worldwide “Touch Disease” repair program for iPhone 6 Plus   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: EmojiSuggest, PasswordRecovery, & more… EmojiSuggest brings iOS 10-like emoji suggestions to the predictive keyboard WiJoin lets you know what Wi-Fi network you’re connected to PasswordRecovery stores passwords and recovers them when you forget them NCTextColor lets you add vibrancy to Notification Center iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2016.

And, while most also include Brazil in this list, they seldom mention other booming Latin American countries. This trend is clearly seen in the allocation of venture capital, which poured almost $12 billion into China venture capital funds in the first half of the year, compared to less than $220 million for Latin America, a recent TechCruch article commented. However, this trend has started to slowly revert, as firms like Andreessen Horowitz, Founders Fund, Sequoia Capital and QED have been investing in the region – mostly in Brazil, but also in Mexico and Colombia. Moreover, TechCrunch contributor Julie Ruvolo explained, this is a market that’s set to boom, with its internet population bound to double, from 300 million to 600 million users; only half of the people included in the banking system; and an avalanche of new people coming online as smartphones become more affordable. Related Link: Evaluating A High-Flying Emerging Markets ETF Also worth pointing out, the author continued, is the fact that Brazilians spend more time online than any other country. All of this explains why venture capital investments have been surging consistently over the past few years, with 2015 setting a new record of $594 million. Furthermore, in the first half of 2016, venture capital transactions in the region rose 46 percent year-over-year, the Latin American Private Equity and Venture Capital Association said. So, let’s take a closer look into some major Silicon Valley firms landing in Latin America. Silicon Valley Goes Latino Earlier this year, Andreessen Horowitz decided to back Rappi, a grocery delivery service in Colombia. Founders Fund invested in Brazilian startups Jusbrasil and Nubank. The latter has already secured more than $80 million in funding from Founders Fund, Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global, Kaszek Ventures and QED Investors. Goldman Sachs also made a $52 million debt investment in Nubank, as well as a $10 million outlay in another Brazilian startup, CargoX. Accel Partners also put some money down in Mexican grocery shopping startup Cornershop. QED Investors, along with Kaszek, Quona Capital, Accion Frontier Inclusion Fund and Jaguar Ventures, participated in an $8 million Series A in Konfio, a lending platform. Fintech Is King Given the high percentage of unbanked population, fintech initiatives are having a big impact on financial inclusion, Ruvolo explicated. This is why 29 percent of the money invested in IT went to fintech startups in 2015; this figure rose to 40 percent in the first half of 2016. Another sector that is gaining traction is agtech – agricultural technology, Ruvolo continued. Monsanto Company (NYSE: MON) recently announced an investment of up to $92 million in BR Startups, a Brazilian agtech fund run by Microsoft Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and QUALCOMM, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM)’s Qualcomm Ventures. The latter also invested in a program to get drones to Brazil’s 2+ million farms. Finally, BASF SE (ADR) (OTC: BASFY) launched Agrostart, a agtech accelerator.

Home Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip links Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact FIDO Authentication Coming Soon to Lenovo Notebooks 88Shares FacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsappLinkedinPrint Azeem Ullah 2 months ago With the monumental Yahoo hack, which compromised of more than 500 million accounts, behind us, Lenovo and partners are teaming up to make sure your online verification methods use something more unique than a password: the good-old fingerprint. FIDO Alliance The FIDO Alliance consisting of Lenovo, Intel, PayPal and Synaptics will result in the arrival of more fingerprint scanners in your laptops. FIDO, or Fast ID Online, will combine Lenovo’s laptops with Intel’s hardware knowledge and Synaptics’s biometric verification prowess to provide an enhanced alternative to passwords. Benefits of FIDO Athentication The procedure will assist with the online payment from services such as PayPal and decrease online fraud. Because the fingerprint is so hard to replicate, the method is likely the most secure form of authentication available right now. Also, it will facilitate users who have to remember different passwords for several of their accounts, to act as a one stop shop. “Passwords are a universal problem that is not limited to mobile devices. Every internet connected device needs the ability to upgrade to simpler, stronger Fido authentication and thanks to this partnership, the desktop ecosystem is on an accelerated path to get the same Fido capabilities already well established across the mobile ecosystem.” Brett McDowell, executive director of Fido Alliance Upcoming Support for the FIDO Standards The first product to be adorned by such hardware is the new Yoga 910 from Lenovo. The new convertible, which already has features, such as a 4K display and a 7th-generation Intel processor. According to Lenovo, this would be the first time PC users will experience this technology. The Yoga 910 will be available starting from next month. Apart from that, Microsoft is also making sure that its Windows Hello supports FIDO authentication, in a bid to finally give users a more complex alternative to passwords. The news comes on the eve of the Yahoo data hack, which saw more than 500 million users losing essential private information. While fingerprints do not tend to be entirely secure either, this step will at least make sure news such as this are seen less often.

Intel Rolls Out HD Graphics Driver 20.19.15.4530 Beta - Download Now The new beta release should fix Gears of War 4 problems Sep 30, 2016 05:38 GMT  ·  By Iulian Pascal  ·  Share:  Intel has made available a new Iris and HD Graphics package, namely version 20.19.15.4530 beta, which confirms the pending driver code changes that should fix crashes and/or unresponsiveness while playing Gears of War 4. However, even though the present release might resolve some game issues seen across certain platforms, the 4530 beta build is basically a test driver that should be used at your own discretion. In terms of compatibility, Intel’s update is suitable for configurations running one of Microsoft’s 64-bit architectures of Windows 7, 8.1, and 10 operating systems, as well as including a supported CPU model as highlighted on the description page. When it comes to installation, first make sure your system is valid for this new driver, save and unzip the downloadable archive, and run the available setup file. Afterwards, simply follow all instructions displayed on-screen for a complete and successful upgrade. In addition to that, once finished, it would be a good idea to perform a system reboot to allow the changes to take effect. If this task isn’t requested, however, make sure to carry it out manually.

The production of new automobiles equipped with data connectivity, either through a built-in communications module or by a tether to a mobile device, is forecast to reach 12.4 million in 2016 and increase to 61 million by 2020. James Hines, Gartner research director, said: “Connected vehicles will continue to generate new product and service innovations, create new companies, enable new value propositions and business models, and introduce the new era of smart mobility, in which the focus of the automotive industry shifts from individual car ownership to a more service-centric view of personal mobility.” Gartner estimated that as cars become more connected they will also become more autonomous, which will see a rise in embedded in-car processing power. Automated driving functions, such as adaptive cruise control, collision avoidance and lane departure warning systems, necessitate real-time camera and sensor data processing and pattern recognition, the analysis company said. BMW recently announced in would be an early adopter of a new Atom-based platform called Joule, which uses Intel RealSense depth-sensing camera technology. The processing power needed to control an autonomous vehicle would be equivalent to a supercomputer in a car, Elmar Frickenstein, senior vice-president for automated driving at BMW, told delegates at the Intel Developer Forum in August. “Outside the car, you need a high performance cloud system to help with things such as swarm intelligence and route planning, plus a 5G network to enable exchange of data between cloud and car,” he said. At Ignite, the annual Microsoft developer’s event in Atlanta, car-maker Renault-Nissan announced a partnership with the software firm in which Azure will be used to power its connected car strategy. “A car is becoming increasingly connected, intelligent and personal,” said Ogi Redzic, Renault-Nissan Alliance senior vice-president, connected vehicles and mobility services. IT is already an integrated part of Volvo, according to Peter Lorentzon, the manufacturer’s vice-president of consumer IT services, speaking at a recent EMC event in Sweden. “We are at the forefront together with the business to drive change.” He said the company is focused on making the lives of consumers easier. “We don’t develop products just for the sake of technology.” Like many car companies, Volvo sees a need to move away from just selling cars. Lorentzon said: “We could just deliver hardware. But we need to spice up the car with other services.” He said Volvo was an early adopter of connected car technology. “Adding private services is something we are now focusing on.” As Computer Weekly has previously reported, Volvo has pioneered the delivery of Amazon purchases directly into a vehicle boot. The challenge for connected cars is how digital services remain relevant as the car gets older. Volvo Cars’ director of business development and strategy for consumer IT, Jonas Rönnkvist, said: “The car industry takes three to four years to develop a car, and it will be operational for 20 years.” Read more about connected cars IT has always tried to align with the business, but for Klas Bendrik, group CIO at Volvo Cars, it seems business has aligned with IT. At its recent investor day, Ford announced its strategy for the Internet of Things and how the company plans to make its mark in the connected car industry. He compared it to the launch 20 years ago of Microsoft Windows 95. “In the digital world you cannot imagine working on a Windows 95 computer,” he said. But among the big challenges the connected car industry faces is the longevity of a connected car. “It is difficult for us to predict what will be the next digital service in three years’ time.” Given that some digital services will have ended long before the car’s useful life is over, Rönnkvist said: “Digital services and infotainment is a challenge given the time frames of a car.” But, for the near-term, he expects cars to become part of a consumer’s integrated connected digital experience. He said: “Today people use more cloud-based services on many devices. So in the future you will use your music service at home, on your computer and in the car.” The challenge the car industry faces is how to make the experience seamless across all these devices. And in the connected world Rönnkvist believes car firms are at a disadvantage, because they cannot dictate standards and interoperability. He said: “We face Google and Apple and startups and we are not top of the food chain.” The connected car pushes IT to the forefront of the automobile business. Along with advancements in technology, car makers are also having to rethink how they work with digital suppliers. And as the car becomes more connected, the car maker is also having to support it and the software and digital services it runs. Rönnkvist said it makes car companies into IT operators. “Our core systems are supporting customers 24/7,” he said. CW+ Features Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join.

Stick It In (or On) Your Ear Analyst Says iPhone SE Was a One-Off for Apple View All Editorials → New Retina MacBook Pro Models Expected in October Jeff Gamet @jgamet · +Jeff Gamet Sep 29th, 2016 10:47 AM EST | News That new MacBook Pro you’ve been holding out for may finally be only a few weeks away. A new report claims Apple plans to release updated models in the second half of October. Reports say new Retina MacBook Pro models coming in October The refreshed Retina MacBook Pro line is expected to replace the keyboard’s function key row with a touch sensitive OLED strip that shows app-specific controls. The new models will also likely ditch the current USB ports for USB-C with Thunderbolt 3 support, gain Touch ID support, trim a little thickness off the body, and higher end models may switch to AMD’s Polaris graphics processor. It doesn’t look like the MacBook Pro will adopt the MacBook’s wedge-shape body and will stick with the flat slab style Apple has used for years, although the overall footprint will be smaller. Sources speaking with MacRumors narrowed Apple’s launch window to the second half of October, getting the laptops out in time for the holiday buying season and fitting in with previous year’s product launches during the month. Those sources didn’t say when Apple would announce the new models, but TMO’s say we should happen on October 11th. The last update to the Retina MacBook Pro line was in May 2015. Prior to that, the last update to the came in October 2013 with the switch from Intel’s Ivy Bridge processors to Haswell, making Apple’s pro laptop ripe for a refresh. Apple could use Intel’s Kaby Lake processors in the new laptops, although that’s something of a longshot. Intel is finally delivering the new chipset to device makers now, but ramping up production for the quantities Apple needs takes time. Intel may not be able to deliver enough Kaby Lake chips until next year, and if that’s the case the new MacBook Pro will ship with Skylake processors instead. While getting a Skylake-based MacBook Pro would be a little disappointing considering the chipset is already a year old, it wouldn’t be a game stopper. The differences between Skylake and Kaby Lake are incremental, and the next major change in Intel’s chipsets isn’t coming until 2017 with Cannonlake. Regardless of which chipset Apple uses, we should see a nice performance boost compared to the Haswell chips in current MacBook Pro models. Hopefully we’ll get better battery life, too. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit Tags: MacBook Pro, refresh 7 Comments Add a comment geoduck September 29, 2016 Eager for these to come out. You mentioned the week of the 10th. 9to5 Mac is saying the 24th. I hope TMO is right. As far as USB-C, if they have TB3 support that’s fine. I can get an adapter for my old devices. However they better have a bunch of ports. I’d like to see 4. The single port on the MacBook is absurd. I hope they keep the memory card drive too. I use it a lot. The OLED Function key row: Meh. Until I see how it’s used I’m withholding judgement. Skylake is fine John M., a few weeks ago, pointed out the performance difference isn’t that great so it doesn’t bother me. What I DO want is storage. That the low end MBP has a 128GB drive is an embarrassment. Bump that up to 256, have the second tier at 512, and top end 1TB with build to order at 2TB. I don’t care if Apple wants us to store stuff on the cloud. The cloud isn’t always accessible. I need local storage. Even if backups and archives, and indeed some files are in iCloud, I have hefty video files that I need to work with locally. I want space. While you’re at it bump the base memory to 16GB. It’s a Pro machine.

What We Know So Far [RUMORS] By Mariel Peralta Sep 29, 2016 | 3:11 AM Microsoft has been keeping mum about the details of the Microsoft Surface Pro 5, but rumors are saying that the hybrid laptop may be coming sooner than expected. Earlier rumors of the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 say that the device may be released in 2017 because the company is waiting up on Intel's Kaby Lake processors which will not be released until the end of this year. New rumors are saying that the Surface Pro 5 may be released as early as next month to rival the rumored release of the MacBook Pro 2016. Microsoft Surface Pro 5 Release Date, News and Rumors Microsoft may be releasing the Surface Pro 5 as early as next month in order to rival the release of Apple's MacBook Pro 2016, according to The Bitbag. There was an earlier report about Apple's laptop that stated the MacBook Pro 2016 may be having an October launch. The two laptops are in constant rivalry and that is why the rumors for an earlier release of the Surface Pro 5 have surfaced. According to the outlet, Microsoft plans for the Surface Pro 5 to have Intel's Kaby Lake processors. However, the chips aren't expected until the end of 2016 so the chances of the hybrid laptop having an early release are low. That is if Intel comes out with an earlier release of the chips this year, the Surface Pro 5 may have a bigger chance of having an earlier release at the last quarter of this year. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit Microsoft Surface Pro 5 Rumored Specs and Price The Surface Pro 5 is a highly anticipated device from Microsoft because it is a major flagship and because of its rumored next-level specs. According to Headlines and Global News, the Surface Pro 5 will have a display screen that can support 2K and 4K. The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will reportedly have several variations and some of the units may house either a Core i3 for standard models or a Core i7 for the higher end units. The hybrid laptop may also feature a USB-C port and a rumored rechargeable Surface pen that can be charged wirelessly through the tablet with a magnet. As for the price tag, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is rumored to fetch a starting price of $900 for the standard models. The high end models of the device may go for $1,600 each, Science World Report noted.

Lifestyle What your laptop decoration says about you Stick it to the man, says Rachael Sigee Rachael Sigee Thursday 29 September 2016 11:03 BST It used to be that toting a MacBook indicated you were one of three things: a graphic designer, a photographer or a DJ. The hardware designated creativity and modernity, and suggested that you’d likely soon be running a tech start-up. But now everyone in the coffee shop has the same gear so you need to customise your kit to stand out from the co-working crowd. If you’re the type to wear your opinion on your sleeve (literally), a MacBook decal is the way to go: there is seemingly a sticker for every taste. Vinyl Revolution has a perky selection, including the Amber Elise Pineapple, the Alice Searching Behind the Curtains and the Calligraphy Unicorn. Coverage isn’t just about looking good. In June Mark Zuckerberg posted a picture on Facebook to promote Instagram and potentially revealed more than he intended to. The internet noticed that he had covered both the camera and microphone on his MacBook with tape. Certainly the Facebook boss will have more concerns about security than most, but if you’re concerned about surveillance, SpiShutter is a discreet magnetic webcam blocker that will put your mind at ease without spoiling the look of your laptop (£15, spishutter.myshopify.com). Customisation is also an opportunity to advertise your skills. Cover the back of your laptop with a whiteboard or blackboard from Draw Attention and inscribe it with your email address, Twitter handle or — if you’re an artist or designer — scrawl an example of your work on it (drawattention.co).

The Amsterdam-based founders of Uncover realised that the backlight that shines through your Apple logo spreads across the entire screen, and if you lasercut a design all the way across the laptop’s back it has striking effects. “Apple’s products are already iconic,” says Uncover’s Victor van Doorn, “but they’ve become so commonplace that it’s no longer a statement of personal creativity — now it’s almost an indication of conformity. We’re on this cat-and-mouse quest with Apple, where they keep making their MacBooks thinner and more repair-unfriendly and we keep finding ways to uncover them.” Read more 7 best laptop bags for students Its bespoke designs start at €499 and are prized by world-renonwned DJs including Jamie xx, tech CEOs from Evernote and Snapchat and even Dutch royalty — the King of the Netherlands has his own customised screen (uncovermac.com).  Meanwhile, if you’re missing old-school Apple Macs with the bright bulbous backs, channel the classic vibe by covering your logo with a vinyl rainbow sticker (£3.99, etsy/uk/shop/Supertogether) — which doubles conveniently as an opportunity to show your love for Pride.  And if you want to test your tattoo plans before you get that sleeve inked, Vinyl Revolution also stocks a selection of appropriate mandalas (vinylrevolution.co.uk).

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Lenovo ZUK Z2 smartphone By Desire Athow Review  Shares Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Verdict A capable smartphone that has been let down by three big issues. Pros Price Performance Multi purpose finger print reader Cons Firmware update No NFC No Band 20 Lenovo is already a well-established brand in Western Europe thanks to its personal computer brand which counts the legendary ThinkPad range and German manufacturer, Medion, amongst its ranks.  It also absorbed storage vendor Iomega, IBM’s Intel-based server business and NEC personal computer range.  The company recently acquired phone manufacturer Motorola, inheriting yet another iconic brand whose name still carries a lot of value for a mainstream audience. But the latest move of the Chinese company, which is already the biggest PC vendor in the world, has been surprising.  It launched a division called Zuk which is a Chinese-only brand, apparently aiming to compete with the likes of OnePlus One (a subsidiary of OPPO), Honor (a subsidiary of Huawei) and Xiaomi.  Gearbest sent us the Zuk Z2 which is its latest addition to its portfolio, one that goes head to head against the Honor 8 and the OnePlus 2. The phone costs just under £200 including delivery; we would suggest that you read this piece about the pros and cons of buying technology from online Chinese retailers (links to our sister website, TechRadar).  The design The phone bears a strong resemblance with the iPhone 5 No surprise there, ZUK uses the same sort of design that you’d find on premium models. Indeed, the phone has an air of iPhone 5 about it, with an entirely black finish. It sports lean lines and a minimalist design with dual 2.5D Arc glass front and back sides. As a business phone, the ZUK will have no problem displayed next to the latest high-end smartphones on the market. Not a hint of plastic here. The software is an entirely different story; more on that later. Glass is a premium material but suffers from three big disadvantages. It is fragile (despite what Gorilla Glass will say – note that the phone doesn’t use GG), it does attract fingerprints and it has a nasty tendency to slide on smooth surfaces (which often end up with a big thump when it hits the floor).  To Lenovo’s credit, it seems that they used an oleophobic coating to make the rear and the front less greasy.  The front fascia contains the speaker, a front facing camera as well as a physical home button that hides a few tricks. Just below that, on the shorter sides, is the headset input, the USB Type C connector and the speaker grill. On the side is the power button, the volume rocker and the SIM card holder.  There’s no micro SD card slot – the phone comes with 64GB by default - and two nano SIM cards, both on standby, can be supported.  At the back is a small ZUK logo – no mention of Lenovo – a single flash and the camera sensor. ZUK says that it used metal particle coating on the sides to enhance the phone’s look; what that means is that it makes it look matte. The hardware The ZUK Z2 is a powerhouse The phone’s dimensions - 8.5 x 142 x 69mm – is great for whoever is not a big fan of phablets; ditto for the weight which tops the scale at only 149g. Bear in mind that it has a smaller than average 5-inch display, coupled with a full HD resolution though, it does produce sharp pictures. More on that later.  As for most of the high end vendors – and unlike many of its tier-2 Chinese competitors which have opted for Mediatek chip - the Zuk Z2 uses a Qualcomm one, the Snapdragon 820, a beast of a processor that runs four cores at up to 2.2GHz and has an Adreno 530 GPU.  As expected, it supports 802.11ac, LTE (all UK 4G bands except Band 20/800MHz), LPDDR4 and Bluetooth 4.1. There’s also an array of sensors including a gyroscope, a compass, a hall sensor, a proximity sensor and a light one.  As mentioned before the ZUK Z2 comes with 64GB onboard storage; note that the phone uses the slower eMMC 5.1 technology rather than the faster – but more expensive - UFS 2.0 one. The rear camera sports a 13-megapixel sensor from Samsung while the front one is an 8-megapixel model. Both have fairly wide apertures (f/2.2 and f/2.0 respectively). And the rear camera can shoot at 4K. The smartphone also came with a USB Type C cable and a tiny adaptor with a Chinese plug but one which delivers far more juice than your average charger. It’s rated 2.5A at 5.3V which equals 13.25W or almost a third more than a standard mobile power adaptor.  Sadly, there’s no NFC capabilities which is simply unacceptable on a phone in this category. This short-range, low power connectivity mechanism has become more popular and omitting it automatically excludes it from some crucial use case scenarios like Android Pay.  In use A look at the connectors As expected, the components in the ZUK Z2 delivered a stellar performance; it blazed through the popular Antutu mobile benchmark, delivering a superb score of 140,058 which is within spitting distance of the leader, the OnePlus 3. The display uses the LTPS technology, probably from Sharp (now Foxconn); that’s a similar display used by the Apple iPhone 7. The pictures look crisp even in broad day light with an average contrast and excellent brightness. Colours are not too saturated and looked natural with excellent viewing angles; out-of-the-box options to tinker with the display settings are limited though. As expected – thanks to a pixel density of 441PPI – the icons and texts remained sharp. The sound quality is one of the few weak spots; the mono speaker failed to deliver the oomph and reach the highs of devices like the Sony Xperia Z3 which deliver sound through two front facing speakers. Audio quality remains a recurrent issue with Chinese smartphones.  One bright spot though has to be the fingerprint reader which can be configured and is not only fast (100ms response time) but also unobtrusive. The hardware only tells half of the story: bear in mind that this is a smartphone for the Chinese market so the installed firmware indicates that. We encountered Chinese characters when trying to update to the latest version of the OS (2.1.059 ST).  Sadly, that didn’t go as planned and is symptomatic of the sort of experience you encounter with devices that are not location-optimised. We had to install a VPN to download the most recent firmware update as ZUK’s servers wouldn’t allow anyone from outside China to do it. And even then, we couldn’t install it because the phone was apparently encrypted (we couldn’t find any option in the settings to disable it). Furthermore, although the ZUK Z2 came with Google Play, most of the other Google services (Youtube, Gmail etc) were not installed by default. At the time of writing, there’s no English version of the ZUK website which means no official support (you can always rely on unofficial third party user forums but at your own risk). As for the battery life, it was excellent. The 3,500mAh battery managed to keep the phone running for almost two days, albeit without any intensive tasks (no Youtube or gaming involved). Verdict A view from the top Clearly, using this phone is not for the faint hearted. The number of hoops you need to go through to get an OTA (Over the air) update is frightening and highlights the gulf that exists between established brands like Huawei or Samsung and those – who like ZUK - aspire to match them.  Obviously, Lenovo has no excuse to fall back on. The OTA experience should be much better than that even if it is a smartphone destined for the Chinese market. There’s also the lack of NFC which puzzled us as much as it disappointed us. And, while entirely subjective, the use of glass at the back instead of metal or plastic means that the phone is more likely to be scratched especially as it slides more easily on any surface with a gentle slope.   Ours got a few scratches within 24 hours. Sure, a protective sleeve or case would help but then doesn’t that negate the purpose of having a glass back in the first place? That combined with the fact that it doesn’t support band 20 (800MHz) makes it a no-no for O2 customers whose LTE service uses this frequency exclusively. MVNO customers from Giff Gaff, Tesco Mobile and Talk Talk are also in the same boat. In the end, the ZUK Z2 is a prime example of a phone that could certainly become a hit but will probably have to be sidelined until the major issues highlighted before are solved. The Verdict 3 out of 5 Lenovo ZUK Z2 A capable smartphone that has been let down by three big issues.

Join For Free Is iPaaS solving the right problems? Not knowing the fundamental difference between iPaaS and dPaaS could cost you down the road. Brought to you in partnership with Liaison Technologies. The Apache Hadoop project recently announced its 3.0.0-alpha1 release. Given the scope of a new major release, the Apache Hadoop community decided to release a series of alpha and beta releases leading up to 3.0.0 GA. This gives downstream applications and end users an opportunity to test and provide feedback on the changes, which can be incorporated during the alpha and beta process. The 3.0.0-alpha1 release incorporates thousands of new fixes, improvements, and features since the previous minor release, 2.7.0, which was released over a year ago. The full changelog and release notes are available on the Hadoop website, but we’d like to drill into the major new changes that landed in 3.0.0-alpha1. Disclaimer: As this release is an alpha, there are no guarantees regarding API stability or quality. The feature set and behavior are subject to change during the course of development. HDFS Erasure Coding HDFS Erasure Coding is a major new feature, and one of the driving features for releasing Hadoop 3.0.0. As described in this Cloudera blog post, erasure coding can reduce storage costs by up to 50% compared to 3x replication while maintaining the same or better durability. Moreover, as shown in a joint Intel-Cloudera blog post, erasure coding adds minimal overhead when using Intel’s optimized ISA-L routines, and can actually improve read and write performance in some conditions. Considering trends in data growth and datacenter hardware, we foresee HDFS erasure coding being an important feature in years to come. YARN Timeline Service v.2 3.0.0-alpha1 includes an early preview of YARN Timeline Service v.2, including. This includes container events, metrics, and application-specific information like the number of map and reduce tasks. The Timeline Service v2 is a new implementation that improves upon the scalability and reliability of TSv1, and enhances usability by introducing flows and aggregation. More details are available in the YARN Timeline Service v.2 docs. Shell Script Rewrite The Hadoop shell scripts have been rewritten with an eye toward unifying behavior, addressing numerous long-standing bugs, improving documentation, as well as adding new functionality. This update affects users who use Hadoop environment variables or integrate with the shell commands. See HADOOP-9902 for incompatible changes and other details, as well as the the Unix Shell Guide. Support for Multiple Standby NameNodes HDFS NameNode high availability with QuorumJournalManager uses a Paxos quorum to store the NameNode edit log. With a three-node quorum, this change means we can tolerate the loss of any one node and still continue operation. However, business-critical deployments may wish to run with higher levels of fault-tolerance, e.g. a five-node quorum to be able to tolerate the loss of any two nodes. QuorumJournalManager already supports an arbitrary number of nodes, but fault tolerance was limited since HDFS was only able to run a single active and single standby NameNode. Hadoop 3 eliminates this restriction by supporting running multiple standby NameNodes. This improves the fault tolerance of HDFS. See the updated HDFS HA docs for information on configuring multiple standby NameNodes. Java 8 Minimum Runtime Version Another major motivation for a new major release was bumping the minimum supported Java version to Java 8. This is critically important as Java 7 was end-of-lifed in April 2015, meaning Oracle would no longer publicly support it with security fixes. Thus, all Hadoop 3 JARs are compiled for a Java 8 language version, and require a Java 8 runtime version. This is also important because many libraries only support Java 8, so this bump allowing Hadoop to upgrade its dependencies to more modern versions. New Default Ports for Several Services To avoid bind errors on startup, the default ports of the NameNode, Secondary NameNode, DataNode, and KMS have been moved out of the Linux ephemeral range (32768-61000). See the release notes for HDFS-9427 and HADOOP-12811 for a full list of port changes. This update should improve the reliability of rolling restarts on large clusters. Intra-DataNode Balancer Intra-DataNode balancing functionality addresses the intra-node skew that can occur when disks are added or replaced. See the disk balancer section in the HDFS Commands Guide for more information. Stay tuned for more information on this feature in a future blog post! Miscellaneous The 3.0.0-alpha1 release is also the first release that incorporates a number of changes to the release process. We are now using Apache Yetus (incubating) to automatically generate our release notes and changelog from JIRA, a vast improvement over our previous system of manually editing a text file. Building the release artifacts has been Docker-ized and streamlined with a new create-release script, which improves correctness and enables us to make more frequent releases. Hadoop’s versioning scheme has been adjusted, letting us more easily release from multiple concurrent branches in parallel (e.g. 2.6.x, 2.7.x, 3..0.x), as well as the addition of -alphaX/-betaX tags. Conclusion Apache Hadoop 3.0.0-alpha1 marks a major development milestone on the road to a 3.0.0 GA release. The features and improvements listed here will eventually be incorporated into CDH after our usual rigorous testing and integration process.

Following the company’s $12 million Series B funding, bringing total funding to $23 million, the two recent management appointments reflect HG Data’s commitment to transform the business intelligence industry through the use of technological competitive intelligence. Both executives will be based in the company’s Santa Barbara headquarters. With more than 20 years of commercial software and engineering experience, Fox joins HG from Liason Technologies where, most recently, he served as vice president of emerging technologies and general manager for Liaison’s cloud-based ALLOY, the industry’s first Data-Platform-as-a-Service (dPaaS) offering. Prior to Liason, Fox was director of engineering at MuleSoft, a widely used API-based integration platform for applications, data, and devices which was recently named to the first-ever Forbes 2016 Cloud 100. At Mulesoft, Fox introduced a micro service-based architecture and launched the business’s first cloud analytics platform to provide insight into the company’s API and integration usage. He is a notable industry expert and has been nominated to CIO Magazine “Ones to Watch” list, and SearchCIO “IT Leadership Award”. Prior to HG Data, Winters spent over a decade at Intel in a variety of strategic marketing roles, and most recently served as a senior member of the company’s marketing organization responsible for identifying and evangelizing key themes and messages around new technologies and strategic partnerships for both consumer and B2B initiatives. She played an integral role in the development and rollout of Intel’s $300 million consumer marketing campaign focused on reinvigorating the Intel brand and driving sales through encouraging PC refresh. In this newly created and key marketing leadership role, Winters will lead HG Data’s product and brand positioning, communications strategy, verbal and visual identity, and analyst and press relations. "Strategic business insight presents tremendous competitive advantage to businesses of all sizes, and HG’s superior competitive intelligence has allowed us to break through in the category,” said Craig Harris, Chief Executive Officer at HG Data. "Rob’s command of the complex Data-Platform-as-a-Service landscape, coupled with Barbara’s unique ability to strategically build and lead marketing teams, make these uniquely talented individuals ideally suited to build upon HG Data’s already viable strengths.” About HG Data HG Data is the global leader in customer intelligence for installed technologies. The world’s largest technology companies, the fastest-growing start-ups, and some of the most innovative OEM partners achieve an unfair advantage by using HG Data in building market analysis, competitive displacement, predictive modeling, marketing campaigns, and client retention initiatives.

Reuters/Stephen Lam Even though Apple has not yet confirmed anything about the MacBook Air 2016, not even whether it will be continuing with the Air line or not, some unconfirmed reports are hard to ignore. First of all, the reports state that an Apple MacBook Air is very much being made and it will boast of some amazing specs such as Apple Pencil, Retina Display and much more. Apple is reportedly refreshing its 13.3-inch MacBook Air and it is very much possible that the product may be released in October. Of course, inclusion of the Intel Kaby Lake processors in Apple MacBook Air 2016 seems unlikely if the device gets an October release. Apart from the Skylake processors, Apple may also consider AMD’s latest “Polaris” graphics processors. Rhoda Alexander, Director Tablet and Notebook PCs at IHS Markit Technology told Forbes that MacBook Air 2016 “production started in the second calendar quarter on refreshes of the 13.3-inch and 15.4-inch MacBook Pro [and] the 13.3-inch MacBook Air.” She also confirmed that Intel Kaby Lake processors are not coming to the device. Thus, Intel Skylake processors seem like a possibility for the MacBook Air 2016. Tech.Mic has reported that the device may sport a thinner design, a flatter keyboard and multi-functional USB-C port technology. This was also confirmed by Bloomberg in August. The MacBook Air 2016 is also expected to come with improved batteries and better cooling modules. The fingerprint scanner is expected to be incorporated in the Home button. Personal Digital Assistant Siri will be introduced to the device as well. According to Macworld, the Apple Pencil-enabled Mac trackpads will have features such as a rotational controller mode, an air mouse mode, inertial sensor input modes and a joystick mode. As per  NDTV, Apple could also be bringing the 5K display this October. If that is the case, then the 5K display technology may also be brought to the Apple MacBook Air 2016. In fact, the inclusion of this technology will infuse fresh enthusiasm in Apple fans for the Air line.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple The most dangerous celebrities to look up on Google Yoni Heisler BGR NewsSeptember 29, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share One of the more common ways that purveyors of malware are able to trick unsuspecting users into downloading malicious software is to prey upon the public’s insatiable appetite for celebrity news, photos and gossip. As a result, some celebrity-oriented search queries tend to be associated with a greater likelihood of downloading malware than others. As Intel notes, malicious actors are quick to put up websites “loaded with malware that can steal passwords and personal information,” especially in the days preceding new movie and music releases and in the days following a major celebrity breakup a’la the recent divorce news involving Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. DON'T MISS: An Apple employee just leaked details about the iPhone 8 Earlier today, Intel published its list of the “most dangerous celebrities” to search for, and checking in at the top of the list is comedian Amy Schumer. Filling out the top 10 are Justin Bieber, Carson Daly, Will Smith, Rhianna, Miley Cyrus, Chris Hardwick, Danieth Tosh, Selena Gomez  and Kesha. All in all, the list isn’t too surprising, though the presence of Carson Daly at number three is somewhat startling. Looking specifically at musicians, artists of note that didn’t crack the top-10 still include a who’s who of entertainers. This year’s riskiest celebrities included some of the most sensational, chart-topping pop artists such as Justin Bieber (No. 2), Rihanna (No. 5), Miley Cyrus (No. 6), Selena Gomez (No. 9) and Kesha (10). Pop, rap, hip-hop and a bit of country were represented by Drake (No. 13), Katy Perry (No. 14), Jason Aldean (No. 16), Justin Timberlake (No. 17), Jennifer Lopez (No. 18), Lady Gaga (No. 19), Nicki Minaj (No. 20), Iggy Azalea (No. 27), Beyoncé (No. 28) and Usher (No. 29) as they rounded out the top 30. While it should go without saying, Intel urges users to only click on search results from reputable sites and, naturally, to avoid any and all Torrent links.

Citing unnamed sources familiar with discussions, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that the two companies are in discussions. A Qualcomm spokeswoman said the company doesn't comment on speculation. NXP, based in The Netherlands, could not be reached for comment. If it happened, the deal would be by far the largest ever for Qualcomm, potentially transforming the company from a mobile chip maker and intellectual property provider to a broad-based semiconductor firm with a slew of products in automotive electronics, Internet of Things, secure payments and other markets. It also could be a tricky integration, merging the cultures of a high-profile Southern California smartphone chip company with a European firm that supplies technology that's not often in the public eye. "This would vault Qualcomm into so many markets, and from a product portfolio standpoint, I think the two companies would be just an awesome match," said Jim McGregor, head of Tirias Research, a technology consulting firm. "But I would be concerned about the culture. These are two drastically different cultures.". Such a deal could return Qualcomm to revenue and earnings growth, however. After three years of fast growth from its lead in 4G LTE technology, Qualcomm has struggled to boost its financial results in the past year or so amid slowing smartphone sales and increased competition in mobile chips. Last year, Qualcomm's revenue fell about 4 percent from 2014 to $25.3 billion. The company is expecting flat results this year. While Qualcomm has been pushing mobile technology into wearables, drones, mobile health, automotive connectivity and other markets besides handsets, these moves have not yet been enough to make up for slowing smartphone growth. "Cellphones have peaked," said Will Strauss, head of industry research firm Forward Concepts. "It's just like Intel has found out the personal computer market. It is not growing anymore because we all have one and last year's model works as good as this year's model, and the same thing is happening with smartphones." Strauss called the potential deal "a surprising move simply because it is a different path than Qualcomm has been on in the past. But certainly I think NXP, if the financing works out, would be a good acquisition for Qualcomm." NXP is among the world's top 10 semiconductor companies, with an estimated $10 billion revenue including its recent acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor. It supplies many chips used in cars, ranging from motor controls for such things as power windows to on-board entertainment systems. It is the world's largest supplier of automotive electronics. NXP also makes Near Field Communication chips for mobile payments, secure payment semiconductors used in smart-chip bank cards and point of sale products, as well as network communications infrastructure chips and radio frequency semiconductors for mobile devices. It also sells sensor chips and range of industrial mirco-controllers. "NXP is probably one of the best positioned semiconductor companies on the planet right now because of their size, their product breath and the fact that they are in key areas that are growing" said McGregor of Tirias Research. "From the Internet of Things to being a leader in automotive to being a leader in security to being a leader in digital networking, they are in a lot of key growth markets." Last year, NXP kicked off what turned out to be a wave of consolidation in the semiconductor industry when it paid nearly $12 billion deal to buy Freescale, which is based in Austin, Texas. Intel followed with a $16.7 billion acquisition of Altera, and Avago jumped in with a $37 billion deal for Broadcom. Qualcomm stayed on the sidelines, with Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf concentrating on trimming costs, including cutting an estimated 4,000 jobs globally. But Qualcomm did hire former Deutsche Bank analyst Brian Modoff last year as an executive vice president of strategy and acquisitions -- signaling that it would consider buyouts as a way to return to growth. Because NXP is based in Europe, Qualcomm could use its $29 billion war chest of offshore cash to finance the purchase, said Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon. Like other global companies, Qualcomm keeps a stockpile of cash offshore to avoid the higher U.S. taxes. In addition to pushing Qualcomm into other markets, it also would be a big enough acquisition to boost Qualcomm's bottom line. Rasgon estimates it would boost Qualcomm's earnings 20 percent to 30 percent. "Given Qualcomm's size there are actually few acquisitions candidates that are big enough to move the needle and that also make sense, at least superficially, from a strategic point of view," said Rasgon. "NXP appears to be one of these." Analysts noted that the two companies are very different in terms of markets, product lifecycles, profit margins, customers and manufacturing strategy. NXP owns semiconductor manufacturing plants, for example, where Qualcomm hires other companies to make the chips that it designs. Shares of both companies jumped on the news of a potential deal. Qualcomm's stock gained 6 percent to $67.47, while NXP's shares surged nearly 17 percent to $96.12 on the Nasdaq.

(WTNH) — November 22, 2014. 12-year-old Tamir Rice was shot by an officer in Cleveland, Ohio while carrying a toy gun. He died the next day. Now, New Haven police are calling on parents to due their part to prevent a similar situation from happening in the city. “I can tell you right now, if either of these was pointed towards me by a bad guy I would do what I can to protect my life,” said Officer David Hartman. At a press conference on Friday afternoon Hartman held up two similar looking rifles. One, an assault weapon used by police. The other, a paintball gun seized during a recent attack. Both look strikingly similar. “These are weapons. They’re considered weapons. The incidents we’ve had, we’re gonna go back and do arrest warrants for the people. Any further incidents, they’ll be prosecuted,” said Sergeant Karl Jacobson, head of the Criminal Intel Unit with New Haven Police. Officers say many of the paintball and BB gun fights happening in the city are part of turf wars between gangs. Last night a 10 year old girl was shot in the head by a paintball gun in Newhallville. This morning another person was hit by a BB gun in Fair Haven. In all about 12 calls came into New Haven Police in the last week alone for similar situations. “We had another scenario where they were on a major roadway in New Haven firing back and forth at each other in stolen cars. It was almost a typical drive by shooting scenario but they were using paint-balls instead,” said Sgt. Jacobson. Police say the calls are coming in from alarmed residents who believe the guns being used are real. Officers say the end result could be tragic. “Police officers arriving at the scene of what is being reported as a gun battle and ending up with teenagers and children shot dead because they were involved in what they thought is some type of game,” said Officer Hartman. Police are urging parents to know what your kids are up to and to tell them to put their guns down. “You need to be involved. These are your kids that are getting into these battles and you have a responsibility to keep your children from harm,” said Hartman.

Richard Trapunski - Sep 30, 2016 share 0 tweet 8 stumble 287 reddit 0 post pin it Tagged: Amy Schumer Drake Jason Aldean Justin Bieber Justin Timberlake Katy Perry Ke$ha Lady Gaga Miley Cyrus Rihanna Selena Gomez Will Smith The internet age has given us access to a whole host of new data to determine the popularity of musicians and celebrities, from YouTube views to Spotify streams. And you'd better believe Drake and Katy Perry are keeping track of their Twitter and Instagram follows. But there's another way of measuring the heat of a public figure: how likely they are to give you a virus. Intel Security just released its 10th annual McAfee Most Dangerous Celebrities study, which tracks which celebrities are the most dangerous to search. Amy Schumer comes first, while musicians like Justin Bieber, Rihanna and Miley Cyrus fill out the list. Here's the whole top 10, in handy infographic form: It's clearly promoting McAfee's protection software, but it's still very handy for people who spend their days googling celebrities, whether they're music writers looking for interesting news (hi), mouthbreathers downloading the latest Nerdist podcast, illegal music and comedy streamers, or, like, anyone under 15. Ignoring the fact that the findings manage to qualify Amy Schumer as a "female comedian" at every single mention of her name, there are some interesting findings here: If you google "Amy Schumer Torrent," for instance, you have a 33% chance of hitting a malicious website. Search Justin Bieber and you've got a 15% chance of hitting trouble (viruses, malware, credit card scams, etc). Beyond the top 10, people searching late night hosts are likely to get hit (how else are you gonna know what dumb game Jimmy Fallon played with the next dangerous politician?), and those searching the hosts of The Voice. There are also a lot of holdouts from streaming subscriptions, apparently, trying to access free music from artists like Drake (No. 13), Katy Perry (No. 14), Jason Aldean (No. 16), Justin Timberlake (No. 17), and Lady Gaga (No. 19). So next time you want to hear the latest Drake & Rihanna rumours, don't try to google it. Just ask Dennis Graham instead: Read the whole study here.

By Todd Haselton | September 30, 2016 Front Page /Virtual Reality/Featured/Gallery By Todd Haselton | September 30, 2016 Stay Connected with Us! Follow TechnoBuffalo Share Universal Orlando recently offered TechnoBuffalo a chance to fly down to Florida to check out its new horror/virtual reality experience called “The Repository.” It’s this year’s addition to Universal’s annual “Halloween Horror Nights” and offers a new spin on theme-park horror adventures. Instead of walking through a haunted house – don’t worry, you’ll experience some of that, too – you’re taken to another world through the use of virtual reality. The experience isn’t cheap – it’s $49.99 plus tax on top of your Halloween Horror Nights admission, but it’s fascinating and fun. I don’t want to give away too many spoilers, so I’ll tell you the backstory and a bit of my experience with the event, and let you enjoy the rest yourself. The Repository The Repository is supposed to be an ancient warehouse built in 1775 for the Scottish army. Since then, it’s been used as a space for collecting haunted artifacts, the sorts of things you hear about in folklore. The artifacts include anything haunted, maybe a bell that rings at night when everyone is upstairs sleeping, or a doll that mysteriously makes its way to different rooms around the house. It’s these sorts of scary objects that have been collected and exist here in The Repository, giving the space some sort of evil power and aura. Somewhere along the line, between the armory and a fire in 1795, rumors of a “Grimslew Curse” have swirled. Your job is to find out if that curse is real and, if so, if you and four of your comrades can break it. “We really wanted to play with a story about artifacts and hauntings,” senior director of art and design at Universal, TJ Mannarino, explained. “Everyone has something that they know that’s haunted. It’s surprising how much people segment their horror, ghost stories hits a chord with everybody. Super-natural paranormal is interesting because it starts to play with the psychological aspects.” You’ll enter into The Repository with the goal of finding a “key.” It’s up to you to decide what that key is and, along the way, you’ll meet a crazy keeper of the relics, a rude scientist, several angry army personnel, a mad key-keeper and more. When it’s time, you’ll travel through a portal to the other world, where you’ll work with certain tools to understand the afterlife and try to get a better understanding of the aforementioned “Grimslew Curse.” A VR Portal This “portal” is where virtual reality comes into play. Characters within the warehouse will help you apply a virtual reality headset after which you’ll explore a burning library, stand atop a pillar hundreds of feet in the air above the ocean and walk in a graveyard. The effects will exhilarate a first-time VR user, but may not be as exciting to someone who has used an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. You will, at the very least, feel transported from this world into another. Mannarino told me Universal uses immersion techniques it employs in other attractions. Actors may touch you at certain aspects and effects like blowing air will help make you feel like you’ve visited somewhere else. You’ll even see other folks in your group while in the virtual realm, each one represented as a glowing mask. While you’ll travel during this experience, in reality you’ve never left the room where you first donned the VR headset. A lot will go on during the roughly 30-minute adventure, so be sure to pay attention. You’ll need to pick up on clues throughout the experience if you want to “win” at the end. I won’t reveal what happens, that’s for you to find out on your own tour through The Repository. My thoughts I found the entire experience very fascinating. Universal used detailed sets, characters and props that it has employed in other experiences, but decided to get its feet wet with advanced technology, too. Mannarino and his team wouldn’t comment on whether or not this is something we’ll see used in more rides that have a permanent position at the park, but said it’s exploring those sorts of options, including looking at other new technologies like augmented reality, and that virtual reality is going to play a huge role in entertainment moving forward. Park-goers and fear-seekers will really enjoy seeing the forefront of where VR can play a role inside amusement parks. Be sure to check out The Repository if you’re heading to Orlando between now and Oct. 31. Disclosure: Universal paid for my flight to Universal Orlando and a night in a hotel so that we could experience The Repository before it opened to the public.

That's where Sato Global Solutions, the new software division of Japan-based Sato Holdings, is working on ways to make shopping at brick-and-mortar retailers "fun" again by providing the interactivity of online and other new benefits. Sato, which opened its headquarters in Fort Lauderdale in May 2015, has joined an alliance formed earlier this year by communications company BT (British Telecom) Americas in Dallas. Together, the companies and their partners are developing technology that tracks inventory, maximizes performance of sales associates and provides more personal service for customers. Consider fitting rooms equipped with wall-mounted touch screens — allowing consumers to request that a different size or color be brought by a sales associate, or giving them recommendations on which shirts in inventory could match the jeans or skirts they're trying on. "Think about all the things you do online — you compare products, you get recommendations. We want to do that and more in a store," said Tom Wolf, vice president of global retail and consumer goods for BT Americas.

One of the reasons for the decline in manual transimissions is that cars with automatic transmissions now get better gas mileage than the manuals. Wolf said the alliance plans to "duplicate anything you can do online, and make [a store] more entertaining and just as personalized." Wolf said Sato was selected as an alliance partner because of its global presence and software development. "Sato has a great vision," Wolf said. With about 50 software developers and other workers at Sato's headquarters, employment is expected to continue increasing as it develops software for the alliance. "We're aiming to deploy the first completed prototype within a few months. We're going through the pilot stage," said Goro Yumiba, executive head of the Japanese company's North American operations, including Sato Global Solutions in Fort Lauderdale, which provides data capture and analytics software for hospitals, retailers and other customers. Nexgen Packaging tag on a piece of clothing, which is used to track retail inventory. Sato hopes to deploy the first alliance product prototype in 2017, Yumiba said. During a recent visit to Sato, BT's vice president of business development, Keith Sherry, explained that the alliance brings together complementary technologies. Dubbed the Acuitas (Latin for "insight") Digital Alliance, it involves five companies: BT, which is providing integration and customer service; Intel, the hardware; Sato, the software; RetailNext, video analytics; and Nexgen Packaging, the RFID, or radio frequency identification. "There's an increasing need to get better consumer engagements and bridge the gap between the online experience with consumer engagement within the store," Sherry said. RFID was first used in manufacturing and distribution centers, but now the technology is being deployed to track individual items within a store. In building its system, Acuitas also is employing cameras, Wi-Fi and digital signage to increase interaction between customers and retailer at the store. Sherry said he couldn't reveal which retailers have signed on to buy the Acuitas system, only that they are "major clothing and cosmetics retailers," many of whom operate in South Florida. With Amazon and other e-retailers continuing to gain market share, traditional retailers invested in brick-and-mortar locations continue to struggle. In August, Macy's announced it would close 100 stores, or 15 percent of its stores nationwide. Earlier this year, Walmart announced plans to shut down 269 stores this year. Sports Authority filed for bankruptcy in March, resulting in closures of all its 450 stores. And retailers Target, JC Penney, Kmart, Sears and Kohl's also have been streamlining store locations. BT executives say brick-and-mortar stores sales still are the bulk of the market. As of the second quarter of 2016, about 8.1 percent of total sales came from e-commerce, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The remainder, nearly 92 percent, came from stores. Yet online sales continue to grow. During the last holiday season — the biggest sales period of the year for retailers — online sales increased 20 percent, according to 2015 data by MasterCard SpendingPulse, which studies purchases made with credit cards, cash and checks. While it was a good year for holiday sales, total retail sales, excluding automobiles and gasoline, rose only 7.9 percent. Bernie Saenz, director of projects for Sato, recently demonstrated his company's new Smart Fitting app to retail executives in a store showroom set up at the headquarters. Visiting retailers included Perry Ellis, Art of Shaving and Lamps Plus,  according to Sato. In addition to the fitting room touch screens helping consumers with clothing suggestions and requests, the technology could be used to keep track of store employees — how many are in the fitting room helping customers, at the sales counter, or on break, Saenz said. He said it could also help with an industry-wide problem: the misplaced store item. "You're missing an opportunity to sell an item because it wasn't where it was supposed to be," Saenz told the retailers. With a radio frequency tag on each item, store employees can receive an alert when the item is discarded by the shopper and lands on the wrong sales rack. Eventually, Acuitas plans to leverage customer loyalty programs through its technology, so when customers visit a store, they can be addressed by name and be presented clothing and other items tailored to them. BT executives said through the alliance's technology, retailers could gather specific information about customers and inventory. They could see which item is being left in the dressing room, instead of being purchased, for example, indicating a problem with the outfit. "We're giving information to the retailer they've never had before," BT's Sherry said. "Now we're getting into predictability on things that are trending and things you should be manufacturing." Sherry said reinventing the store experience "is getting back to enjoying shopping." While online shopping can be convenient, he said, "what you don't get from the online experience is that immediate satisfaction of, 'I just bought something.'

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Notebooks Apple MacBook Pro Rumored For October 24th Launch As More Details Surface By Ramish Zafar Posted 2 months ago 20Shares Share Tweet Submit All done with the launch of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, Apple’s ow focusing aggressively on the MacBook. Reports surrounding the notebook have started to increase as September ends. While we’ve heard some analysts comment that a late September launch might be on the cards, it doesn’t look to be that way. Now, more sources have started to speculate on an October launch for the notebooks. In fact, some have gone as far as to give a precise launch date. Take a look below to find out more. Apple To Launch MacBook Pro In Late October Claim Multiple Sources Apple’s launch of the MacBook has been in the rumor mill for quite a while. The biggest question surrounding this year’s notebook launches from Cupertino is whether we’ll get to see Intel’s Kaby Lake on board. Current word on the street doesn’t make it out to be that way. We’re hearing more about AMD and Polaris’ potential presence on Apple’s product portfolio. Now, multiple sources claim to be in the know-how of the MacBook Pro’s launch date. Both of them believe that the notebook will be launched in late October. It’s believed that Apple’s working on an aggressive schedule. The company’s current focus on macOS 10.12.1 is geared towards catering to hardware upgrades for the lineup. To that end, the MacBook Pro is expected to feature several interesting upgrades this year. Advertisement TheApplePost is also reporting a potential launch date for the MacBook Pro. According to their sources, Apple will launch the notebooks on October 24th. This marks a month until the notebooks are finally unveiled by Cupertino. Furthermore, it’s also believed that Cupertino will seed one more beta version of macOS 10.12.1 to developers and public next week. There’s little information on Cupertino’s plans for the MacBook Air, with some analysts claiming that the gadget will also see an upgrade. The MacBook Pro is expected to feature several upgrades on board. For starters, it’s rumored with an OLED touch bar. This will replace the top function key bar on the notebook, and make for much more interactive methods of input. Secondly, Touch ID is also expected to finally make it on the MacBook Pro. This will also include Apple Pay support as users will get to authenticate their transactions directly from their MacBooks. Thoughts?

It recently updated its ThinkPad X1 Yoga with an excellent 2560x1440 OLED panel, for example, making it even more attractive to executives. But the company hasn’t forgotten users who dig more utilitarian builds, and don't need the latest bells and whistles. The ThinkPad X260 is all about functionality, portability, and quality. It is a no-nonsense road warrior. At about $765, the ThinkPad X260 has the lowest starting price of any laptop in Lenovo’s ThinkPad X ultrabook series. The ThinkPad X1 Carbon starts at $1,142 and features a very sleek, carbon-fiber reinforced body, along with high-resolution display options and other mouth-watering tech. The ThinkPad X1 Yoga (starting at $1,394.10) packs high-end hardware into the multi-mode chassis that has made Lenovo’s Yoga notebooks famous. As the shared ‘X1’ in their names implies, these two notebooks are more similar to each other than to the somewhat-blocky, enterprise-friendly ThinkPad X260, but there’s no doubt that X260 belongs in Lenovo’s ultraportable, high-quality X series. Lenovo ThinkPad X260 Specifications & Features Processor Intel Core i5-6300U Dual-Core 2.4GHz (Max 3GHz) OS Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Display 12.5-inch FHD IPS (1920x1080) 300 nits Non-Touch Graphics Intel HD Graphics 520 Storage 256GB SSD Opal 2 Memory 8GB DDR4-2133 Audio Dolby Advanced Audio v2 Camera 720p HD Camera Networking LAN, Intel Dual-Band Wireless-AC 8260 (2x2), BT 4.1 Ports: Left USB 3.0 x2, Mini DisplayPort, HDMI Port, Power Port Ports: Right Headphone/Mic jack, USB 3.0 Port, SIM Slot, SD Card Reader, Ethernet Port, Lock Slot Keyboard Island-Style, Backlight Option Battery 3-Cell 23.2Wh Li-Ion Battery, 6-Cell Li-Ion Rear Battery Upgrade, Mobile Broadband Support, Smart Card Reader Support Extras Fingerprint Reader, TrackPoint, 6-Cell Li-Ion Rear Battery Upgrade, Mobile Broadband Support, Smart Card Reader Support Weight 2.9 Pounds Dimensions 12.03 x 8.21 x 0.8 Inches Warranty 1-Year Depot Or Carry-In Price $1,250.10 As Configured - Find Them At Amazon The ThinkPad X260 has a 12.5-inch display, which is the smallest panel in the X series. (The ThinkPad X1 Carbon and ThinkPad X1 Yoga have 14-inch displays.) The display on the base model is an uninspiring 1366x768, but you can bump that to a 1920x1080 IPS display when customizing your ultrabook before purchase. Touch screens aren’t available for the ThinkPad X260 line, however. Available processors range from an Intel Core i3-6100U to a Core i7-6600U. Our system features the Core i5-6300U, which makes for a nice performance/price balance in this notebook. The CPU has a 2.4GHz base clock speed and can Turbo up to 3GHz. The Intel HD Graphics 520 engine built-into Skylake is standard on the ThinkPad X260 series, but the line has multiple memory options, up to 18GB. Our test system arrived with 8GB of DDR4-2133 memory. Lenovo is touting the ThinkPad X260 as enterprise-ready, so it’s no surprise that the notebook has a full complement of security features, including a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip. Lenovo also opted for its ThinkPad 256GB OPAL2.0 SSD over more pedestrian storage options to provide OPAL 2.0 and IEEE 1667 support. You can add the optional security features when you configure your notebook online. The ThinkPad X260 equips a Smart Card reader for an additional $10 and can also include a fingerprint reader. As for networking, the ThinkPad X260 is ready for anything. It features an Ethernet port, which is becoming an uncommon sight on ultra-portable notebooks these days, along with an Intel Dual-Band Wireless-AC (2x2) 8260 WiFi controller. Wireless-AC is an important feature for road warriors, who move from one hotspot to the next. Bluetooth is also onboard for peripherals. Of course, one of the most important considerations for business travelers is battery life, and Lenovo aims high here, stocking the ThinkPad X260 with two 3-cell, 23.2Wh batteries. One is in the front of the laptop and the other, removable battery sits at the back. As you’ll see in our performance analysis, we tested the ThinkPad X260 with both its standard battery set and the 72Wh optional rear battery. Because the notebook has two batteries, the rear battery is hot-swappable: You can pop it out and replace it with a backup battery without powering off the laptop. The notebooks’ support for massively extending its battery life is clearly going to be a chief selling point for many business users. But before we dig into how the notebook (and its batteries) perform, let’s take a look at its design. Great battery life won’t matter much if you don’t like the notebook… NEXT PAGE Article Index:    Introducing the Lenovo ThinkPad X260 Lenovo ThinkPad X260 Design and Build Quality Lenovo ThinkPad X260 ATTO Disk, SunSpider And Cinebench Performance Lenovo ThinkPad X260 PCMark 8, 3DMark, Far Cry 2 Performance Lenovo ThinkPad X260 Battery Life And Acoustics Performance Summary And Final Analysis Tags:  Intel, Lenovo, ThinkPad, Core i5, x260 Image gallery Related content Alienware 13 R3 Review: OLED, GeForce 10 Pop And Performance WD My Passport Wireless Pro Review: Portable Storage For Mobile Devices Netgear Orbi AC3000 Mesh WiFi System Review Adventures With Dell's Rugged PC Line-Up Moto Z Play Review: 8-Cores And Insane Battery Life Comments Show comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Follow Us: Twitter Facebook RSS Email YouTube AppStore Google+ 85K 9K 4K 27K CONVERSATIONS Chrome Crushing It In The Browser Wars...45 Alienware 13 R3 Review: OLED, GeForce 10...13 Google DeepMind AI's Ability To Discern...9 Hell Freezes Over As Microsoft Releases...8 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Allegedly...7 Kaspersky Calls Out Microsoft For...5 Apple 13-inch MacBook Pro With Touch Bar...5 FEATURED Huawei Honor 8 Review: A Stylish,...

Purism Is Still Hoping To Build A GNU/Linux Free Software Librem Smartphone Written by Michael Larabel in Hardware on 30 September 2016 at 10:32 AM EDT. 16 Comments Purism, the startup behind the Librem laptops with a focus on free software and user privacy/freedom, still has their minds set on coming up with a GNU/Linux smartphone. Purism continues selling their high-priced laptops and their Librem 11 is forthcoming as an Intel-based tablet/convertible device with stocking station. Next on their horizon they want to produce "the ideal no-carrier, Free Software phone running a bona fide GNU+Linux stack." Purism wants the Librem Phone to be running a free software stack made up of GNU+Linux without Android, protects user privacy, emphasizes digital security, etc. The specifications they are thinking about include a Freescale i.MX6 quad-core SoC, Vivante GC2000 graphics using the Etnaviv driver, DDR3 RAM, and other modern sensors / receivers / adapters. They also hope to have kill switches for webcam / microphone / GPS, external mini SD slots, etc. In working towards this device, Purism has started the Librem Phone survey. They are hoping users will provide their feedback on device specification particulars, ideal pricing, their main concerns, what apps they would be after, etc. Can a possible Purism Librem GNU/Linux Phone survive where the likes of OpenMoko, webOS, Jolla / Sailfish OS, Firefox OS, and Ubuntu Phone have either failed or made little sustainable progress in the smartphone market against the iOS and Android giants?

Ratan Tata. AFP "Hearty congratulations to India's armed forces and Intel agencies for successful surgical retaliatory action against Pak terrorist camps," Tata said in a tweet. Yesterday, India Inc had rallied behind the Army's move to conduct surgical strikes across the Line of Control and saying it was time to act tough while ruling out any negative impact on the country's economy and trade. "Our civil n (sic) decent response in the past hasn't been met with reciprocity so it's time to act tough," Biocon CMD Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw tweeted. Recalling an earlier tweet in which he had said "I trust our army. They know how to pursue & retaliate" in the wake of the Uri attack, industrialist Anand Mahindra said: "I don't need to add anything more today..." The action by the Army came 11 days after the attack by Pakistan-based terror outfit JeM on an Indian army camp in Uri in Kashmir. Hearty congratulations to India's armed forces and Intel agencies for successful surgical retaliatory action against Pak terrorist camps. — Ratan N.

Ok, got it TAGS Technology Car makers and telco giants join forces for Car-to-X communication tech. 30 September 2016 by Danny Kwan Audi AG, BMW Group, and Daimler AG, together with telecommunications giants develop the future of car communications German premium car makers form 5G Automotive Association with telecommunication giants to spearhead implementation of ‘Car-to-X’ communications technology. Although technological progress might appear as an individual achievement, bringing autonomous mobility to a broader and widespread application would require a team effort. This is why Audi AG, BMW Group, and Daimler AG, together with telecommunications giants, Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Nokia, and Qualcomm have come together to form what is known as the ‘5G Automotive Association’. The association’s end goal is to accelerate the commercial availability and global market penetration of ‘Car-to-X’ communications technology. That being said, the association will be involved in developing, testing and promoting communication solutions for cars and infrastructure. This also includes supporting the standardisation of the technology, engage regulatory bodies, acquire certification, and undergo approval processes, while addressing technical challenges such as security, privacy, and cloud computing distribution. On top of that the association also plans to run joint innovation and development projects, with large scale pilot programmes and trial deployments. With the emergence of 5G mobile networks, automakers are seeing the potential to deliver car-to-everything communications technology, or otherwise known as ‘Car-to-X’. This technology also allows cars to hook up to infrastructures to find empty parking spaces. As highlighted by Audi’s ‘swarm intelligence’, this technology has the capability of allowing the cars themselves to transmit information on traffic hazards or changes in the road conditions between one another. This technology also allows cars to hook up to infrastructures to find empty parking spaces or even time their approach to traffic lights as to arrive just as the lights turn green. Going in line with the shift towards the ‘Internet of Things’, the technology has the capability of greatly improving safety and reduce or eliminate traffic congestion, as well as enabling cars to integrate themselves into a city’s infrastructure. The widespread integration of such technology would allow autonomous vehicles to see far beyond the peripheral vision of their onboard sensors and cameras.  Effectively the system could enable such cars to steer clear of hazards, congested roads, and respond quickly to changing traffic speeds and conditions that are far beyond its vicinity. While ‘Car-to-X’ technology has been around for years, it has never been rolled out to mainstream applications due to issues such as standardisation, and also the technical challenge of achieving the data transfer loads required. Back in 2011 Continental AG demonstrated the potential of their ‘Car-to-X’ technology, and while the hardware was available to make all this possible back then, its developers admit that the biggest hurdle to overcome is data transfer. According to their estimates the amount of data transmitted between one car to the other or to another infrastructure was measured in megabytes. When combined with several such vehicles in the same area, the transfer loads could easily go into gigabytes. The association believes that these next-generation telecommunications networks are able to handle much more data volume, with significantly reduced latency issues, and thus are able to transmit data reliably between sources and receivers.  Despite its association to the big three German premium brands, the 5G Automotive Association says that their doors are open for other carmakers to join their programme. For now the association will more likely focus on developing the technology for the European market, though should their efforts prove successful, you can expect the standards and technology developed from this association to spread to other markets rather quickly. Is this alliance the key to mainstream ‘Car-to-X’ tech? Tell us what you think in the comments below.

The British government is trying to tackle the problem with publicity. Starting in 2018, it will require all companies with more than 250 employees to publish information about average and median pay differences as well as the number of male and female employees in each salary quartile. But sunlight may not be enough to force change. As a young reporter, I worked for the Washington Post Company, which, years earlier, had been sued for gender discrimination by some of its female employees. As part of the settlement, the company was required to disclose publicly the pay breakdown by gender for various categories of newsroom job. Each time, the gaps were visible and significant. By now, one hopes the company is doing much better. Back then, the disclosures were simply a depressing reminder of how far women still had to go. In the US, President Barack Obama has tried to put the weight of the White House behind the issue. In June, he convened a summit on the state of American women and asked companies to sign an equal pay pledge promising to analyse their hiring, promotion and pay practices annually with the aim of eliminating inequality. President Obama followed up with a second event in August to announce that a total of 57 groups — ranging from consulting firms and tech giants to airlines and retailers — had signed up. One of them, Intel, has already been working on such imbalances for years. The technology group tracks base pay and bonus targets by gender, ethnicity, job classification and location. Since 2009, it has been running company-wide statistical analyses to spot differences that cannot be explained by performance, education, length of service or other legitimate factors. If follow-up interviews fail to turn up a qualitative reason for the gap, the company boosts the person’s pay. Related article Close the gender gap to boost output Narrowing the gender divide offers economic gains as well as societal benefits This year, Intel announced that it had reached full gender pay parity and 99 per cent parity for under-represented minorities, which it defines as people who are black, Hispanic or Native American. It is easy to be cynical about this achievement — statistics can easily be manipulated when many factors affect pay, and gender comparisons are especially complicated when men and women do different jobs. Intel, like many Silicon Valley companies, has a serious shortage of women — just 25 per cent of its workforce is female, and they are far more prevalent in its “non-technical divisions”. Other companies, in an effort to prove that their equality pledges are not just empty words, have gone even further and are seeking outside validation. Related article How women can demand a higher salary Negotiation trainer Giuseppe Conti offers tips on handling pay talks All of them should be applauded for trying to live up to their promises. Not only is it the right thing to do, but it also makes good business sense. Studies by the advocacy group Catalyst and the consultancy McKinsey suggest that high levels of female participation at board level are correlated with better financial results, as measured by return on capital and return on equity. Lower down in the organisation, the same logic applies. At a time when many companies are struggling to retain mid-career women, a sense that the company plays fair will help keep good people around. As Intel spokeswoman Ellen Healy explains: “It’s in our interest to retain employees and hire at competitive rates. People who feel they aren’t compensated fairly will go elsewhere.” I certainly did.

While October can still be jammed with volatility, November through January is often a good period to be long stocks, and this year technology looks like a good sector to overweight for the stretch run. The heavily tech-weighted Nasdaq has had a nice bounce off the late June Brexit lows and looks to be breaking out to new highs. We screened the Merrill Lynch research universe for tech stocks that are rated Buy at the firm and pay a solid dividend, and ones that could be ready to report solid third-quarter results too. We found four that look outstanding for long-term growth portfolios. Applied Materials This semiconductor capital equipment leader has moved up nicely this year after underperforming. Applied Materials Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT) is the global leader in precision materials engineering solutions for the semiconductor, flat panel display and solar photovoltaic industries. Applied Material’s technologies help make innovations like smartphones, flat screen TVs and solar panels more affordable and accessible to consumers and businesses around the world. The analysts are very positive on the stock and see Applied Materials benefiting not only the semiconductor side of the business, but also from larger, higher resolution and flexible screens on the display side of the business. Despite reporting solid first-quarter earnings that were above consensus, and guidance that was in line with expectations, the stock is still very reasonably priced. It may very well be one of the best technology values available for investors today. Some Wall Street analysts see continued FinFET capacity expansion (10nm/14nm/16nm) and transition to 3D NAND, with DRAM spending remaining strong next year. Earlier this year the company announced a new $2 billion share buyback program, which comes on the heels of a recently completed $3 billion program. Merrill Lynch sees the purchase plan as being approximately 8% accretive to earnings. Shareholders receive a 1.35% dividend. The Merrill Lynch price target for the stock is $35. The Wall Street consensus target is at $33.50. Shares ended Friday at $29.66. Intel This leader in semiconductors is working hard to scale away from dependence on personal computers. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) designs, manufactures and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide. The company’s platforms are used in various computing applications comprising notebooks, two-in-one systems, desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, wireless and wired connectivity products, wearables, retail devices and manufacturing devices, as well as for retail, transportation, industrial, buildings, home use and other market segments. The company also provides communication and connectivity offerings, such as baseband processors, radio frequency transceivers and power management integrated circuits, and tablet, phone and Internet of Things solutions, which include multimode 4G LTE modems, Bluetooth technology and GPS receivers, software solutions and interoperability tests, as well as home gateway and set-top box components. Intel reported an inline second quarter, but data center sales came in way below expectations, a trend the analyst thinks reverses in the fourth quarter and 2017. In addition, a new partnership with Microsoft for virtual reality, and a consistent shift away for reliance on chips for personal computers, keeps the stock a compelling buy. Intel investors receive a 2.8% dividend. Merrill Lynch has a $45 price target, while the consensus target is $40.38. The shares closed Friday at $37.19.

You show up, people dress you up, they put your makeup on, they do your hair, and all you have to do is walk down a runway a couple of times, get your photo taken, and that’s done. However for those in the industry, you guys probably know it isn’t as easy as it seems. Granted a lot of models do make it look easy, but in reality, many could also be stressing out pretty badly. During the Paris Fashion Week, Intel decided to merge tech and fashion together by creating a wearable that will actually allow audience members to see the stress levels and the state of mind of a model as he/she walks down the runway. These wearables come in the form of smart glasses and belts. The glasses will have capacity EEG electrodes built into them that will read the wearer’s brainwaves, while the nose bridge will house an optical heart rate sensor and a microphone. The information gathered will be processed by the onboard Curie module and then sent to the 3D printed belt around the waist of the wearer. The belt also features a pico projector that can cast an image and animations onto a surface to show real-time stress levels. Now we’re not sure if there ever will come a time when such a wearable will be required in real-life, but we guess if anything it does show off the ways fashion and tech can work together.

Read today's eNewspaper Health Science & Research Upper-limb amputee at Johns Hopkins builds computer controller device for feet Developing controller for feet A controller developed by a Johns Hopkins student allows upper body amputees and others with limited upper body mobility to play video games with their feet. (Amy Davis, Baltimore Sun video) A controller developed by a Johns Hopkins student allows upper body amputees and others with limited upper body mobility to play video games with their feet. (Amy Davis, Baltimore Sun video) Carrie WellsContact ReporterThe Baltimore Sun A Johns Hopkins student who lost his arms developed a device to control a computer with feet. Once an avid video gamer, Gyorgy Levay stopped playing when he lost his hands to a meningitis infection six years ago. Manipulating a mouse or a controller without hands or fingers was frustratingly impossible, but the struggles Levay faced sparked an interest in building devices to make life easier for him and other upper-limb amputees. Now a biomedical engineering graduate student at the Johns Hopkins University, he developed a prototype device last year that will enable people to command a computer using their feet instead of their hands. Levay, 28, a Hungarian native who pronounces his first name "George," is on a Fulbright scholarship to develop prosthetic devices at Johns Hopkins. He created his GEAR (Game Enhancing Augmented Reality) device in a biomedical instrumentation class and believes it could have broad appeal even for those who aren't amputees. "Right now basically all control options on computers are for hands," he said. His device "is not only useful for people who lost limbs, it's useful for people who have limited control in their limbs, like people who suffered a stroke or suffered from carpal tunnel syndrome. They can benefit from a method where they use their feet instead of relying so heavily on their hands for the simple control of computers." Gyorgy Levay, a grad student at Johns Hopkins, has created a tool for himself and other amputees who would like to play video games. It allows gamers to use their feet. Earlier this year, the clunky sandal-like device won a $7,500 grand prize in the 2016 Intel-Cornell Cup, in which student inventors are judged on applications of embedded technology, and was a finalist in the 2016 Johns Hopkins Healthcare Design Competition. Levay secured a provisional patent for the device through the university. A user activates the device's four sensors by pressing their feet into the foot bed in various ways. Those sensors, embedded in a silicon and 3-D printed plastic exterior, can be customized to follow any programmed command, but his unit is set up to perform game functions such as crouching, moving forward and backward, and moving left or right.

Since Donald Trump became president-elect, concerns have risen over birth control. Here's some background on IUDs. Besides playing computer games, the device could be customized to work with a computer for any task, such as editing photos. Levay said he doesn't want to create a startup to promote the device, a venture he called "pretty risky." He hopes an established company will buy the device, refine it and put it on the market. He thinks it could appeal particularly to those developing virtual reality devices, which often require hands to simulate walking. "It just gives a whole new layer of functionality to games," he said. "We have our legs and it's not used when we're interfacing with computers." The loss of upper limbs is rare. According to research published in the Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation in 2008, just 56,000 people are estimated to have lost a hand or an arm in the United States. Of the estimated 2 million people who have lost a limb, finger or toe, about two-thirds lost a lower extremity. A third, or 700,000, were classified as having lost an upper extremity, but most of those people have lost a finger or fingers. The device could be useful for those with spinal cord injuries who have lost dexterity or function in their upper limbs, said Heather Weesner, an occupational therapist at the University of Maryland Rehabilitation and Orthopaedic Institute and a certified hand therapist. Many people who have lost their hands or the use of them are trying to use voice-activated technology to interact with computers, but it can be prohibitively expensive, she said. Prosthetic limbs also can be very expensive and cost as much as $100,000, said Karen Lundquist, a spokeswoman for the Amputee Coalition. Upper-limb prosthetics are trickier to design and can be uncomfortable and difficult to manage, she said. "There's a huge gap in what's available and what's possible," Lundquist said. Some upper-limb amputees have "gotten very life-hack about it," she said, developing unique solutions. A person might attach a cup holder to a prosthetic arm, for instance, she said. The ability to use the internet is crucial for those who have lost limbs, Lundquist said. "To be able to be socially connected to other people with disabilities, it could connect you to the world and give you a lot of work opportunities as well," she said. "You're more likely to not be depressed, you're more likely to be employed." That loss of social connection via the internet isn't something that really affects lower-limb amputees, Weesner said. But for upper-limb amputees, being able to use a computer is often a top priority after figuring out how to dress and bathe. "It really helps the patient's psyche when they can have some of the activities that they used to have," such as video games, she said. "Especially when they're fun." While testing the device, Levay and three nonamputees played the first-person action-adventure game Mirror's Edge and posted video of the game play online, asking viewers to guess which player was using the device. More than 80 percent of people who viewed the videos couldn't identify which player was using the GEAR controller. Such online anonymity could be good for those who have lost their upper limbs, Levay said, so they can temporarily avoid the odd glances from people who are surprised by their appearance. "I walk down the street and people think about what's going on," with his appearance, Levay said. "Without hearing it, you hear it in your mind. It doesn't bother me necessarily, but it can get annoying after some time. But there are people who would rather not go out and socialize … and all that goes away with computer games because no one sees you, so all they're going judge you by is how well you play." Still, Levay said that because he is focused on graduate school and building better prosthetics, he hasn't had much time to actually use the device and enjoy his old hobby. "The motivation was of course to allow me to play, but I haven't had any time to play on this or anything else," Levay said. "I'm happy it's there as a possibility. One day maybe I'll have more time." cwells@baltsun.com Copyright © 2016, The Baltimore Sun, a Baltimore Sun Media Group publication | Place an Ad Maryland boy who got double hand transplant can throw a football, write with pencil, do other routine tasks Preliminary licenses to dispense medical marijuana in Maryland will be announced in December Unconventional indoor workouts in the Baltimore area Breaking Sports Maryland Opinion Business Jobs Obits Advertising 64°

Mesa 13.0 Planning For Release At End Of October, Might Include RADV Vulkan Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 30 September 2016 at 06:27 AM EDT. 10 Comments Following the mailing list talk over the past two days about doing the next Mesa release, plans are being discussed for releasing at the end of October and it might have just got a whole lot more exciting. Emil Velikov, Collabora developer and Mesa release manager for the past several release series, has commented on that previously discussed mailing list thread. He mentioned he was secretly waiting in hopes of seeing the RADV Radeon Vulkan driver merged for this next release! He said he'd even be willing to see it merged even if it's "not perfect/feature complete." David Airlie, one of the developers leading RADV, commented that he would be open to merging it but isn't too comfortable that it's not passing all Vulkan conformance tests yet. He commented, "It's probably fine if I just make a big printf on device creation that RADV isn't a conformant vulkan implementation yet. Sorta like what Intel do on the older GPUs. Otherwise I don't think merging it is a big job, it's 30,000 lines of standalone code, I've already merged the prereq patches, and I think any code sharing should happen in tree." So now we are looking at potentially having this RADV open-source driver in mainline Mesa in time for the official release in one month. We'll see what ends up happening! Emil Velikov laid out tentative plans for having the feature freeze and first release candidate on October 7th or the 14th, then having the second release candidate one week later, and then having a third release candidate or final release one week after that. Long story short, we could be seeing this next Mesa release -- with possibly RADV -- around 28 October. For this next's release version number, if past tradition holds it is to be called Mesa 13.0 since OpenGL 4.4 was reached by core Mesa and the Intel driver. Core Mesa also supports OpenGL 4.5 although no hardware driver is officially exposing conformance. However, Intel developer Jason Ekstrand said he'd prefer seeing it version 12.1 rather than 13.0 already. So we'll see how that discussion settles if the Mesa versioning practices will change. That's the latest so far on planning for the next Mesa release.

Page 1 of 3. 28 Comments Yesterday I published some macOS 10.2 vs. Ubuntu 16.04 LTS benchmarks from a Mac Mini and MacBook Air systems. For those curious if BSDs can outperform macOS Sierra on Apple hardware, I tested the MacBook Air with FreeBSD 11.0 compared to the Linux and macOS results on that Core i5 system. Here are those results. FreeBSD 11.0 AMD64 was tested on the Haswell-based MacBook Air and it actually worked well. Even the HD Graphics 5000 were playing nicely with the FreeBSD DRM Intel driver. The MacBook Air is equipped with a Core i5 4250U CPU with HD Graphics 5000, 4GB of DDR3 memory, and a 120GB Apple SSD. The install was smooth and was off to the races with testing. The TrueOS (formerly PC-BSD) rolling release was also attempted for testing on the same system, but unfortunately it didn't work out well. It was able to boot the TrueOS installer, but after rebooting, it wasn't able to boot into TrueOS. Even when trying the installer again and using the GRUB boot-loader, it still failed. When trying DragonFlyBSD 4.6, it failed to boot with the kernel hanging after the uhub1 reports. At least FreeBSD 11.0 was happily running on this Apple MacBook Air for being able to conduct those benchmarks. The compatible test profiles via the Phoronix Test Suite were then carried out. Continue reading to see how macOS 10.12, Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS (with both GCC 5.4 and LLVM Clang 3.8 compilers), and then FreeBSD 11.0 compare on the same MacBook Air system.

More Tech BIO-key brings Hello logins to any Windows 10 PC By Lee Mathews 09.29.2016 :: 12:45PM EST Everybody’s looking for ways to kill your passwords these days. If you’re running Windows 10, Hello is a nice option… provided you’ve got the right hardware. There still aren’t many computers shipping with Hello-compatible webcams (like Intel’s RealSense) to allow facial recognition. Fortunately, Windows Hello works with other biometric devices, and BIO-key makes adding one to your computer a relatively painless process. BIO-Key just unveiled a trio of new fingerprint scanners. First up is the EcoID. It’s designed for desktop use, with a short USB cord that tethers it to your computer. Park it next to your keyboard and you can log in to Windows 10 and authenticate in apps that have added Passport support by simply placing your finger a top the sensor. The SideSwipe. Sorry about the lack of banana for scale The other two scanners are designed for tablets and laptops. The SideTouch (top) is the larger of the two — larger because its sensor is the same kind of tap-to-authenticate number BIO-Key used in the EcoID. The SideSwipe, on the other hand, is about as small as USB fingerprint readers get. It’s roughly the same size as your fingertip, and, as its name suggests, you swipe your finger over the sensor to authenticate. Even if the developers of your favorite apps haven’t jumped on the Hello train just yet you may still want to pick up a BIO-Key scanner. The bundled password management software they ship with lets you sign in with a tap or swipe anywhere an app like LastPass or 1Password would. All three readers are reasonably priced. At $39.99, they’re among the least expensive options out there for adding biometrics to your PC. They’re also certified to work with Windows Hello, and you’re not likely to find a cheaper sensor that comes with Microsoft’s stamp of approval.

Credit PHOTOGRAPH BY ODED BALILTY / AP Shimon Peres, the former Israeli President, died at ninety-three, a revered elder statesman, but his glory days were as part of a suspect young guard. In the early fifties, he was part of a cadre of defense officials whom David Ben-Gurion promoted in order to wrest control of the economy from veteran leaders of the Zionist Labor Federation and hand it to the fledgling state. Peres was at first hawkish, in favor of nuclear deterrence against Arab invasion and retaliation against Palestinian border attacks. He ended his career as a symbol of the peace process, after secretly initiating and championing the 1993 Oslo Accords, for which he and his co-signers, Yitzhak Rabin and Yasir Arafat, won the Nobel Peace Prize. “If I’ve changed my policies, it’s because the situation has changed. I was a hawk, but when we could make peace I was a dove,” he told David Remnick, in 2002. For his seventy years of public life, Peres was famous as a man who tempered his views to accommodate shifts in political power. He held almost every important government post—Prime Minister, Defense Minister, Foreign Minister, President—and served people he both idolized and reviled. After the Oslo negotiations stalled, and during the darkest days of the Second Intifada, Peres assumed his last significant position, as Ariel Sharon’s Foreign Minister, and stayed even after Sharon put Arafat under siege. Yossi Beilin, an Oslo negotiator and a protégé of Peres, was not impressed: of Sharon, he said, in 2002, “To do what he is doing now, he needs a rabbi to make it all kosher.” Beilin added, “In Shimon Peres, Ariel Sharon got the most kosher rabbi in the world.” Yet it would be wrong to suppose that Peres lacked governing principles. What set him apart, and prepared him for a short but pivotal premiership from 1984 to 1986, was political-economic prescience. Early on, he was a builder of Israel’s military power, becoming an expert on increasingly sophisticated arms. He grew fascinated by advanced technologies and, more important, the kind of society that advances them. In many ways, Israel’s entrepreneurial burst in the nineties was facilitated by Peres’s economic reforms of the eighties. It is no diminution of his achievement to say that he was Israel’s first technocrat. “The Arabs have the numerical superiority; we have technological superiority,” he told a cluster of reporters in 1974, while he was the Minister of Communications. “Technology will always defeat numbers.” Szymon Perski, who emigrated with his family to Israel from Poland, in 1934, at age eleven, was viewed, in the parochial pioneering society he joined, as both a potential recruit and something of an intruder. The view stuck, and he seemed to embrace it, making himself conspicuously useful to his elders in the socialist élite, but also nudging them toward vaguely bourgeois values. Peres spent his adolescence on a kibbutz and at the Ben Shemen youth village. He wrote lyric Hebrew poetry. The writer Yael Dayan, the daughter of the military leader and government minister Moshe Dayan, told me recently that Peres was “insecure as a young man, cultivated relations with writers, and probably hoped to become one.” His first distinction came in 1944, when, as a youth leader, he rushed from student group to scouting group, trying to keep the labor movement’s youth wing loyal to David Ben-Gurion’s governing social-democratic party, while much of the kibbutz movement, drawn to Soviet Marxism, parted ways with it. “Shyness and nerve are two sides of the same coin,” Peres later told his biographer, Matti Golan. Peres and Moshe Dayan were chosen as youth delegates to the 1946 Zionist Congress, in Basel, as plans for the partition of Palestine took shape. The following year, Peres joined the Haganah, the Labor Zionist self-defense force. Ben-Gurion personally made him responsible for organizing manpower, and for clandestine missions to buy weapons. These tasks kept Peres off the battlefields of the War of Independence, which earned him, unfairly, a lesser moral prestige than celebrated war heroes like Dayan, Rabin, and Sharon, who became his rivals for leadership positions in the seventies. In 1953, Ben-Gurion, who was serving as the Defense Minister as well as Prime Minister, appointed Peres his Director-General of Defense. Peres was barely thirty. Ben-Gurion extolled him and Dayan, the Chief of Staff, as examples of mamlachtiyut, or “statism”: the drive to absorb the flood of immigrants into nationalist, not proletarian, institutions. Ben-Gurion, exhausted, exited the government that year, but when he returned, two years later, Peres was his right hand, plotting Israeli participation in what would become the Suez Crisis, in 1956, and acting as the liaison to the French government. The connections would prove essential to setting up Israel’s nuclear program and acquiring the advanced jets that were critical to Israel’s victory in the Six-Day War, in 1967. But they also reinforced Peres’s enchantment with scientific management. Peres, who was elected to the Knesset in 1959 and became Deputy Defense Minister, grew impatient with traditional Labor Zionist condescension regarding market competition. He had seen what companies like Dassault, the French aircraft manufacturer, could do. That same year, Bedek, a company that Peres had helped found and the forerunner to Israel Aerospace Industries, produced its first plane. Beginning in 1955, Peres and Dayan were embroiled in what came to be known as the Lavon Affair, the fallout from a botched operation to discredit Egypt’s new President, Gamal Abdul Nasser. The controversy finally led, in 1963, to Ben-Gurion’s resignation. In 1965, Peres persuaded Ben-Gurion and Dayan to lead a new leftist, secular-nationalist party, Rafi, which would, in Peres’s words, bring together “famous and influential names from the worlds of art, literature, commerce, and science.” The Party went on to join a national-unity government just before the 1967 war, and a united Labor Alignment during the euphoria after it. But its challenge to the labor aristocracy continued to define Peres’s position. In the wake of the Yom Kippur War, in 1973, Prime Minister Golda Meir and Dayan, the Defense Minister since 1967, were forced to resign; the clique that had inherited the Labor Alignment, run by the Finance Minister, Pinchas Sapir, anointed Rabin as Meir’s successor. Peres, though still marked as having been part of the Rafi insurrection, unexpectedly announced his candidacy. He presented himself as the hard-liner, supporting the National Religious Party’s defense of the settlement project. Peres won forty per cent of the delegates’ votes, conceded, and was named Defense Minister. Rabin would later brand Peres an “indefatigable schemer.” When, in 1976, Rabin planned to remove by force a Jewish outpost in the hills of Samaria, in the northern West Bank, Peres intervened to let it stay. Rabin resigned over a minor financial infraction just before the election of May, 1977. Peres, his replacement, debated Menachem Begin, of the Likud Party, on television, insisting that it was the labor pioneers who knew how to settle the land. Begin won, concluded the Camp David Accords with Egypt in 1979, and increased the number of settlers to about ten thousand by 1981. Begin won reëlection that year, by increasing subsidies for staples and slashing tariffs on imported consumer products, setting off a spending spree among his poorer and less educated base. By 1984, government deficits, worsened by the Lebanon War, had pushed inflation to more than four hundred per cent. The election that year produced a tie for Peres, and he assumed the Prime Minister’s job for two years, in a rotation agreement with Yitzhak Shamir. This proved to be Peres’s finest hour, as he worked tirelessly with respected economists to prevent economic collapse and to enable future growth, privatizing or closing failing public companies and encouraging private investment. He introduced a new shekel, pegging it to the dollar, while imposing austerity and wage and price controls. He confidently oriented the economy toward technology exports, focussed on the defense technologies he had nurtured, reinvested in the universities, and advocated for tax holidays to encourage investment by foreign technology corporations such as Intel, Motorola, and I.B.M. By 1991, the chairman of Intel-Israel, Dov Frohman, told me that the country was primed to become a home to technology startups: “four for every direct foreign investor.” In the fall of 1993, I met with Peres, who was the Foreign Minister in the new Rabin government at the time, in New York. I was working for a consulting firm founded by, among others, the Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter. When I entered the room, Peres had Porter’s “Competitive Advantage” in his hands. He started off subdued, businesslike, but his face brightened when I asked how the state might facilitate an export-driven economy. He told me what many would later come to believe, that the competitive advantage Israel’s military gave it was not in its technology but in the “human capital” that the Army experience created: the teamwork, the comfort with advanced machinery. He spoke of Israel as a hub of a “new Middle East,” the name of a book he published that same year, which argued that economic integration, based on scientific exchange, had made war obsolete. At the same time, political vanity caused Peres to miss opportunities to build that new Middle East. In 1987, shortly before the first intifada roiled the Palestinian territories, Peres, who was serving as Foreign Minister under Shamir, secretly negotiated a deal with King Hussein’s representatives in London, which would have brought Jordan into the peace process and halted settlement building. Peres promised Hussein that, if Shamir rejected the deal, he would resign and mount an electoral campaign on the issue. Shamir did reject it, Peres did not resign, and Hussein renounced all interest in representing Palestinian claims. Peres was the indispensable proponent of the Oslo Accords with the Palestine Liberation Organization. But Oslo never produced a final-status agreement, and Rabin and Peres were put on the defensive by terror attacks and settler violence. After Rabin’s assassination, in 1995, Peres became Prime Minister, and the polls showed that he would have won an overwhelming victory over Benjamin Netanyahu had he called an immediate election. But Peres seemed determined first to prove that he could be charged with the nation’s security. He put the election off until the spring, and secretly authorized a series of retaliatory operations against Hamas terrorists, which led to retaliatory bus bombings. During the early spring, he authorized an action against Hezbollah in the north, Operation Grapes of Wrath, which included an errant strike against a Lebanese town in which more than a hundred civilians were killed. When an election was held in May, he lost to Netanyahu by less than a per cent. By the time Ehud Barak regained power for Oslo’s advocates, in 1999, the climate had been soured by settlement growth and terror, and in 2000 a new intifada broke out. Thereafter, Peres was something of a shadow figure in Israeli politics, taking back interim leadership of Labor in 2004, and eventually joining with Sharon and Ehud Olmert in forming yet a new party, Kadima, in 2005. After Sharon’s death, Olmert formed a government and organized a Knesset vote to elect Peres to the Presidency, a largely honorific role, but one the outsider seemed to thrive in, inviting “famous and influential names,” as he had once put it, to his official residence, encouraging ethnic integration, and promoting large entrepreneurial projects: the electric car, a canal joining the Mediterranean to the Dead Sea. He seemed to revel in the idea that he’d never again face an election. One is hard-pressed to know what was happening in the shadows, or to assess what political courage he had left. The late Ron Pundak, former head of the Peres Center and one of Oslo’s negotiators, told me just before his death, in 2014, that Peres had him deposed for his anti-government peace activities after 2009, “convinced that Netanyahu was serious about making progress toward a two-state solution.” Later in 2014, as his term as President was ending, Peres told Channel Two that he had met with the Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, in Jordan three years before, and that the two had worked out a comprehensive peace deal, including recognition of Israel as a “Jewish state.” Netanyahu, Peres claimed, had “stopped it.” Why did Peres not resign and expose the matter? Why, too, did he draw close to powerful mentors, adapt to new parties, take only the most calculated risks, and shift with the winds of war and peace? “Shimon never seemed far from the center of things, but felt himself the outsider,” Yael Dayan told me. “Shimon was the immigrant who knew the language well, who thought himself a man of letters. But he spoke with an accent; he had a certain paranoia.” The outsider’s restlessness seemed critical here. “Shimon was endlessly curious about the sciences, taught himself what he didn’t know: in chemistry, hydrology, nanotechnology, economics,” Dayan added. “He saw the Israel he wanted: advanced, democratic, multicultural, at peace. He did what he could to set the stage for it.” Bernard Avishai’s latest book is “Promiscuous: ‘Portnoy’s Complaint’ and Our Doomed Pursuit of Happiness.” He is a visiting professor of government at Dartmouth College and an adjunct professor of business at the Hebrew University.

Market research firm IHS ranked NXP as the seventh largest semiconductor supplier globally in 2015, while Qualcomm ranked third, trailing Samsung Electronics and top chipmaker Intel. Citing sources close to the matter, WSJ stated that the deal could be wrapped up within two or three months, or Qualcomm could move on to explore other options. Following the report, both company’s shares received a bump, with NXP jumping by 16.9 percent and Qualcomm up by 6.3 percent. Qualcomm’s successful Snapdragon mobile chip line brings in the majority of the company’s revenue, with added profit coming in from wireless patents that it licenses to the mobile industry — such as its recent Clear Sight dual-camera technology. According to a recent fact sheet produced by NXP, it has over 9,000 issued and pending patent families.

Photo Credit: Erin Geismar advertisement | advertise on newsday HIGHLIGHTS Huntington theater, opened five years ago, among top U.S. clubs Taking Back Sunday, Rod Stewart among the other headliners In five short years, The Paramount has already permanently changed Long Island. Consistently ranked one of the Top 20 clubs in the world by Pollstar magazine, the venue has even changed the look of downtown Huntington by adding a radio station studio that people can watch from New York Avenue. “The venue wants to thank all of Long Island for this unprecedented success and hopes that the next five years will be just as successful, as we push forward to become the No. 1 venue in the U.S.,” The Paramount’s directors said in a statement. Here’s a look at 10 of the biggest moments in The Paramount’s history so far: Most popular ‘Dr. Phil’ blasted for Shelley Duvall interview HBO ‘exploring’ ‘Game of Thrones’ prequel Christie Brinkley: I’m not a ‘former’ model Designer Sophie Theallet: I won’t dress Melania Trump Exes Lopez, Anthony kiss, duet at Latin Grammys 10. Elvis Costello (Sept. 30, 2011): The first official concert showed exactly what The Paramount owners wanted for the venue — an A-List act who would normally play in Manhattan playing Long Island so that fans could enjoy great music closer to home. 9. John Kasich (April 4, 2016): The Paramount was the center of the 2016 presidential race that day as Fox News hosted a town hall there with the Ohio Republican governor. 8. Shawn Mendes (June 10, 2015): The WBLI-sponsored concert with the Canadian sensation drew plenty of screams, it but also showed how up-and-coming Long Islanders like Melanie Martinez and Robbie Rosen could hold their own. Music11 LI entertainment places we loved 7. Chris Algieri (July 18, 2014): The Greenlawn boxer had fought at the venue several times, but this time the WBO junior welterweight champion was honored for his victories, shortly before challenging boxing legend Manny Pacquiao for a new title. advertisement | advertise on newsday 6. Rod Stewart (Aug. 30, 2016): The Rock and Roll Hall of Famer kicked off The Founder’s Room Legends Series, in which arena artists play rare club shows in The Paramount’s members-only, 450-capacity Founder’s Room. 5. Kevin Hart (Oct. 19, 2015): The “Ride Along” comedian had already become the first stand-up to sell out a stadium when he decided to do two surprise shows in one night at The Paramount. 4. Ed Sheeran (July 5, 2014): The British superstar, already used to selling out Madison Square Garden at that point, was rehearsing at the venue for a radio show and decided to open it to fans as an impromptu concert. 3. Taking Back Sunday (Dec. 27-28, 2011): The Long Island scene heroes loved the Huntington venue so much that they returned in 2015 to celebrate the club’s 500th show. MusicThrowback: Billy Joel plays The Paramount 2. Long Island Music Hall of Fame Induction Awards Galas (Oct. 18, 2012 and Oct. 23, 2014): The star-studded affairs that inducted the fourth and fifth classes of area stars showed how wide-ranging Long Island’s influence on music has been, from Debbie Gibson to Salt-N-Pepa, with Roger Waters and Dionne Warwick in the house to pay tribute to industry greats like Ron Delsener and Clive Davis. Tweets by ndmusic 1. Billy Joel (Oct. 16, 2013): Like so many Paramount patrons, Joel was impressed by the space. After seeing a few shows there, he decided to use it as a rehearsal space for an upcoming European tour and enjoyed playing there so much he decided to turn his final rehearsal night there into a concert, a benefit for Long Island Cares. As Joel’s first on Long Island since 2002 and one of the smallest venues (seating capacity: 1,563) he had played publicly in years, it became the hottest ticket the area had seen in years, drawing dignitaries ranging from Gov. Andrew Cuomo to actor Paul Rudd.

One challenge many universities face is keeping up with rapid advancements in the field. At the University of Southern California's Viterbi School of Engineering, IT is now at the center of education. "We have witnessed a rapid revolution in the way we prepare students for a successful career in engineering," said executive director of IT, Michael Goay. "Advanced technologies, including graphic-intensive 3D design applications, are a critical element in addressing these challenges." However, ensuring that IT systems have the processing power and flexibility to handle requirements—including the need for mobile and remote access to files across multiple devices—is no simple task. A few years ago, "We were facing a situation where, from an IT perspective, we required increasing processing power to run applications with an acceptable level of performance." At the same time, instructors were relying on more advanced graphics-intensive applications, such as computer aided design (CAD) and 3D CGI animation software. As a result, the engineering school embarked on a major IT infrastructure upgrade in August 2014. The school piloted VMware vSphere and Horizon View running on Intel powered Dell 12G PowerEdge R720 servers. The virtualization technology delivered a superior user experience and allowed the school to use IT resources far more efficiently. A year later, the school began expanding the technology framework with NVIDIA vGPU-enhanced virtual desktops and Dell Wyse thin client endpoints. Overall, the system now supports 6,300 students, across 27 classrooms, 900 desktops and laptops and 200 software titles. Quarterly student and faculty technology ratings have risen and the thin client approach supports the use of mobile devices, including laptops, tablets and smartphones. Although the IT project has presented more than a few challenges, success has followed. "As an early adopter of these solutions there were a lot of unknowns and some significant challenges; we had to experiment with how to run certain applications in a virtualized environment," Goay said. "Students have access to graphics-intensive applications anywhere and at any time—whether they are sitting in a classroom, an auditorium or at a dorm." What's more, many students rely on Mac laptops, but the engineering software typically runs on Windows. The virtualized environment makes all of this invisible and irrelevant to the user. "This has introduced a high level of flexibility," he added. Because the engineering school stores all the files and data on its internal IT systems, there's no longer a need to rely on flash drives and other portable storage devices, which are both inconvenient and represent an increased security risk. "Their data is safe and it follows them from device to device," Goay said. IT can provision and de-provision accounts and machines immediately—and restrict access to undesirable content. "The virtual environment is entirely sandboxed. Its sole purpose is for students working on school projects and homework. There's no reason to go there to watch ESPN or other entertainment," Goay said. Now that the university has the system operating smoothly, it is looking to expand the use of the VDI technology in classrooms and for disaster recovery. "This technology framework, including VDI, gives us a lot of flexibility and it has helped us manage costs far more effectively,” Goay said.   RELATED ARTICLES How to Deal With the Cyber Kill Chain Why IT Training Efforts Get Mixed Grades Why Business Departments Choose Their Own Tech How a Skills Gap Impedes the Use of New Tech Why Few Data Centers Are Fully Optimized   Submit a Comment Loading Comments...

Probably VR ADVERTISE SUBSCRIBE CONTACT ABOUT MACHINES Is the goal of democratising AI just a pipe dream? by John Kennedy 29 Sep 20167 Shares If the social media revolution has taught us anything, it is that tech giants will need real humans to give machines their vaunted artificial intelligence. Image: Michal Bednarek/Shutterstock Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Amazon, IBM and other tech companies have joined forces to democratise artificial intelligence (AI) and make it available for everyone. But what are their real motives? The AI world is exploding. 10 of the biggest power brokers have joined forces to bring some clarity to a world still fumbling with smartphones, and one that hasn’t quite gotten its head around what AI really means for it. It’s called the Partnership on AI to benefit People and Society. Sounds lofty and earnest, but these are businesses after all. Could this be more of the passive-aggressive PR shtick from a bunch of tech giants who talk about being open and transparent, but really prefer to keep you at arm’s length behind security desks and email addresses that no one replies to? It’s like talking up social media when your approach can at best be described as sociopathic. What snake oil is this? Do they want to improve AI as a team when they compete ruthlessly against each other? What are they really selling here? Remember dear human, you will always be the product The tech giants pushing AI are already driving significant advances; one might say that we are in the age of machine intelligence. For example, Intel recently bought Irish tech company Movidius, whose machine learning chip can help devices like DRI drones to see and understand. It’s like we are at the gates of Florence and the Renaissance is about to unfold. And it already looks magnificent. Microsoft is building what it claims to be the world’s most powerful AI supercomputer, which it plans to make available to everyone to harness the full power of AI. IBM’s Watson has been beating humans at chess for some time now. Facebook has already installed AI agents inside Messenger to converse with humans on behalf of businesses. Google’s latest neural machine technology can translate entire sentences from English to Chinese and vice versa. As for Amazon, God only knows what Jeff Bezos has up his sleeve, but it probably involves swarms of delivery drones or entire AI servers on demand (think Amazon Supercomputer Services) that will unleash another wave of entrepreneurship. But when big businesses talk about sharing the spoils of their advances in AI do they really want to share? What’s their real game here? In the dawn of social media, it was information. What you do with that information, that is called intelligence. It therefore makes sense to the masters of AI to invite society to their party good and early. Think about it. Humans are already product, when you consider the 1.5bn people who use Facebook every month. Humans are advertising fodder. It makes sense for Google to create free services like Translate or Gmail because it’s a captive audience for advertising. It’s not personal – well, it is – but it’s just business. Microsoft seems to be really taking this benefiting humanity stuff seriously. Not only did it promise free supercomputing resources, but it made a bold statement this week that it intends to infuse every application and device with cognitive capabilities. It has already done so in Windows 10 with Cortana, which it says has achieved 12bn queries from over 133m active users. Other examples include the photo editing tool Pix, which has apparent powers of perception and a location-aware app called MileIQ that helps you calculate expenses without doing much. Another thing worth considering is how AI could be used to replace humans in jobs. Who needs call centre agents when Facebook Messenger has bots that can carry a good conversation? Will AI reduce the number of people in the working world? Will robots take our jobs? What is the point in talking about democratisation when people won’t be able to put food on their plates? Or will AI go the other way? Will it augment our lives, make us more productive and lead to more opportunities for gainful employment and fulfilling healthy, happy lives? Let’s hope so. “AI technologies hold tremendous potential to improve many aspects of life; ranging from healthcare, education, and manufacturing, to home automation and transportation,” the Partnership on AI said in its mission statement. “Through rigorous research, the development of best practices, and an open and transparent dialogue, the founding members of the Partnership on AI hope to maximise this potential and ensure it benefits as many people as possible.” That’s fair enough. But you can’t help but wonder how AI is going to benefit these behemoths first before the rest of us figure it out.

Originally the X1 was just the X1 Carbon notebook, but Lenovo has decided to expand the X1 series to include the aforementioned X1 Carbon, along with the X1 Yoga and X1 Tablet. So the ThinkPad Yoga is now the ThinkPad X1 Yoga, and as such it keeps the same thin and light design of the X1 Carbon. The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga Review Thin and light is the key here, and the X1 Yoga doesn’t disappoint. The X1 Yoga is only 16.8 mm (0.66”) thick, and weighs 1270 grams (2.8 lbs). While not the thinnest and lightest notebook around, don’t forget that the X1 Yoga also features a 360° hinge, allowing it to be used exclusively with touch with several modes, including tablet, stand, and tent, just like the other Yoga devices they sell. Lenovo also pointed out that the X1 Yoga is thinner and lighter than the original X1 Carbon even, despite including touch and the convertible hinges. Lenovo is offering plenty of choices here to outfit the X1 Yoga, with the baseline offering of an Intel Core i5-6200U and 8 GB of LPDDR3-1866. You can upgrade to the i5-6300U, i7-6500U, and i7-6600U, with RAM offerings up to 16 GB. On storage Lenovo has gone all NVMe, with choices from 128 GB to 512 GB. On the display side, the 14-inch panel can be either a 1920x1080 IPS, 2560x1440 IPS, or a 2560x1440 OLED model. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga   As Tested: Core i7-6500U, 8GB, 512GB, 2560x1440 LCD CPU Intel Core i5-6200U Dual-Core with Hyperthreading 2.3-2.8 GHz, 3MB Cache, 15W TDP Intel Core i5-6300U Dual-Core with Hyperthreading 2.4-3.0 GHz, 3MB Cache, 15W TDP Intel Core i7-6500U Dual-Core with Hyperthreading 2.5-3.1 GHz, 4MB Cache, 15W TDP Intel Core i7-6600U Dual-Core with Hyperthreading 2.6-3.4 GHz, 4MB Cache, 15W TDP GPU Intel HD 520 300-1050MHz, 24 EUs Memory 8GB to 16GB LPDDR3-1866 Dual-channel Display 14-inch 1920x1080 IPS Optional 2560x1440 IPS Optional 2560x1440 OLED Storage 128GB to 1TB SSD, PCIe and SATA I/O OneLink+ USB 3.0 Type-A x 3 Headset jack 720p Webcam Mini DisplayPort microSD Dimensions 333 x 229 x 16.8 mm 13.11 x 9.01 x 0.66 inches Weight 1.27 kg / 2.8 lbs Battery 52 Wh, 65 W AC Adapter Keyboard Spill-Resistant with TrackPoint Wireless Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC8260 2x2:2 with Bluetooth 4.1 Price Starting at $1400, as tested $1871.10 Lenovo also offers plenty of connectivity on the X1 Yoga, including three USB 3.0 ports, HDMI, DisplayPort, and a OneLink connector for its docking stations. There are no USB Type-C ports, but the X1 Yoga does have MicroSD support for additional storage, and LTE-A as an option for those that want to be as untethered as possible. Wireless is supplied via the Intel 8260 wireless card, and as a business focused device it can be had with vPro as well. They also include a stylus built into the laptop which will charge while docked. It’s not as big or as comfortable as the one included with something like the Surface Book, but the fact that it is docked will more than make up for that for a lot of people, because that means it’s always available, and less likely to get misplaced. Lenovo has gone with a 52 Wh battery for this laptop, meaning it is over the 50 Wh baseline for Ultrabooks. That’s pretty good considering the inclusion of a stylus, and the thin nature of this device.

I run procurement for an architecture office. I wouldn't order this over an XPS 13 because you can get the XPS with Iris. They're not the workhorse of our office, but for getting some work done on an airplane and giving a presentation while manipulating CAD drawings, something with Iris or discrete graphics is critical. I can appreciate that the niche for professional ultrabook users who demand higher graphics performance is small, but to say that it wouldn't make the product more useful to professionals is simply shortsighted. Reply close - Friday, September 30, 2016 - link ddriver is usually here for two purposes: -some pseudo-engineering rants that are laughable until you realize he might actually believe them (then it feels like you're laughing at an autistic kid). -make some sort of homophobic remark, or any kind of insult really. The kind that suggests he was raised and educated by 4chan. Reply ddriver - Friday, September 30, 2016 - link I am glad you finally found a purpose in life. As pathetic as it may be, that's a huge step up for you LOL, your peak lifetime achievement really. Reply ddriver - Friday, September 30, 2016 - link You are joking, right? This is a convertible device that can be used as a tablet and comes with a stylus while the xps 13 is an ultrabook without tablet mode or stylus support. Which explains why the xps in a matching configuration is 100$ cheaper. If you are a professional and need to work with CAD you don't get a "business class" generic ultrabook, you get a laptop with dedicated professional graphics, or the very least, something with a decent discrete graphics, like the xps 15 Iris critical for CAD - that's laughable to say the least. But wait, since you did say "drawings" I can only assume you mean 2D in autocad, which, and I hate to break it to you, will show exactly ZERO advantage for iris over the plain integrated graphics. It will be marginally better for 3D, but nowhere near the 960m in the xps 15, which also has a bigger display at the same price point. Or maybe now you are also going to tell me that a smaller screen is also critical to working with cad and making presentations?

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple The Algorithms That Tell Bosses How Employees Are Feeling The AtlanticSeptember 29, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Share Every day, humans type out more than 200 billion emails, hundreds of millions of tweets, and innumerable texts, chats, and private messages. No one person could pick through even a tiny sliver of this information and stitch together themes and trends—but computers are starting to be able to. For more than a decade, researchers have been developing computer programs that can ingest enormous amounts of writing to try and understand the emotions stirred up by an idea or a product. The field—known as sentiment analysis—got its start in market research. As online reviews started to gather steam in the mid-2000s, companies who wanted to understand how their products—or their competitors’ offerings—were being received  began to use algorithms to aggregate reviews, says Bing Liu, a professor of computer science at the University of Illinois, Chicago, who has written extensively about the history of sentiment analysis. The algorithmic approach could reveal broader insights than a focus groups or surveys, the thinking went. Recommended: Email Etiquette Update: No Need for 'Best,' 'Cheers,' or 'Thanks' Sentiment analysis has bloomed into a large and lucrative industry. Dozens of startups now focus exclusively on providing these services to other companies, Liu says, and many bigger tech corporations have developed their own software. More recently, the corporate world has turned these same tools inward. Large companies like Accenture, Intel, IBM, and Twitter have started using the software to understand how their own employees feel about their jobs, and identify problems that might escape a harried supervisor during annual-review time. Twitter, for example, hired a company called Kanjoya to analyze employees’ responses to regular surveys about their workplace experiences. The surveys used to be administered twice yearly, and included just one or two open-ended questions, The Wall Street Journal reported last year. But with Kanjoya, Twitter started sending the survey to one-sixth of its workforce every month—and increased the number of open-ended questions it asked. Kanjoya’s analysis tools ran through the narrative answers, extracting patterns that were then shared with executives. Other companies have focused on analyzing employee chatter outside of formal reviews or surveys. To catch grievances that might not surface in structured responses, or identify policies that are working, IBM has for years been scooping up employees’ posts and comments on the company’s internal social networking platform. Recommended: How the Ballpoint Pen Killed Cursive That platform, called Connections, is available to all of IBM’s 380,000 employees in 170 countries. It functions like Facebook, Dropbox, and Wikipedia bundled into one package, allowing employees to publish posts, comment on others’, or collaborate in smaller groups. (IBM also sells a version of Connections to other companies.) An internally developed sentiment-analysis tool called Social Pulse monitors posts and comments for trends and red flags. Last year, IBM used the program to engage its employees in a revamp of its performance-review system. Its HR department set up a forum to solicit feedback on proposals for a new system, and received tens of thousands of responses. Instead of assigning a team of analysts to comb through the reams of feedback, IBM set Social Pulse loose on the data. The software helped surface a widespread complaint: Employees were unhappy that their performances were graded on a curve. The company promptly did away with the method, says Sadat Shami, who manages IBM’s Center for Engagement & Social Analytics. “Without our social listening capabilities, we wouldn't have been able to surface that in time to make that decision,” says Shami. “What traditionally happens in a month or two, we did in real-time.” Kanjoya, the company that helps Twitter interpret its employee-survey results, also offers a service that piggybacks on workplace social networks. A page on its website advertises that the company’s sentiment-analysis tools work with Yammer, a social network that was acquired for more than a billion dollars by Microsoft in 2012. (Microsoft announced this week that it’s combining Yammer with its Office 365 Groups service.) Kanjoya’s product offers “employee engagement tracking,” which promises to trace positive or negative emotions over time, and a search function that responds to queries with an analysis of the sentiment surrounding it. Read More Recommended: The Unbearable Smallness of Benjamin Netanyahu Broadening the scope of data-gathering from surveys and reviews to social-media posts risks invading employees’ privacy. That’s why IBM restricts its data-mining to posts and comments that are shared with the entire company, and doesn’t touch emails, chats, or interactions in private groups. Kanjoya was not available for comment on its privacy policies. (Federal insider threat-detection programs are experimenting with sentiment analysis, too, to suss out moles inside their own agencies. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency will award a contract to implement sentiment-analysis technology, NextGov reported earlier this month, the details of which are still vague.) Sentiment analysis is far from a polished technology. “The computer’s understanding of natural language is still bad,” says Liu. “Accuracy is not very easy.” A research project that tested basic analysis tools on a trove of emails sent between developers of an open-source server software suite only had a maximum accuracy rate of 30 percent. (Interestingly, when two people tried to determine the emotions expressed in 50 emails, they could only agree on three-quarters of them, says Tourani Parastou, the main author of the research paper at Polytechnique Montréal.) The human element still remains an important check on emotion-sensing algorithms. Even IBM’s 3-year-old Social Pulse software is bolstered by human eyes: A small team of analysts routinely examine the trends it identifies to make sure it got them right before sending them up the chain to management. Advancements in machine learning continue to improve algorithms’ ability to understand human writing—but researchers are already looking for the next emotion-detection technology. A pair of computer scientists at Sathyabama University in India published a paper last year that proposed a new way of determining employees’ attitudes and well-being: facial scans. The system they created captures images of employees’ faces every time they enter the building to determine whether they’re happy, sad, depressed, or angry, with the intention of using that data to optimize productivity and employee performance.

SAP is one of those organizations that has had to work hard to remain relevant in the cloud defined world. Like Oracle, IBM, Intel and many others, the German enterprise software giant has had to redefine its business model to remain competitive in the new digital economy. There has been progress but occasionally such companies are caught in the shadows of the leaders of the new hierarchy. When that happens noise needs to be made to make sure we don’t forget about them. That’s where we find SAP this week as the team announced its intention to spend €2 billion over five years to expand its IoT portfolio, and also to make a more significant impact on the connected services market. “With billions of connected devices, we now have the potential to reshape society, the economy and the environment,” said Bill McDermott, CEO of SAP. “SAP HANA is the data platform we knew would unlock the Internet of Things. Today SAP is making another bold investment to help our customers seize the benefits of live business. Only SAP empowers businesses to innovate from the core to the edges to the networks.” The investment will support SAP’s efforts to build several IoT development labs around the world and as well as launch a new product line, which the team have very sensibly named SAP IoT. No messing around and straight to the point, a highly functional name; does what it says on the tin. Good work all round. To support the growth of the IoT business unit, SAP has also announced a couple of acquisitions. PLAT.ONE, an enterprise-grade IoT provider, will provide the team expertise to ‘accelerate the availability of key IoT capabilities in SAP HANA Cloud Platform’, the team claims. Norwegian Fedem Technology will also be welcomed to the SAP family. Fedem will add a bit more weight to the analytics side of SAP, as the team aim to develop an (deep sigh) ‘end-to-end solution’ for the IoT world. The recent tie-up with engineering giant Bosch also adds weight. The partnership will use Bosch’s platform and SAP’s back-end software to connect vehicles, manufacturing machinery and tools of Bosch customers. SAP is still trying to figure out its place in the new digital world. Cloud was the focal point of all marketing campaigns in previous years, and now it would appear IoT is going to be the star performer. An uncharitable commentator could position this announcement little more than a plea for attention (don’t forget about us – we’re still important), though the two acquisitions do add a bit of weight to the posturing.

News & Analysis Consortium Forms Framework for Industrial Cybersecurity Rich Quinnell 9/29/2016 10:21 AM EDT Post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SEATTLE&mdash:The Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC) has released the initial version of its Security Framework for industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) development. The Framework, an adjunct to the IIoT Reference Architecture the Consortium released last year, seeks to initiate a process that will result in broad industry consensus on how to secure IIoT systems. The goal is to ensure that security is a fundamental part of an IIoT system's architecture, not simply bolted on, and covers the system end-to-end including endpoint devices and the links between system elements. The IIC is an open membership organization, formed in 2014 to accelerate the development, adoption, and wide-spread use of interconnected machines and devices along with intelligent analytics. From its founding by AT&T, Cisco, General Electric, IBM, and Intel, the Consortium has grown to more than 160 members from 24 countries and is now under management by the Object Management Group standards organization. "The Security Framework looks at IIoT security from three different perspectives," Hamed Soroush, the IIC's security working group chair, told EE Times in an interview. "Chip makers, equipment developers, and end users all have an important role in security for the IIoT, but often work without knowing one another's perspectives. The Framework will help them talk to each other." It also provides guidance to management on risk management when considering security, he added. Part of the motivation for creating the Framework is the difference between industrial IoT and consumer IoT security needs, Soroush noted, which calls for a discussion focused on industrial IoT system needs. Security in the industrial IoT should be more robust than for consumer IoT, for instance, to reduce the risks to critical infrastructure such as power generation. Also, unlike consumer systems, IIoT security needs to support decades long periods of deployment (which affects patch management), to preserve the integrity of high-availability systems, and to avoid conflicts with operational safety requirements. The Framework establishes a basis for discussions on how to address these needs. It also, Soroush pointed out, includes annexes that identify relevant existing security standards and best practices to guide developers. In addition, the Framework provides details on five characteristics — security, privacy, resilience, reliability and safety — that help define trustworthiness in the Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems that overlap in the IIoT, as well as defining risk, assessments, threats, metrics and performance indicators to help business management protect their organizations. The Security Framework is in its first version now, but the Consortium expects it to evolve over time. "We're already talking about what needs to be in the next version," Soroush said, "such as more elaboration on key points. But it depends on the feedback we get from users." He also noted that technology, standards, regulatory, and the security threat landscape are all continually changing, and those changes will inform subsequent version of the document. Revisions will also incorporate lessons learned from the exercise of test bed structures to see what is actually practical in various application classes. "One of the differences between the IIC and other organizations," Soroush said, "is the test beds it creates to evaluate the practices it suggests." The Consortium already has a number of test beds for evaluating IIoT system design, including such application areas as smart water management, precision timing networks, connected care, and edge intelligence. "The Framework will provide guidance to test bed builders for security systems, to provide feedback for the Framework's next addition." The IIoT Security Framework is available as a PDF document for any interested party, not just Consortium members. In addition, the IIC has invited the industry to join Framework editors and other security experts at a Security Forum on October 6th in Sunnyvale, CA. The Forum is complementary, but pre-registration is required. —Rich Quinnell covers industrial control for EE Times.

Zhongguancun Science Park is known as China’s “Silicon Valley” because it’s a technology hub where 20,000 technology enterprises operate and companies like Google, Microsoft, Intel, AMD, Sony and others have R&D centers of their own. The upcoming Apple facility will employ about 500 people and focus on the development of computer software and hardware products, communication, audio and video devices, as well as advanced technologies for consumer electronics products and the information industry, according to media reports in China. DigiTimes adds that the R&D center will also be used to “integrate Apple’s engineering and business teams for ramping up sales and services.” The facility should be completed in 2016. The Cupertino firm operates R&D centers in Japan, Israel and the United Kingdom and plans to establish additional R&D facilities in Canada, India, Indonesia and Vietnam.

By Zhai Yun Tan, Staff September 28, 2016 Save for later Saved Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella walks off the stage after delivering the keynote address at the Microsoft Build Conference in March 2016. Nadella is an Indian-born American. Eric Risberg/AP/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of While the technology industry is heavily criticized for lack of diversity, Asians are rarely part of the discussion, owing to the prevailing stereotype of Asians as engineers and coders well-loved by Silicon Valley. But a lawsuit filed Monday by the US Department of Labor may change the narrative. Palantir Technologies, a data company co-founded by tech financier Peter Thiel and partially financed by the investment arm of the Central Intelligence Agency, was accused of routinely discriminating against Asian job candidates in its hiring process. The lawsuit is the first of its kind against a Silicon Valley company, Rose Darling, a senior trial attorney for the Labor Department tells the Associated Press. The suit is unusual because company reports and industry studies show that Asians are overrepresented in the tech industry. Efforts to diversify hiring practices more often focus on adding women, African Americans, and Hispanics into the workforce instead of Asians. Recommended: Would Google hire you? 10 test questions to find out Palantir denied the allegations Monday and said it will contest the suit. It said that the government's case "relies on a narrow and flawed statistical analysis relating to three job descriptions from 2010 to 2011."

While Asians are well-represented in the tech industry, the representation doesn’t extend to the executive level, a phenomena that applies to other minority groups as well. A study released May 2015 by Ascend, a pan-Asian organization of business professionals in North America, found that while Asians represent 27.2 percent of the professional workforce for tech giants Google, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, LinkedIn and Yahoo, only 13.9 percent of them are executives.   “The common assumption is that Asians are successful since so many of them already work in Silicon Valley companies,” Janet Wong, a former partner at KPMG and study co-author said in a press release. "However, our deeper EPI analysis reveals that while Asians are well-represented – even overrepresented – at the staff and professional levels, they are underrepresented in the management pipeline and barely seen at the executive levels." The executive positions are dominated by white men followed by white women, Hispanic men and Asian men, with black women and Hispanic women at the tail end. There are as many Asian professionals as white professionals in these companies, but the report finds that white women and men are 154 percent more likely to be an executive. Asian women are especially underrepresented at the management level. Some of the reasons the researchers gave for the small number of Asian employees transitioning to management positions include a lack of role models and gaps in leadership expectations and training. “I consider myself third-generation Chinese American, and I grew up with my parents and grandparents, and their culture was what I grew up with,” Ms. Wong told the Los Angeles Times in an interview. “They told me all I needed to do was stay in school, make good grades, and that was all I needed to be successful. They never taught me the soft skills or leadership skills. So when I started my career, I thought all I had to do was keep my head down, do good work, and I’d be acknowledged and have a successful career.” Other studies have also found  wage gaps between minorities and whites in the high-tech industry, although the gap between Asians and whites is smaller than for other minorities, as USA Today reported in 2014. Some Asian employees in the tech industry have spoken out on social media about that the lack of dissent in the Asian community, and theorized that it could be part of the reason why the problem persists. “We are the “model minority” – quiet, hardworking, well-educated, successful in a middle class sort of way.… It’s good enough that we don’t complain about the erasure of our individual identities and work ethic and personal successes, we don’t complain about the bamboo ceiling, we stay quiet on issues of race,” wrote Tracy Chou, software engineer at Pinterest in a LinkedIn post. “To my fellow Asians in tech: It’s time for us to start caring, to start talking, to start doing something about the racial disparities in our industry.” Some Asian Americans in the tech industry may feel awkward discussing this when it may seem as if they already have a foot in the door. Some may point to Indian executives at companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Nokia as examples of Asians representation in the tech industry, the Wall Street Journal reports.  Anil Dash, an Indian American and a two-decade veteran in the tech industry, argues in a Medium post that those are rare. In fact, Mr. Dash tells The Christian Science Monitor in a phone interview, the situation is getting worse compared to when he entered the field. “There has been a lot of pushback … (and sentiment of) I got in, why am i going to complain?” Dash says. “Especially for first generation immigrants who are excited about the opportunity, but also don’t know the tradeoff they’re making.” Dash points out the tendency for these companies to hire foreigners in the tech industry as one of the reasons. These employees with no permanent immigration status – many are Asians –  face problems securing their status and don’t hold much leverage in asking for career advancement. The Ascend report recommends examining the hiring processes to ensure biases are absent and to develop culture-specific leadership programs. Many tech companies now  have initiatives to increase the numbers of Asians and other minorities in leadership positions, The Los Angeles Times reports. Dash, like Chou, says he believes that Asians in the tech industry, especially Asian men, should begin speaking up for themselves and for other minority groups. Non-Asian minority groups still face hurdles in accessing capital, technology, and perceptional biases in even getting their foot in the door compared to Asians. “We should acknowledge that we haven’t said enough about anti-Black and anti-Latino attitudes, and that we have not articulated our complicity in industry sexism and misogyny. Indeed, we have often helped build these systems of exclusion, not merely remained silent while they were enforced,” he wrote in the Medium post two years ago. “We can do justice to our peers and coworkers who are working in an unfair system, bringing them closer to the level playing field they deserve.” Next up Test your knowledge Would Google hire you? 10 test questions to find out Focus Can familiarity build trust?

An opera singer and corporate creativity maestro, David bridges the gap between the arts and business in surprisingly creative ways. (David Pearl) LONDON, U.K.—A dreary November day stuck in a London bus. The stench of passengers, noisy children, barking dogs. The mood is dull. I don’t want to be here, thought David Pearl. Then he thought again. “Suddenly my brain said: ‘Just imagine if you were dead David, and you were given a minute back on life but you had to take it here. Would you be complaining? Would you take a minute?’ “I would definitely take this minute. Just 60 seconds of normal life. I would not be complaining, I would be amazed at fellow human beings, I would savour the smell of the sweat, I would enjoy the aches of my body.” He’s taken that “let’s do this now” energy with him ever since. “You know, maybe there’s never going to be a tomorrow,” he said spiritedly. It’s been a theme in David’s life and career: finding that magic and meaning in mundane moments. Now he helps business leaders think outside-the-box. He’s worked with influential people in some of the biggest companies in the world, like GlaxoSmithKline, Google, Intel, and Barclays, and runs an arts company and a social enterprise on the side. But getting there hasn’t been an easy ride. A Turning Point It wouldn’t cross your mind that David, an enterprising 56-year-old, sitting comfortably with a coffee in a central London café, has survived two suicide attempts. The real low points in his life, like a dark and desolate abyss, were incredibly dangerous. When he was a university student at Cambridge he tried to commit suicide, for the second time. The first attempt was when he was a teenager. “I think when I look back it was bad luck,” he said. “You can deal with one difficult thing, or two, but five in a row? It’s like buckets coming at once. I’ve noticed with people they can deal with any one of them individually, a break up of a relationship, work pressure, feeling not good in your skin, worry about the future … all of those were happening, changes I guess, and it all happened at once,” he recalled. Now, he talks about embracing his life’s lows and still counts himself as one of the lucky ones. “It’s actually been a fuel for all the work I’ve done since. It helped me understand that we have highs and lows, and the lows can be incredibly productive. They are not necessarily pleasant but they can be incredibly productive.” Lows force you to think about the deeper things in life, he said, but he doesn’t advocate depression. He recently spoke about it at a talk hosted by Google, as he felt that many business people suffer in silence. “I wanted to talk out and say, listen, you’re not alone mate,” he said, perhaps challenging the stigma around emotional health in the corporate world. He has the demeanour of a performer as he speaks. It’s no surprise, as he has been an opera star since he was a young child after his school teacher spotted his talent. He debuted with Placido Domingo at age 9 at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden and sang professionally there until age 13. That exposure to the opera world at such a young age, where he was a schoolboy by day and an opera singer by night, deeply touched his heart. “It was the real-ist thing I ever heard. It wasn’t the stupid story or the crazy costumes, it was the power of the music, tucked through all the everyday stuff. It wasn’t opera it was life to be this bright, and it can be this beautiful,” he said. The people for me who seem to do best and be happiest are the people who know their why. — David Pearl After working part time as a writer for film director Stanley Kubrick while studying at university, he continued his journey as an advertising writer by day and a professional opera singer by night. He then set up Opera Circus, a company that combines opera, circus, and theatre, and presented a music series called ‘The Score’ on BBC2. He thought he’d always belong in the world of art. But an unexpected call from one of the largest professional services companies in the world drew him towards the world of business. Now he works on bridging the two worlds, living in the “smudge” in between. “I don’t think I’m a performer or a business person, I really am hybrid. I’m both, I feel very comfortable in both areas. I’m clearly not a hard-nut businessman and I’m not a crazy art person, like most of us I live in the smudge,” he said. “I live in the sort of grey area in the middle of it, green, I don’t know, whatever it is.” The Theatre of Business The company that phoned, which he insists can’t be named, asked for David’s help because they wanted to bring the arts into the way they made relationships, solved problems, and did business. His solution was to build a skeleton theatre on a clifftop in Portugal, to have 1,500 of the staff come together, and to ask them to create an opera performance. He started to bring his theatrical experience to businesses. Related Coverage The Art of Networking and Coffee Chats Sceptics might question whether it would really work. The key is to work on things over time, he said, and the advantage of an individual event is that it gives people an experience that they can refer back to. “Will one event change their performance? No. But is it an example of people’s collaboration? Yes it is. People say we can’t collaborate – well, yes you did,” he said. “To the sceptics I would say don’t just measure time, keep looking and listening; in 6 months time there might be changes.” His creative streak has certainly got people thinking differently; he has since organised over 800 events for different organisations. David sees a synergy between theatre, life, and business. “Characters in drama all have a ‘why’ underneath their actions,” he said. “I found that most people have a why if they think long enough … And the people for me who seem to do best and be happiest are the people who know their why.” David Pearl sings during a presentation. (David Pearl) He used to hide his musical side in business meetings, but now he uses it to his advantage. “I’ll often sing in the boardroom, I just launch into song. Not for shock value but sometimes it’s easier – one song can say what 1,000 PowerPoint presentations would never do. If the room is going dead, I might just sing to them to re-energise them to shock them awake. “Or if there are people who are thinking about engaging with people or connecting with the customer, I sing them a love song to remind them that music and the arts have an incredible amount of technology to help you connect with audiences.” Of course, music isn’t just about connecting businesses to their audiences. It’s how he met his wife 24 years ago, serenading her under her window. They are now settled only a couple of streets away from where they first met, with their two children Elsa, 17 and Zachary, 15. Aside from writing books – most recently “Story for Leaders” – he runs Impropra, an improv opera company, and a not-for-profit venture called Street Wisdom. That’s a lot of projects going on at once. “I like the contrast of the different lives I’m leading. It keeps me energised,” he said. “Instead of thinking there’s one day and you’re yourself from the beginning to end, I like to think there’s one day and there’s probably five or six mes, each doing a bit of it. Then, I think I’m less tired at the end of the day. “I’m living a few lives at once, like a rockstar business life.” Take a Walk The moment in the bus, where David suddenly found inspiration in the ordinary, was one of the catalysts behind the social enterprise Street Wisdom, the third project he runs. The workshops that are free and are run globally “give participants the skills to access the ‘invisible university’ that’s all around them and find fresh answers to personal or work-related questions – with profound results,” the website explains. David Pearl leads a group of Street Wisdom workshop participants. (David Pearl) Though it sounds mystical, through a Street Wisdom taster session I found myself appreciating the small things on the street that I would not have otherwise appreciated, a beauty in the mundane. Being aware of the environment, rather than busily rushing from A to B, opened my mind. “What we do in Street Wisdom is mindfully wander,” said David. “There’s wisdom in the wandering. You’ll find things that you wouldn’t do otherwise.” Many people who have come on the workshop have had life-changing experiences, finding answers in the environment around them. “You don’t have to go on holiday to have a new thought,” he said. Mostly it’s about slowing down. It’s also designed to get business people out of the office and to think differently. “For a while I’ve started taking businesses out of their offices, I noticed there’s a difference when you’re out of the office – ah, I’m a human – sort of thing,” he said. “You also don’t have an identity. It doesn’t matter if you’re standing in a queue in a post office or you are sitting in a cafe, no one knows or cares if you are head of blah blah, or Chief Financial Officer of a bank, you’re just a person.” So next time you’re stuck in public transport on your daily commute, a little mindful wandering might just get you on your way.

Zhongguancun is a technology hub situated in the Haidian District in northwestern Beijing and is very well known in China. Often referred to as "China's Silicon Valley", the area has gathered nearly 20,000 technology enterprises since its emergence in the 1950s. The hub has many local prestigious academy affiliations, and is home to research centers for several global tech companies, including Google, Intel, AMD, Sony, and Microsoft. Zhongguancun main street and plaza in northwestern Beijing, China.. Apple's new R&D center in Zhongguancun has reportedly registered a capital of $15 million, with total investment likely to reach $45 million in the future, according to the park's press release. The center will employ a total of 500 staff and focus on the development of "computer software and hardware products, communication, audio and video devices, as well as advanced technologies for consumer electronics products and the information industry". The R&D facility is expected to complete in 2016 and to be used to integrate Apple's engineering and business teams to increase regional sales and services, according to media reports in China. The news comes on the heels of Apple CEO Tim Cook's announcement last month during a visit to China that an R&D center would be coming to the country "by the end of the year". The move has been seen as a response to the iPhone's dwindling returns in the country as consumers opt for low-cost alternatives available on the Chinese market. Apple has also experienced a series of setbacks in the region this year, including the closure of the iTunes and iBooks store and a number of lawsuits that have prevented it from being able to focus on gaining traction in the country's lucrative mobile segment. Although once Apple's second largest market in the world, the company announced during July's earnings report that its revenue in China had dropped 33 percent year-over-year. Apple has set up similar R&D centers in Japan, Israel, and the UK, and is said to be planning similar facilities in Canada, India, Indonesia and Vietnam to take advantage of local resources.

Don't get me wrong, I am not stupid. I understand international business sufficiently to understand and agree that Apple needs to establish substantial presence in the countries to which it sells its products. I'm just saying there is a reason that's not hard to figure out about its declining sales in China. Rating: 4 Votes GrumpyMom 7 weeks ago No, they're doomed. I saw it somewhere. [doublepost=1475148707][/doublepost] They did, the customers are, and the dongle was free in the box. Yeah but we have to buy more dongles for all our headphones if we don't want to carry the single one around or lose it when we take it off to use our headphones with our stereos or computers. Besides, dongles was just a throwaway example of the many ways Apple sneaks out a bit of profit here and there. I don't hate Apple, goodness no or I wouldn't be here and I wouldn't be planning out future purchases from them. I'm just giving them a bit of a o_O look at some of the things I think run contrary to the focus on the customer experience that I was used to getting from them. [doublepost=1475159637][/doublepost] Apple uses such local employment bribes in place of lobbyists, to try to get tax breaks, permission for stores and services, hopefully better patent court results, etc. It worked in Ireland. Hasn't worked in India very much. Pretty unlikely to work in China. A $45 million investment is nothing. Still, if a side effect is more localized apps and features, it'll be a win for China users. I would imagine or hope that's all Apple expects to get out of this. Serious R&D will be pilfered so they would be wise to stick to endeavors that will benefit the local population in much the same way they were able to develop the capability for the IPhone to work with the Japanese card system. There are elements to Chinese culture and daily life that should not be left to guessing or assumptions or even visits. Heck, I'm half Asian and I get it wrong a lot when it comes to understanding the nuances of the various Asian cultures that make up my heritage. It is really challenging to mix perspectives from east and west and not screw something up. Apple needs to be there in the thick of this daily life to better serve their Chinese customers. I just wonder if the Chinese government will foil them at every turn there. I do question how Tim justifies to himself as a human being all the butt kissing he has to do in order to conduct business in a country that has so many government sanctioned restrictions on gay rights as well as other human rights violations like enforced abortions listed in the other post on this thread.

Rating: 1 Votes rshrugged 7 weeks ago There's countless stories about trade secret thefts emanating from China, both by private parties and by the Nation-state. A federal grand jury has indicted six Chinese citizens in what authorities say was a long- running conspiracy to steal valuable technology from two U.S. firms for the benefit of the Chinese government. The indictment, unsealed Monday, highlights the threat posed by insiders who use their position to steal sensitive information on behalf of a foreign government or for financial gain. The move is part of a larger trend by the U.S. government to step up efforts to deter Chinese theft of trade secrets.[...] https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-indicts-6-chinese-on-charges-of-stealing-trade-secrets/2015/05/19/f11fd35e-fdd8-11e4-805c-c3f407e5a9e9_story.html Does Apple find the success of China's Great Firewall agreeable? It wasn't supposed to work. But China's Great Firewall -- a massive Internet surveillance and content control system -- has, in many respects, been an unparalleled success. China has Internet companies worth billions of dollars and more web users than the population of the United States -- all while still being able to block information it deems counter to its interests. And now, some fear, the model is going global. "If you are sitting in Beijing, what's the problem?" asks Bill Bishop, China watcher and author of the Sinocism China newsletter in the latest episode of "On China." "You are still in power, you have 650 million Internet users, you have billions of dollars of economic value going to the Internet everyday, you've used the Internet to increase government transparency, investors love us and they can't throw enough money at our companies that have more than half a trillion dollars in market capitalization," says Bishop.[...] http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/25/asia/china-internet-censorship-kristie-lu-stout/index.html Last year the Party did lift their one-child restriction policy. They now generously allow two. BEIJING — Driven by fears that an aging population could jeopardize China’s economic ascent, the Communist Party leadership ended its decades-old “one child” policy on Thursday, announcing that all married couples would be allowed to have two children.[...] For China’s leaders, the controls were a triumphant demonstration of the party’s capacity to reshape even the most intimate dimensions of citizens’ lives. But they bred intense resentment over the brutal intrusions involved, including forced abortions and crippling fines, especially in the countryside.[...] http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/30/world/asia/china-end-one-child-policy.html Does Apple find central control, as practiced in China, attractive?

Rating: 1 Votes GrumpyMom 7 weeks ago Both China and India are nations where females are not just aborted, but many baby girls are abandoned or killed after birth. Indian Minister Says 2,000 Girls Are Killed Across the Country Every Day ('http://time.com/3830874/2000-girls-killed-every-day-india-minister/') Wow, I didn't know that. I know there is violence against women there but did not know that particular statistic. We have very good friends from India who have daughters (no sons) they adore and intend to educate in the best US schools in fields such as engineering and medicine. They are in fact sparing no expense to educate their daughters. They always paint India in a very progressive and idealistic light to my family. In fact, once their girls complete their education here, they all plan to return to India because they prefer it there, overall. They are not considered wealthy here but they are affluent enough. In India, they are apparently well to do and perhaps sheltered from the more brutal realities against females there, especially those of the lower castes. I don't know. It would be a delicate conversation to have with them, so I won't. In light of that gruesome statistic, it is rather incredible India has managed to have a female Prime Minister while the more progressive US has yet to elect a female president. It has always fascinated me to look around and see the numbers and influence of female leaders who manage to rise to prominence in some of the countries that are more restrictive if not downright brutal to women. I think the difference between China and India is that officials in India are working toward change. Clearly that female Minister is attempting to make things better for females. They are trying to eradicate brutality in India and it really persists on an institutional level due to corruption, not ideology. But in China, the brutality and oppression is instigated by the government itself. So I can see less ethical conflict about Apple moving into India to do business, but in the case of China which practically celebrates its oppression of people and in fact holds it up as an example to be exported, Apple has to concede a vast disconnect between Tim's stated commitment to social responsibility for Apple. [doublepost=1475245346][/doublepost] Uh, how many pairs of headphones do you have, that you use with your phone? You don't "have to buy more dongles for all our headphones", hardly anyone is going to do that despite what you might do. All these posts about losing dongles and AirPods, are you guys really that aloof when it comes to your belongings? Do you lose things all the time? Like I said it's not about this one "dongle" per se, but about what it represents in terms of Apple making changes not for consumer benefit but to eke out more profit. There are numerous comments from forum members, tech reviewers and pundits in general about the logistical pain in the tail this move by Apple has engendered and their possible profit motive for initiating it.

 Car industry puts cooperation on show in battle against Silicon Valley firms Reuters Sep. 29, 2016, 5:34 AM 127 facebook linkedin twitter email print By Edward Taylor and Eric Auchard PARIS/FRANKFURT, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Alarmed by the threat posed by Silicon Valley firms to their businesses in developing autonomous driving systems, it was evident at the Paris Motor Show this week that carmakers are seeking to fightin back by cooperating in areas of technology development where previously they might have tried to compete. Three big carmakers - BMW, Daimler and VW's Audi - announced earlier this week they would launch new traffic monitoring services next year which give drivers a view of road conditions along their entire route, based on video data collected by their jointly-owned navigation mapping services firm, HERE from sensors incorporated in other cars (http://reut.rs/2dabC1B). Meanwhile HERE's Dutch rival TomTom NV, on Thursday announced traffic data deals for truckmaker Volvo and carmaker Skoda, a VW subsidiary. Connecting cars on the move with the Internet also needs more reliable mobile telecoms networks and towards that end Germany's top automakers said this week they were teaming up with the telecoms network equipment makers Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia, Qualcomm and Intel to help with developing the next-generation 5G networks set to debut around 2020 (http://reut.rs/2dcPuCy). It's unfamiliar territory for carmakers who are unaccustomed to cooperating as they battle for distinctive features that will help drive sales of their latest model vehicles. "This is how the automotive industry may be able to fight off the threat that Apple and particularly Google represent to their brands as digital services become more and more important," technology investment analyst Richard Windsor said. Moreover, carmakers are now racing one another to plot their paths to building self-driving vehicles over the next five years. That's a dramatic acceleration from the 10- to 15-year timeframes many had charted until pushed to speed up the process by the advances made by Google and Tesla. "We see the car transforming from a product into the ultimate platform," Daimler Chairman Dieter Zetsche said. Now General Motors, Nissan and VW are also experimenting with a plan to pull video data captured by their customers' vehicles using Israeli firm Mobileye's camera-based sensor systems, that may soon give automakers an edge over the likes of Google in the precision-mapping required for driverless cars (http://reut.rs/2daj3Wr). However, it remains to be seen whether carmakers can charge premium prices for connected car services as technology companies like Google look to develop similar offerings for free, supported by advertising or other business models. A deal by traffic data start-up Inrix to supply Google-owned crowd-sourced mapping unit Waze with its data will help drivers find parking spots on their smartphones via a free app. And on Thursday Renault said it was working with Waze on a Google Android Auto protoype for a navigation app that besides showing traffic conditions will also identify 13,000 electric car-charging stations across France. CAREFUL DRIVING Some in the industry are also cautioning that the move to developing fully autonomous driving should remain a very gradual one. Earlier this month pioneering electric car maker Tesla was accused by Mobileye of "pushing the envelope in terms of safety", alleging that it had promoted its Autopilot driver assistance system as "hands-free" (http://reut.rs/2d5lUiG). Other carmakers, while reluctant to address the dispute directly, are keen to emphasise that the move to developing truly autonomous vehicles remains a very gradual one. "There can be no compromise on safety, which is absolutely crucial - that is why at PSA we've always believed autonomy will happen in incremental steps," PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said in an interview published earlier this month. "This is not the case for certain competitors who have tried to produce a fully autonomous vehicle right away." Among car companies there are two camps: Those who are trying to develop their autonomous driving technology in-house, and those who are outsourcing it. Fiat's recent partnership to build self-driving vans with Google is seen by analysts as an example of outsourcing, given the Italian auto maker's weak finances, limiting its ability to invest in its own software expertise (http://reut.rs/1ZatE2c). Daimler, on the other hand, is firmly in the camp of those auto makers who want to go it alone. Some partnerships like the deal between Chinese carmaker Geely's Swedish subsidiary Volvo Car Group's deal to develop autonomous cars with Uber Technologies, and General Motor's partnership with Uber's rival Lyft, are seen as hybrid approaches to such cooperation. "The automotive industry has and will continue to become a software business in many ways," Audi of America President Scott Keogh told Reuters. "We are either capable of doing it in-house or we are going to all the partners that we need to go to, whether it's Nvidia , Mobileye or HERE."

"This is how the automotive industry may be able to fight off the threat that Apple and particularly Google represent to their brands as digital services become more and more important," technology investment analyst Richard Windsor said. BMW, Daimler and VW's Audi announced this week they would launch new traffic monitoring services next year which give drivers a view of road conditions miles ahead. They are based on video data collected from sensors in other cars and fed to the three carmakers' jointly-owned navigation mapping services firm HERE (http://reut.rs/2dabC1B). Separately HERE's Dutch rival TomTom NV on Thursday announced traffic data deals with truckmaker Volvo and carmaker Skoda, a VW subsidiary. Also General Motors, Nissan and VW are experimenting with a plan to pull video data captured by their customers' vehicles using Israeli firm Mobileye's camera-based sensor systems, that may soon give automakers an edge over the likes of Google in the precision-mapping required for driverless cars (http://reut.rs/2daj3Wr). However, it remains to be seen whether carmakers can charge premium prices for connected car services as technology companies like Google look to develop similar offerings for free, supported by advertising or other business models. A deal by traffic data start-up Inrix to supply data to Google-owned crowd-sourced traffic and navigation service Waze will help drivers find parking spots on smartphones using the free app. And Renault said on Thursday it was showing a prototype of a Waze system built into its car dashboards which run Android Auto, Google's operating system for carmakers. Meanwhile connecting cars on the move with the Internet also needs more reliable mobile telecoms networks. With that aim, Germany's top automakers said this week they were teaming up with telecoms network equipment makers Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia, Qualcomm and Intel to help with developing the next-generation 5G networks set to debut around 2020 (http://reut.rs/2dcPuCy). CAREFUL DRIVING At the same time carmakers are now racing to plot their courses to building self-driving vehicles over the next five years, a dramatic acceleration in pace from the 10- to 15-year timeframes many had charted until pushed to speed up the process by the advances made by Google and Tesla. "We see the car transforming from a product into the ultimate platform," Daimler Chairman Dieter Zetsche told reporters in Paris. Among the car companies there have been two camps, those who are trying to develop their autonomous driving technology in-house, and those who are outsourcing it, but that division is looking set to become less clear-cut due to the need for cooperation in some areas at least. "Gradually all of the car manufacturers will have to get more and more involved in managing data. It's natural. We're going to have to work much more collaboratively," Stewart Callegari, a Nissan product planning executive for driverless cars told reporters at the Paris show. Fiat's recent partnership to build self-driving vans with Google is seen by analysts as an example of outsourcing, given the Italian auto maker's weak finances, limiting its ability to invest in its own software expertise (http://reut.rs/1ZatE2c). Daimler, on the other hand, is firmly in the camp of vehicle makers who want to go it alone but still sees some need for collaboration. "We need to think whether we work together analysing the data or whether we do this on our own. This depends on the use case," Zetsche said, adding that it made sense to work together in areas where potential cost savings resulted but did not blur the distinctions between brands. Some partnerships like the deal between Chinese carmaker Geely's Swedish subsidiary Volvo Car Group to develop autonomous cars with Uber Technologies, and General Motor's partnership with Uber's rival Lyft, are also seen as hybrid approaches. "The automotive industry has and will continue to become a software business in many ways," Audi of America President Scott Keogh told Reuters.

Three big carmakers – BMW, Daimler and VW’s Audi – announced earlier this week they would launch new traffic monitoring services next year which give drivers a view of road conditions along their entire route, based on video data collected by their jointly-owned navigation mapping services firm, HERE from sensors incorporated in other cars. Meanwhile HERE’s Dutch rival TomTom NV, on Thursday announced traffic data deals for truckmaker Volvo and carmaker Skoda, a VW subsidiary. Connecting cars on the move with the Internet also needs more reliable mobile telecoms networks and towards that end Germany’s top automakers said this week they were teaming up with the telecoms network equipment makers Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia, Qualcomm and Intel to help with developing the next-generation 5G networks set to debut around 2020. It’s unfamiliar territory for carmakers who are unaccustomed to cooperating as they battle for distinctive features that will help drive sales of their latest model vehicles. “This is how the automotive industry may be able to fight off the threat that Apple and particularly Google represent to their brands as digital services become more and more important,” technology investment analyst Richard Windsor said. Moreover, carmakers are now racing one another to plot their paths to building self-driving vehicles over the next five years. That’s a dramatic acceleration from the 10- to 15-year timeframes many had charted until pushed to speed up the process by the advances made by Google and Tesla. “We see the car transforming from a product into the ultimate platform,” Daimler Chairman Dieter Zetsche said. Now General Motors, Nissan and VW are also experimenting with a plan to pull video data captured by their customers’ vehicles using Israeli firm Mobileye’s camera-based sensor systems, that may soon give automakers an edge over the likes of Google in the precision-mapping required for driverless cars. However, it remains to be seen whether carmakers can charge premium prices for connected car services as technology companies like Google look to develop similar offerings for free, supported by advertising or other business models. A deal by traffic data start-up Inrix to supply Google-owned crowd-sourced mapping unit Waze with its data will help drivers find parking spots on their smartphones via a free app. And on Thursday Renault said it was working with Waze on a Google Android Auto protoype for a navigation app that besides showing traffic conditions will also identify 13,000 electric car-charging stations across France. CAREFUL DRIVING Some in the industry are also cautioning that the move to developing fully autonomous driving should remain a very gradual one. Earlier this month pioneering electric car maker Tesla was accused by Mobileye of “pushing the envelope in terms of safety”, alleging that it had promoted its Autopilot driver assistance system as “hands-free”. Other carmakers, while reluctant to address the dispute directly, are keen to emphasise that the move to developing truly autonomous vehicles remains a very gradual one. “There can be no compromise on safety, which is absolutely crucial – that is why at PSA we’ve always believed autonomy will happen in incremental steps,” PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said in an interview published earlier this month. “This is not the case for certain competitors who have tried to produce a fully autonomous vehicle right away.” Among car companies there are two camps: Those who are trying to develop their autonomous driving technology in-house, and those who are outsourcing it. Fiat’s recent partnership to build self-driving vans with Google is seen by analysts as an example of outsourcing, given the Italian auto maker’s weak finances, limiting its ability to invest in its own software expertise. Daimler, on the other hand, is firmly in the camp of those auto makers who want to go it alone. Some partnerships like the deal between Chinese carmaker Geely’s Swedish subsidiary Volvo Car Group’s deal to develop autonomous cars with Uber Technologies, and General Motor’s partnership with Uber’s rival Lyft, are seen as hybrid approaches to such cooperation. “The automotive industry has and will continue to become a software business in many ways,” Audi of America President Scott Keogh told Reuters. “We are either capable of doing it in-house or we are going to all the partners that we need to go to, whether it’s Nvidia , Mobileye or HERE.” Please Wait while comments are loading...

REUTERS/Jacky Naegelen 5/5 By Edward Taylor and Eric Auchard | PARIS/FRANKFURT PARIS/FRANKFURT Alarmed by the threat posed by Silicon Valley firms developing autonomous driving systems, carmakers at this week's Paris Motor Show showed signs they are ready to hit back by cooperating in areas where they might have been expected to compete. "This is how the automotive industry may be able to fight off the threat that Apple (AAPL.O) and particularly Google (GOOGL.O) represent to their brands as digital services become more and more important," technology investment analyst Richard Windsor said. BMW (BMWG.DE), Daimler (DAIGn.DE) and VW's (VOWG_p.DE) Audi announced this week they would launch new traffic monitoring services next year which give drivers a view of road conditions miles ahead. They are based on video data collected from sensors in other cars and fed to the three carmakers' jointly-owned navigation mapping services firm HERE (reut.rs/2dabC1B). Separately HERE's Dutch rival TomTom NV (TOM2.AS) on Thursday announced traffic data deals with truckmaker Volvo (VOLVb.ST) and carmaker Skoda, a VW subsidiary. Also General Motors (GM.N), Nissan (7201.T) and VW are experimenting with a plan to pull video data captured by their customers' vehicles using Israeli firm Mobileye's (MBLY.N) camera-based sensor systems, that may soon give automakers an edge over the likes of Google in the precision-mapping required for driverless cars (reut.rs/2daj3Wr). However, it remains to be seen whether carmakers can charge premium prices for connected car services as technology companies like Google look to develop similar offerings for free, supported by advertising or other business models. A deal by traffic data start-up Inrix to supply data to Google-owned crowd-sourced traffic and navigation service Waze will help drivers find parking spots on smartphones using the free app. And Renault (RENA.PA) said on Thursday it was showing a prototype of a Waze system built into its car dashboards which run Android Auto, Google's operating system for carmakers. Meanwhile connecting cars on the move with the Internet also needs more reliable mobile telecoms networks. With that aim, Germany's top automakers said this week they were teaming up with telecoms network equipment makers Ericsson (ERICb.ST), Huawei [HWT.UL], Nokia (NOKIA.HE), Qualcomm (QCOM.O) and Intel (INTC.O) to help with developing the next-generation 5G networks set to debut around 2020 (reut.rs/2dcPuCy). CAREFUL DRIVING At the same time carmakers are now racing to plot their courses to building self-driving vehicles over the next five years, a dramatic acceleration in pace from the 10- to 15-year timeframes many had charted until pushed to speed up the process by the advances made by Google and Tesla (TSLA.O). "We see the car transforming from a product into the ultimate platform," Daimler Chairman Dieter Zetsche told reporters in Paris. Among the car companies there have been two camps, those who are trying to develop their autonomous driving technology in-house, and those who are outsourcing it, but that division is looking set to become less clear-cut due to the need for cooperation in some areas at least. "Gradually all of the car manufacturers will have to get more and more involved in managing data. It's natural. We're going to have to work much more collaboratively," Stewart Callegari, a Nissan product planning executive for driverless cars told reporters at the Paris show. Fiat's recent partnership to build self-driving vans with Google is seen by analysts as an example of outsourcing, given the Italian auto maker's weak finances, limiting its ability to invest in its own software expertise (reut.rs/1ZatE2c). Daimler, on the other hand, is firmly in the camp of vehicle makers who want to go it alone but still sees some need for collaboration. "We need to think whether we work together analyzing the data or whether we do this on our own. This depends on the use case," Zetsche said, adding that it made sense to work together in areas where potential cost savings resulted but did not blur the distinctions between brands. Some partnerships like the deal between Chinese carmaker Geely's (0175.HK) Swedish subsidiary Volvo Car Group to develop autonomous cars with Uber Technologies [UBER.UL], and General Motor's partnership with Uber's rival Lyft, are also seen as hybrid approaches.

Three big carmakers - BMW, Daimler and VW's Audi - announced earlier this week they would launch new traffic monitoring services next year which give drivers a view of road conditions along their entire route, based on video data collected by their jointly-owned navigation mapping services firm HERE from sensors incorporated in other cars (reut.rs/2dabC1B). Meanwhile HERE's Dutch rival TomTom NV, on Thursday announced traffic data deals for truckmaker Volvo and carmaker Skoda, a VW subsidiary. Connecting cars on the move with the Internet also needs more reliable mobile telecoms networks and towards that end Germany's top automakers said this week they were teaming up with the telecoms network equipment makers Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia, Qualcomm and Intel to help with developing the next-generation 5G networks set to debut around 2020 (reut.rs/2dcPuCy). It's unfamiliar territory for carmakers who are unaccustomed to cooperating as they battle for distinctive features that will help drive sales of their latest model vehicles. "This is how the automotive industry may be able to fight off the threat that Apple and particularly Google represent to their brands as digital services become more and more important," technology investment analyst Richard Windsor said. Moreover, carmakers are now racing one another to plot their paths to building self-driving vehicles over the next five years.

A deal by traffic data start-up Inrix to supply Google-owned crowd-sourced mapping unit Waze with its data will help drivers find parking spots on their smartphones via a free app. And on Thursday Renault said it was working with Waze on a Google Android Auto protoype for a navigation app that besides showing traffic conditions will also identify 13,000 electric car-charging stations across France. CAREFUL DRIVING Some in the industry are also warning that the move to developing fully autonomous driving should remain a very gradual one. Earlier this month pioneering electric car maker Tesla was accused by Mobileye of "pushing the envelope in terms of safety", alleging that it had promoted its Autopilot driver assistance system as "hands-free" (reut.rs/2d5lUiG). Other carmakers, while reluctant to address the dispute directly, are keen to emphasise the need for a cautious approach. "There can be no compromise on safety, which is absolutely crucial - that is why at PSA we've always believed autonomy will happen in incremental steps," PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said in an interview published earlier this month. "This is not the case for certain competitors who have tried to produce a fully autonomous vehicle right away." Among car companies there are two camps: Those who are trying to develop their autonomous driving technology in-house, and those who are outsourcing it.

Apple is expected to fully revamp their 13-inch and 15-inch Retina MacBook Pro, which should rock Intel's new Kaby Lake CPUs - making for thinner, lighter MacBook Pros.   Apple is expected to unveil their Touch ID fingerprint sensor onto the next-gen MacBook Pros, borrowing the security side of things from the iPhone and iPad. The fingerprint sensor would allow MacBook Pro owners to log-in to their laptops using their fingerprint, or they would allow for Apple Pay purchases with your fingerprint, which is now supported by macOS Sierra, and iOS 10.   The most exciting thing aside from the Kaby Lake processor and Touch ID sensor, is that the new MacBook Pros are rumored to feature an OLED touchbar above the function keys. The OLED display touchbar would allow people to tap the bar to access applications on their MacBook Pro, but I'm sure there'll be some magic and hopefully some courage built-in to the new MacBook Pro, too.

Yup, we’ve all been there, and now it seems that during the 10th annual McAfee Most Dangerous Celebrities study, Intel Security has found actress/comedian Amy Schumer to be the most dangerous celebrity to search for. What do we mean by that? Basically one of the ways hackers trick people into installing malware on their computers is to hijack the search results for celebrities, basically those shady links we were talking about. For users who do not know better, they might click that link and end up having malware or a virus installed on their computer. At this time of writing, Amy Schumer has topped the list with 16.11%, meaning that there’s a 16.11% chance that the search results could lead users to a site with malware. Coming in second place is Justin Bieber at 15%, Carson Daly and Will Smith who are both tied 13.44%, Rihanna at 13.33%, Miley Cyrus at 12.67%, Chris Hardwick at 12.56%, Daniel Tosh at 11.56%, and Selena Gomez tied with Ke$ha at 11.11%. Like we said, if you know what you’re doing then chances are you know which sites sound shady enough to avoid, but if you want to be safe, we suppose keeping your anti-virus software up to date with the latest threats is always a good idea.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Huawei reportedly looking to Tizen for future smartwatches JC Torres - Sep 29, 2016 9 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit It seems that Google might be losing yet another OEM partner in the smartphone market. According to an unnamed Samsung official quoted by a South Korean newspaper, Huawei is in the process of developing a new smartwatch, but one that doesn’t run Android Wear. Instead, the Chinese company is said to be working together with Samsung in order to get the Tizen operating system up and running on the wearable device. With Android Wear smartwatches seemingly at a plateau, this win for Tizen could mean a more difficult struggle for Google’s wearable platform. To be clear, and despite appearances, Samsung doesn’t own Tizen and neither is it the only company working on it. In fact, Huawei is one of the first members of the Tizen Association, which also includes the likes of Intel, LG, and Panasonic, just to name some. Of these, however, Samsung remains Tizen’s biggest champion, putting the operating system in TVs, fitness bands, smartwatches, and even smartphones. As to why Huawei would be considering switching sides as far as its smartwatches are concerned, the report cites the Samsung exec as saying that Google has been uncooperative helping Huawei customize the Android Wear interface and experience. Unlike Android on smartphones and tablets, Android Wear has more or less been standardized across different smartwatches, leaving smartwatch makers to compete on smartwatch design primarily. In contrast, Samsung has had positive results with Tizen, which it has custom fit for the Gear S2 and S3 to accommodate its rotary bezel control. LG had a similar approach with its own webOS-based Watch Urbane, but eventually went back to the Android Wear fold in later iterations. Huawei may be planning to do likewise but is impeded by Google’s tighter control on Android Wear. Or at least that’s what the report implies. That said, Tizen does face other, equally substantial deficiencies, particularly in apps. Google has made it almost too easy for Android app developers to create equivalent Android Wear apps by practically using the same platform. For Tizen smartwatch apps, however, they will need to learn a different software stack. The growing popularity of Samsung’s Gear S2 and Gear S3 smartwatches, however, could provide an opportunity for the OS as Android Wear seemingly gets stuck in stagnation.

Microsoft Surface Book and Pro 4 Tablets Receive August 30, 2016 Update The new release improves on-screen keyboard stability Sep 29, 2016 06:18 GMT  ·  By Iulian Pascal  ·  Share:  Microsoft has rolled out a new cumulative firmware and driver update package targeted at its Surface Book and Pro 4 tablets, namely version August 30, 2016, which installs Surface Integration Service Device Version 1.0.146.0 to ensure the Balanced power plan is set correctly when the OS is updated. In addition to that, the present update applies the 11.0.15.1003 Surface Management Engine, as well as a new Surface UEFI version, to increase stability and performance when shifting power states. Moreover, tablets will also receive improved usability and battery life, enhanced touch stability when resuming from sleep/hibernations (Intel Precise Touch Device 1.1.0.246), as well as optimized pen pairing. When it comes to installation, know that this task can be carried out either automatically via Microsoft’s Windows Update service or manually by downloading and installing the package. If the first method is desired, take into account that not all Surface owners will receive this new firmware at the same time, and you might need to wait for this release to reach your tablet. As for the other method, simply save, extract, and install all files on your device. However, do not forget that the present firmware is only targeted at the Surface units mentioned above. Also, it would be a good idea to reboot your device manually (if not requested automatically), to ensure all changes take effect properly. That said, download Microsoft Surface Pro 4 Firmware August 30, 2016, or download Microsoft Surface Book Firmware August 30, 2016, install it, and constantly check our website to stay “updated one minute ago.” #Surface Book#Surface Pro 4#Microsoft#August 30, 2016#Firmware reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Microsoft Updates Firmware for Its Surface 3 - Download Version August 8, 2016 Microsoft Rolls Out August 2016 Firmware for Its Surface Pro 3 Devices Microsoft Surface 3 Receives May 2016 Firmware and Drivers Pack Microsoft Surface Book Receives New Firmware - Get the May 24, 2016 Update Google Suspends Lots of Pixel Buyers Accounts for Reselling Them - Update Hacker Breaks into Italian Government Website, 45,000 Users Exposed Three UK Hacked, Details of 6 Million Customers at Risk Microsoft Replaces Command Prompt with PowerShell in Latest Windows 10 Build NVIDIA Makes Available New GeForce Graphics Hotfix Driver - Version 375.95 AMD Releases Radeon Crimson Edition 16.11.4 Hotfix - Download and Apply Now New Firmware Is Available for Sony PlayStation 4 Consoles - Get Version 4.06 Amazon Adds Alexa to Its Fire, Fire HD 8, and Fire HD 10 - Get Firmware 5.6.0    Microsoft Surface Pro 4 tablet New Apps Gus Tools: Turn ESD images of Windows 10 to ISO format, so that you may upgrade your computer to this operating system using a USB or a DVD Avira System SpeedUp: Clean junk files, repair registry errors, delete invalid keys, clean computer activity traces, and defragment your drives using this all-in-one tool POPcon PRO: Advanced program that helps you retrieve messages from POP3 mailboxes and deliver them to your Microsoft Exchange Server mailboxes using antispam, archive, antivirus engine, rule-based distribution and scheduled tasks WFilter Enterprise: Monitor bandwidth, filter and block Internet activities on your network from a single computer via a web-based administration interface PDF to Image Converter: An intuitive and user-friendly application that can come in handy whenever you want to convert your PDF files to various graphic formats Mkgmap splitter: Split the OpenStreetMap files into smaller tiles in order to use them on your Garmin device, with this practical command-line utility Mkgmap: Convert OpenStreetMap tags to a map in IMG format, compatible with Garmin GPS devices, using this advanced command-line application Reader comments Amazon Adds Alexa to Its Fire, Fire HD 8, and Fire HD 10 - Get Firmware 5.6.0 more on: Fire HD 8 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Other players like ebay India, Shopclues are also going to offer discounts during the sale period.

The Hypercat Australia group recently launched its efforts as a counterpart to the UK-based alliance pushing the Hypercat standard. This comes against the backdrop of competing standards vying for dominance in the relatively new field of IoT. Hypercat Australia supporters include KPMG Australia, Flexeye, Giant Ideas and the University of Technology Sydney. “It’s early days given the launch yesterday was the initial call for local membership, but in less than 24 hours we have received more than 40 registrations of interest for membership of Hypercat Australia,” said KPMG Australia’s IoT point man Piers Hogarth-Scott. Meanwhile, the standard is supported globally by such industry giants as Intel, IBM, Huawei, Cisco, ARM, Broadcom and Fujitsu. “The goal of Hypercat is to accelerate the global explosion of the Internet of Things – by enabling connected devices and data to work together to improve how cities work, and how people live,” said Justin Anderson, founder of the Hypercat Alliance. The open JSON-based Hypercat standard is used for exposing IoT device information via the Internet. “The Commonwealth is exploring relationships with different jurisdictions to build smart cities that improve our lives,” added Angus Taylor, Australia’s assistant minister for cities and digital transformation.  “Hypercat Australia is one such partnership which will allow a platform to facilitate cutting edge technology solutions to be applied to urban problems.” Taylor was on hand for the launch event of Hypercat Australia. Aussie smart city efforts key to renewal Last month he announced that the Australian government’s $50 million Smart Cities and Suburbs Program would stage a series of stakeholder roundtables. The first of these roundtables is set to take place in Melbourne on September 14. This follows the April publication of the government’s Smart Cities plan which cited “Smart Technology” as one of its three main pillars. The document promoted the approach of infrastructure renewal through the lens of such emerging technology as IoT. “The Australian Government has strengthened its assessment of infrastructure projects and now examines the extent to which new technologies are used to improve the efficiency, sustainability and services of infrastructure networks,” it said.

The package was originally created by a collaboration between Intel and the Princeton Neuroscience Institute (PNI). To reduce verbosity, we may refer to the Brain Imaging Analysis Kit using the BrainIAK abbreviation. Whenever lowercase spelling is used (e.g., Python package name), we use brainiak. Requirements We support Linux and MacOS with Python version 3.4 or higher. Most of the dependencies will be installed automatically. However, a few need to be installed manually. Linux Install the following packages (Ubuntu 14.04 is used in these instructions): apt install build-essential cmake libgomp1 mpich python3-pip
 Install updated version of the following Python packages: pip3 install --user -U pip virtualenv
 Note the --user flag, which instructs Pip to not overwrite system files. You must add $HOME/.local/bin to your $PATH to be able to run the updated Pip, e.g., by adding the following line to $HOME/.profile and launching a new login shell (e.g., logout or execute bash -l): PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
 MacOS Install the Xcode Command Line Tools: xcode-select --install
 Install brew from https://brew.sh. If you already have brew, examine the output of the following command to make sure it is working: brew doctor
 Then install the following: brew install llvm cmake mpich python3
 You must instruct programs to use this clang version at /usr/local/opt/llvm/bin. One way to do this, which works for most programs, is setting the CC environment variable. You can add the following lines to $HOME/.profile (or $HOME/.bash_profile, if you have one). For them to take effect, you must logout or launch a new login shell, e.g., bash -l: export CC=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang
export CXX=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang++
 In addition, you also need to specify the directories that the newly installed clang will seek for compiling and linking: export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib $LDFLAGS"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/llvm/include $CPPFLAGS"
 Install updated versions of the following Python packages: pip3 install -U pip virtualenv
 Installing The Brain Imaging Analysis Kit is available on PyPI: pip3 install -U brainiak
 Note that you may see a Failed building wheel for brainiak message (issue #61). Installation will proceed despite this failure. You can safely ignore it as long as you see Successfully installed at the end. Documentation The documentation is available at pythonhosted.org/brainiak. Contributing We welcome contributions.

Gaming 3 0 0 September 30, 2016 ‘Quantum Break’ Steam Release: Is The Steam Version Better Than The Windows 10 Release? Joseph Bradford Quantum Break has made the leap onto Steam this week, and while the game has been out for most of the year on PC, this move means more consumers have a chance to check out Remedy’s time-bending, story-driven game. Quantum Break blends a television show and a video game pretty seamlessly, creating one of the more unique takes on storytelling in the medium. Now with the Steam release, Quantum Break gives those not running Windows 10 a chance to try out the game. However, is there a difference between the two versions? Digital Foundry released their analysis of Quantum Break’s Steam release versus the original Windows 10 release. The major difference is the lack of a DirectX 12 requirement on Steam, meaning users still running Windows dated back to Windows 7 can now enjoy the game. But is there a difference in terms of performance between the two? According to Digital Foundry, it depends on your hardware. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-PK55-kCviA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> In the video, the outlet ran Quantum Break at ultra settings, 1080p, and with the upscaling effect enabled. Essentially, as the Inquisitr reported earlier this year, the upscaler is taking four 720p images and combining them into one 1080p image. Turning this off will see a performance drop, but it does clean up the image tremendously. However, for the purposes of the test, they decided to keep it on as that is the optimal setting. When running on Nvidia hardware, the Steam version found itself running at a much higher clip than the Windows 10 counterpart, sometimes on average of 10 or more frames per second. This is telling, as Nvidia hardware has struggled in terms of DirectX 12 performance, so the change to DirectX 11 has definitely improved things for Nvidia users. This writer has noticed the same during testing, as the game is running smoother on Steam than it ever has on my EVGA GTX 980 SC graphics card, paired with an Intel i7-6700K and 16GB of RAM, clocked at 3200 MHz. The game feels smoother, and it runs better than it ever did on the Windows store release. That being said, it’s not perfect. Playing with the upscaling off, for instance, immediately cuts the framerate in half, and while that does give a crisper, clearer image, its performance feels sluggish by comparison. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eU17_kd-e4w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> AMD users have a different story unfold for them, however. Team Red’s hardware leads the pack when it comes to DirectX 12 performance in many titles, but its interesting to see there is not much of a difference in terms of metrics between the two Quantum Break versions. Showing some test footage of AMD’s Rx 480 card, the framerates are a wash, pretty much within a few decimal points and well within the “margin of error” for Digital Foundry. However, it’s incredible to see the gulf of difference between the Nvidia GTX 1060 and the Rx 480 when the settings are fiddled with to target a full 60 frames per second in the Steam version. At times, the video showed the Nvidia card running a full 40 frames better than the AMD card, a staggering gulf between them. If you’ve never played Quantum Break before, this is definitely the version to go with, unless you want the ability to cross save with your Xbox One should you choose to grab the game there too. The Steam version doesn’t sync with your Xbox Live ID, so your progress doesn’t carry over. However, if you’ve held off waiting for a potential Steam release, this is the version for you.

Eurogamer.net Follow @eurogamer Home Guides Destiny PlayStation 4 Xbox One Destiny Khvostov Quest - schematic location, 7G-OX weapon parts and manual pages for Rise of Iron's We Found a Rifle Quest How to start and complete Rise of Iron's Quest to get an Exotic version of Destiny's very first gun. By Matthew Reynolds Published 29/09/2016 Destiny: Rise of Iron has a neat callback to the very first weapon players wield in the game - the Khvostov - by making it the Exotic weapon Khvostov 7G-OX. The path to get there isn't signposted by the game, but once you're on the Khvostov Quest in Rise of Iron, it will only take you around an hour to 90 minutes to get it - though expect some exploration and a tough boss battle before you do so. Once you're done, maybe you'd want to take on another Exotic - the Gjallarhorn Quest, Thorn Quest or Outbreak Prime Quest perhaps? - which are required to complete an entry in Rise of Iron's Record Book. How to get the Khvostov Quest 'We Found a Rifle' in Destiny: Rise of Iron First, you need the Khvostov 7G-OX schematic to unlock the questline. There are two ways to do this: Dismantle the original Khvostov weapon Use a Splicer Intel Relay to board the Ketch ship in The Plaguelands If you managed to keep hold of that weapon from way back in 2014, then great - pull it out of your Vault, dismantle it and move on to the next step. Of course, most people got rid of it as soon as possible, and thankfully there's another way to get the Khvostov 7G-OX schematic. Here's the Khvostov 7G-OX up close. You need to head to the place you started Destiny, just outside the Cosmodrome walls. Fire up The Plaguelands patrol (complete the game's final story mission, The Iron Tomb, to access this) and head back in the direction of the Rocketlands (from where you spawn in, go right, through the doorway on the upper walkway). Once in the Rocketlands, go left to The Divide, then left round the corner into the sewers to access The Breach. You need to make sure you have a Splicer Intel Relay on you, because before you can go exit the wall, you'll have to open a doorway in The Breach. (Note that this won't work if you try and access the ship from story The Walls Come Down - we tried it.) Once you do, work your way through the pile up of cars to the Ketch ship in the distance, and kill everything on board, including a rather persistent Pilot Servitor. Once taken care of, a chest will appear in the far right corner, containing the Khvostov 7G-OX schematic. Whichever way you get it, take it to the Iron Temple to continue the next part of the quest. How to complete the 'We Found a Rifle' Quest, Khvostov weapon parts and manuals pages locations You now have to locate 10 manual pages and 3 weapon parts while in Patrol in The Plaguelands area. 10 Manual Pages for Khvostov 7G-OX - These are dropped by killing Fallen enemies within Patrol, so kill everything you come across and they'll drop from time to time. For some players this step was rather quick, with a steady stream of drops, but for us it took a while. We also had more success when not doing patrols, but you can do other things at the same time - we had two drop in a single Acheon's Forge session, for example. In short, you can get most of these pages while getting weapon parts, then just stay in Patrol until you're done. 3 Weapon Parts for Khvostov 7G-OX - These three weapon parts are found in specific places. Start The Plaguelands, and make your way back to the Rocketyards, which will act as your starting point. From here, you want to go to the Refinary, and essentially take the route the Devil's Lair Strike takes you on. Two of the three Weapon Parts are on this route: 1. One is located in the room after you face waves of enemies as your Ghost opens the door, on the right side in the corner. The first Weapon Part in the 'We Found a Rifle' Quest. Please ignore the photobombing dancer. 2. The next is in The Blast, the vast area where you face the Walker, outside in the centre of the map, against the purple pipe. The second Weapon Part is outside near where you fight the Walker in the Devil's Lair Strike. 3. For the third Weapon Part, go back to the Rocketyard, and head in the other direction so you go to The Divide. Instead of going left to The Breach, go right to Dock 13 (as if you are going to where you spawn into the Cosmodrome in the original Patrol). After the large room with enemies, the Weapon Part is under the stairs. Check under the stairs in Dock 13 for this third Weapon Part. Once you have 10 manual pages and 3 weapon parts, return to the Iron Temple to get a mission that'll finish off the Quest. Completing the Khvostov Quest 'We Found a Rifle' in Destiny: Rise of Iron This final A Khvostov Rising mission is home to a particularly tough boss encounter. Make sure you're a decent level (our article on how to reach Light level 400 can help) and come equipped with something that can take down a Void shield and do strong follow-up damage. If possible, team up with one or two other players too. Start the mission, use your Ghost on the scan point then head outside to meet Kaviss. As mentioned, he's pretty tough, so take his shield down with a Void Heavy or Super, then follow it up with more rapid damage. When his health is low enough, he'll retreat. Go to The Breach where you'll encounter a path of SIVA clouds through the tunnels, and be wary of the trip mines along the way. When you reach the wide, snow-filled area, head to the far end upper walkway to start another battle with the Captain. Kaviss is pretty tough, so make sure you have a powerful Void attack to knock out his shield. Again, same rules apply as before - use a Void Heavy or Super to quickly drop his shield then follow up with the opposite or some more to get in some damage. The problem here is the amount of surrounding enemies; the two things you mainly have to watch out for are the Servitors on the walkways (a few sniper shots will drop them) and the dropships that occasionally appear. Wait until the dropships disappear before coming out into the open (we had to 'approach' them to make them move one time, so consider that if they aren't budging) and try and clear as many regular enemies as you can. Then, when the coast is mostly clear, go in with a Super / Heavy combo to drop a chunk of the Captain's health, then retreat and repeat the process. It's a tough battle solo, and no doubt will be easier with a few of you, so consider grouping up if you can.

Then read our Wrath of the Machine walkthrough and guides, complete list of all Dormant SIVA Cluster locations, Rise of Iron Artifacts, tips on how to reach Destiny's max Light level and how to complete the Exotic Gjallarhorn Quest, Khvostov 7G-OX Quest and Thorn Quest. Once Kaviss is downed, he'll immediately drop the Khvostov 7G-OX as an Engram, which you can equip straight away. We're not done with the mission just yet though; make your way onward to beyond the wall, where you started the game and the new Ketch ship is, and clear out all the Fallen along the way. Once you've taken out all the enemies on the ship, your Ghost will want to have a chat with you while admiring the view. Once you've done the cutscene, head back to the Tower, and chat to Shiro-4 to complete the Quest.

Maintaining cover: A guide to business insurance Let's have a meeting in the echo chamber Download Current Issue Scale Computing Scale Computing announced that Johan Pellicaan has joined as managing director for EMEA. He will focus on expanding the company’s channel presence across the region. Pellicaan has over 30 years’ experience in technology sales and product management, with more than ten in channel focused roles. He comes to the company from Springpath where he was responsible for driving their hyperconverged EMEA regional strategy. Prior to Springpath, he was an executive at Seagate, Microsoft and ProClarity. “Scale has an extremely interesting proposition for small and medium sized businesses,” said Pellicaan. “It’s ‘data centre in a box’ enables businesses to reap tremendous cost savings whilst delivering the simplicity and ease of use that hyperconvergence can. With such an exciting product offering in a rapidly growing market, I am looking forward to using my experience to build good professional values across EMEA and establish solid distribution channels”. FireMon FireMon has announced the appointment of Satin Mirchandani as its new president & CEO. Mirchandani said that he will focus on branching out into major regions beyond the UK, as well as building on the company’s commitment to channel partners. “My first enterprise software experience was with a company that focused on the IT channel (VARs, distributors) – I learned the unique value of a trusted advisor who is a domain expert,” Mirchandani continued. “For many customers—and, in security specifically —the channel is simply irreplaceable.  FireMon is fortunate to have partnered with the best of the best.  As such, I intend to continue investing heavily in the education, enablement and growth of our channel partners.” Tech Data Tech Data has appointed Tom Baker as its first business development manager for Google in Education. Baker will be working with partners to raise awareness and increase penetration of Chrome-based devices across the sector. “I’ve done a lot of work with education partners already but in this new role I’ll be able to concentrate all my efforts on supporting resellers that have a specific focus and on schools and driving penetration of Chrome devices,” Baker said. “I feel that we can make a positive difference – for schools and for partners – by raising awareness of Chromebooks and demonstrating just how effective they are in educational settings." Cloud Industry Forum The Cloud Industry Forum (CIF) has announced the appointment of Frank Bennett as deputy chair. Bennett will work alongside CIF’s chairman, Richard Sykes. He has been involved with a number of vendors known to the channel, including Microsoft, Google, IBM, Avaya, Verizon, Intel, Avnet and VMware.  “The role that CIF plays in the industry is more important than ever,” Bennett commented. “Cloud adoption is rapidly accelerating and businesses are migrating more and more workloads and in some cases their entire IT estate and are achieving truly transformative changes as a result.” “More substantive migrations imply more complexity and potentially associated risk, so the guidance and education that CIF can provide to support that change is critical. I’m therefore delighted to assume the role of CIF’s deputy chair and look forward to working closely with the rest of the team to build a strong community of industry partners and Professional CIF Membership to deliver on the promise of cloud computing."
