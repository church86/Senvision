X Karlin Lillington: After 25 years, Linux’s world domination is coming along nicely Back in the 1990s, it was a major surprise when Intel and Netscape invested in the OS Thu, Aug 25, 2016, 05:05 Karlin Lillington Co-founders of Red Hat Robert Young (left) and Marc Ewing in 1998. Photograph: Candice C Cusic/AP         In 1998, while out in California, I received a press notification for what looked to be an unusually compelling panel at an annual conference of internet service providers (be still, my geek heart) in San Jose. The chief executive of Red Hat, a little company offering a supported version of the operating system Linux, was to make an announcement. Also on the panel were a top executive from Intel and one from Netscape, internet pioneer Marc Andreessen’s company which, at the time, offered the most popular internet browser. The panel would also include the Finn Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, which turns a mature 25 this month. Torvalds was, and remains, a geek superstar guaranteed to draw adulatory crowds of programmers and system administrators. He was not a person one expected to see seated in an on-stage semi-circle with companies such as Intel and Netscape. I signed up for a press pass immediately. I’d actually have gone along just to see Torvalds. I liked his dry sense of humour, which included his semi-joking advocacy of, as his trademark quip went, the eventual “total world domination” of his namesake operating system (OS). But looking at that panel, anyone with a news sense could sniff something else was going to be in the air besides geek chat. This curious line-up must have a purpose. And, of course, it did: a truly groundbreaking moment for Linux. Here’s what I wrote at the time. “Intel and Netscape announced they had taken an equity stake in the tiny North Carolina company Red Hat. That means that Red Hat now will get access to the same advance information on Intel’s upcoming chip technologies as Microsoft. It means two of the biggest tech heavyweights are backing Linux as an OS for the corporate market. The entry for Linux is the server market for internet and intranet applications – the kind of applications Netscape makes, while high-end chips for servers are what Intel most likes to sell. ADVERTISEMENT “All in all, an interesting little marriage.” Renegade Given the surreptitious, renegade rise and rise of Linux, it was an extraordinary breakthrough. Linux was, at the time, the dirty little secret at many of the largest companies in the world. Many sysadmins down in the basement rooms of Fortune 500 companies were running internal networks, and those newfangled websites every company was then getting, on Linux, often without anyone in the executive suite being aware of it. That’s because the C-suite would likely have freaked out. Linux didn’t come from a big company with sales representatives, support teams and liability insurance. Oh no. It was an open source OS and distributed under the GPL (General Public License) meaning all its code was public and could be worked on, debugged and improved by anyone. If someone using Linux had a problem, they could post about it in various forums, and others would step in and help. For free. By 1998, thousands of programmers all over the world had contributed to the kernel – the core code – of Linux. it was considered more stable, reliable and – in that special term of admiration used by coders – elegant than other options, such as Windows. By 1998, too, a few big tech-oriented organisations were revealing that they happily relied on Linux: Nasa, for example, and the stars of the rising young computer-special-effects industry. Notably, the movie Titanic’s special effects were powered by Linux. Red Hat was one of several small new companies building a business by offering a branded “distribution” of Linux and offering formal technical support. Now, here on stage, were two big companies – one in computing, one in the new internet sector – saying they’d invested in Red Hat. Shortly afterwards, in 2000, technology behemoth IBM surprised many by announcing a Linux strategy, a sure sign of Linux going into the corporate mainstream. Not everyone who loved Linux and open-source software was thrilled. Much debate ensued – and continues in this strongly opinionated, passionate community – over whether the OS might become too commercialised or start to “fork” (as the term goes) into too many sub-versions or even proprietary versions. Success Yet what a success Linux has become. A well-regarded 2008 Linux Foundation study valued the Linux kernel at $1.4 billion and estimated it would cost nearly $11 billion to develop the Fedora Linux distribution from scratch. Its whole ecosystem was valued at $25 billion. These days, Linux distributions (and related open-source software) are widely used across the globe. Linux is ubiquitous in the corporate world. The C-suite doesn’t panic. Thinking back to when I sat in that audience in 1998, I definitely was excited about the announcement and where things might go. But, especially in that overwhelmingly Windows-dominated time, I sure didn’t imagine Linux would be as mainstream as it is today. So now, as Linux turns 25, here’s a tip of the hat (red or otherwise) to the mighty little OS’s power, appeal and durability. In other words, its total world domination.       Topics: Linus Torvalds Marc Andreessen Linux Foundation Nasa IBM Intel Microsoft Netscape Red Hat California San Jose Read More Donald Trump’s team reveals surprising lack of global business knowledge Election exemplified web’s slide into sleaze and belligerence Court challenge to Privacy Shield will have wide reverberations Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Financial Services 1:10 First-time buyer deposits cut to 10% as Central Bank eases mortgage rules Technology Clever cube makes for easier shared viewing English Soccer Ex-England player David White reveals sexual abuse by coach Business Pharmacist taking skincare back to its natural source Sponsored A bank-beating foreign exchange proposition How ‘nudge theory’ can improve pension provision Black Friday: what is it and how to prepare for it Send an AdMailer Christmas card and help a homeless charity ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

By: Steven Bassiri | VR in Displays & Projectors | Posted: Aug 25, 2016 11:03 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Page 1 [Project Alloy and Windows Holographic] Page 1 [Project Alloy and Windows Holographic] Page 2 [WiGig / Thunderbolt 3] Page 3 [USB PD 3.0, Audio, and Display] Page 4 [Will the iGP be Important Again?] Project Alloy and Windows Holographic     Last week at the Intel Developer Forum (IDF 2016) in San Fransico, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich unveiled Intel's vision for the future of virtual and augmented reality; merged reality (MR). Virtual reality is, of course, a buzz word, but Intel's dedication to the VR/AR scene can't be overlooked. Throughout IDF 2016, multiple new and cutting edge technologies were displayed; half the time I couldn't help but realize that they are all small pieces to a much bigger puzzle.       I saw Intel's Project Alloy, which takes multiple technologies (some Intel) and merges them into a groundbreaking piece of hardware. The headset is totally self-contained with an array of RealSense cameras, battery pack, and even a 6th generation processor for onboard computing. It should come out in 2017.     Don't get the wrong idea; Intel isn't saying the upcoming future of VR is only wireless headsets, but instead they have broken up headsets into mainstream and enthusiast segments. If you think about it, we already have many wireless and totally contained VR headsets in the form of the Galaxy VR and other smartphone-based VR headsets. Intel would consider Project Alloy as a much more powerful headset that offers more versatility and horsepower than current offerings, and I think we would consider it a mainstream VR headset.     We were also teased by Windows Holographic. Over the past year, Microsoft has been touting its augmented reality HoloLens, which looks to change the way we interact with reality. Windows 10 will bring an update that includes Windows Holographic sometime next year.   Windows Holographic will offer desktop applications that we can touch and interact with in 3D. There are limitless uses for such software, but bringing it to the masses through Windows 10 will push the PC market forward.

Read more about the stories in today's news: Apple iPhone 6, 6 Plus Suffer From 'Touch Disease' Intel, Nvidia Trading Shots Over AI, Deep Learning Microsoft: 60 Percent of U.S. Teens Keep Secret Online Accounts Lenovo to Preinstall Microsoft Apps on Android Devices       Today's topics include iFixit's report of a widespread glitch affecting Apple iPhone 6 and 6 Plus touch-screens, the rivalry between Intel and Nvidia in the AI sector, a Microsoft-commissioned study that found that 60 percent of American teens have online accounts their parents do not know about and the deal that will allow Lenovo to preinstall Microsoft Apps on Android devices. Electronics repair website iFixit is reporting a widespread problem with Apple's iPhone 6 and, particularly, iPhone 6 Plus smartphones that repair advocates have dubbed "Touch Disease." A gray bar appears across the top of the phones' displays and the screens' performances gradually decline before users lose touch functionality completely. "What started as an unfortunate trend, now seems to be growing into an epidemic," reports iFixit's Julia Bluff, who interviewed a handful of independent electronics repair experts and micro-soldering specialists. According to Bluff, while the issue appears to be touch-screen-related, it actually comes down to two touch-screen controller chips, or Touch ICs, on the logic board. The problem is apparently caused after the relatively thin handsets bend and twist when users put them in their back pockets and then sit, lean or bend over. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are opening up another front in the sprawling competition between Intel and Nvidia that has stretched from the data center and high-performance computing environments to autonomous vehicles. Both chip makers see the nascent artificial intelligence space—and the machine learning technology that helps enable it—as key growth areas. Each sees the other as primary competitors. As Intel executives at the Intel Developer Forum last week unveiled a range of moves the company is making to address the needs in the emerging market, Nvidia officials fired off a post on the vendor's blog questioning some of the benchmark numbers Intel was using comparing its many-core Xeon Phi processors to Nvidia's GPU. Microsoft today released the findings of a new study conducted on behalf of the company by the National Cyber Security Alliance. After surveying 804 American teens, aged 13 to 17, and 810 parents of teens of those ages, Microsoft and the NCSA found that when it comes to online safety, teens and their parents aren't quite on the same page. Sixty percent of the teens admitted that they had created an an online account their parents don't know about in order to use an app, social media site or other online service. Only 13 percent said their parents were "completely aware" of their online activities. Parents, on the other hand, said they were "neutral" in terms of awareness about their kids' online activities. A mere 3 percent claimed they knew everything their children did online. Android keeps paying off for Microsoft and now a patent licensing pact between the Redmond, Wash., software giant and Lenovo is another step in that direction. The deal, announced on Aug. 23, includes a cross-licensing agreement covering Motorola devices as well as those carrying the Lenovo brand. In addition, Lenovo has agreed to ship Android mobile devices preloaded with Microsoft Office, OneDrive and Skype. Lenovo acquired Motorola Mobility from Google in 2014 in a transaction valued at $2.91 billion. Christian Eigen, head of corporate alliances at Lenovo, said in prepared remarks that the deal offers "new opportunities for our customers to take advantage of some of Microsoft's most popular apps" and offers additional value to the company's customers worldwide.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

They’ve brought us mobile apps for businesses that make processes easier to handle. We have entertainment systems that transport us into virtual worlds. We can talk to a machine and have them perform basic functions around the house. The technology we have at our disposal will never cease to amaze. Intel is looking to take things one step further with a new chip module called Joule that’s helping to improve the stretch of gadget intelligence. This chip is just a tiny board for developers to use to bring computer vision technology into their own prototypes. The hope is that this new concept will allow developers to make products more affordable and bring them to the market more quickly. Overall, Intel is hopeful that the device will accelerate automation in every capacity. The chip was revealed in an onstage demo at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco in the shape of smart glasses made by PivotHead. The glasses themselves were a standard pair of industrial safety glasses. There was nothing remarkable about what they did. They were simply a catalyst for Joule, which performed volt verification on a piece of aircraft in real time. The chip is a small rectangle, barely taller than a postage stamp and shorter than a stick of gum. So far, there’s only been an onstage demonstration and some brief information on the website to describe the innovation. More information will come with the product’s official release. What’s most amazing about this technology is that it has no need for wires, Wi-Fi, or a Bluetooth connection in order to analyze and compute data. You don’t need a smartphone app to track things or evaluate the information, though a screen is necessary for display. Joule can handle all the processing within the chip, giving constant power, even when there’s poor connectivity. Joule will be available in two different kits. The first will be the 550x, including a 1.5GHz quad-core Atom T5500 processor, 3GB of RAM and 8GB of storage. The other will be slightly more powerful, called the 570x. The specs: 1.7GHz quad-core Atom T5700 CPU (with burst speeds up to 2.4GHz), 4GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. To display the information collected in the chip, both models have a “laptop class” 802.11AC wireless, Intel graphics with 4K capture and display support, and a Linux-based OS. The kits and accessories will be available for purchase on sites like Newegg. With some luck, Intel will have authorized sale of the devices in more than 100 countries before 2016 closes. Intel’s main priority now is to ground themselves in the next wave of computer devices. And on its end, Joule will be primarily used in a manufacturing and development setting, helping to develop products and services at a faster, more affordable rate. Intel’s Diana Shea uses glasses that include the Joule maker board. Additionally, AR, VR, and AI technologies are beginning to emerge with real force, though they were considered “too advanced” a few years ago. Joule could be used to develop software like augmented reality glasses, VR headsets, drones, and robots. If Intel’s chip is the foundation of these devices, they’ll become leaders in the market and remain competitive in the advanced technology sector. Microsoft has already jumped on the opportunity to use Joule in its robotic companion Bamboo, the friendly device that helps kids remember to check their blood sugar. Other tech companies have also been eying the chip for use in a variety of devices, which shows that Intel has already made a good start in defining their role in the AI industry.

Unlike other efforts to automatically defer harassment, this one is smarter. It doesn’t just speak English, it speaks Web. Bastidas educated the algorithm using comments from websites like the NY Times and the Wall Street Journal. For the worst examples, he scanned the darker corners of Reddit. While his work is not quite ready for public use just yet, it’s the first to sprout out of Hack Harassment, an Intel-backed movement to create tools and platforms against online abuse.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Intel 600P Series SSDs bring NVMe into the M.2 mainstream by Jeff Kampman  2:22 PM on August 25, 2016 Intel is pushing NVMe SSDs further into the mainstream today with its SSD 600P Series drives. These M.2 gumsticks use the same Intel-Micron 3D TLC NAND that we're starting to see in more and more SSDs of late. That NAND lets Intel deliver these drives at prices similar to that of high-end SATA storage while offering sequential read speeds far beyond what any SATA drive can achieve. Here's the full SSD 600P lineup: Intel SSD 600P series Capacity Sequential read (MB/s) Sequential write (MB/s) Random read (IOPS) Random write (IOPS) Suggested price 128 GB 770 450 35K 91K $69.00 256GB 1570 540 71K 112K $104.00 512GB 1775 560 128.5K 128K $189.00 1024GB 1800 560 155K 128K $359.00 At costs per gigabyte ranging from 53 cents for the 128GB drive to just 35 cents for the 1TB model, these drives are among the most competitively-priced NVMe SSDs we've seen so far. Samsung's 950 Pro posts much better random and sequential speeds across the board, but the $189.99 price tag on the 256GB version works out to a nosebleed-inducing 74 cents per gig, while the $318.99 512GB model demands a somewhat less insane 62 cents per gig. Even if the Samsung drives have better performance on paper, our reviews have found that real-world performance isn't significantly affected by these figures. By giving system builders and OEMs a more affordable NVMe option, Intel could help to advance the adoption of PCIe storage in a wide range of desktops and laptops. The 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB 600P drives will be available next week, while the 1TB drive and an upcoming 360GB model will arrive in the fourth quarter of this year.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Intel's SSD P3520 has 3D NAND chips and is targeted at enterprises. Credit: Intel More like this AMD gets back into SSDs with value Radeon R3 drives Toshiba's new SSD line features rock-bottom pricing Samsung’s massive 15TB SSD can be yours -- for about $10K Video SanDisk crams 200GB onto MicroSD Intel is expanding its lineup of SSDs with its 3D NAND chips with more affordable consumer and enterprise drives. The 3D NAND chips have a structure that makes SSDs durable and fast but was only available in a handful of drives. The new SSDs support the NVMe protocol, which offers faster throughput than the SATA controller originally designed for hard drives. The new SSDs include entry-level consumer drives starting under US$100. Gamers may want to wait, however, until Intel releases its crazy-fast Optane SSDs, which the chip maker claims will be up to 10 times faster than regular SSDs. The consumer SSD 600p series for PCs starts at $69 for a 128GB drive and ranges to $359 for a 1TB drive. The SSD Pro 6000p for business laptops is slightly more expensive at $79 for a 128GB drive and up to $364 for the 1TB drive. The PC SSDs plug into m.2 slots and have similar speeds but differ on features. The SSD Pro 6000p has enterprise features like remote erase, where the disk can be wiped remotely. It also has fine-grained power management features not available with the 600p. Those features work with Intel's Core vPro processors, allowing system administrators to take control of remote PCs. The drives have sequential read speeds of 1,800 megabytes (MBps) per second and write speeds of 560MBps. They have random read speeds of 155,000 IOPS (input-output per second) and write speeds of 128,000 IOPS. On all counts, the 600p series is significantly faster than Intel's SSD 540s, which came out earlier this year. Intel's new drives also include the enterprise SSD DC P3520 series, which has storage capacities from 450GB ($294) to 2TB ($984). The SSDs plug into 2.5-inch and standard PCI-Express 3.0 slots. The 2TB drive is the fastest in the series, with random sequential read speeds of 1,700MBps and write speeds of 1,350MBps. The random read speeds are 375,000 IOPs and write speeds are 26,000 IOPS. Those speeds beat Samsung's 1.92TB PM953 enterprise SSD based on NVMe, which has a sequential read speed of 1,000MBps, write speed of 870MBps, and a random read speed of 240,000 IOPS and write speed of 19,000 IOPS. Another Intel SSD for data centers called the SSD DC S3520 Series "is ideal for those making the initial transition to SATA SSDs from hard drives," an Intel spokesperson said in an email. They come in capacities from 150GB ($89) to 1.6TB ($739). The drive comes in m.2 and 2.5-inch slot formats. The SSD DC S3520 is a kind of cache where data is stored temporarily while being processed by computers. It is used to boot systems, serve up commonly used applications or data over the internet, or to store database or analytics data being processed. It's not meant for long-term storage, and has low power-consumption and read and write speeds, making it more appropriate for storage arrays.

By: Steven Bassiri | Standard Laptops in Laptops | Posted: Aug 25, 2016 5:15 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA TweakTown Rating: 92%Manufacturer: Lenovo Page 1 [Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing] Page 1 [Introduction, Specifications, and Pricing] Page 2 [Physical Overview] Page 3 [Physical Overview Continued] Page 4 [Software and BIOS] Page 5 [System Performance Benchmarks] Page 6 [Gaming Performance Benchmarks] Page 7 [System IO and Battery Performance] Page 8 [Thermal Performance] Page 9 [What's Hot, What's Not & Final Thoughts] Introduction     With the launch of Intel's Skylake microarchitecture came two new types of mobile processors. Intel introduced its first mobile Xeon processor and its first overclockable processor. Today we look at one of Lenovo's ThinkPads using Intel's latest 6th generation mobile Xeon workstation processor, the E3-1505M v5. There are a few advantages that Xeon processors have over their Core series counterparts, but the two most important are ECC memory and vPro support.     Mobile workstations are designed for professionals, and in the case of the ThinkPad P70, we are talking about content creation professionals. On the display capabilities of the ThinkPad P70, it has multiple display panel options ranging from a 1080p panel with touch to a 4K along with a Pantone Colorimeter sensor for automatic panel color calibration. The notebook also offers a few of NVIDIA's mobile workstation graphics processors, in our case the Quadro M4000M. Together with smart PCB and case design, Lenovo hopes to provide a very high-end mobile workstation. Let's see how they did.     Specifications     The ThinkPad P70 we have today uses a Xeon E3-1505M v5 mobile processor with 4/8 cores/threads with a 2.8GHz base clock and 3.7GHz Turbo. The CPU has a TDP of 45W, which can be reduced depending on the vendor's implementation. It supports 64GB of RAM, our model came with 16GB of ECC enabled RAM. The CPU fully supports ECC memory and vPro. If a vendor decides to use Intel's latest mobile Xeon processors, they are also required to implement ThunderBolt 3, and Lenovo supplies two type-C USB 3.1/Thunderbolt 3 ports. Our unit also uses a NVIDIA Quadro M4000M to drive a 4K UHD IPS 300 nits monitor and comes with an X-Rite Pantone Color Calibrator. You can also have the unit include a WWAN 4G LTE-A card for on the go internet connectivity.     At 16.4"x10.8"x1.17-12" (WxDxH), the ThinkPad P70 isn't the smallest or slimmest notebook, but it is very powerful. It weighs 7.56 lbs (3.43 kg), which makes it quite heavy. The notebook does come with a wired Intel RJ-45 1Gbit NIC, as well as an Intel 8260 2x2 Wireless AC/Bluetooth 4.1 wireless networking card.     Pricing   The ThinkPad P70 comes in a wide variety of configurations ranging from $1550-3000+. Our model costs roughly $3000. Next Page Shopping Information PRICING: You can find products similar to this one for sale below.

At IDF, PCs Take a Back Seat to Drones, VR, AI, Driverless Cars This year's Intel Developer Forum had a decidedly different flavor to it—with fewer PCs but more drones, cars and other connected devices on display. Virtual Reality in the Real World Krzanich introduced Project Alloy, a push to create an entirely self-contained virtual reality (VR) headset that doesn't need exterior sensors or to be tethered via a wire to a PC. All the compute, graphics, batteries and modules, as well as technologies like RealSense, are contained in the headset. Project Alloy Takes Center Stage Krzanich, left, and Intel's Craig Raymond show the VR headset. It's part of what Krzanich called "merged reality," or the ability to bring physical objects into the virtual world, and vice versa. The demonstration showed Raymond viewing a virtual world through a headset, being able to see his hands and other physical objects, and manipulating the environment using those objects. Microsoft and Intel Put Focus on VR Terry Myerson, right, executive vice president of Microsoft's Windows and Devices Group, said the software maker will update Windows 10 to enable the company's Windows Holographic software that runs on its HoloLens to also run on the Alloy headsets. In December, the companies will announce a spec for VR headsets like Alloy and Microsoft's HoloLens, and next year, Intel will open-source the Alloy hardware. The Music of Merged Reality Before Krzanich took the stage, musicians—such as this drummer—played music using Intel's VR headset and software, with drums that could be seen and played via the headset but were not physically in front of the musician. Intel Takes to the Air Krzanich continued what has become standard at Intel events by showing off drones that use such Intel products as processors and RealSense 3D camera technology. Here the CEO shows off an Aero Ready to Fly drone, a fully assembled quadcopter on which developers can launch their applications. Intel Drones On Intel's Jeff Lo demonstrates a ready-to-fly drone that uses the company's Aero Compute Board and RealSense technology, which can be used to help the system navigate environments and avoid collisions. Intel Also Stays on the Ground Autonomous cars continue to be a key focus for most chip makers, including Intel, which recently announced a partnership with BMW and Mobileye to get self-driving BMW vehicles on the road by 2021. At IDF, Intel officials said the company is building its own fleet of autonomous cars, and put two test vehicles on display. Behind the Wheel of a Self-Driving Car Software will be crucial to the development and performance of autonomous cars. Here, an IDF attendee tries out a natural human-machine interface (HMI) prototype platform for self-driving cars. It's Fun to Play With the FPGA Intel last year paid $16.7 billion to acquire Altera and its programmable chip technology. At IDF, Krzanich and other officials stressed the importance of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) in the fast-growing digital world. Here the CEO shows off an Intel-branded 14-nanometer Stratix 10 FPGA during the inaugural Intel SoC (system-on-a-chip) FPGA Developer Forum, run in conjunction with IDF. The Power and Energy of Joule Intel introduced a chip module called Joule, a tiny board with sensors based on RealSense, that will make it easier for developers to create prototypes of devices that include computer vision capabilities. It complements other such Intel development boards like Edison, Galileo and Curie. Here Krzanich displays a Joule board. Joule in Action At IDF, there were numerous devices on display that use the Joule development board, such as safety glasses and small robots with computer vision. Here, a user looks through a helmet heads-up display by EyeLights powered by Joule. Intel Bringing Silicon Photonics to Data Centers Diane Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of Intel's Data Center Group, announced that after 16 years of development, the company was ready to bring silicon photonics products to market later this year. The technology will address the demand by cloud service providers for more network bandwidth, better scalability and faster connectivity. Keeping an Eye on 5G Venkata "Murthy" Renduchintala, president of Intel's Client and IoT Businesses and Systems Architecture Group, told IDF attendees that a key part of the vendor's IoT strategy is focusing on the development and deployment of 5G, the upcoming next-generation wireless broadband technology that promises to deliver speeds 10 to 100 times faster than average 4G LTE connections today. Many Cores and AI Artificial intelligence and machine learning is fast becoming another highly competitive field for chip makers. At IDF, Intel's Bryant said that next year, the company will introduce "Knights Mill"—a derivative of Intel's current many-core Xeon Phi "Knights Landing" chip that will compete with Nvidia's GPUs in machine learning tasks.

Essentially, the company wants the billions of connected devices that will make up the IoT to run on Intel technology, and for its products to drive the systems that connect them to the cloud. "We are transforming into the company that is powering the cloud, connecting smart devices and making new experiences possible based on all that today," Intel CEO Brian Krzanich told the more than 6,000 people who traveled to San Francisco last week for the annual Intel Developer Forum (IDF). In the past, the show had been packed with new PCs and servers powered by the company's latest and greater processors. However, this year's IDF had a decidedly different vibe to it, with fewer PCs on display and more drones, cars and other connected devices on the floor. This slide show takes a look at some of the highlights from this year's IDF.

The new models use a mix of 3D MLC and 3D TLC, some SATA and some PCIe, and variously target the consumer, business, embedded and data center markets. While we are still awaiting details on the timing of these product releases, it is clear that Intel is eager to put planar flash behind them. The drive for this is especially strong as the models being replaced are all either based on Intel's relatively expensive 20nm flash or on 16nm flash that Intel had to buy on the open market due to their decision to not participate in the 16nm node at IMFT. Product Series Market Interface 3D NAND SSD 600p Consumer Client M.2 PCIe 3 x4 TLC SSD Pro 6000p Business Client M.2 PCIe 3 x4 TLC SSD E 6000p Embedded, IoT M.2 PCIe 3 x4 TLC SSD E 5420s Embedded, IoT 2.5" and M.2 SATA MLC SSD DC S3520 Data Center 2.5" and M.2 SATA MLC SSD DC P3520 Data Center U.2 and PCIe x4 HHHL MLC First up, we have a M.2 PCIe SSD branded three different ways for three different markets. In the consumer market we have the SSD 600p series, while the business market will get the Pro 6000p series. The specs released so far differ only in mentioning that the Pro 6000p series will be supported by the remote secure erase feature of Intel's Active Management Technology. The third variant—for the embedded and Internet of Things market—will only get the two smallest capacities, which gives us a look at how this design will perform with the limited parallelism that results from using IMFT's high-capacity 384Gb 3D TLC die. Intel Client and Embedded PCIe SSDs Model Pro 6000p 600p E 6000p 750 Capacity 128GB, 256GB, 360GB, 512GB, 1024GB 256GB 128GB 400GB, 800GB, 1.2TB NAND IMFT 32-layer 3D TLC IMFT 20nm MLC Interface M.2 2280 PCIe 3 x4 (single-sided) U.2 or PCIe 3 x4 HHHL Sequential Read up to 1800 MB/s 1570 MB/s 770 MB/s up to 2500 MB/s Sequential Write up to 560 MB/s 540 MB/s 450 MB/s up to 1200 MB/s 4kB Random Read up to 155k IOPS 71k IOPS 35k IOPS up to 460k IOPS 4kB Random Write up to 128k IOPS 112k IOPS 91.5k IOPS up to 290k IOPS Idle Power 10mW 4W Warranty 5 years 5 years The 600p and 6000p series are a much more mainstream design than Intel's previous NVMe SSD for the client market. The SSD 750 was a thinly-disguised enterprise drive, with power consumption and physical dimensions that are far too big for the M.2 form factor that has become the preferred choice for client PCIe storage. The SSD 750 was in many ways overkill from the start, and more recent M.2 drives (especially from Samsung) have caught up in peak performance to offer a much better value for typical client usage. The 600p will be going after the client PCIe storage market from the opposite end: as one of the first TLC PCIe SSDs, its performance specifications don't set any records but it will be a much more value-oriented product than any of the M.2 PCIe SSDs currently on the market. Intel has confirmed that the 600p and 6000p are using a third-party controller. UPDATE: Allyn Malventano at PC Perspective has uncovered a forum post with an uncensored picture of the 600p. The controller has "SMI" in big letters, suggesting that it is a Silicon Motion SM2260 or relative thereof, but with different markings than the samples Silicon Motion has been showing off at conventions. Intel has also used Silicon Motion controllers in drives like the 540s. SSD 600p In addition to the SSD E 6000p, there is a new series of SATA drives for the embedded market. The SSD E 5420s series consists of a 240GB 2.5" drive and a 150GB M.2 drive, both with 3D MLC and full power loss protection. The E 5420s is rated for one drive write per day, a substantial improvement over the 0.3 DWPD rating of the E 5410s or the 20GB/day of the E 5400s. Intel Embedded/IoT SATA SSDs Model E 5420s E 5410s E 5400s Capacity 240GB 150GB 80GB, 120GB 48GB, 80GB, 120GB, 180GB NAND IMFT 32-layer 3D MLC 16nm MLC 16nm TLC Interface 2.5" SATA M.2 SATA 2.5" SATA 2.5" and M.2 SATA Sequential Read 320 MB/s 165 MB/s up to 475 MB/s up to 560 MB/s Sequential Write 300 MB/s 145 MB/s up to 135 MB/s up to 475 MB/s 4kB Random Read 65k IOPS 39k IOPS up to 68k IOPS up to 71k IOPS 4kB Random Write 16k IOPS 28k IOPS up to 84k IOPS up to 85k IOPS Warranty 5 years 5 years 5 years SSD E 5420s Moving on to the data center products, the SSD DC S3520 is a new mid-range enterprise SATA SSD for read-oriented workloads and the third iteration of the S3500 series. The M.2 form factor has returned as an option after the DC S3510 series was only offered in the 2.5" form factor. As with the SATA drives for the embedded market, performance has decreased but endurance has been bumped up from 0.3 DWPD to 1 DWPD. The larger per-die capacity of the 3D MLC has caused the smallest capacity option to increase from 80GB to 150GB, but 1.6TB is still the largest option for the 2.5" form factor. Intel Enterprise SATA SSDs Model DC S3520 DC S3510 Capacity 150GB, 240GB, 480GB, 800GB, 960GB, 1.2TB, 1.6TB 150GB, 240GB, 480GB, 760GB, 960GB 80GB, 120GB, 240GB, 480GB, 800GB, 1.2TB, 1.6TB NAND IMFT 32-layer 3D MLC 16nm MLC Interface 2.5" SATA M.2 SATA 2.5" SATA Sequential Read (up to) 450 MB/s 410 MB/s 500 MB/s Sequential Write (up to) 380 MB/s 320 MB/s 460 MB/s 4kB Random Read (up to) 67.5k IOPS 53k IOPS 68k IOPS 4kB Random Write (up to) 17k IOPS 14.4k IOPS 20k IOPS Endurance 1 DWPD 1 DWPD 0.3 DWPD Warranty 5 years 5 years 5 years SSD DC S3520 (UPDATED) Finally, for the enterprise PCIe space we have the SSD DC P3520. In March the DC P3320 was announced as Intel's first 3D NAND SSD and the P3520 was mentioned but specifications were not provided at that time. Intel has since decided to only produce the P3520 and to price it close to the level of SATA SSDs. The reduced performance relative to the DC P3500 is a consequence of reduced parallelism at the same capacity that results from using the 256Gb 3D MLC rather than 128Gb 20nm MLC, and the size of this performance regression is a bit dismaying. The DC P3520 is clearly based on the same hardware platform as the rest of the PCIe data center drives, with a familiar layout for the PCB and heatsink evident in the add-in card version. Intel Enterprise PCIe SSDs Model DC P3520 DC P3320 (canceled) DC P3500 Capacity 450GB (U.2 only), 1.2TB, 2TB 450GB (U.2 only), 1.2TB, 2TB 400GB, 1.2TB, 2TB NAND IMFT 32-layer 3D MLC IMFT 32-layer 3D MLC IMFT 20nm MLC Interface U.2 and PCIe 3 x4 HHHL U.2 and PCIe 3 x4 HHHL U.2 and PCIe 3 x4 HHHL Sequential Read (up to) 1700 MB/s 1600 MB/s 2700 MB/s Sequential Write (up to) 1350 MB/s 1400 MB/s 1800 MB/s 4kB Random Read (up to) 375k IOPS 365k IOPS 430k IOPS 4kB Random Write (up to) 26k IOPS 22k IOPS 28k IOPS 4kB Random 70/30 Read/Write (up to) 80k IOPS 65k IOPS 80k IOPS Warranty 5 years 5 years 5 years SSD DC P3520 U.2 These new SSDs will have a staggered release over the rest of the year. Starting next week the DC P3520 will be shipping, as well as the 128GB, 256GB and 512GB capacities of the SSD 600p and SSD Pro 6000p. The 2.5" DC S3520 will ship in early September. The rest are planned to be available in Q4. Source: Intel Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment. POST A COMMENT 49 Comments View All Comments zepi - Thursday, August 25, 2016 - link How come endurance is not mentioned for many of the products? Reply plopke - Thursday, August 25, 2016 - link Happens more and more , because of cache structures and aimed for regular consumers the worse case scenario would show underwhelming numbers. See SSD like sandisk Ultra II . I don't agree with it but sometimes you can only get review estimates. Reply Billy Tallis - Thursday, August 25, 2016 - link Intel only provided the product briefs prior to the announcement. The full spec sheets and ark.intel.com data aren't online yet. Reply JoeyJoJo123 - Thursday, August 25, 2016 - link And why is it that you care? Have you personally _ever_ lost any data due to an SSD's endurance being too poor? SSD endurance "mattering" is a meme. Reply Paul Tarnowski - Thursday, August 25, 2016 - link I did when an old OCZ refused to take anymore writes and just outputted a bunch of errors. I was able to recover most of the data, but it's the main reason I've stuck with Samsung for the last 3-4 years. Reply JoeyJoJo123 - Thursday, August 25, 2016 - link You essentially just proved my point: My point is that SSD endurance isn't a problem for modern SSDs, in this case, we're talking about new 3D NAND SSD offerings branded by Intel. By your omission, the SSD which "refused to take anymore writes" is an OCZ SSD (widely reputed to be an awful distributor of SSDs ~5 years ago, declared bankruptcy in 2013, and they then got bought out by Toshiba), and as a result you've stuck with Samsung for the last 3-4 years. Therefore, you bought an OCZ SSD back when they had lots of quality issues prior to their bankruptcy (older than the last 3-4 years), experienced one of these quality issues, and have stuck with Samsung drives since then, with presumably no issues. Secondly, SSD endurance is typically measured in full drive writes per day (DWPD), and typical consumer usage of SSDs would be hard pressed to even have a single full drive full of write operations over the span of an entire month. Thirdly, even beyond the normal spec of DWPD, most drives have specs that far underestimate their current capabilities of endurance. NAND flash on even TLC drives lasted over a PetaByte each (hammered by mixed I/O workloads 24/7 for over year) for some drives in TechPowerUp's SSD Endurance Test articles, far beyond any warranty and kept working until the SSDs eventually bricked themselves. http://techreport.com/review/27909/the-ssd-enduran... To be blunt, you could be dumb about wasting endurance by scheduling 3 completely unnecessary (and stupid) defragmentations to your SSD every day, and I'd be willing to bet that the SSD would still be fine after 5 years. These days, typical consumers with typical consumer workloads shouldn't give a squat about SSD endurance metrics, as the SSD is far more likely to outlast its useful lifespan. 5 years from now, you won't care about a 128GB SATA 3 SSD bootdrive, as 512GB SSDs that are faster will be available for cheap, and who knows if manufacturers will still be bothering to include SATA 3 ports on motherboards 10 years from now. SATA is going the way of the IDE port and will disappear soon enough, but chances are, SATA 3 SSDs will keep ticking along, regardless of any "endurance" metrics you may be concerned about. Reply Samus - Thursday, August 25, 2016 - link By no coincidence, the only SSD's I've ever seen "lock" themselves were Sandforce-based from OCZ (Vertex 2/3?) and ADATA (S510) which either lend to it being a bad firmware bug (most SF2281 firmware wasn't really stable until it was antiquated) or just two manufactures notorious for using shoddy binning practices. Most of the OCZ NAND should have ended up in USB flash drives, not performance SSD's. Reply FLHerne - Thursday, August 25, 2016 - link I wouldn't say it's *never* a problem - my two-year-old, 120GB SanDisk Ultra II is almost halfway to its rated write lifetime without any stupid workloads, and I don't expect to replace it for any other reason before it reaches that. Afterwards, well, I'll have to see how it behaves. Hopefully the spec is an underestimate, as most tests seem to find. Reply mdw9604 - Tuesday, August 30, 2016 - link Endurance does matter. In the datacenter and enterprise world, only certain SSD's qualify for hard compatiabilty list's if they have certain DWPD's. Database applications and other applications that are write intensive can burn through a consumer rated SSD. Reply bug77 - Friday, August 26, 2016 - link Because endurance gets worse with every node shrink. 3D NAND mitigates some of that, but it's useful to have some numbers available.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing IBM details next-gen Power 9, will take the fight to Intel’s data center strongholds IBM details next-gen Power 9, will take the fight to Intel’s data center strongholds By Joel Hruska on August 25, 2016 at 7:30 am Comment The story of how Intel rose to dominance in the server and workstation markets was written more than a decade ago. Once upon a time (the late 1980s and early 1990s), various RISC, CISC, and SPARC architectures dominated the high-end PC industry, even as consumer PCs overwhelmingly opted for x86 designs. Intel leveraged both economies of scale and its alliance with Microsoft to push x86 processors into both data centers and workstations. By 2000, Intel had seized the majority of the market, forcing companies like IBM and Sun into smaller and smaller niches. Today, IBM wants to reverse that trend — and it thinks Power 9 is the chip to do it. The new cores will come in two flavors; a “scale-out” design meant for large HPC applications and supercomputers with support for four or more CPU sockets and a “scale-up” design with 1-2 sockets. Next Platform reports that there will be four flavors of Power 9 in total, varying in terms of total core count, direct-attached memory, the amount of simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) per-core, and support for various co-processors and other types of compute hardware (ASICS, FPGAs, and GPUs). Power 9 processors can be attached directly to various accelerators rather than communicating via the PCI Express bus. Some of the variants will also support IBM’s Centaur memory buffer technology to improve performance and implement an L4 cache. The Power 9 die. Power 9 CPUs will be built by GlobalFoundries on its 14nm process node and will be the first chips to implement Power ISA 3.0. This is the first version of the ISA to be released since IBM launched its OpenPOWER initiative and the first to support AltiVec 3 instructions. Like SSE or AVX, AltiVec is a single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instruction set, but how much additional performance it’ll deliver over its predecessor isn’t currently clear. Challenging Intel, ARM… and AMD? ARM, AMD, and IBM have all announced fresh challenges to Intel’s near-total dominance of the data center market in the past few weeks. Data centers aren’t just a lucrative market — they’re one of the only areas of computing that’s actually growing. The tablet market is shrinking, smartphone markets in the developing world are maturing rapidly, and the PC industry has been in free-fall for nearly five years. The growth of cloud computing and services like Google and Facebook means that selling to these customers has become essential to top-end server providers. Each company is making different moves to address these markets. AMD, of course, has Zen, its new architecture that it hopes will offer potent competition for its long-time rival. ARM added a flexible vector instruction set to boost performance in HPC workloads, and IBM is launching an all-new iteration of the Power architecture. Image by Next Platform “We started with a 64 bit compute building block and we coupled that with a 64 bit load store building block,” Brian Thompto, senior technical staff at IBM said in his Hot Chips presentation. “Each compute building block has a heterogeneous mix of compute, fixed and float, supporting scalar and vector. This allows us to obtain high utilization of our compute resources while also providing seamless exchange of data and shared data paths. It also serves as an efficient building block for managing instruction flow through the machine. We couple two of these 64 bit slices together to make a 128 bit superslice, and this is our physical design building block.” IBM’s new cores and their peripheral accelerators will be tied together by its custom on-chip fabric. L3 cache bandwidth is said to be 256GB/s, with support for PCI Express 4.0 (when that standard is available), multiple 25Gb/s “Bluelink” ports (these are used for the attached accelerators and for Nvidia’s NVLink 2.0 protocol). Aggregate bandwidth from all these sources is over 7TB/s, though the chip would rarely leverage all of these devices simultaneously. IBM claims that Power 9 will offer up to 2x the performance of Power 8 per socket — and it’s already courting at least one significant customer. Google has reportedly field-tested Power 8 and has said it would move to Power 9 if doing so would save it 20% power compared with using Intel hardware. Betting against Intel in this space is risky — the CPU giant is well aware of how critical data centers are to its bottom line, and its more than willing to spend big bucks to defend its market share. At the same time, Intel’s near-total dominance of the market gives its competitors nowhere to go but up. If ARM, AMD, and IBM collectively took 15% of the market away from Intel over the next few years it would be a significant achievement and revenue generator for each — and a significant loss for Intel.

Malware is the term used to describe any virus created with the purpose of infecting a device to steal personal information or lock owners out. The South Korean hardware manufacturer claims the software has already protected millions of Galaxy owners from these dangers. Galaxy S6, S6 edge, S7 and S7 edge also have VirusScan software pre-installed. According to the latest Intel McAfee Lab Threats Report published in June, there are over 305 new malware viruses created a minute, equivalent to more than five every second. The total number of dangers has also steadily been on the rise in recent years. There were over 550 million viruses in Q1 2016, an year-on-year increase from 400 million. The same period in 2014 saw just 260 million recorded viruses. Intel Security corporate vice president John Giamatteo said: “Mobile threats continue to grow and be more sophisticated as we become increasingly connected. Now mobile devices are the tip of the spear for new hacking method. “Intel Security is combatting these growing mobile threats by collaborating with mobile device manufacturer Samsung to keep customer’s mobile devices, data and privacy safe from vulnerabilities.” Samsung Mobile security technology vice president Henry Lee added: “Security and privacy are at the core of what we do and what we think about every day. It is very important to provide a high level of protection at all times to our customers” The Note7 (£699.99) has been available for preorder from August 17, with general sale opening on September 2.

Miller August 24, 2016 10 Comments Memory was a big topic of discussion at last week's Intel Developer Forum, and I was interested to see both how faster memory is now becoming commonplace in clients and servers, and how new techniques are coming together to promote persistent memory. (Above: DRAM DDR Transition by Segment) Memory was a big topic of discussion at last week's Intel Developer Forum, and I was interested to see both how faster memory is now becoming commonplace in clients and servers, and how new techniques are coming together to promote persistent memory. Intel's Geof Finley discussed main memory, noting that all of Intel's major products now support DDR4 memory, with the Xeon E5-2600v4 family taking up to 2400 MHz memory and the 6th generation Core (Skylake) systems supporting up to 2133 MHz. He said nearly all of the server market was using DDR4 memory already, and most client systems are now moving to DDR4 memory, although notebooks tend to use low-power (LP) versions. Finley said this was the first time the server market has led the memory transition, and it has worked well. The next specification known as DDR5 is expected to come out of the standards body shortly, and may be ready to be announced next year, but will probably not be in mass production until 2018 or 2019, with the real ramp starting in 2020. Much of the discussion focused on storage class memory, http://forwardthinking.pcmag.com/hard-drives/346999-storage-class-memory-the-coming-revolution or persistent memory (as most of the speakers termed it), and in particular the 3D XPoint memory http://forwardthinking.pcmag.com/none/336469-intel-micron-s-3d-xpoint-memory-could-change-pc-server-design Intel will be using first in its Optane SSDs. Intel Fellow Frank Hady talked about the advantage of the new memory and discussed a variety of benchmarks where 3D XPoint memory has shown a speed improvement in desktop applications and improved throughput and latency in data center applications. A demo showed how creating a 7-second fluid dynamics simulation using a billion particles would take 35 hours on a Broadwell-E based system with an Intel 750 series SSD, but only 10 hours using an Optane SSD. (Memory – Optimized System Interconnect) In the long run, though, Hady pointed out that while the new memory provides huge advantages over SSD using the NVMe (non-volatile memory express) solution, there was still a lot of latency coming from the file system and stack, as they are designed to work with storage in blocks. Access to data in memory is much faster, so the next step will be to push 3D XPoint on DIMMs, not only because the memory bus is faster but also because of the software stack. Hady also talked about how Linux and Microsoft are optimizing their software to take better advantage of persistent memory. (Persistent Memory—Performance Comparison) In another talk, Microsoft's Neal Christiansen and Intel's Andy Rudoff talked about changes in Windows to better support and manage persistent memory, including a new driver model and new interfaces for managing it. There's a persistent memory block volume that treats persistent memory more like traditional software, and is also fully compatible with the existing applications and features, though it offers a huge speed-up over NAND-based SSD. Even faster is a new direct access storage (DAX) volume that is now supported by NTFS as part of the Windows 10 Anniversary Update and the Windows Server 2016 releases. This treats persistent memory more like memory, but has some limitations—such as no support for software encryption or compression. Still, it does seem to be a step in the right direction, at least for new applications. At the show, Intel said it would be making its Optane SSDs using 3D XPoint memory available as a cloud-based service so enterprises can test out workloads. Meanwhile, VMware was showing off its Virtual Persistent Memory (vPMem) service to simulate 3D XPoint memory so developers can create applications that take advantage of the new kind of memory. All of these sound good, but indicate that the drives will be widely available a bit later than we originally thought. Back to top By Michael J. Miller Michael J.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing IBM details next-gen Power 9, will take the fight to Intel’s data center strongholds IBM details next-gen Power 9, will take the fight to Intel’s data center strongholds By Joel Hruska on August 25, 2016 at 7:30 am Comment The story of how Intel rose to dominance in the server and workstation markets was written more than a decade ago. Once upon a time (the late 1980s and early 1990s), various RISC, CISC, and SPARC architectures dominated the high-end PC industry, even as consumer PCs overwhelmingly opted for x86 designs. Intel leveraged both economies of scale and its alliance with Microsoft to push x86 processors into both data centers and workstations. By 2000, Intel had seized the majority of the market, forcing companies like IBM and Sun into smaller and smaller niches. Today, IBM wants to reverse that trend — and it thinks Power 9 is the chip to do it. The new cores will come in two flavors; a “scale-out” design meant for large HPC applications and supercomputers with support for four or more CPU sockets and a “scale-up” design with 1-2 sockets. Next Platform reports that there will be four flavors of Power 9 in total, varying in terms of total core count, direct-attached memory, the amount of simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) per-core, and support for various co-processors and other types of compute hardware (ASICS, FPGAs, and GPUs). Power 9 processors can be attached directly to various accelerators rather than communicating via the PCI Express bus. Some of the variants will also support IBM’s Centaur memory buffer technology to improve performance and implement an L4 cache. The Power 9 die. Power 9 CPUs will be built by GlobalFoundries on its 14nm process node and will be the first chips to implement Power ISA 3.0. This is the first version of the ISA to be released since IBM launched its OpenPOWER initiative and the first to support AltiVec 3 instructions. Like SSE or AVX, AltiVec is a single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instruction set, but how much additional performance it’ll deliver over its predecessor isn’t currently clear. Challenging Intel, ARM… and AMD? ARM, AMD, and IBM have all announced fresh challenges to Intel’s near-total dominance of the data center market in the past few weeks. Data centers aren’t just a lucrative market — they’re one of the only areas of computing that’s actually growing. The tablet market is shrinking, smartphone markets in the developing world are maturing rapidly, and the PC industry has been in free-fall for nearly five years. The growth of cloud computing and services like Google and Facebook means that selling to these customers has become essential to top-end server providers. Each company is making different moves to address these markets. AMD, of course, has Zen, its new architecture that it hopes will offer potent competition for its long-time rival. ARM added a flexible vector instruction set to boost performance in HPC workloads, and IBM is launching an all-new iteration of the Power architecture. Image by Next Platform “We started with a 64 bit compute building block and we coupled that with a 64 bit load store building block,” Brian Thompto, senior technical staff at IBM said in his Hot Chips presentation. “Each compute building block has a heterogeneous mix of compute, fixed and float, supporting scalar and vector.

We couple two of these 64 bit slices together to make a 128 bit superslice, and this is our physical design building block.” IBM’s new cores and their peripheral accelerators will be tied together by its custom on-chip fabric. L3 cache bandwidth is said to be 256GB/s, with support for PCI Express 4.0 (when that standard is available), multiple 25Gb/s “Bluelink” ports (these are used for the attached accelerators and for Nvidia’s NVLink 2.0 protocol).

By DAVID RAMLI Bloomberg News First Published Aug 25 2016 01:05AM    •    Last Updated Aug 25 2016 01:05 am Share This Article China faces an uphill battle in its push to become the global leader in computer chips because of a lack of technological know-how and talent, according to an analysis by Bain & Co. China is one of the world's largest consumers of semiconductor devices thanks to its manufacturing might, and is planning to spend more than $100 billion to become also a premier supplier to the planet. The global consultancy estimates that by 2020, almost 55 percent of the world's memory, logic and analog chips will flow to or through the country. But the vast majority of the microchips that act as the brains of products like Apple's iPhone are largely imported from companies like Intel Corp. and Samsung Electronics. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The government in 2014 moved to change this with plans to invest more than $100 billion and become a leading global player. It's also driven consolidation among domestic suppliers to maximize its investments, including the $2.8 billion merger of Tsinghua Unigroup and Wuhan Xinxin Semiconductor Manufacturing announced last month. China's effort to build a world-leading semiconductor industry is part of a broader effort to wean itself off foreign technology. But financial investment will not be enough to buy leadership of the semiconductor sector, which is worth around $1 trillion according to Singapore-based Bain partner Kevin Meehan. The country currently makes just 15 percent of the semiconductors it consumes, Bain said in a report. And by 2020, the consultancy expects Chinese-based plants to produce just 7 percent of the world's microchips, barely up from current levels. "China is coming at it in a pretty smart and intelligent way," he said. "But I don't see a path for them to own leading-edge processor technology and that is the foundation of Intel, the foundation of Samsung's success." Efforts by Chinese companies to buy rivals with intellectual property in the processor and memory markets have run afoul of regulators around the world. Plans for a $3.8 billion investment in Western Digital Corp. were scrapped amid a U.S. security review and investments in Taiwanese chip companies face regulatory obstacles and have stoked political tension. "Assuming they can spend it all, the biggest risk is that they end up with a whole bunch of fragmented and weak follower positions," Meehan said. "There's ways for them to have influence over greater than 10 percent if they're partnering well, but otherwise I think you're essentially capped there." Meehan said China's semiconductor makers could eventually learn from partnerships with global giants and become one of the larger suppliers of key components like computer memory. Both Intel and Qualcomm have agreed to build semiconductor fabrication plants there in partnership with local providers. "If you take a long view -- not five years but decades -- then certainly you'd have to believe there's some absorption," he said. "But people are careful not to put their leading edge IP in China." "I don't see a way to get there without licensing or buying."   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Salt Lake City police cancel Amber Alert for 3-year-old girl who is found safe in Hawaii BYU football: RB coach Reno Mahe's daughter clings to life after hanging accident Ed Kimball, who wrote warts-and-all biographies of his father, Mormon leader Spencer Kimball, dies | After unusual election, lawmakers draft pile of bills seeking to make changes BYU basketball: Title belt at stake as Cougs get rematch with Valparaiso ELEVATE During National Alzheimer’s Disease Awareness Month the Focus is Keeping Caregivers Healthy   Life is a Peach at the SALT Awards   Salt Lake Regional Medical Center First in the U.S. to Perform Meniscus Replacement   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

As planned Intel is going to release Kaby Lake architecture based processors in the coming months. The desktop processors based on Kaby will use LGA 1151. Two processors will be an unlocked K series processor.  Kaby Lake will already be the 3rd generation processors that Intel fabs at 14nm. The Kaby Lake generation will be the successor to the current Skylake generation. That makes Kaby Lake the third step in Intel's "process-architecture-optimization' strategy. The chips are, much like Broadwell and Skylake, produced at 14nm, but should get some optimizations including support for Optane-SSD's. Intel will release three product stacks based on power utilization, LGA1151-Standard Power; LGA1151-Low Power; and LGA1151-Ultra Low Power based on the processor TDP. Information that reaches us through OCaholic shows standard Power Core i7-7700K and the Core i5-7600K. These K models obviously have unlocked multipliers.  Earlier this year the specs of Intel Core i7 7700K Kaby Lake already processor surfaced in the SiSoft SANDRA benchmark results page. The Core i7 7700K listed would be a quad-core with HyperThreading enabling 8 logical CPUs. The clock frequencies have changed towards higher numbers though. As it stands now this flagship quad-core processor is clocked at 4.2 GHz and can Boost to 4.50 GHz. To compare a little, a Core i7 6700K runs at 4.00 GHz with a boost to 4.20 GHz. The cache is the same, 256 KB per-core L2, and 8 MB shared L3 caches. Clock-for-clock and core for core you should not expect much performance differences though. The processors will use the current socket LGA1151 which means that after a motherboard firmware upgrade, you should be ready to go with your current motherboard. The second K model would be the Core i5-7600K and will get a 3.80 GHz clock that may boost towards its 4.00 GHz Turbo. It will have less L3 cache (6 MB) and also will lack hyper-threading. Lower in the stack will be lower TDP based SKUs like the i7-7700 (non-K) with a 3.60 GHz base clock and TBA turbo clock.   Processor Name Frequency (GHz) Cache C/T Turbo Boost (GHz) Intel HD Graphics Dynamic Frequency (MHz) Unlocked USD Socket 1151 Standard Power (95W) i7-7700K 4.20 8 MB 4/8 4.50 Next Gen HD Graphics TBA Yes TBA i5-7600K 3.80 6 MB 4/4 4.00 Next Gen HD Graphics TBA Yes TBA Socket 1151 Low Power (65W) i7-7700 3.60 8 MB 4/8 TBA Next Gen HD Graphics TBA No TBA i5-7600 3.50 6 MB 4/4 TBA Next Gen HD Graphics TBA No TBA i5-7500 3.40 6 MB 4/4 TBA Next Gen HD Graphics TBA No TBA i5-7400 3.30 6 MB 4/4 TBA Next Gen HD Graphics TBA No TBA Socket 1151 Ultra Low Power (35W) i7-7700T 2.90 8 MB 4/8 TBA Next Gen HD Graphics TBA No TBA i5-7600T 2.70 6 MB 4/4 TBA Next Gen HD Graphics TBA No TBA i5-7500T 2.40 6 MB 4/4 TBA Next Gen HD Graphics TBA No TBA K - Unlocked T - Power-optimized lifestyle Even at 35 Watt there will be a Ultra Low Power quad-core processor, the Core i7-7700T will have 2.90 GHz clocks and 8 MB of L3 cache. More SKUs can be spotted in the table, courtesy of OCaholic.  Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ... Not the best 3 ... Average 4 ... Good 5 ...

Unless you want an overprised Optane SSD, assuming you could somehow snatch one from the corporate channels, this is utterly worthless. Overclock a Skylake and you've got a Kaby lake.

The only sugar in the coffee is a 6 core version to help compete with 8 core Zen. 3 pages 1 2 3 Post New Comment Click here to post a comment for this news story on the message forum.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Aug 24, 2016 at 9:22PM Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has made plenty of smart moves over the past year. The chipmaker struck back hard at AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) in the low-end GPU market with its new Pascal-based cards, forged new data center partnerships with IBM, and unveiled its next-gen autonomous driving supercomputer, Drive PX 2. Image source: Nvidia. The company has posted double digit year-over-year sales growth for three consecutive quarters, and is expected to post 22% sales growth for the full year. That growth caused Nvidia to rally nearly 200% over the past 12 months, but the stock remains fairly valued with a 5-year price/earning-growth (PEG) ratio of 1.4. While the bullish reasons for owning Nvidia are now well-known, investors should also keep an eye out for three potential pitfalls which might cause the stock to fall. 1. AMD might launch Vega this year Nvidia struck AMD pretty hard when it launched its GTX 1060 last month. The 6GB card, which cost $250, offered 50% more RAM and roughly 15% faster performance than AMD's RX 480 for just $50 more. Nvidia then launched a 3GB version of the 1060 for $200, which the company claims runs 10% faster than the 8GB version of AMD's RX 480, which costs $240. AMD's RX 480. Image source: AMD. But AMD isn't down for the count yet. In response to Nvidia's new Pascal cards, AMD might pull forward the launch of Vega, its next-gen GPU, from next year to this October. The Vega chipset will reportedly offer performance comparable with that of Nvidia's top-tier GTX 1080, which costs $600, at a lower price point. If the Vega cards arrive in time for the holidays, Nvidia's core gaming GPU business -- which generated over half its sales last quarter -- could take a big hit. 2. Intel could strike back in data centers Nvidia's data center revenue rose 110% annually last quarter and accounted for 11% of its top line. The unit's sales were boosted by robust demand for its high-end Tesla GPUs in data centers. That's because Nvidia's Tesla GPUs can process certain machine learning and AI-related tasks faster than Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) high-end Xeon Phi processors. However, Intel's Xeon is still the industry standard for data centers, and they power 99% of all servers worldwide. Intel realizes that it could lose market share in machine-learning data centers to Nvidia, so it recently announced a third-generation Xeon Phi processor, code-named Knights Mill, which will arrive next year. Intel hasn't revealed any technical details about Knights Mill yet, but it will reportedly add more floating point calculations for machine learning algorithms. If Knights Mill offers a significant performance advantage against Nvidia's Tesla GPUs, Intel can leverage its dominant market share to strike back at Nvidia in the machine learning market. 3. Plenty of competition in connected cars Nvidia did a great job pivoting its Tegra mobile CPUs toward the connected car market. The Tegra-powered VCM (visual computing module) offered better graphics and audio for infotainment systems, and the Tegra X1-powered Drive PX platform provided ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems) with robust processing power. The new Drive PX 2 platform, which will reportedly be ten times faster, is designed to power fully autonomous vehicles. Over 80 automakers, suppliers, and university research centers worldwide are already developing driverless cars based on the PX 2. Demand for these platforms boosted Nvidia's automotive revenue, which accounted for 8% of its top line, by 68% annually last quarter. Image source: Nvidia. But Nvidia also faces fierce competition in this fledgling market. NXP (NASDAQ:NXPI), which became the biggest automotive chipmaker in the world after buying Freescale last year, recently unveiled BlueBox -- a turnkey driverless platform that competes directly against Nvidia's Drive PX 2. Since NXP also supplies a wide variety of other automotive chips, it could eventually use aggressive bundling strategies to marginalize Nvidia. Other competitors include Qualcomm, which launched its Snapdragon 820 Automotive processors for infotainment centers earlier this year; Intel, which supplies Atom chips to several automakers for the same purpose; and Mobileye, which provides ADAS and computer vision chips to 90% of the top automakers in the world. These rivals could spark a fierce pricing war and reduce the margins of Nvidia's automotive business. So is Nvidia still a worthy investment? I personally believe that Nvidia is still a solid long-term investment, and that the company has a knack for establishing first-mover's advantages in growing markets. However, investors should still do their homework and carefully weigh the pros and cons before buying this stock after its massive year-long rally. Leo Sun owns shares of Qualcomm.

Through several iterations, however, it slowly became more powerful. While the most recent version -- the Raspberry Pi 3 -- has a much more capable processor, some developers will still want even more horsepower. Today, Intel announces a maker board that puts the Raspberry Pi 3 to shame. The Joule system-on-module mini-computer features RealSense camera support and runs Ubuntu Linux Core. Best of all, its specs are very impressive for what it is. "We're happy to welcome a new development board in the Ubuntu family! The new Intel Joule is a powerful board targeted at IoT and robotics makers and runs Ubuntu for a smooth development experience. It's also affordable and compact enough to be used in deployment, therefore Ubuntu Core can be installed to make any device it’s included in secure and up to date … wherever it is", says Canonical. ALSO READ: How to: Install Google Chrome web browser on Ubuntu Linux (and uninstall Firefox) Intel explains, "Joule enables people to take a concept into a prototype and then into production at a fraction of the time and development cost. The Intel Joule platform is a high performance system-on-module (SOM) in a tiny, low-power package thus making it ideal for computer vision, robotics, drones, industrial IoT, VR, AR, micro-servers and other applications that require high-end edge computing". You can see a robot powered by Intel Joule in the video below. Intel shares the following specs.

OpenGL ES 3.1 Comes For Intel Haswell On Mesa Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 24 August 2016 at 08:58 PM EDT. 14 Comments For those running Intel Haswell processors, hope is not lost in seeing new versions of OpenGL extensions with the Intel Mesa driver. New patches will bring Haswell up to OpenGL ES 3.1. Intel's Jordan Justen published a set of 16 patches for enabling OpenGL ES 3.1 with Haswell hardware.The last extensions needed were ARB_stencil_texturing and ARB_texture_stencil8. Other work is still needed for GLES 3.1 support with Ivy Bridge and Bay Trail hardware. Hopefully these patches will be merged soon but for now you can find them via the Mesa mailing list. 14 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Is Linux Mint 18 the best desktop operating system? Why did Gentoo Linux fade into obscurity? Video How IBM's Watson will change cybersecurity Linux and old Mac computers Apple is known for its planned obsolescence strategy that encourages customers to upgrade their Macs every so often. This can result in older Macs that can't update to the latest version of macOS, but are still perfectly functional computers that can perform many everyday computing tasks such as web browsing, word processing, image editing, etc. So what can you do with an older Mac that no longer gets macOS updates? You can install Linux and breathe new life into that old Mac computer. Distributions such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Fedora and others offer a way to continue using an older Mac that would otherwise be cast aside. Phil Shapiro reports for FOSS Force: These days, thanks to Apple’s move to Intel about a decade back, bringing new life to an old Mac by installing your favorite Linux distro is just as easy as it is with a standard PC, as you will see in this video. All Macintosh computers from about 2006 onwards were made using Intel CPUs and installing Linux on these computers is a breeze. You don’t need to download any Mac specific distro — just choose your favorite distro and install away. About 95 percent of the time you’ll be able to use the 64-bit version of the distro. On CoreDuo Macs, from 2006, you’ll need to use a 32-bit version. Here is a screencast video I made on a revived Macbook that came into my hands recently. I downloaded Linux Mint 18 Xfce 64-bit ISO, burned it to DVD, inserted it into the Macbook (after the Macbook was turned on) and then booted the Macbook from DVD by holding the the letter “C” (which tells the Mac to boot from the optical drive). More at FOSS Force The article on FOSS Force about using old Macs to run Linux caught the attention of Linux redditors and they shared their thoughts about it: IBlowAtCoding: “Linux is very modular and customizable. Upgrading to latest OSX with old hardware is definitely going to see a performance decrease but doing so with Linux it may not be the case. For example, you could choose a more bare bones distribution, you could choose a very simple desktop environment (Openbox instead of Unity), etc. I even have some shit laptop with the latest Debian where I don’t even run a GUI at all and just use the terminal and tmux.” Faissaloo: “…with OSX you have a choice between incompatibility and planned obsolescence. With Linux you get neither.” Maximiliankolb: “i don’t want to be judgmental in any kind of way, but using machines slower than a new raspi3 for 30$ is probably a waste of resources itself. as others have pointed out, they just use a hell lot of power, while not being reliable. the effort to support all those different models is too high, comparing to a fairly standard and well tested raspi3 setup. i like using used/ refurbished machines, but there are boundaries!” Noxygen: “I still use an IMac from 2008 under linux. As the screen is good and big, and power consumption quite low, it makes a perfect second computer for monitoring and administrating my rtmp server.” BaronVonD: “You can also download a PowerPC version of Deb/Ubuntu for even older Macs, run that using lxde or any other light weight environment. I have an iMac G3 that I was trying to get Lubuntu installed, just for fun. Had some issues on install, so I haven’t done much with that, but I might try again today.” CompsciKinder: “I run g4 and g5 powermac with ubuntu ppc. Works great still great cpus! I use them for testing software for specific use cases so I don’t care about efficiency.” Tiv: “Just keep in mind that there are Macs out there that have a 32-bit UEFI implementation and a 64-bit CPU. Which means that downloading a 64-bit distro doesn’t automatically guarantee that you can boot from it. Some distros don’t include EFI stubs for both architectures. Canonical at some point shipped a specific EFI+Mac version for that reason I believe. If you encounter this problem just use rEFInd and be done with it.” Macbookairquestion: “Apple want you to replace their products every several years. I had to deal with a 2008 MacBook Air. It is not supported by the latest OS X versions. The latest OS X which is running on it (Lion) does not get any security updates anymore. Linux is a good the only way to continue to use this well manufactured computer for average tasks in a secure manner.” AlwaysManaged: “Just out of curiosity, how is this “reviving” the computer? If it already had OSX on it, why not just restore it to factory settings and upgrade it to whatever the latest release it’ll run is? I don’t see how installing linux makes a difference for the hardware…OSX is already a unix-based OS.” Djxfade: “Because in the case of Mac’s that Apple have abandoned, like the PPC hardware, the first few Intel generations etc. they can only run old and unsupported OS X versions. On the PowerPC hardware, you are screwed, because it is permanently stuck on Leopard, a 10 year old OS. By installing a flavor of Linux, you get access to the latest software, security patches, and a modern browser. The older Safari versions are useless today.” More at Reddit 8 Linux file managers to try Linux offers a wide range of choices when it comes to file managers. A writer at opensource.com has a helpful overview of 8 Linux file managers worth using. David Both reports for opensource.com: One of the most common administrative tasks that end users and administrators alike need to perform is file management. Managing files can consume a major portion of your time. Locating files, determining which files and folders (directories) are taking the most disk space, deleting files, moving files, and simply opening files for use in an application are some of the most basic—yet frequent—tasks we do as computer users. File management programs are tools that are intended to streamline and simplify those necessary chores. Many people aren’t aware of the wide array of choices available in file managers, nor do they realize the full capabilities of the ones they do know about. As with every aspect of Linux, there are many options available for file managers. The most common ones provided by my favorite distribution, Fedora, are: Midnight Commander Konqueror Dolphin Krusader Nautilus Thunar PCmanFM XFE More at Opensource.com Pokemon GO has lost millions of players Pokemon GO took the mobile gaming world by storm when it was first released, quickly becoming one of the most popular games on Android and iOS devices. But now the game is losing millions of players, and its popularity might prove to very short lived indeed. Tom Mendelsohn reports for Ars Technica: It had almost 45 million daily users in July, but this figure appears to have sunk by more than 12 million since the start of August, to just over 30 million said to be playing Pokémon Go. Further decline is expected, as downloads, engagement, and the time users spend on the app have all also visibly flopped, according to data provided by Sensor Tower, SurveyMonkey, and Apptopia. Bloomberg, which saw the raw data, reported that other major apps such as Twitter, Facebook, and Snapchat “can breathe a sigh of relief” that Pokémon Go is finally wobbling, as the game’s popularity had apparently been costing them considerable amounts of users. Developer Niantic is persevering with the game, however, and is due to release version 0.35.0 for Android and 1.5.0 for iOS. According to the patch notes, players “will now be able to learn about a Pokémon’s attack and defence capabilities from their Team Leader to determine which of their Pokémon have the most potential for battle.” More at Ars Technica Did you miss a roundup?

Artificial intelligence and machine learning are opening up another front in the sprawling competition between Intel and Nvidia that has stretched from the data center and high-performance computing environments to autonomous vehicles. Both chip makers see the nascent artificial intelligence (AI) space—and the machine learning that helps enable it—as key growth areas and have made significant recent pushes into the market, and each sees the other as primary competitors. Now the two companies are looking to grab mindshare around AI in the industry by both touting their own technologies while throwing shade at the other's. As Intel executives at the Intel Developer Forum (IDF) last week unveiled a range of moves the company is making to address the needs in the emerging market, Nvidia officials fired off a post on the vendor's blog questioning some of the benchmark numbers Intel was using comparing its many-core Xeon Phi processors to Nvidia's GPUs. Ian Buck, vice president and general manager of Nvidia's accelerated computing unit, in the blog post downplayed methods Intel used in trying to pump up the benchmark numbers for Xeon Phi. "While we can correct each of their wrong claims, we think deep learning testing against old Kepler GPUs and outdated software versions are mistakes that are easily fixed in order to keep the industry up to date," Buck wrote. "It's great that Intel is now working on deep learning. This is the most important computing revolution with the era of AI upon us and deep learning is too big to ignore. But they should get their facts straight." In his own blog post this week, Jason Waxman, corporate vice president in the Intel's Data Center Group and general manager of the company's Data Center Solutions Group, pushed back, noting what he said is the company's strong position as the AI market grows and the worry that may cause competitors. "However, arguing over publicly available performance benchmarks is a waste of time," Waxman wrote. "It's Intel's practice to base performance claims on the latest publicly available information at the time the claim is published, and we stand by our data." The argument echoes similar ones the two companies have made in the past in such areas as high-performance computing (HPC), where Intel processors are the dominant CPU in the systems but Nvidia's GPUs are increasingly being used as accelerators to help boost the performance and power efficiency of the machines. Intel has responded with Xeon Phi, which initially could be used only as coprocessors for accelerating performance but, since the release last year of the 72-core Knights Landing chip, can now be used as the primary processor. Intel has argued that running HPC workloads on its x86-based architecture—both its Xeon and Xeon Phi chips—makes sense, while Nvidia officials have said GPUs offer greater performance in parallel processing environments. Some of the debate around AI is similar. Nvidia executives for the past several years have said that AI and machine learning—which aims to train neural networks to enable artificial intelligence so systems can learn from experience, much like a human brain does—are key technologies for the company's future. In April, Nvidia unveiled the Tesla P100, a massive chip based on Nvidia's 16-nanometer Pascal architecture that packs 150 billion transistors, as well as the DGX-1, a supercomputer for deep learning and AI that combines eight Tesla P100 GPUs with two Intel Xeon server chips to drive 170 teraflops of performance in a 3U (5.25-inch) form factor. "Deep learning has the potential to revolutionize computing, improve our lives, improve the efficiency and intelligence of our business systems, and deliver advancements that will help humanity in profound ways," Nvidia's Buck wrote. "That's why we've been enhancing the design of our parallel processors and creating software and technologies to accelerate deep learning for many years. Our dedication to deep learning is deep and broad. Every framework has NVIDIA-optimized support, and every major deep learning researcher, laboratory and company is using NVIDIA GPUs." In his own blog post, Intel's Waxman said Intel is "inherently well-positioned to support the machine learning revolution." Intel chips power more than 97 percent of servers used for running machine learning workloads, and "while there's been much talk about the value of GPUs for machine learning, the fact is that fewer than 3 percent of all servers deployed for machine learning last year used a GPU." He also noted other efforts by Intel in the AI space, including the planned release of a Xeon Phi chip dubbed "Knights Mill" with enhanced variable precision and flexible high-capacity memory that is aimed at AI workloads, the commitment to open frameworks for machine learning—including Caffe and Theano—and the acquisition of Nervana Systems and its machine learning technologies.           LATEST SERVERS ARTICLES   Microsoft Plans to Build a Quantum Computer Cray, SGI Awarded $52 Million in Federal Supercomputer Contracts IBM, OpenPower Foundation Make Push into Europe GPU's Role in Artificial Intelligence Advances Featured at Conference EMC Shows Its Data Center Strength at Inaugural Dell EMC Conference                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

In San Francisco last week Intel executives showed off two new technologies for storing data and moving it around that could shake up established ways of designing computers. The new technologies are primarily being targeted at the giant data centers that power mobile apps, websites, and emerging ideas in artificial intelligence. They could also benefit consumers more directly by appearing in consumer products. Intel needs some new markets. In April the company announced it was laying off 12,000 workers and abandoning making chips for mobile devices, a huge market Intel missed out on. The company has also had to slow the pace at which it brings out new generations of smaller transistors, a trend that has underpinned the industry and Intel’s business for decades (see “Intel Puts the Brakes on Moore’s Law”). One of Intel’s new technologies is a form of data storage that’s faster than the flash disk used in laptops and data centers today. Intel calls it Optane, and it is based on technology called 3D Xpoint, developed in collaboration with memory manufacturer Micron. Intel has not disclosed how 3D Xpoint works, but it is believed to write data by heating a glass-like “phase change” material (see “A Preview of Future Disk Drives”). Silicon chips with built-in lasers allow this gadget to add a new kind of high-speed, optical fiber data link to data center computers. Intel says it will launch Optane disks in 2016 and memory chips that fit into the same slots as a computer’s RAM in 2017. At Intel’s annual developer conference last week, Frank Hady, a technical leader on the project, showed a computer with a prototype Optane disk processing database records in a task common in the data centers of companies such as Facebook at three times the speed of a computer with a flash disk. Hady said an Optane drive can locate and access a piece of data in a tenth the time a flash disk, or SSD, would need. In the past few years, flash disks have been enthusiastically adopted by computing companies to make servers and consumer PCs snappier. If Optane drives appear in PCs, they should also boost performance. And Ethan Miller, a professor and director of the Center for Research in Storage Systems at the University of California, Santa Cruz, says that Intel and Micron’s technology could have an even larger impact than flash on how people build and use computer systems if researchers and companies outside Intel embrace and experiment with it. For instance, Optane memory chips might offer ways to make the expensive data center systems that underpin search engines and social networks much more efficient—something large Internet companies such as Facebook would gladly pay for. Optane memory chips also retain their data when powered off, unlike RAM. That should make data center systems quicker to recover after crashes or power outages. Intel also announced a new way to move data between computers last week. The company has begun manufacturing silicon chips with tiny, built-in lasers as a way to replace some copper cables inside data centers with fiber optic ones. Fiber optic links are today mostly limited to long-range connections, such as telecom networks, because of the size and expense of the components needed. Intel’s technology can send 100 gigabits of data per second over a single optical fiber a few millimeters thick. Production problems derailed Intel’s previous promise to launch its silicon photonics technology in 2013 (see “Intel’s Laser Chips Could Make Data Centers Run Better”). But the company now appears to be on track to beat IBM, Cisco, and others working on similar technology. “We are the first to light up silicon,” said Diane Bryant, who leads Intel’s data center business, at the company’s event last week. Bryant said that Intel’s silicon photonics technology will initially be used to connect network gear inside data centers. But after that it will be used to link up servers, and Intel also hopes to replace some of the metal cables inside individual computers with silicon photonics links. That could free engineers to rethink conventional computer designs, which are constrained by the performance of copper cables. Intel has previously said silicon photonics could eventually be used to make data cables and computers used by consumer faster. Microsoft’s Kushagra Vaid, who leads work on the hardware behind its Azure cloud computing service, spoke alongside Bryant. He said he expected to rely on the technology as a way to keep increasing the volume of data his fleets of servers can process, because they are going to become constrained by conventional connections. “We need some new technologies,” he said. “It’s a great way to continue that scaling.” From Our Advertisers Sponsored by Google for Work Survey: Machine Learning Trends, Challenges, and Opportunities In partnership with Dynatrace Emerging Trend Analysis: What is Digital Performance Management?

However, now AMD is revealing every naked detail of a processor core technology that may give Intel’s “Kaby Lake” desktop processors a hard time on the market next year. As previously reported, Zen cores will have 40 percent more instructions per clock than the previous “Excavator” generation. Each core will have two threads (lanes), and access to 8MB of shared L3 cache, a large amount of “private” L2 cache, and a micro-op cache. Other highlights include two AES encryption units for security, and transistors based on energy-efficient FinFET process technology. Related: AMD confirms that DirectX 12 support is coming to ‘Deus Ex: Mankind Divided’ AMD considers its Zen core a “clean sheet” design, meaning the company nearly started over from scratch and uses very little from its previous CPU architecture. With Zen, AMD is pushing to increase the performance per clock while decreasing the amount of energy needed per cycle. And while AMD created a wide performance/energy usage gap with its Excavator core technology, Zen seemingly balloons that gap to an even higher amount in a rather short distance on AMD’s core technology timeline. In a slide displayed during the convention, AMD listed a number of performance and power improvements offered by Zen, including faster L2 and L3 cache, up to five times more L3 bandwidth, a large Op Cache, larger instruction schedulers, and so on. AMD said Zen even includes “low power design methodologies” to achieve higher performance while keeping the power consumption low. On a more technical level, the Zen core architecture is comprised of a number of parts. AMD’s “Fetch Four” x86 instruction units, micro-operations cache instruction units, four integer units, two load/store units, and two floating point units. There’s also a four-way I-Cache amount of 64K, an eight-way D-Cache of 32K, and an eight-way L2 Cache of 512K. Again, each core supports two threads, and access to a larger shared L3 cache. In practice, this is similar to Intel’s Hyper-Threading, though the architecture that enables AMD’s take on it differs dramatically. Additional slides provided by AMD reveal even deeper Zen details covering the Zen core’s fetch, decode, execute, load/store and L2, and floating point capabilities. The new slides even reveal Zen’s cache hierarchy, an SMT overview, and a “CPU Complex” diagram showing four Zen cores connected to an L3 cache. This diagram displays each core with 512K of “private” L2 cache and “public” access to eight units of L3 cache at 1MB each. Finally, AMD provided a new list of instructions not offered in the previous Excavator generation. One instruction is called ADX, which extends the multi-precision arithmetic support. Another instruction called RDSEED compliments the RDRAND random number generation. There are six additional new instructions for clearing the cache line, combining 4K page tables into a 32k page size, and more. Intel may have a challenger once again Okay, okay, that’s a lot to take in. What does it mean? Accroding to AMD, it means its processors will again be performance-competitive with Intel hardware. Zen is a huge leap in performance  — about 40 percent more instructions per clock — compared to Excavator, far more than we’ve seen from new generations of AMD hardware in recent years. The company is also lower power targets with Zen. It expects the fastest desktop parts to have a thermal design power between 95 and 100 watts. That’s right in line with high-end Intel hardware, which over the past few generations as hovered in the 90 watt range. AMD further believes the design will scale down better than past architectures, which means low power envelopes — such as 15-watt parts intended for laptops — should fair well. AMD’s new Zen cores will first be used in its “Summit Ridge” processors. The first Zen-based product will appear in the high-end desktop market. A release date is not confirmed, but will be in early 2017. After that, the Zen-based chips will roll out to the enterprise-class server market, followed by mobile PCs, and the embedded application market (tablets, smartphones, and the like).

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Aug 24, 2016 at 2:04PM Image source: Intel.  About a year ago, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) introduced a chip known as the Core i7 6700K. It is based on the company's newest Skylake processor architecture and is targeted at the PC gaming and enthusiast market, a sub-segment of the personal computer market that Intel CEO Brian Krzanich says "continues to grow at a double-digit rate". Interestingly, when the 6700K first arrived, Intel had a lot of trouble building enough of them to meet demand (likely as a result of some combination of robust demand and production difficulties related to the company's 14-nanometer chip manufacturing process). Fast forward to today, and Intel seems to have its 14-nanometer manufacturing yields in good shape, so manufacturing these parts is no longer an issue. Additionally, the excitement around a product that's now a year old probably isn't what it was when the product first launched. But as a result, it would appear Intel has cut prices on the Core i7 6700K. Does this bode poorly for the company's future revenue or profitability? Core i7 6700K now available for $319 According to Intel's Processor Price List document, the official recommended customer price for the Core i7 6700K is $339. However, on both Newegg.com as well as Amazon.com, the pricing of the 6700K chip has fallen to $319. Generally speaking, it's not in a company's best interest to reduce pricing on a product if demand is robust at a higher price point -- price cuts often come when a company is trying to stimulate demand for a product. The fact that Intel has reduced pricing on the 6700K by $20 (or approximately 6%), seems to suggest that it's trying to do just that to reignite interest in the chip. A refresh would be helpful here The problem is that a year after the 6700K launched, Intel should be ready to launch its successor, the Kaby Lake-based 7700K. According to a recent leak, the product looks quite compelling, offering a solid increase in out-of-the-box performance. Unfortunately, according to that same leak, Intel has delayed the launch of its Kaby Lake family of desktop processors from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the first quarter of 2017. This means that the company is going to be stuck selling 6700K chips at depressed levels for several more quarters before refreshing the product line to shore up average selling prices. A potential offsetting factor Although Intel seems to have cut prices on the 6700K, it's worth pointing out that for gamers and enthusiasts, the chipmaker offers an entirely separate product line known as the high-end desktop, or HEDT, lineup. These parts feature greater core counts than the 6700K (the current lineup comes in six, eight, and ten-core options) but are built on a previous generation processor architecture (Broadwell instead of Skylake). They're also significantly more expensive than the 6700K, with the lowest cost model in the lineup beginning at $420 on Newegg.com. Interestingly, generation-on-generation, Intel actually increased the prices of its Broadwell-based high-end desktop parts, as you can see in the table below: Product configuration Haswell Launch Pricing Broadwell Launch Pricing Price Change 6C/12T w/ 28 PCIe Lanes $389 $434 +11.6% 6C/12T w/ 40 PCIe lanes $583 $617 +5.8% 8C/16T w/ 40 PCIe lanes $999 $1,089 +9% 10C/20T w/ 40 PCIe lanes N/A $1,723 N/A Data source: Intel processor price list. With the higher price tags, it appears Intel may be betting on gamers and enthusiasts moving over to the high-end desktop product line rather than staying with mainstream parts. Longer-term implications of moving to high-end desktop platform The market for gaming-oriented personal computers and components is a unique one. According to ASUSTek, a major vendor in this industry, the segment should grow at a 20% to 30% annual pace "over the next few years" (via DIGITIMES). That figure combines both desktop and notebook PCs, but I would imagine that both platforms are expected to enjoy some unit growth. Intel is well-positioned to capitalize on the secular growth trends in both of these markets (its offerings for both platforms are extremely strong). However, I don't think Intel is content to simply ride the secular unit growth wave. Intel wants to build products that bring additional value to the market in a bid to drive richer average selling prices. By more aggressively marketing its high-end desktop products, it can potentially drive improved average selling prices.  As far as margins go, the high-end desktop chips are based on the same silicon as chips that go into servers. This means the chip sizes are larger and more expensive to manufacture. However, at the current selling prices, it's likely that raw gross margins on these products are much higher than their mainstream counterparts. If Intel can continue to improve its high-end desktop offerings -- something that various leaks show that it is indeed doing -- then the company's gaming business could see both top and bottom line boosts in the years ahead.

China is one of the world’s largest consumers of semiconductor devices thanks to its manufacturing might, and is planning to spend more than US$100 billion to also become a premier supplier to the planet. The global consultancy estimated that by 2020, almost 55 percent of the world’s memory, logic and analog chips will flow to or through the country. However, the vast majority of the microchips that act as the brains of products like Apple Inc’s iPhone are largely imported from companies like Intel Corp and Samsung Electronics Co. The Chinese government in 2014 moved to change this with plans to invest more than US$100 billion and become a leading global player. It has also driven consolidation among domestic suppliers to maximize its investments, including the US$2.8 billion merger of Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd (清華紫光) and Wuhan Xinxin Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp (武漢新芯集成電路) announced last month. China’s efforts to build a world-leading semiconductor industry are part of a broader effort to wean itself off foreign technology. However, financial investment will not be enough to buy leadership of the semiconductor sector, which is worth about US$1 trillion according to Singapore-based Bain partner Kevin Meehan. The country currently makes just 15 percent of the semiconductors it consumes, Bain said in a report. By 2020, Bain expects Chinese-based plants to produce just 7 percent of the world’s microchips, barely up from current levels. “China is coming at it in a pretty smart and intelligent way, but I don’t see a path for them to own leading-edge processor technology and that is the foundation of Intel, the foundation of Samsung’s success,” he said. Efforts by Chinese companies to buy rivals with intellectual property in the processor and memory markets have run afoul of regulators around the world. Plans for a US$3.8 billion investment in Western Digital Corp were scrapped amid a US security review and investments in Taiwanese chip companies face regulatory obstacles and have stoked political tension. “Assuming they can spend it all, the biggest risk is that they end up with a whole bunch of fragmented and weak follower positions,” Meehan said. “There’s ways for them to have influence over greater than 10 percent if they’re partnering well, but otherwise I think you’re essentially capped there,” he added. Meehan said China’s semiconductor makers could eventually learn from partnerships with global giants and become one of the larger suppliers of key components like computer memory. Both Intel and Qualcomm Inc have agreed to build semiconductor fabrication plants there in partnership with local providers. “If you take a long view — not five years, but decades — then certainly you’d have to believe there’s some absorption, but people are careful not to put their leading-edge IP [intellectual property] in China,” he said. “I don’t see a way to get there without licensing or buying,” Meehan added.

The Skull Canyon is small–really small. At just 8 inches long, 4 inches wide, and about an inch deep, it packs the latest 6th Generation Intel® Core™ i7 processor with Intel® Iris™Pro Graphics, offering the highest end integrated graphics solutions out there. There’s a performance, size, and power envelope advantage to having a CPU and GPU on the same physical piece of silicon that allows the system to be super thin, making it even smaller than most laptops, and significantly smaller than any of the major gaming consoles currently on the market. Motherboard spoke to Intel’s Mitchell Lum to learn how the latest generation of the Intel® NUC (code named Skull Canyon) represents the next evolution of extremely powerful, small form factor, desktop PCs. MB: Hey Mitchell. Thanks for speaking with us. We’re really excited about this tiny but powerful little unit. Can you give us a little background on the latest Intel NUC project? The Skull Canyon product is the latest version of our Intel® NUC (Next Unit of Computing)–strictly speaking Skull Canyon is a code name. A number of years ago, a team at Intel said “Hey, we think we can do better with really, really small form factor PCs, and drive a new usage model and new market.” In particular, these units are great for a little media PC. The earlier versions of the NUCs, inspired Gigabyte to do a system called the Brix Pro, which used our 4th generation Intel® Core™ i7 with Iris™ Pro graphics, and in 2014, Intel, in conjunction with Valve, did a hardware seeding at their Steam Dev Days event where all of the devs that attended got one of these machines as a Steam OS dev kit. These products were really popular with game devs. Many of them, realistically speaking, either dual booted them or just put Windows on them. What the devs really liked them for was for going to trade shows. So, if you’re doing a festival or trade show, and you need a reasonably high powered PC, you’ll usually take a big desktop computer, which is difficult to travel with, or a laptop, which you’d still want an external monitor with. So devs have been traveling with these Gigabyte Bricks Pros, and they’re great little machines. But that was 2 years ago, and we now have 2 generations of newer machines–and that’s where we are with the Skull Canyon. Skull Canyon Intel® NUC MB: So what’s currently in this machine? How has it been updated from those previous versions? Just like the previous version, this has the Intel® Iris™ Pro graphics in it. It’s a 45w processor, and it should be highly competitive with some of the mobile discrete graphics cards. It’s able to play Just Cause 3. If you look at the price point for this product, if you looked at building one of these systems out, in comparison with building out a small form factor traditional desktop, it’s almost the same price. If size and space is at a premium for you as a user, this product is something you should definitely consider. Whether that’s game developer traveling, or people using it as a living room gaming console. MB: So, obviously small form factor systems like this limit your ability to modify or upgrade as time goes on and hardcore gamers are probably not your target market for this sort of thing. But for a casual gamer like myself, and someone who lives in a small apartment where space is at a premium, the idea of having a versatile living room PC that can play some AAA gaming titles at good frame rates is very attractive. This is more of a niche product. It’s definitely something that can be attractive for casual gamers, and it can be viewed as more of a secondary PC that you can put in your living room–a PC-based console alternative. For many people, it wouldn’t necessarily be a primary system, but if you’re a hardcore gamer and you have your big, gaming rig in your office or spare bedroom–having one of these Skull Canyons and a big TV in you living room is pretty unbeatable for local multiplayer party games. Going over to a friend’s place and having a game system for a group gaming session is something that a lot of people enjoy, and the PC can offer a lot of options that a console can’t. There are also other folks looking at this for video processing as it offers pretty competitive performance, especially when considering this form factor. While it doesn’t have a big hard drive in it, it can support 2 M.2 blazing fast NVMe SSDs (today shipping at 512GB sizes) that can be raided if desired. And in addition, with Thunderbolt 3 you can add virtually unlimited external storage over a 40Gbps bus–adding a lot of versatility. Skull Canyon Intel® NUC MB: But at the core of the project, you really see this as being a great product for game developers? Absolutely. We’d like to think game developers will see this as a pretty exciting, fairly high-end performance system. It doesn’t necessarily represent tens of millions of users as an install base for them if they’re targeting it, however, with the lead times that big studios have, and some indies, if they’re targeting this type of performance and hardware today, we’ll see that type of performance in more mainstream products in the future. Every year our performance gets better. What you can buy on a 15w Ultrabook today would have been extremely high end in terms of integrated graphics in desktop parts a few generations ago–what you see with this NUC will be commonplace in a few years. We think the opportunity is really nice for developers and users are going to get a good experience out of this. Skull Canyon Intel® NUC MB: So, by looking at the technology in this generation of NUC, developers will have great insight into the next generation of integrated graphics that we’ll see in mass-market consumer products in the near future? Right. We think that Skull Canyons are one of the most exciting pieces of hardware to come out of this generation. The performance that they’ll see out of it will be really exciting, and by making sure that their games work really well on Intel integrated graphics means, downstream, they’ll have access to a larger install base of end users who will be able to play these games. For end users, we think people that use this will approach it as something of a console-like experience, for living room gaming, local multiplayer party style games, or just delivering a console-like experience on a big screen. What we’re doing is two sides of the same coin. On the one hand, this is great for game developers to create great content that will run on the machine, but on the other side we want consumers to enjoy the content that the developers are making. The Skull Canyon may just be a glimpse into the future of small form factor PCs with discrete GPUs becoming a viable alternative to big, hulking gaming rigs for a generation of casual gamers.

Corrales Comment News Reporting as if Democracy Matters Home Welcome to Corrales Comment Publication Dates Subscribe CC Advertise! Ad Rates Archived Articles CALENDAR COP21 Reporting From Paris Intel Explains Goals for 2020 Details Published: 24 August 2016 Microchip production at the Intel plant between Corrales and Rio Rancho continued at 93.5 percent of capacity during July and August, with no definitive statement from corporate officials whether the facility here will close or keep churning out chips. Amid substantial worldwide layoffs this spring, Intel New Mexico has consistently maintained similar high levels of production while corporate leaders chart a course into an uncertain future. Last month at Intel’s Community Environmental Working Group meeting in the Corrales Senior Center, Intel Rio Rancho Site Manager Mindy Koch explained the corporation’s environmental goals to be achieved by 2020. Her presentation also included its Corporate Social Responsibility Report.  At no point in her power point talk did she hint that the plant here might, or might not, be operating by 2020. The goals enumerated were corporation wide, across all manufacturing, research and administrative facilities, she said, adding that the Intel site here is expected to help meet several of those.  Perhaps the only indicator given for Intel’s future here came when Koch explained that operations here substantially reduced energy consumption by shutting down one of the site’s two utility plants earlier this year. The utillity plants house diesel-powered boilers, generators and other equipment. For Corrales residents concerned about chemical emissions from Intel’s manufacturing processes, perhaps the most important goal for 2020 was screening and selecting “green chemistry” production line gases and liquids. The stated goal: “Implement an enhanced green chemistry screening and selection process for 100 percent of new chemicals and gases by 2020.” Koch said the next step is to develop and pilot a screening tool to evaluate chemicals. The deciding factors are effectiveness in the manufacturing process and the best outcome for envisionmental sustainability. But, she pointed out, decisions on which chemicals to use are made at Intel headquarters, not in Rio Rancho.  Another goal for 2020 is to reduce direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 10 percent compared to 2010. She said much of that would come from more efficient use of the factories’ combustion equipment, such as boilers and gas-fired incinerators to burn off waste volatile organic compounds. (See Corrales Comment Vol.XXXIV No.20 December 5, 2015 “Greenhouse Gases From Intel Not Now Regulated.”) Draft minutes of the July CEWG meeting indicate Koch did not specifically mention reducing the industrial chemical emissions that release considerably more potent greenhouse gases than carbon. Instead, she said intended reductions in Intel’s GHG are tied to the kind of energy being used there. “As part of our 2015 Climate Change Pledge, we committed to two new goals,” Koch said, “to continue our support of green power purchasing and triple our use of on-site alternative energy by 2020.” Another goal called for Intel worldwide to “achieve cumulative energy savings of four billion kilowatt/hours  from  2012 to 2020. Locally, some of that would be done by “taking large compressors and capturing waste heat to introduce heat into hot water loops used for heating purposes, rather than generating steam.” Koch said Intel’s goal is to “reduce water use on a per unit basis below the 2010 level by 2020.” She said that would be difficult companywide because Intel’s latest  manufacturing technology uses more water. But for the same reason, Intel New Mexico will help meet that goal, where, she said, its facilities “conserved over 12 million gallons of water in 2015.” Among other goals, Intel will try to recycle 90 percent of its nonhazardous waste by 2020.   Prev Next CREATE A LOGIN ACCOUNT Please take a moment to create account for full, free access to the website.

Intel Sends In A Second Batch Of Graphics Driver Updates For Linux 4.9 Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 24 August 2016 at 09:22 AM EDT. 8 Comments Earlier this month Intel submitted their first batch of i915 DRM driver updates to DRM-Next that in turn is now targeting the Linux 4.9 kernel. A second batch of new feature material was submitted today. The latest batch of Intel DRM driver changes that are now queued up for in turn landing with Linux 4.9 include atomic mode-setting fixes, GuC submission improvements, GGTT improvements, prep work for multi-plane framebuffers, GEM tracking changes, tuning to the command parser, frame-buffer compression changes, and other low-level graphics driver changes. Much of this work was led by Intel's Chris Wilson with being responsible for 102 of the patches while the other developers were responsible for just about 40 of these patches. A complete list of changes can be found via this dri-devel message. Expect more Intel DRM material to still land in the weeks ahead for hitting the Linux 4.9 merge window. 8 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Credit: Lucas Zallio More like this Android Studio for beginners, Part 3: Build and run the app Android Studio for beginners, Part 2: Explore and code the app Choosing your Java IDE For a few years now it's been clear that Android dominates the mobile OS landscape. This Java-based technology has sparked a new gold rush, with programmers competing to make money from their mobile apps. Android jobs are also plentiful, as shown by a quick job search using Indeed.com. To be successful, Android developers need a good grasp of the Java language, Android APIs, and Android app architecture. It's also essential to use an appropriate and effective development environment. For many years, Eclipse IDE with the ADT plugin was the preferred platform for Android development. Today it's Android Studio. If you're new to Android Studio, this tutorial series will get you started. I'll briefly introduce the Android development platform, then show you how to download, install, and run the software. After that, we'll spend most of our time actually using Android Studio to develop an animated mobile app. In Part 1 you'll start up your first Android project and get to know the project workspace in Android Studio. In Part 2 you'll code the app, learning how to use Android Studio to enter source code and resources into the project. Finally, in Part 3 we'll build and run the app using both an emulated hardware device and an Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7" tablet. After you're comfortable with developing a basic mobile app in Android Studio, we'll explore more advanced topics like debugging, performance monitoring, and profiling with Android Studio. We'll also look at extending Android Studio with three useful plugins. Get started with Android Studio Android Studio is Google's officially supported IDE for developing Android apps. Based on IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio is freely available under Apache License 2.0. The most recent stable version, 2.1.1, includes the following features: A unified environment where you can develop for all Android devices. Support for building Android TV apps and Android Wear apps. Template-based wizards to create common Android designs and components. A rich layout editor that lets users drag-and-drop user interface components, and that offers an option to preview layouts on multiple screen configurations. Android-specific refactoring and quick fixes. Gradle-based build support. Lint tools to catch performance, usability, version compatibility, and other problems. ProGuard integration and app-signing capabilities. A fast and feature-rich emulator. Instant Run to push changes to your running app without building a new APK (Application PacKage Zip file). Built-in support for Google Cloud Platform, enabling integration with Google Cloud Messaging and App Engine. C++ and NDK support. Plugin architecture for extending Android Studio via plugins. Download Android Studio Google provides Android Studio for the Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux platforms. You can download this software from the Android Studio homepage. (You'll also find the traditional SDKs, with Android Studio's command-line tools, available from the Downloads page.) Before downloading Android Studio, make sure your platform meets one of the following requirements: Windows OS Microsoft Windows 7/8/10 (32-bit or 64-bit) 2 GB RAM minimum, 8 GB RAM recommended 2 GB of available disk space minimum, 4 GB Recommended (500 MB for IDE + 1.5 GB for Android SDK and emulator system image) 1280 x 800 minimum screen resolution JDK 8 For accelerated emulator: 64-bit operating system and Intel processor with support for Intel VT-x, Intel EM64T (Intel 64), and Execute Disable (XD) Bit functionality Mac OS Mac OS X 10.8.5 or higher, up to 10.11.4 (El Capitan) 2 GB RAM minimum, 8 GB RAM recommended 2 GB of available disk space minimum, 4 GB Recommended (500 MB for IDE + 1.5 GB for Android SDK and emulator system image) 1280 x 800 minimum screen resolution JDK 6 Linux OS GNOME or KDE desktop: Tested on Ubuntu 12.04, Precise Pangolin (64-bit distribution capable of running 32-bit applications) 64-bit distribution capable of running 32-bit applications GNU C Library (glibc) 2.11 or later 2 GB RAM minimum, 8 GB RAM recommended 2 GB of available disk space minimum, 4 GB Recommended (500 MB for IDE + 1.5 GB for Android SDK and emulator system image) 1280 x 800 minimum screen resolution JDK 8 For accelerated emulator: Intel processor with support for Intel VT-x, Intel EM64T (Intel 64), and Execute Disable (XD) Bit functionality, or AMD processor with support for AMD Virtualization (AMD-V) Once you've ensured your operating system is compatible with Android Studio 2.1.1, download the appropriate Android Studio distribution file. The Android Studio download page auto-detected that I'm running 64-bit Windows 8.1 and selected android-studio-bundle-143.2821654-windows.exe for me to download. Bundled installer and Android SDK android-studio-bundle-143.2821654-windows.exe includes an installer and the Android SDK. Alternatively, I could have downloaded a distribution file without the installer and without the SDK. Installing Android Studio on 64-bit Windows 8.1 I launched android-studio-bundle-143.2821654-windows.exe to start the installation process. The installer responded by presenting the Android Studio Setup dialog box shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Set up Android Studio Clicking Next took me to the following dialog box, which gives you the option to decline installing the Android SDK (included with the installer) and an Android Virtual Device (AVD). Figure 2. Do you want to install the Android SDK and AVD? I chose to keep the default settings. After clicking Next, you'll be taken to the license agreement dialog box. Accept the license to continue the installation. Figure 3. Accept the license agreement to continue installation The next dialog box invites you to change the installation locations for Android Studio and the Android SDK. Figure 4. Set the Android Studio and Android SDK installation locations  Change the location or accept the default locations and click Next. The installer defaults to creating a shortcut for launching this program, or you can choose to decline. I recommend that you create the shortcut, then click the Install button to begin installation. Figure 5. Create a new shortcut for Android Studio  The resulting dialog box shows the progress of installing Android Studio and the Android SDK. Clicking the Show Details button will let you view detailed information about the installation progress. The dialog box will inform you when installation has finished. When you click Next, you should see the following: Figure 6. Leave the Start Android Studio check box checked to run this software To complete your installation, leave the Start Android Studio box checked and click Finish. Running Android Studio Android Studio presents a splash screen when it starts running: Figure 7. Android Studio's start screen On your first run, you'll be asked to respond to several configuration-oriented dialog boxes. The first dialog box focuses on importing settings from any previously installed version of Android Studio. Figure 8. Import settings If you're like me, and don't have a previously installed version, you can just keep the default setting and click OK. Android Studio will respond with a slightly enhanced version of the splash screen, followed by the Android Studio Setup Wizard dialog box: Figure 9. Validate your Android SDK and development environment setup When you click Next, the setup wizard invites you to select an installation type for your SDK components. For now I recommend you keep the default standard setting. Figure 10. Choose an installation type Click Next and verify your settings, then click Finish to continue. Figure 11. Review settings The wizard will download and unzip various components. Click Show Details if you want to see more information about the archives being downloaded and their contents. Figure 12. The wizard downloads and unzips Android Studio components If your computer isn't Intel based, you might get an unpleasant surprise after the components have completely downloaded and unzipped: Figure 13. Intel-based hardware acceleration is unavailable Your options are to either put up with the slow emulator or use an Android device to speed up development. I'll discuss the latter option later in the tutorial. Finally, click Finish to complete the wizard. You should see the Welcome to Android Studio dialog box: Figure 14. Welcome to Android Studio  You'll use this dialog to start up a new Android Studio project, work with an existing project, and more. You can access it anytime by double-clicking the Android Studio shortcut on your desktop. Your first Android Studio mobile app The quickest way to get to know Android Studio is to use it to develop an app. We'll start with a variation on the "Hello, World" application: a little mobile app that displays a "Welcome to Android" message. In the steps that follow, you'll start a new Android Studio project and get to know the project workspace, including the project editor that you'll use to code the app in Part 2. Starting a new project From our setup so far, you should still have Android Studio running with the Welcome to Android Studio dialog box. From here, click Start a new Android Studio project. Android Studio will respond with the Create New Project dialog box shown in Figure 15. Figure 15. Create a new project  Enter W2A (Welcome to Android) as the application name and javajeff.ca as the company domain name. You should then see C:\Users\jeffrey\AndroidStudioProjects\W2A as the project location. Click Next to select your target devices. Figure 16. Select your target device categories  Android Studio lets you select form factors, or categories of target devices, for every app you create. I would have preferred to keep the default API 15: Android 4.0.3 (IceCreamSandwich) minimum SDK setting (under Phone and Tablet), which is supported by my Amazon Kindle Fire HD tablet. Because Android Studio doesn't currently support this API level (even when you add the 4.0.3 system image via the SDK Manager), I changed this setting to API 14: Android 4.0 (IceCreamSandwich), which is also supported by my tablet. Click Next, and you will be given the opportunity to choose a template for your app's main activity. For now we'll stick with Empty Activity. Select this template and click Next. Figure 17. Specify an activity template Next you'll customize the activity: Figure 18. Customize your activity Enter W2A as the activity name and main as the layout name, and click Finish to complete this step. Android Studio will respond that it is creating the project, then take you to the project workspace. Figure 19. Android Studio workspace The project workspace is organized around a menu bar, a tool bar, a work area, additional components that lead to more windows (such as a Gradle Console window), and a status bar. Also note the Tip of the Day dialog box, which you can disable if you like. Accessing AVD Manager or SDK Manager from menu and tool bar To access the traditional AVD Manager or SDK Manager, select Android from the Tools menu followed by AVD Manager or SDK Manager from the resulting pop-up menu (or click their tool bar icons). The project and editor windows When you enter the project workspace, W2A is identified as the current project, but you won't immediately see the project details. After a few moments, these details will appear in two new windows. Figure 20. The project and editor windows The project window is organized into a tree whose main branches are App and Gradle Scripts. The App branch is further organized into manifests, java, and res subbranches: manifests stores AndroidManifest.xml, which is an XML file that describes the structure of an Android app. This file also records permission settings (where applicable) and other details about the app. java stores an app's Java source files according to a package hierarchy, which is ca.javajeff.w2a in this example. res stores an app's resource files, which are organized into drawable, layout, mipmap, and values subbranches: drawable: an initially empty location in which to store an app's artwork layout: a location containing an app's layout files; initially, main.xml (the main activity's layout file) is stored here mipmap: a location containing various ic_launcher.png files that store launcher screen icons of different resolutions values: a location containing colors.xml, dimens.xml, strings.xml, and styles.xml The Gradle Scripts branch identifies various .gradle (such as build.gradle) and .properties (such as local.properties) files that are used by the Gradle-based build system. Branch names and directory/file names Each branch/sub-branch corresponds to a directory name or to a file name. For example, res corresponds to the res directory and strings.xml corresponds to the strings.xml file. Conclusion to Part 1 You've installed and configured Android Studio and created a project for your first Android Studio mobile app; now you're ready to build your Android application. In Android Studio, this means populating your new project with Java source code and resource files for a mobile app. Turn to Part 2 when you're ready to get started with your first Android animated mobile app. Related: Java Android Developer Mobile Mobile Java Development Tools Google Jeff Friesen teaches Java technology (including Android) to everyone.

Aubinator Added To Mesa To Help Intel Driver Developers Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 24 August 2016 at 08:59 AM EDT. 1 Comment The Aubinator tool has been added to the Mesa tree for helping Intel graphics driver developers debug problems. Aubinator is a tool for reading AUB files dumped by the Intel driver and via intel_aubdump in the Intel GPU Tools package. There's been the AUB file support present in Mesa for a few years while now Aubinator as a tool for dealing with these files is being added to the Mesa source tree. The commit adding Aubinator explains, "The Aubinator tool is designed to help the driver developers in debugging the driver functionality by decoding the data in the .aub files." So nothing exciting for end-users, but will hopefully help open-source developers in figuring out Intel's graphics driver troubles. 1 Comment Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Miller August 23, 2016 10 Comments Probably the biggest news at the Intel Developer Forum last week was the company's plans for 10nm production, and particularly that the company would now be offering access to ARM's Artisan physical IP. From a manufacturing point of view, probably the biggest news at the Intel Developer Forum last week was the company's plans for 10nm production, and particularly that the company would now be offering access to ARM's Artisan physical IP. The latter is important because it shows that third-parties who use Intel's 10nm process will have access to the most advanced ARM Cortex cores and related technologies. Intel announced that LG Electronics would be its first 10nm customer; it plans to build a mobile platform based on the Intel process. This indicates that Intel intends to compete more with TSMC, Samsung, and GlobalFoundries in making ARM-based mobile processors. The announcement came from Zane Ball, general manager of Intel Custom Foundry. I found that quite interesting, but I was equally intrigued by a presentation he and Intel Senior Fellow Mark Bohr gave on the company's advanced technologies. Bohr discussed the progress Intel has made in 10nm production, saying the company is planning on volume shipments of its first 10nm products in the second half of next year. More interestingly, he said that for its 10nm process the company is getting its historical improvements in transistor gate pitch scaling, and is actually seeing better logic transistor area scaling (which it defines as gate pitch times logic cell height), than it has historically been able to do each generation. Bohr said that as scaling has slowed at some of its competitors, Intel's 10nm technology could be almost a full generation ahead of the 10nm processes of the other foundries. (Part of this is a naming question, as the foundries are using the names 14nm, 16nm and 10nm even though that measurement doesn't refer to a specific part of the process anymore. Note that TSMC and Samsung are now both promising that their 10nm processes will be ready next year, whereas historically they have been behind Intel. We won't really be able to see how good the processes are until real products are available, of course.) It's been clear that the time between nodes seems to be extending, with the "tick-tock" cadence of a new process now every two years, with microarchitecture changes in between no longer applying. Intel has previously announced that it would be shipping a third generation of 14nm CPUs this year (Kaby Lake, following Skylake and Broadwell). Bohr said the company has a "14+" process that provides a 12 percent process performance increase. He also suggested that the 10nm process would actually come in three types, supporting new products over time. Bohr also talked about how the 10nm process would support a variety of features, including transistors designed for high-performance, low leakage, high voltage, or analog designs, and with a variety of interconnect options. The company hasn't disclosed real performance numbers for the next 14nm chip expected later this year, known as Kaby Lake; and has said even less for the 10nm version expected next year, known as Cannonlake. It's good to see progress coming, but certainly it's a slowdown from the pace we once expected. At Intel Developer Forum in 2013, the company said it would have 10nm chips going into production in 2015, and 7nm following in 2017. One thing holding technology back is the lack of successful deployment of EUV lithography systems. EUV is capable of drawing finer lines because it uses light with a smaller wavelength than traditional 193nm immersion lithography. But to date, EUV systems haven't been successfully deployed for volume manufacturing, leading to more double-patterning of traditional lithography, which adds both steps and complexity. Bohr has noted that EUV will not be ready for 10nm production, and said Intel is developing its 7nm process to be compatible with either all traditional immersion lithography processes (with even more multi-patterning required) or with EUV at some layers. He recently told Semiconductor Engineering that the issues with EUV are uptime and wafers per hour, and said if EUV could resolve those issues, manufacturing could be done at a lower total cost. At a panel at the conference, Bohr noted that the number of immersion layers is increasing at a dramatic pace, and said he hopes and expects that at 7nm, EUV can replace or slow down the growth of immersion layers.

Wildfire primarily spreads through Dutch spam emails from transport companies, targeted at Dutch speakers, fooling them with a notice of a ‘missed’ delivery and steps for scheduling a new delivery by filling in a ‘special form’ attached to the message. This form is nothing more than an obfuscated dropper which infects the victim with ransomware, demanding the sum of 1.5 bitcoins to unlock their files. The group behind the ransomware netted US$79,481 (£60,240, A$104,399) in the last month by infecting 5309 systems, Intel Security chief technology officer Raj Samani and advanced threat researcher Christiaan Beek found. "The actors behind Wildfire have clearly put a lot of effort into making their spam mails look credible and very specific," they said. What’s more, like other ransomware types such as CryptoWall, Wildfire does not encrypt victims from a certain set of countries; a strong indicator that an Eastern European group could be responsible, says Intel. However, victims now have the means to unlock their data without having to part with their cash, with researchers making available an initial 1600 keys for Wildfire (with more to come) as part of the NoMoreRansom effort. “With ransomware being the most devastating type of malware currently doing the rounds any decrease in its activity is a great thing,” said Mark James, security specialist at ESET. “Always be very wary of email attachments and links from unknown sources," he added. "If you are unfortunate enough to be infected with ransomware and do not have a current backup to restore from then make sure you check around to see if public decryption keys are available."

The PC market rose in Q2 from the previous quarter, but declined from the same quarter last year, largely due to data center and servers. Some PC suppliers are seeing growth in hope 2-in-1 systems and gaming desktops and notebooks, they hope this will offset the slow down the in PC shipments. While there are high ASP systems, however the two segments combined can only contribute around 10 million unit shipments a year, less than the decline of the total PC market. Overall GPU shipments (rounded up) decreased -4% from last quarter, AMD decreased -1% Nvidia decreased -20% and Intel, decreased -1% Year-to-year total GPU shipments decreased -10%, desktop graphics decreased -6%, notebooks decreased -12%. Graphics processors, stand-alone discrete devices, and embedded processor-based GPUs are ubiquitous and essential components in all systems and devices today from handheld mobile devices, PCs, and workstations, to TVs, servers, vehicle systems, signage, game consoles, medical equipment, and wearables. New technologies and semiconductor manufacturing processes are taking advantage of the ability of GPU power to scale. The GPU drives the screen of every device we encounter-it is the human-machine interface. The second quarter is typically down in the seasonality cycles of the past. For Q2'16 we saw it decrease -4.0% from last quarter, and was below the ten-year average of 2.44%. Quick highlights AMD's overall unit shipments decreased -1.41% quarter-to-quarter, Intel's total shipments decreased -0.74% from last quarter, and Nvidia's decreased -20.01%. The attach rate of GPUs (includes integrated and discrete GPUs) to PCs for the quarter was 132% which was down -7% from last quarter. Discrete GPUs were in 27.78% of PCs, which is down -4.94%. The overall PC market increased 1.06% quarter-to-quarter, and decreased -5.83% year-to-year. Desktop graphics add-in boards (AIBs) that use discrete GPUs decreased -20.81% from last quarter, reflecting seasonality and the clearing out of inventory from older models and Nvidia introduced several new boards in Q2. Q2'16 saw a decrease in tablet shipments from last quarter. GPUs are traditionally a leading indicator of the market, since a GPU goes into every system before it is shipped, and most of the PC vendors are guiding cautiously for Q3'16. Once again, the Gaming PC segment, where higher-end GPUs are used, was a bright spot in the market in the quarter. One thing to note, the Gaming PC segment, where higher-end GPUs are used, continues to deliver growth for PC makers. New gaming content and the promise of Virtual Reality help drive the demand for gaming desktops and notebooks. The quarter in general AMD's shipments of desktop heterogeneous GPU/CPUs, i.e., APUs, for desktops decreased -22.2% from the previous quarter. AMD's shipments were down -0.4% in notebooks. Desktop discrete GPUs increased 4.03% from last quarter, and notebook discrete shipments decreased -3.7%. AMD's total PC graphics shipments decreased -1.4% from the previous quarter. Intel's desktop processor embedded graphics (EPGs) shipments decreased from last quarter by -4.5% and notebook processors increased by 1.4%, and total PC graphics shipments decreased -0.7% from last quarter. Nvidia's desktop discrete GPU shipments were down -28.15% from last quarter; and the company's notebook discrete GPU shipments decreased -5.7%, and total PC graphics shipments decreased -20.0% from last quarter. Total discrete GPUs (desktop and notebook) shipments decreased -14.19% from the last quarter, and decreased -1.03% from last year. Sales of discrete GPUs fluctuate due to a variety of factors (timing, memory pricing, etc.), new product introductions, and the influence of integrated graphics. Overall, the CAGR from 2014 to 2017 is now -8%. Ninety-nine percent of Intel's non-server processors have graphics, and over 66% of AMD's non-server processors contain integrated graphics; AMD still ships integrated graphics chipsets (IGPs). The report contains the following content: Worldwide GPU and PC Shipment Volume, 1994 to 2020. Detailed worldwide GPU Shipment Volume, 1Q 2001 to 2Q 2016, and forecast to 2020.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter China is one of the world’s largest consumers of semiconductor devices thanks to its manufacturing might, and is planning to spend more than $100 billion to become also a premier supplier to the planet. The global consultancy estimates that by 2020, almost 55 percent of the world’s memory, logic and analog chips will flow to or through the country. But the vast majority of the microchips that act as the brains of products like Apple Inc.’s iPhone are largely imported from companies like Intel Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co. The government in 2014 moved to change this with plans to invest more than $100 billion and become a leading global player. It’s also driven consolidation among domestic suppliers to maximize its investments, including the $2.8 billion merger of Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. and Wuhan Xinxin Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. announced last month. China’s effort to build a world-leading semiconductor industry is part of a broader effort to wean itself off foreign technology. But financial investment will not be enough to buy leadership of the semiconductor sector, which is worth around $1 trillion according to Singapore-based Bain partner Kevin Meehan. The country currently makes just 15 percent of the semiconductors it consumes, Bain said in a report. And by 2020, the consultancy expects Chinese-based plants to produce just 7 percent of the world’s microchips, barely up from current levels. “China is coming at it in a pretty smart and intelligent way,” he said. “But I don’t see a path for them to own leading-edge processor technology and that is the foundation of Intel, the foundation of Samsung’s success.” To read a Gadfly column on China’s evolving chip industry, click here. Efforts by Chinese companies to buy rivals with intellectual property in the processor and memory markets have run afoul of regulators around the world. Plans for a $3.8 billion investment in Western Digital Corp. were scrapped amid a U.S. security review and investments in Taiwanese chip companies face regulatory obstacles and have stoked political tension. “Assuming they can spend it all, the biggest risk is that they end up with a whole bunch of fragmented and weak follower positions,” Meehan said. “There’s ways for them to have influence over greater than 10 percent if they’re partnering well, but otherwise I think you’re essentially capped there.” Meehan said China’s semiconductor makers could eventually learn from partnerships with global giants and become one of the larger suppliers of key components like computer memory. Both Intel and Qualcomm Inc. have agreed to build semiconductor fabrication plants there in partnership with local providers. “If you take a long view -- not five years but decades -- then certainly you’d have to believe there’s some absorption,” he said. "But people are careful not to put their leading edge IP in China.” “I don’t see a way to get there without licensing or buying.” (A previous version of the story corrected the amount that China supplies the world) Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

This year has a number of talks about power management, upcoming IBM CPUs, upcoming Intel CPUs, upcoming NVIDIA SoCs and the final talk of the final day is from AMD, discussing Zen in even more depth than the previous week. While we were unable to attend the event in person, we managed to get some hands on time with information and put questions to Mike Clark, AMD Senior Fellow and design engineer. What We Learned Last Week: L1/L2/L3 Caches and the Micro-Op Buffer In AMD’s initial presentation for the general media, we were given a sense of the microarchitecture layout. We covered the material, but it contained a number of highlights. AMD Zen Microarchitecture: Dual Schedulers, Micro-op Cache and Memory Hierarchy Revealed AMD Server CPUs and Motherboard Analysis Unpacking AMD's Zen Benchmark: Is Zen actually 2% Faster than Broadwell? First up, and the most important, was the announcement of the inclusion of a micro-op cache. This allows for instructions that are frequently used to be closer to the micro-op queue and saves a trip through the core and caches to load the desired information. Typically micro-op caches are still relatively small, and while AMD isn’t giving any information for size and accessibility, we know that Intel’s version can support 1536 uOps with 8-way associativity; we expect AMD’s to be similar though there are many options in play. Secondly is the cache structure. We were given details for the L1, L2 and L3 cache sizes, along with associativity, to compare it to former microarchitectures as well as Intel’s offering. CPU Cache Comparison   Zen HEDT Bulldozer HEDT Excavator   Skylake Broadwell HEDT L1-I 64KB/core 64KB/module 96KB/module 32KB/core 32KB/core 4-way 2-way 3-way 8-way 8-way L1-D 32KB/core 16KB/thread 32KB/thread 32KB/core 32KB/core 8-way 4-way 8-way 8-way 8-way L2 512KB/core 1MB/thread 512KB/thread 256KB/core 256KB/core 8-way 16-way 16-way 4-way 8-way L3 2MB/core 1MB/thread - >2MB/core 1.5-3MB/core 16-way 64-way - 16-way 16/20-way L3 Type Victim Victim - Write-back Write-back In this case, AMD has given Zen a 64KB L1 Instruction cache per core with 4-way associativity, with a lop-sided 32KB L1 Data cache per core with 8-way associativity. The size and accessibility determines how frequently a cache line is missed, and it is typically a trade-off for die area and power (larger caches require more die area, more associativity usually costs power). The instruction cache, per cycle, can afford a 32byte fetch while the data cache allows for 2x 16-byte loads and one 16-byte store per cycle. AMD stated that allowing two D-cache loads per cycle is more representative of the most workloads that end up with more loads than stores. The L2 is a large 512 KB, 8-way cache per core. This is double the size of Intel’s 256 KB 4-way cache in Skylake or 256 KB 8-way cache in Broadwell. Typically doubling the cache size affords a 1.414 (square root of 2) better chance of a cache hit, reducing the need to go further out to find data, but comes at the expense of die area. This will have a big impact on a lot of performance metrics, and AMD is promoting faster cache-to-cache transfers than previous generations. Both the L1 and L2 caches are write-back caches, improving over the L1 write-through cache in Bulldozer. The L3 cache is an 8MB 16-way cache, although at the time last week it was not specified over how many cores this was. From the data release today, we can confirm rumors that this 8 MB cache is split over a four-core module, affording 2 MB of L3 cache per core or 16 MB of L3 cache for the whole 8-core Zen CPU. These two 8 MB caches are separate, so act as a last-level cache per 4-core module with the appropriate hooks into the other L3 to determine if data is needed. As part of the talk today we also learned that the L3 is a pure victim cache for L1/L2 victims, rather than a cache for prefetch/demand data, which tempers the expectations a little but the large L2 will make up for this. We’ll discuss it as part of today’s announcement. The mid-week release also gave insight into the dual schedulers, one for INT and another for FP, which is different to Intel’s joint scheduler/buffer implementation. The talk at Hot Chips goes into detail about how the dispatch and schedulers operate The New Information As part of the Hot Chips presentation, AMD is reaffirming its commitment to at least +40% IPC improvement over Excavator. This has specifically been listed as a throughput goal at an equivalent energy per cycle, resulting in an increase in efficiency. Obviously a number of benefits come from moving the 28nm TSMC process to GloFo’s 14nm FinFET process which is used via a Samsung licence. Both the smaller node and FinFET improvements have been well documented so we won’t go over them here, but AMD is stating that Zen is much more than this as a direct improvement to immediate performance, not just efficiency. While Zen is initially a high-performance x86 core at heart, it is designed to scale all the way from notebooks to supercomputers, or from where the Cat cores (such as Jaguar and Puma) were all the way up to the old Opterons and beyond, all with at least +40% IPC. The first immediate image out of the presentation is the CPU Complex (a CCX), which shows the Zen core design as a four-CPU cluster with caches. This shows the L2/L3 cache breakdown, and also confirms 2MB of L3 per core with 8 MB of L3 per CCX. It also states that the L3 is mostly exclusive of the L2 cache, which stems from the L3 cache as a victim cache for L2 data. AMD is stating that the protocols involved in the L3 cache design allow each core to access the L3 of each other core with an average (but a range) of latencies. Over the next few pages, we’ll go through the slides. They detail more information about the application of Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT), New Instructions, the size of various queues and buffers, the back-end of the design, the front-end of the design, fetch, decode, execute, load/store and retire segments.

POST A COMMENT 104 Comments View All Comments CrazyElf - Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - link If they can really get a 40% improvement over Excavator, and I mean 40% on average, not on a few select benchmarks, then AMD has a serious chance of being a compelling option once again. I'm hoping to see more improvements on Floating Point, which was comically bad in Bulldozer. A big part of the problem is that we don't know how well Zen will clock or the power consumption. Still, this should be a major leap in performance overall. We'll have to wait for the launch day benchmarks to see the true story. Another big concern is the platform. CPU performance is only part of the story. We need a good platform that can rival the Z170 and Intel HEDT platforms for this to be compelling on the desktop. For mobile, there will have to be good dual channel Zen APUs (Carrizo, as Anandtech noted was heavily gimped by poor quality OEM designs obsessed with cost cutting). Reply jabber - Wednesday, August 24, 2016 - link Yeah I don't think OEMs and others are that worried about supporting AMD. AMD have withered away so much, making AMD CPU capable gear must have become a very minor part of say ASUS/Gigabyte/MSI etc. revenue stream. Making AMD based graphics cards is okay but motherboards? Not so much. Reply teuast - Wednesday, August 24, 2016 - link I wouldn't speak so soon. Just this year MSI and Gigabyte (at least) have introduced new AM3+ boards with USB 3.1 and PCIe 3.0. Why, I'm not sure, but if they're doing that for something as old and deprecated as the FX chips, it would defy logic for Zen to come out and for them to only release a few token efforts. I will say, if the CPUs are good but you're right about OEMs not being concerned with support, then the first OEM to say "hey, why don't we make some actually good AM4 boards?" is going to make an absolute killing. Reply h4rm0ny - Thursday, August 25, 2016 - link Are you sure about the PCI-E v3 on AM3+ motherboards? I can find recent releases that have USB3.1 and M.2, but none that support PCI-Ev3. Can you link me or provide a model number? I didn't think 3rd generation PCI-E was possible on the Bulldozer line. Reply SKD007 - Thursday, August 25, 2016 - link SABERTOOTH 990FX/GEN3 R2.0 Reply SKD007 - Thursday, August 25, 2016 - link https://www.asus.com/Motherboards/SABERTOOTH_990FX... Reply Outlander_04 - Thursday, August 25, 2016 - link A little misleading . The Graphics pci-e controller is built in to an FX processor so adding a pci-e 3 standard slot to a motherboard will make no difference to actual bandwidth. Not an issue though since x16 pci-e 2 has the same bandwidth as x8 pci-e 3 and intel boards with SLI/crossfire ability running at x8/x8 do not choke any current graphics card Reply h4rm0ny - Thursday, August 25, 2016 - link What about PCI-E SSDs? Can I get full bandwidth on those? I agree about the graphics cards but that's not so important to me. If I can get full PCI-Ev3 x4 performance for an SSD then I'll pribably buy this as a hold-over until Zen. Thanks fir the link! Reply fanofanand - Friday, August 26, 2016 - link Pci-e 3.0 x4 should be the same as 2.0 x 8. So long as you have a vacant x8 it should theoretically work the same. Reply extide - Wednesday, September 07, 2016 - link I think they use a PLX chip and turn the 32 2.0 lanes from the FX chip into 16 3.0 lanes.

A look at whether such an arrangement makes sense at some point in the future. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Aug 23, 2016 at 7:23PM Image source: Intel.  At microprocessor giant Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) developer forum earlier this month, the company disclosed that it will build a future mobile processor for LG Electronics on the former's upcoming 10-nanometer chip manufacturing technology. Although the financial impact of this deal to Intel is unlikely to be significant for a number of reasons (more on that in a coming column), this has rekindled the following, seemingly age-old question: "Does this mean that Intel will build future A-series processors for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)?" Intel's next shot is in the 2018 iPhone The A10 chip inside the upcoming iPhone 7 and 7 Plus series of smartphones is expected to be manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) on its current-generation 16-nanometer FinFET Plus manufacturing technology. The A10 is expected to be manufactured in TSMC's 10-nanometer manufacturing technology, which should be in mass production a couple of quarters before Intel's own 10-nanometer technology is in production. Intel's next real shot at building the processor for the iPhone, then, would be for the A12 chip that will go inside the 2018 iPhone. The two processes that Apple could use for this product and likely achieve similar performance, power, and area metrics would be Intel's 10-nanometer technology and TSMC's 7-nanometer technology. Going with Intel might be an unnecessary risk for the A12; A13 more likely Apple is certainly fond of supplier diversity and likes to have multiple sources for components to get better pricing on said components. It would be in Apple's best interests to have multiple strong, viable chip manufacturing partners, especially in light of a recent report from Digitimes claiming that Apple dares not try to squeeze TSMC for better pricing since it has reportedly found it "difficult to find alternative sources" to TSMC. That being said, Intel doesn't have a proven track record of being able to ramp up tens of millions of a third party's chip design on a bleeding-edge chip manufacturing technology. TSMC does. Over the long term, Apple may very well choose to go through the work to second-source a design at Intel. However, I wouldn't expect Apple to risk it with the A12. I could see Apple giving Intel a shot for the A13 for the 2019 iPhone. By then, Apple will have gotten to see how Intel handled the production ramp-up of LG's upcoming 10-nanometer chip, and Intel's 10-nanometer process should be quite mature. It will have been in production for about a year-and-a-half when it comes time to ramp up the A13. If Intel shows it can deliver on being a world-class contract manufacturer for third-party chipmakers, then I could see Apple giving Intel a minority allocation of the A13, on perhaps 20% to 30% of the orders. This has to be what Intel is gunning for At the end of the day, the only potential foundry deal in the mobile market that would truly be worth all of the investment that Intel seems to be making into its contract chip manufacturing business would be a win at Apple. Winning, and sustaining, business at Apple would drive both significant unit volumes as well as non-trivial revenues. It would also, in my view, drive improved execution at the chipmaker in terms of ramping up new manufacturing technologies. If Intel can win the Apple business, losing it in future generations would be painful, so this could potentially light a fire under Intel to really succeed. Not only would improved execution help Intel try to hang on to business with Apple, but it would accelerate the pace of manufacturing innovation at Intel as a whole, which would help improve the competitiveness of all of Intel's product lines -- PCs, servers, and the Internet of Things. Whether Intel can ultimately win Apple -- and, if it does, whether it can keep it -- as a foundry customer remains to be seen. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

The company is coming out of a controlled release of KWaaS with several long standing customers including Intel and holds many patents in this space. eXalt's KWaaS platform generates rules driven digital workers to bridge the many knowledge gaps that stall the B2B sales process, making processes digital end-to-end without human touch, and providing a competitive advantage in the marketplace. "Our vision is to offer digital workers to complement human workers for the front to back B2B sales process. Any B2B Vendor, Distributor or Reseller in single or multi-tier channel sales can scale their output to be many times their peers by leveraging KWaaS to create digital workers." said Leslie Swanson, President and Chief Executive Officer, eXalt Solutions. "Traditional B2B enterprises will not be able to keep up with competitors, large and small, who leverage digital workers. First movers are successfully leveraging digital workers in front office sales to advise buyers and back office operations to gain agility in administrative tasks. Ignoring digital workers as a growth strategy is a dangerous choice in today's accelerated digital economy." A recent report* by McKinsey& Company estimates that by 2025 the automation of knowledge work will have an economic impact of between $5-7 trillion, and will impact 230+ million knowledge workers globally. eXalt has found that as much as 50-70% of the knowledge work in the B2B sales process alone is rules-based and repetitive and can be addressed with digital workers. "Digital labor is rapidly becoming indispensable to companies wanting to stay competitive in the marketplace," said Stephen Hendrick, Principal Analyst at Enterprise Strategy Group. "It enables companies to scale more rapidly and to produce more with their existing employee base. eXalt's Knowledge Work-as-a Service (KWaaS) offering is wildly unique, as it takes digital transformation throughout the entire organization." Knowledge Work Automation Better Together Philosophy eXalt's philosophy is 'Better Together' where human and digital workers produce more at a higher level of quality as a team -- giving their customers unlimited scale. eXalt is the only company to weave an end-to-end fabric of Digital Threads from Sales through Delivery where Digital Workers take over the rules-based repetitive tasks, bringing companies closer to customers, freeing up their best people to do high value work, and enabling significant cost savings overall. In the past automation was seen as a 'tool' used by human labor but now Digital Workers are independent co-workers and a necessity for every team in the future. Digital transformation can be a daunting task for companies who are often siloed, who lack expertise or resources, or who mistakenly think digital transformation is yet another IT project. eXalt addresses these issues by making it easy. Because eXalt's KWaaS platform is a service, implementation it can be completed in weeks without a major outsourcing or IT project. Marketing, eCommerce or operational executives can specify business rules changes that eXalt loads into its cloud platform without any software or IT involvement. Industry Trends Moving Rapidly Toward eXalt's Knowledge Work Automation The traditional B2B sales process is notoriously slow and has many knowledge gaps that are bridged by high touch manual labor across a vast partner ecosystem. Recent trends are making it difficult for companies to rely on traditional phone sales or simple Catalog Web sites: 1) Social Change: Talking to a sales rep is annoying, slow and error prone. Buyers want modern digital self service. 2) Technical Change: Technology is better than humans in weaving together solutions from thousands of vendors with 1,000-100,000's skus each undergoing constant change.. 3) Economic Change: Margins have been shrinking and require lower touch process 4) Process Change: Sales reps not contacted until buyers are 2/3rd of the way though the decision process. 5) Expectations Changing for Agility: B2B buyers need information from both the reseller's back-office and an entire partner ecosystem of distributors, vendors and integrators. Buyers demand agility and expect this information to be retrieved, aggregated and presented almost instantaneously without human delay. eXalt's KWaaS platform offers three types of Digital Workers to scale the B2B sales process: : Digital Advisors - Help buyers access smarter ways to shop and solve their problems Digital Administrators - Make businesses more connected to themselves and each other resulting in agility Digital Analysts - Offer businesses improved visibility and anticipate and act on change Companies gain unprecedented customer intimacy through advanced self-service and ecommerce offerings, and they immediately reduce operational costs and delays, while gaining visibility for the necessary process refinements that help them work smarter. "eXalt is a leader in building Solutions Sales Portals with advanced rules engines powering the world's largest technology channel sites," Swanson added. "In developing ecommerce portals for Vendors, Distributors and Resellers, we were helping them begin to digitally transform their enterprises before digital transformation was even a concept. Increasing scale and velocity has been our core business for 15 Years. Digital Transformation is a natural next step in our company's growth and success." In the last year eXalt Solutions re-architected its platform to specifically address Knowledge Work Automation in the enterprise and launched a new website (www.exaltsolutions.com) that better reflects their new growth strategy for Digital Transformation. eXalt's affordable pricing plans are charged by the transaction for smaller organizations and offer an unlimited plan for large enterprises. * Disruptive technologies: Advances that will transform life, business, and the global economy, McKinsey & Co., May 2013 About eXalt Solutions, Inc. Our mission is to make business digital first by making processes digital end-to-end without human touch enabling companies to sell more, more profitably. Our patented Knowledge Work as a Service (KWaaS) cloud platform scales out the B2B enterprise with three types of digital workers: Digital Advisors help buyers access smarter ways to shop and solve their problems, Digital Administrators make businesses more connected to themselves and each other resulting in agility and Digital Analysts that offer business improved visibility, and can anticipate and act on change. eXalt's philosophy is Better Together where humans and digital labor produce more at a higher level of quality as a team - giving our customers unlimited scale.

Ga verder Meer informatie Software-update: Kodi 17.0 bèta 1 Door Japke Rosink, donderdag 25 augustus 2016 12:05, 35 reacties • Feedback Bron: Kodi, submitter: -Z- De eerste bètaversie van Kodi 17.0 is eerder deze week beschikbaar gemaakt zoals je ook al in de nieuws-hoek kon lezen. Deze crossplatform-mediacentersoftware wordt ontwikkeld voor Windows, OS X, Linux, Android en iOS. In versie 17.0 is de mogelijkheid voor het afspelen van 10bit- en hevc-materiaal toegevoegd, in combinatie met gpu's van Intel of Nvidia die daar ondersteuning voor bieden. Ook de standaard-skin is gewijzigd naar Estuary en voor apparaten met een aanraakscherm is dat Estouchy geworden. Volgens de ontwikkelaars zijn de verschillen tussen de eerste bètaversie en de derde alfa klein, het zou met name gaan om kleine oplossingen en onderhuidse verbeteringen. De aankondiging van deze uitgave ziet er als volgt uit: Kodi v17 “Krypton” Beta 1 We are excited to announce the first beta of Kodi 17, codenamed Krypton. Kodi 17 features a huge amount of work in areas like video playback, live TV and PVR/DVR, the music library, skinning and more. It features a new default skin, as well as a new default touchscreen skinned, named Estuary and Estouchy, respectively. The changes between Alpha 3 and Beta 1 are mainly limited to minor fixes and under the hood improvements, so for this first beta, we’ll instead take some time to review a few of the really visible changes in Kodi 17. Estuary and Estouchy Without question, the biggest visual change from Kodi 16 to 17 is the new default skin Estuary. This skin pulls a dramatic amount of content to the homescreen, including much from your music and video libraries, commonly used add-ons, and links to adding new video/music sources and installing new add-ons. It also enables color and theme changes within the skin, and overall pulls Kodi into the present day of UI design. For a full review of Estuary (and its touchscreen counterpart Estouchy), see the Estuary blogpost. It should be noted that this is only the default skin. You are, of course, welcome to continue using whatever skin you might prefer, including the previous default skin Confluence. A Cleaner, Clearer Settings Section The Kodi settings area has always seemed to require some sort of advanced degree (or a similar amount of related experience) to navigate effectively. With that in mind, we have spent the better part of a year cleaning up and reorganizing Settings with the ultimate goal of making the section, if not friendly, then at least clearer for new and journeymen Kodi users. We’ve also made it possible to point Kodi to new media sources from the settings menu, a requested feature for many years. An Improved Music Library Many would argue that the Kodi music library has not seen the same degree of development and support as the video library over the past few years. With Kodi 17, that has changed. The improved music library now supports better tag reading and scraping, better handling of albums and artists with the addition of adding artist role (such as composer, conductor, DJ, etc.). Additionally, certain files and websites support musical “mood,” which means you can now select your music based on mood, rather than artist or genre. Live TV and PVR/DVR Improvements For a full list, see the Kodi Alpha 3 write-up, but the Live TV and PVR/DVR component of Kodi has seen just as much improvement with Krypton as the music library. Channels can now be organized by last played, so if you really only watch 5 or 6 of your 300 channels, those can always be at the top of the list. Timers and Timer Rules are now clearer and better organized and timers are much smarter now. For example, if you set a Timer to record one episode of a show, you can transform it so that it records an entire series. And that’s really only the cream on top. Check the alpha 3 blogpost for more. Finally, only the channels you actually watch need be listed at the top. VideoPlayer While the average user might not notice this massive under-the-hood improvement, we feel remiss in not mentioning it. The switch from Kodi’s old DVDPlayer to the new, modern VideoPlayer may be one of the most massive re-writes in Kodi’s long history. A longer, and more detailed discussion of the changes in VideoPlayer may be found in the Alpha 2 write-up, but the important take-away is that this rewrite likely won’t affect users much right now, but should vastly improve the Kodi experience over the next few years. With that said, there are some improvements you may see right away. In particular, DVD playback finally has hardware acceleration. A/V syncing has improved. Video streams can now be selected, just like different language audio streams or subtitles, useful for things like concert DVDs, where you can now select the various different camera angles, but perhaps more importantly useful for switching between different bitrates in Youtube and other online streaming sources using the DASH protocol. At present, the Youtube add-on in the Kodi repo has not yet been updated to handle this new support, but we hope to see that update in the near future. Conclusion As previously noted, this is only a small summary of all the improvements in Kodi 17. For more, see the Alpha 2 and Alpha 3 posts. Should you want to download and install this build please visit our download page. You can install these build just on top of your current Kodi installation. Please report any problems on our forum http://forum.kodi.tv and not on the release announcement. Don’t forget we also have some official tablet/phone remote controls for both Android and iOS.

Zou iets simpeler kunnen +2 Elect @tombruneel • 25 augustus 2016 12:48 Ik ben eigenlijk juist te spreken over de mogelijkheid om een MySQL DB te kunnen delen tussen verschillende clients om de libraries te delen en een video te resumen op een andere client (om te verkassen van de woonkamer naar de slaapkamer bijvoorbeeld ) http://kodi.wiki/view/MyS..._and_advancedsettings.xml Simpeler kan misschien wel, maar ik denk dat de meeste gebruikers van Kodi die zoiets wensen toch redelijke fanatics zijn. [Reactie gewijzigd door Elect op 25 augustus 2016 12:51] +1 tombruneel @Elect • 25 augustus 2016 12:51 Ik gebruik dit ook zo nu, maar zou iets handiger kunnen, binnenin de UI bvb +1 Elect @tombruneel • 25 augustus 2016 12:52 True. Advancedsettings.xml zou eigenlijk overbodig moeten zijn. +1 robieNL @Elect • 25 augustus 2016 13:14 Ben ik het helemaal mee eens. Dat vind ik ook het mooie aan OSMC (een distro van Kodi). Deze heeft voor de meeste zaken in de advancedsettings.xml een UI +1 Klojum @robieNL • 25 augustus 2016 13:50 Zoals zo vaak... "PR's are welcome". MySQL wordt al vanaf XBMC Dharma onderteunt, maar een UI met settings is nog altijd geen topprioriteit. Als mensen zich hiervoor willen inzetten, zijn ze zeer welkom. Zie http://kodi.wiki/view/Development +1 sirotilc @Elect • 25 augustus 2016 14:51 Ik gebruik hiervoor de plugin WatchedList, welke een bestandje op mn NAS wegschrijft. Het houdt geen tijden bij van een half bekeken video, maar wel wat je wel en niet hebt gezien. Tijdens het updaten van de library leest hij dat bestandje in en voert de wijzigingen door. Goed genoeg imo en binnen de UI [Reactie gewijzigd door sirotilc op 25 augustus 2016 14:52] +1 Raven__NL @sirotilc • 25 augustus 2016 16:49 Gebruik dan de addon van trakt.tv. Alles synced naar de website wat ook weer op andere clients gebruikt kan worden. Tevens houdt de site leuke statistieken bij +1 f.welvering @Elect • 25 augustus 2016 15:16 Een mooi alternatief hierop is wellicht Emby : http://emby.media/ Gebruik dit zelf al een periode als media beheer tool, deze geeft ook op een goed werkende manier de watched states door. +2 Jazco2nd Design en multimedia Kodi @tombruneel • 25 augustus 2016 14:20 Maar dat kan ook gewoon prima binnen de UI zonder met externe databases te gaan rommelen. RPI3 in de woonkamer, Via Settings > Services (uit mijn hoofd) > UPNP library sharing enabled. RPI1 in de slaapkamer, via Video > Add Source .. > kies UPNP en voila, daar staat een library, daar kan je nog doorheen klikken. Ik heb bijv TV Shows>Titles toegevoegd als 1 source en Movies>Titles als nog een source. Nu kan ik gewoon mijn library zien, compleet met fanart en (indien aanwezig) subtitles! En inderdaad, als ik iets afspeel in de woonkamer kan ik gewoon op stop drukken, in de slaapkamer start de video precies waar ik gebleven was. Dodelijk simpel. Werkt ook met Kodi op mn telefoon trouwens. Ik zou het ook echt zeker niet anders willen zoals Nosmo King beschrijft. Ik heb minimale hardware: 1 RPI3 met daarop 1 HDD aangesloten doet echt alles, verder heb ik niks anders nodig. Met SyncThing worden fotoalbums automatisch naar het adres van mijn ouders gebackupped. Ook als ik de schijf loskoppel om mee te nemen of wat snel te kopieren gaat dat perfect. [Reactie gewijzigd door Jazco2nd op 25 augustus 2016 14:22] +1 tombruneel @Jazco2nd • 25 augustus 2016 14:25 Dan moet je pi wel altijd aan staan natuurlijk :-) Heb een server op zolder en een server in colocatie ... Die op zolder gebruik ik nu als sql db om dit te bewerkstelligen en dat werkt, geen problemen mee... Zou gewoon handiger zijn bij initiele installatie mocht je dan niet moeten prullen met de xml file. Tevens de versie 'onafhankelijkheid' zou wel leuk zijn. +1 Jazco2nd Design en multimedia Kodi @tombruneel • 25 augustus 2016 16:03 ? Je zal toch 1 apparaat, hoe je het ook wil noemen een server of een NAS altijd aan moeten hebben staan voor wat jij wil? Een Pi heeft geen uit knop en verbruikt max 1.5-2 watt.. Dat haalt geen enkele server/nas Ik heb dit gewoon met mijn TV remote ingesteld, paar vinkjes en het werkt. +1 nosmo king @tombruneel • 25 augustus 2016 13:51 Helemaal mee eens. Het zou mooier zijn als ze de speler en de library functionaliteit lostrekken. Library installeer je dan op je NAS en de speler op een device bij je TV. Je kan dit wel realiseren met Plex of Emby, maar dit integreert toch weer niet voor 100% perfect. Iets wat niet kan met de MySQL DB optie, is het hebben van meerdere profielen. Je moet dan ook meerdere database instanties gaan aanmaken. Vind ik toch iets wat overkill. +1 densoN 25 augustus 2016 12:46 Kun je deze update ook aanroepen via een ssh command voor distro's als openELEC en LibreELEC? +1 wars @densoN • 25 augustus 2016 12:57 deze updaten zich automatisch als je de alpha hebt draaien (voor LibreElec toch, OpenElec zit nog op Kodi 16 beta...) En anders even de files (uit de .tar) in de update map zwieren en rebooten +1 Klojum @wars • 25 augustus 2016 13:41 LibreELEC ondersteunt al een tijdje het direct updaten mbv .img.gz en .tar bestanden in de Update folder. +1 Klojum @densoN • 25 augustus 2016 12:54 Als je met wget overweg kunt, en het updatebestand in de Update folder plaatst en je box reboot, dan zou het moeten lukken. LibreELEC kent geen sudo apt-get update of welke andere packagemanager dan ook, want het is een plain-vanilla Linuxsysteem en geen Debian- of Ubuntukloon. EDIT: OE geeft trouwens op Github weer een teken van leven, maar LibreELEC zal vanaf a.s. vrijdag aan nieuwe builds met Kodi v17b1 werken. [Reactie gewijzigd door Klojum op 25 augustus 2016 13:26] +1 Mecallie 25 augustus 2016 12:43 Ben benieuwd. Vooral naar de nieuwe default skin. Tot nu toe kwam ik altijd weer terug bij Confluence omdat ik die gewoon het prettigst vind werken. Ik hoop eigenlijk dat er ook wat meer "legale" online content beschikbaar komt in KODI. Zo zou ik graag Netflix/Hulu en (nog mooier) Horizon Go in KODI zelf willen gebruiken. Ik vind de interface super en ook de toegang tot mijn lokale content. Maar het zou mooi zijn als je zonder allerlei hacks en omwegen wat meer online content kon krijgen. Ik snap dat Netflix en Ziggo (Horizon Go van Liberty Global) de rechten moeten beschermen, maar dat moet toch prima kunnen? Als ik iets in een browser kan weergeven, waarom dan niet de optie bieden het ook in een mediacenter weer te geven. Lijkt me echt heerlijk, 1 eco systeem op je tv. Kan de reguliere kabel meteen de deur uit. Doet niets af aan KODI zelf verder: top product! +1 The Zep Man @Mecallie • 25 augustus 2016 13:09 Als ik iets in een browser kan weergeven, waarom dan niet de optie bieden het ook in een mediacenter weer te geven.Omdat browsers tegenwoordig ondersteuning hebben voor DRM, en Kodi dat niet heeft. Sowieso is het gebruik van DRM onzinnig. Kopiëren kan en doet men toch wel als men dat wil. Betalende klanten zijn de dupe, want die kunnen niet hun eigen gekozen apparatuur gebruiken om content af te spelen (tenzij ze het illegaal downloaden). 0 Mecallie @The Zep Man • 25 augustus 2016 14:21 Ik ben het volledig met je eens, maar dat doet niets af aan het feit dat ik wel gewoon simpel Netflix of Hulu of Horizon Go, of ... zou willen kunnen zien op KODI. Het hele drm gebeuren is gewoon in beginsel al stompzinnig. Als niet wilt dat iets wordt verspreid moet je het niet uitbrengen. Weggegooid geld. +1 lieziewiezie @Mecallie • 25 augustus 2016 13:09 tvaddons heeft een netflix add-on voor kodi. maar ik heb onvoldoende vertrouwen in niet-officiele addons om mijn netflix login daarop in te vullen. dus ik kan niet zeggen of hij goed werkt. +1 Mr Eekii 25 augustus 2016 13:03 die default skin ziet er goed uit zelf altijd aeon mq draaien maar misschien tijd om te switchen zeker in combinatie met mpc hc + madvr een aanrader +1 goarilla @Mr Eekii • 25 augustus 2016 13:24 Is wel te zwaar voor op een Raspberry Pi.

CrowdStrike, one of the most prominent young security companies threatened with exclusion from some shared services, said it has integrated part of its system for detecting malicious software with VirusTotal, the main industry repository for disclosing and rating risks of malware and suspect files. Alphabet Inc’s Google runs the VirusTotal database so security professionals can share new examples of suspected malicious software and opinions on the danger they pose. In May, the 12-year-old service said it would cut off unlimited ratings access to companies that do not share their own evaluations of submitted samples. CrowdStrike is opening up a machine-learning process for malware evaluation, after discussions with VirusTotal on how to make the systems compatible. “It will be very helpful to have the engine out so people can see for themselves how well it is working,” CrowdStrike Chief Technology Officer Dmitri Alperovitch told Reuters ahead of a public announcement on Thursday. VirusTotal did not respond to a request for comment. People familiar with the situation told Reuters said that two other “next-generation” security companies are expected to integrate with VirusTotal by the end of next month. More are likely, the people said, a hopeful sign that a serious rift between older and newer security companies can be healed in service of the general good. Some newer companies disparage the way that older vendors such as Symantec Corp, Intel Corp and Trend Micro Inc recognize malware based on signatures, or characteristics that have been spotted before. The younger companies say they use behavioral monitoring, machine-learning and other modern techniques to stop fast-changing malware. Symantec, Intel, Trend Micro and other older companies say they also use similar new methods. But some of the younger companies still used VirusTotal’s assessments from old-line companies, without contributing their own evaluations. The dispute was partly based in technological compatibility with VirusTotal’s system, an issue CrowdStrike said it and VirusTotal had solved. Dennis Batchelder, general manager of cybersecurity industry group called the Anti-Malware Testing Standards Organization, predicted that more new companies would re-integrate with VirusTotal. Machine learning systems would benefit from access to the VirusTotal database, he said. But some of the companies who parted with the VirusTotal ratings said they had no plans to make up. “We did make attempts early on to engage with VirusTotal with the hopes that they would find a way to take advantage of our behavior-based detection model,” said SentinelOne Chief Marketing Officer Scott Gainey. “To our knowledge, those interfaces still do not exist today.”  And Stuart McClure, chief executive of Cylance Inc, pointed out that his company and others can still get samples of malicious software from VirusTotal, just not the opinions of other companies about those samples. “We don’t integrate with VirusTotal,” McClure said by email. “The VirusTotal pullout has not impacted us at all.” Reuters Tags: CrowdStrike, cybersecurity, Google, Intel, Malware, Security, Symantec, Trend Micro, Virus, VirusTotal atabas, Web Also read Cybersecurity: A boardroom mainstay How Security as a Service is changing cybersecurity X Recommended For You Ireland starts investigating Yahoo! over scanning emails at behest of US Authorities New laws and legislation should be formed to stop rising instances of cyber crime, says Supreme Court Smartphone App tracks eyes to detect signs of autism in children China’s new cybersecurity law: Don’t claim sovereignty over cyberspace in the name of cybersecurity Subscribe to our newsletter GO You are Now Subscribed to our Newsletter - Stay Tuned !

IBM officials want to remind businesses that Intel's x86 processors aren't the only server chips on the market. Company engineers were at the Hot Chips 2016 show in Cupertino, Calif., this week to talk about Big Blue's upcoming Power9 processors, which are scheduled to hit the market next year and promise a broad range of capabilities that will make the architecture attractive for an array of workloads, from hyperscale data centers to machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). They reiterated many of the key assets of Power9, from its new architecture that will offer up to 24 processing cores and its ability to run with a wide array of accelerators like GPUs, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for faster performance to embracing such technologies as Nvidia's NVLink 2.0 and PCI Express 4.0. It's a cornerstone of IBM's larger effort to carve into Intel's dominant share of the server chip market, where more than 90 percent of all systems run on x86 chips from Intel. Big Blue is one of a number of chip players—including Advanced Micro Devices and its upcoming Zen chips and ARM with its push into the high-performance computing (HPC) space and supercomputers—that see changes in workload and processing demands in data centers as an opportunity to grab some share away from Intel. It reportedly was the message at Hot Chips, which came a week after IBM officials were in San Francisco outside of where Intel was hosting its annual Intel Developer Forum (IDF) to talk about Power9 and the OpenPower Foundation. "We want people to know there is an alternative to x86 chips and that alternative can bring a lot of performance with it," Dylan Boday, IBM Power engineer, told eWEEK last week standing outside of the Moscone Center, home to IDF. "At the end of the day, most people want choice, but they also want to see advantages to that choice." IBM traditionally had developed Power chips to run only in its Power servers. However, the company three years ago—with such partners as Nvidia and Google—launched the OpenPower Foundation, enabling third parties to license the architecture to create their own Power-based systems. It was part of a larger effort to embrace open technologies—such as Linux, OpenStack and the Open Compute Project (OCP)—for its Power architecture. The work is paying off, according to IBM officials. At the first OpenPower Summit last year, the group had about 130 members. That has since grown to more than 200. At the same time, there are more than 2,300 applications that run on Linux on Power, they said. In addition, there are projects underway with both Power8 and Power9. Google and Rackspace in April announced a project called "Zaius," in which they are working on a dual-socket OpenPower-based server design powered by Power9 and that will include OpenCAPI and Nvidia's NVLink connectivity, DDR4 memory and the CAPI acceleration technology. The companies hope to contribute the design to the Facebook-led OCP. IBM also is working with Nvidia and original design manufacturer (ODM) Wistron to build a next-generation Power8 system for HPC environments.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Extreme Microsoft shares details on the secret processor at the heart of HoloLens Microsoft shares details on the secret processor at the heart of HoloLens By Joel Hruska on August 24, 2016 at 3:20 pm Comment We’ve known for a long time that Microsoft’s HoloLens relied on a custom “HPU,” or Holographic Processing Unit, to provide the headset’s mixed-reality mode and augmented reality capabilities. At Hot Chips this week, the company actually released some details on how the chip works and what it’s capable of. According to Microsoft, the HPU can handle a trillion pixel operations per second. While a variety of designs were floated, including a partnership with Movidius, Microsoft ultimately went with a custom design that packs 24 Tensilica DSP cores and 8MB of cache into a single package, alongside 1GB of DDR3. The cores were customized with additional instructions (EETimes reports 300 new instructions, while The Register claims 10). “We used programmable elements wherever possible and fixed function hardware where we needed it to meet our performance goals.” Nick Baker, a technologist at Microsoft, told Hot Chips. “We took co-design to an extreme with this project.” Image by EETimes The chip is designed to process feedback from the HoloLens’ multiple cameras and process it in real time, and shares processing duties with a 14nm Intel Cherry Trail Atom SoC. With Intel having discontinued its Atom tablet and smartphone processors it’s not clear what’s next for HoloLens, and Microsoft hasn’t commented on whether it will develop a second-generation HPU or bring the hardware to market at a lower price point more suitable for the consumer and corporate market. Power consumption for the HPU is also reported differently, with EETimes claiming the chip operates “in a power budget lower than the 4W Intel Atom-based Cherry Trail SoC that acts as its host processor,” while The Register states “The HPU draws less than 10W and includes PCIe and standard serial interfaces.” Image by The Register At present, the HPU operates at less than 50% of its maximum theoretical capacity. While this undoubtedly keeps power consumption down, it also gives Microsoft a way to extend its design and make more use of it in the future without building a brand-new chip. The current HPU is built on 28nm technology at TSMC, which means a die-shrink to 14nm could also improve power consumption and battery life (or allow the chip to leverage more of its processing capabilities in a future product). Microsoft’s slides imply that the data sent to the Cherry Trail SoC is extensively processed to minimize data transfer requirements and power consumption. The company evaluated a number of potential solutions before settling on the DSPs, including sharing a workload across both CPU and GPU and using an array of traditional CPU cores. The available slides suggest that power consumption remains a formidable barrier to making AR work in wearable headsets — future designs will likely focus on minimizing power consumption for both AR and VR. On the other hand, gamers have clamored for higher-resolution displays and larger viewing frustums — and these are the kind of features that tend to increase weight and power draw, not reduce it. Based on what Microsoft has revealed about HoloLens’ HPU, it’s clear that the existing solution has some legs — but without knowing more about Redmond’s long-term plans, we can’t say if we’ll ever see the hardware in consumer price points. Right now, HoloLens is a $3,000 solution and marketed to developers only.

Reports from numerous news sites this week said the company, which competes with the likes of NXP and Infineon and is seeing other chip makers like Intel and Nvidia pushing their way into the autonomous vehicle space, could announce the acquisition soon. The deal would continue a consolidation trend in the semiconductor industry as chip makers buy rivals to build out their capabilities and address such emerging trends as self-driving cars, data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, the internet of things (IoT), mobility and the cloud. High-profile acquisitions in recent years include Intel buying programmable chip maker Altera for $16.7 billion, NXP acquiring Freescale for $12 billion and Avago Technologies grabbing Broadcom for $37 billion in a move to broaden its capabilities in such areas as IoT. In a statement to Reuters, Renesas officials said they were looking at multiple options for growth, including a deal with a chip maker in the United States, but that no decisions had been made. Intersil officials have not commented on the reports. Automotive is a key market for Renesas, and is a fast-growing area for Intersil. In the second quarter, revenue for the business was near record levels, officials said last month. In a July 28 conference call about the quarterly numbers, Intersil CEO Necip Sayiner said that combined, the company's industrial and automotive businesses make up about half of Intersil's revenues. Automotive accounted for about 13 percent of overall revenues. There is a lot of attention being paid to the nascent autonomous vehicle space, and chip makers are expecting to play a key role. Most recently, Intel announced it is working with BMW and Mobileye on a project to bring self-driving cars to market in 2021. Analysts with Strategic Analytics said late last year that fully autonomous cars probably won't emerge before 2025. IHS Automotive analysts are projecting that more than 20 million autonomous vehicles will be on the road by 2035.           del.icio.us | digg.com             Submit a Comment Loading Comments...     Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter China is one of the world’s largest consumers of semiconductor devices thanks to its manufacturing might, and is planning to spend more than $100 billion to become also a premier supplier to the planet. The global consultancy estimates that by 2020, almost 55 percent of the world’s memory, logic and analog chips will flow to or through the country. But the vast majority of the microchips that act as the brains of products like Apple Inc.’s iPhone are largely imported from companies like Intel Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co. The government in 2014 moved to change this with plans to invest more than $100 billion and become a leading global player. It’s also driven consolidation among domestic suppliers to maximize its investments, including the $2.8 billion merger of Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd. and Wuhan Xinxin Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. announced last month. China’s effort to build a world-leading semiconductor industry is part of a broader effort to wean itself off foreign technology. But financial investment will not be enough to buy leadership of the semiconductor sector, which is worth around $1 trillion according to Singapore-based Bain partner Kevin Meehan. The country currently makes just 15 percent of the semiconductors it consumes, Bain said in a report. And by 2020, the consultancy expects Chinese-based plants to produce just 7 percent of the world’s microchips, barely up from current levels. “China is coming at it in a pretty smart and intelligent way,” he said. “But I don’t see a path for them to own leading-edge processor technology and that is the foundation of Intel, the foundation of Samsung’s success.” To read a Gadfly column on China’s evolving chip industry, click here. Efforts by Chinese companies to buy rivals with intellectual property in the processor and memory markets have run afoul of regulators around the world. Plans for a $3.8 billion investment in Western Digital Corp. were scrapped amid a U.S. security review and investments in Taiwanese chip companies face regulatory obstacles and have stoked political tension. “Assuming they can spend it all, the biggest risk is that they end up with a whole bunch of fragmented and weak follower positions,” Meehan said. “There’s ways for them to have influence over greater than 10 percent if they’re partnering well, but otherwise I think you’re essentially capped there.” Meehan said China’s semiconductor makers could eventually learn from partnerships with global giants and become one of the larger suppliers of key components like computer memory. Both Intel and Qualcomm Inc. have agreed to build semiconductor fabrication plants there in partnership with local providers. “If you take a long view -- not five years but decades -- then certainly you’d have to believe there’s some absorption,” he said. "But people are careful not to put their leading edge IP in China.” “I don’t see a way to get there without licensing or buying.” (A previous version of the story corrected the amount that China supplies the world) Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The spectrum is in the 3.5 GHz band (specifically 3550-3700 MHz) and is being referred to as the Citizens Radio Broadband Service, so the joint effort is called the CBRS Alliance. The founding members consist of: Google, Intel, Nokia, Qualcomm, Ruckus Wireless and Federated Wireless. This partnership was first publicly discussed back at MWC this year but it seems to have taken them half a year to get their act together. The availability of the 3.5 GHz band has been spoken about for a while, but the rules governing the coexistence of incumbent users with new entrants were only formalised earlier this year. The presence of a significant chunk of unlicensed spectrum so close to licensed bands has intrigued many companies, recently causing Google to reassess is fibre plans. “There is ever-growing demand for LTE-based solutions in 3.5 GHz bands and expansion of the wireless footprint,” said Neville Meijers, VP of small cells for Qualcomm and chairman of the board for the CBRS Alliance. “Working together, the CBRS Alliance aims to enable the entire industry to address demand by expanding the capacity of new technologies.” “Working together, the Alliance will ultimately build LTE-based solutions for the CBRS band – creating one of the many paths that will make it possible to help meet challenges associated with the coming data capacity crunch, which experts predict will reach over 30 exabytes per month by 2020,” blogged Intel’s Shawn Covell who moved there from Qualcomm. “Federated Wireless has been instrumental in leading the creation of the shared spectrum ecosystem that will enable carriers and enterprises to seamlessly and cost effectively alleviate the challenges of sharing and managing spectrum while improving the performance and capacity of wireless networks for their customers,” said Iyad Tarazi, CEO of Federated Wireless. “The CBRS Alliance can be a critical driver to the success of the shared spectrum deployment in the CBRS band, which we believe has great potential to drive innovation, support new business models and spur economic growth.” This move brings together two prevailing trends in the wireless industry right now: the exploitation of unlicensed spectrum and the formation of partnerships. It speaks volumes about the potential of this resource that so many industry heavyweights are staking a claim but you do have to wonder why the likes of AT&T and Verizon aren’t part of the gang.

Wildfire is carried in spam messages and demands up to 1.5 Bitcoins of ransom for files to be decrypted. Security researchers have uploaded 1,600 decryption keys with more to come to the No More Ransom joint ransomware-busting effort between McAfee and parent company Intel, Kasperksy Labs, Europol's EC3 cybercrime division, and dutch police. The group earned US$79,481 (£60,240, A$104,399) over the last month by infecting 5,309 systems, Intel Security chief technology officer Raj Samani and advanced threat researcher Christiaan Beek found. "The victims were misled with a notice of a missed delivery and instructions for scheduling a new delivery by filling in a special form attached with the mail," the pair say. "This form was in fact an obfuscated dropper that infects the victims with the ransomware. "The actors behind Wildfire have clearly put a lot of effort into making their spam mails look credible and very specific." Countries including Russia; Moldova; Estonia; Latvia; Lithuania, and Belarus are excluded from being targeted by the ransomware in a tactic typically designed to avoid drawing local law enforcement heat. Samani and Beek say the actors are likely a Dutch-speaking group due to language and iconography used in the Wildfire spam, but did not suggest the attribution was certain. It also appeared Wildfire was operated under a service model in which criminals can rent ransomware and the necessary infrastructure to launch attacks against users, typically with some commissions in the range of 20 to 30 per cent going to malware writers. Facilitators link new buyers to ransomware writers, and other necessary service offerings such as traffic pushers and encrypting services. Criminals can net a conservative US$84,000 a month in the ransomware game for an investment of $6000, a whopping 1,425 per cent profit margin, Trustwave found last year. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 4 Comments More from The Register Billion-tonne IceCube: Sterile neutrino does not exist We're, um, Straight Outta 'fourth' 'trons...

Think of it as truckers-versus-tech 24 Aug 2016 at 02:58, Richard Chirgwin Richard Chirgwin Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics NBN, Security , Science, Broadband, Google Recent Articles Chap turns busted laptop into phone keyboard, in Himalayan book-rescue mission Thanks, IoT vendors: your slack attitude will get regulators moving Microsoft drops tools to help ingest and model big datasets Another industry alliance is gearing up to pitch mobile phone spectrum access to spectrum in the 3.5 GHz band – this time using frequencies formerly devoted to Citizens Band (CB) radio users. Following a decision by America's Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to free up 150 MHz of the “truckers' Internet” for unlicensed use, industry giants have created a new group to push LTE into the band. The CBRS Alliance has its eye on frequencies between 3550 MHz and 3700 MHz in America. The group so far comprises six companies: Alphabet's Access Technologies, Federated Wireless, Intel, Nokia, Qualcomm, and Brocade-owned Ruckus Wireless. Google has already conducted some field trials in the band, and the CBRS Alliance plans more field trials through 2016. Intel's boilerplate boast explains the ongoing desperate hunt for spectrum by pointing out that “a single smart hospital might use up to three terabytes of data per day”. The group, which first announced its intentions in February, will work on standards definition, technology adoption, and coexistence management. Coexistence has already proven a sore point as vendors and carriers try to scoop up whatever spectrum they can find. Since last year, LTE-U's alliance has been working on a coexistence plan that would let it borrow Wi-Fi spectrum, in the face of strong opposition from Wi-Fi users. Its coexistence plan is due in September, but along the way, LTE-U advocate Qualcomm has complained that its suggestions for coexistence and field tests have been ignored. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 27 Comments Whitepapers Build scalable and secure public cloud services Based on the industry-leading products and technologies your customers demand, Red Hat provides a complete set of platforms, tools, and software components you need to build a scalable, agile, and secure cloud services infrastructure.

Wildfire is carried in spam messages and demands up to 1.5 Bitcoins of ransom for files to be decrypted. Security researchers have uploaded 1,600 decryption keys with more to come to the No More Ransom joint ransomware-busting effort between McAfee and parent company Intel, Kasperksy Labs, Europol's EC3 cybercrime division, and dutch police. The group earned US$79,481 (£60,240, A$104,399) over the last month by infecting 5,309 systems, Intel Security chief technology officer Raj Samani and advanced threat researcher Christiaan Beek found. "The victims were misled with a notice of a missed delivery and instructions for scheduling a new delivery by filling in a special form attached with the mail," the pair say. "This form was in fact an obfuscated dropper that infects the victims with the ransomware. "The actors behind Wildfire have clearly put a lot of effort into making their spam mails look credible and very specific." Countries including Russia; Moldova; Estonia; Latvia; Lithuania, and Belarus are excluded from being targeted by the ransomware in a tactic typically designed to avoid drawing local law enforcement heat. Samani and Beek say the actors are likely a Dutch-speaking group due to language and iconography used in the Wildfire spam, but did not suggest the attribution was certain. It also appeared Wildfire was operated under a service model in which criminals can rent ransomware and the necessary infrastructure to launch attacks against users, typically with some commissions in the range of 20 to 30 per cent going to malware writers. Facilitators link new buyers to ransomware writers, and other necessary service offerings such as traffic pushers and encrypting services. Criminals can net a conservative US$84,000 a month in the ransomware game for an investment of $6000, a whopping 1,425 per cent profit margin, Trustwave found last year. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 4 Comments More from The Register Billion-tonne IceCube: Sterile neutrino does not exist We're, um, Straight Outta 'fourth' 'trons...

IBM Revives Its Fight With Intel Over Server Chip Dominance Fortune 8/23/2016 Barb Darrow © Provided by Fortune POWER9 DD1 die photo - print 4x4 300dpi Intel remains at the top of the heap of server chip makers, but that doesn’t mean rival IBM has given up. Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 111.07 -0.73 -0.65% Eli Lilly and Co LLY ▼ 68.14 -7.85 -10.33% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 778.16 -7.17 -0.91% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▼ 60.35 -0.77 -1.26% Quite the contrary, IBM this week renewed its push to make its Power9 chip a top contender. It revealed specifications for the new “P9” chips Tuesday at the HotChips technology conference in Cupertino, Calif. Starting next year, P9- based systems will be available from IBM and associated hardware partners, according to an IBM spokesman. The chips will go into servers starting for as little as $6,000, but the purported beauty of these new chips is that they will act as expandable hubs into which server makers can plug graphics chips as well as special-purpose Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and other performance enhancers as needed. That means manufacturers can fine-tune the boxes they make for specific purposes to, in theory, wring the best performance out of the hardware. So, if you want to sell a server that runs a small number of real-time algorithms very fast, you can do so. The Power9 chip will come in two basic designs, one for crunching numbers for big data or artificial intelligence applications like IBM’s favorite product Watson. The second will target Google-like “hyperscale” applications that must run across hundreds or thousands machines. This is an interesting story for IBM. Given Intel’s dominance, IBM’s chip architecture was pretty much used by IBM alone until three years ago, when the company decided to make its Power software and hardware technology available to outsiders via the OpenPower Foundation. Initial partners in the foundation included Mellanox mlnx which makes switches and host adapters; NVIDIA, which makes graphics processors; and Tyan, which produces motherboards. Those are all key server components, but the biggest brand coming aboard was Google goog, which said it was interested in using POWER chips in its own servers. That was definitely a coup for IBM because Google uses hundreds of thousands or millions of servers to power its Internet search, cloud computing, and other businesses. Since that time Google, which can be secretive about what technology it uses internally, has reportedly run earlier Power8 chips in its servers. And Google data center guru Urs H?lzle told technology trade publication The Next Platform that the company would run Power9 if it could realize a 20% power savings. Words like that have got to get Intel’s attention. Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. IBM isn’t the only server chip taking on Intel. AMD has been pushing its own “Zen” server processor technology that is starting to take off, as AMD chief executive Lisa Su told Fortune a few weeks ago.

Stewart, UniversityHerald Reporter Microsoft Surface Pro 5, Microsoft Surface Book 2 Release In Spring 2017? Kaby Lake Processors, USB Type-C Port, 4K Graphic Support, 1TB Internal Storage More Likely Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is expected to feature either Intel’s sixth or seventh generation Kaby Lake processor, a USB Type-C port and a new and improved battery. (Photo : Andrew Burton/Getty Images) Microsoft Surface Pro 5 and Microsoft Surface Book 2 are reportedly in the works but Microsoft has not confirmed or denied its development. However, this has not stopped rumors on the specs of the devices from spreading. Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is expected to feature either Intel's sixth or seventh generation Kaby Lake processor, a USB Type-C port and a new and improved battery. Rumors surfaced that the high end Microsoft Surface Pro 5 tablet that is a laptop hybrid will carry a 2K screen. However, a version that could support 4K graphics will also be available. The memory capacity of Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is said to be upgradable up to 16GB of RAM, Tech Times reported. Other components of the device can also be upgraded such as the camera, Wifi, Bluetooth and the Surface Pen. The Microsoft Surface Pen is suggested to have a rechargeable battery that could be charged wirelessly. Meanwhile, Microsoft Surface Book 2 is also suggested to equip the seventh generation Kaby Lake processor and will support 3D and 4K as well as VR displays, The Christian Times reported. The device will also sport 16GB of RAM with up to 1TB of internal storage capacity, reportedly. Microsoft Surface Book 2 is also expected to support a USB Type-C port connectors and ThunderBolt 3 ports. News about Microsoft's plans for the Microsoft Surface Pro and Microsoft Surface Book lines was intensified when the developer named Shubhan Chemburkar posted a photo of a wall from Microsoft's building 88. The photo depicted a Surface placeholder with labels 2016 and coming soon. Three other devices that has 2017 labels on them were also revealed. Microsoft Surface devices are rumored to be released alongside Windows 10 Redstone 2 operating system. Speculations also arise that the Surface devices might be deployed around the same time as Windows 10's second major update in Spring 2017. Both devices are expected to sell at $900 to $1500.

Ivan Menchavez27 August, 2016 Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7. Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today Several Microsoft releases have been in the rumor mill for quite some time now. Since the beginning of the year, rumors about Microsoft Surface Phone, Microsoft Surface Book 2 and the highly anticipated Microsoft Surface Pro 5 have been circulating all over the Internet. Previous reports suggest that the new Surface Pro 5 will be released before the year ends. However, the development of Intel's seventh generation core processor, the Kaby Lake, will not be finished until late this year. For that reason, the launching of the new Microsoft hybrid laptop will be moved to 2017. (Microsoft)The latest iteration, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 could launch in 2017 alongside Surface Book 2 and two other Surface devices. Although Microsoft has yet to confirm these reports, many fans believe that it is only a matter of time before the company makes an official statement and provide concrete details about the new Surface Pro 5. According to a report by PC Advisor, the development of Windows' next operating system, Redstone 2, is also part of the reason why the device will be delayed. According to the publication, the new software will not be available until next year. Meanwhile, Tech Times reported that the new device from Microsoft will be developed around the new Kaby Lake chipset. According to the report, the new processor will certainly improve the overall performance of the hybrid laptop. The powerful processor will be incorporated with other advanced specs to make sure the device will have 2K and 4K support. The new laptop will also carry better graphics technology with NVIDIA Pascal or AMD Polaris GPUs. There are speculations saying that the new Intel processor will be paired with 6 GB of RAM for multitasking purposes. According to the report, the non-4K model of the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will come out with a price tag of $899. On the other hand, the top-tier variant with 4K support will be sold at $1,599. However, these are merely just speculations and must be taken with a grain of salt.

The age of innovation is here. Both behind the scenes and at the consumer level, footwear firms are angling to become better technology-design companies. And why shouldn’t they? Abundant consumer data has aided curation and customization to make firms more powerful than ever before. Under Armour, for instance, signaled its desire to become a multifaceted player when it joined forces last year with fitness tracking app MyFitnessPal. And Nike continues to up the ante on its suite of Nike+ fitness tracking mobile applications. Related This Could Be Your Last Chance to Buy the Adidas Yeezy Boost 750 'Light Brown' To boot, 3-D printing, body scanning and augmented reality could help capture consumers by revealing how products will look or feel on their bodies before purchase. It’s the ultimate in forward-looking technology, which consumers have craved since the 1985 movie “Back to the Future” — or even the Sixties cartoon “The Jetsons.” It’s an exciting time, to say the least. “We are in the golden age of innovation in footwear right now,” said Matt Powell, sports industry analyst at The NPD Group Inc. Here, FN ranks eight of the hottest innovations affecting — and yet to affect — the market. 1. 3-D PRINTING (Eventually) Coming to a Home Near You The initial dream of 3-D printing was that consumers could print their own products at home. While the footwear market is not there yet, lower prices for 3-D printers have made the technology accessible to a larger number of shoe manufacturers, which is helping this innovation achieve mainstream recognition. Recently, athletic powerhouses such as Under Armour, Nike, Adidas and New Balance have produced special runs of sneakers with 3-D midsoles. But in about a year, footwear firms may hit a more-solid milestone: They should be able to produce short runs — including sole-tooling components, midsoles and shanks — that they’ve printed themselves for market introductions. “We’re just starting to see some examples of [3-D-printed shoe] production,” said Lee Dockstader, director of vertical market development for HP. In May, the company announced a 3-D printing partnership with Nike, and also revealed a printer that it said is 10 times faster and less expensive than other models. Dockstader declined to provide specifics on the timing or “strategic footwear applications” of HP’s Nike partnership, but he noted that during the Rio Olympics, 3-D-printed spike plates from New Balance and Nike’s Superfly Flyknit shoes will show the power of this innovation. “Industrially, in the U.S., 3-D printing is becoming a mainstay,” said Andy Polk, SVP of the Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America. “The confidence in a 3-D-printed spike plate on the bottom of a [performance] shoe speaks volumes to what this technology is about, how it’s transforming things.” As for when consumers could conceivably print, afford to print or even want to print their own shoes at home, industry watchers aren’t optimistic this will happen within the next five years. However, footwear manufacturers angling to get the attention of younger consumers who are fans of personalization could draw them in with accessories — for instance, selling designs for at-home printing or for printing at a local UPS store (a service that is available at 60 locations so far, with 100 planned). Scherf Design, in collaboration with Materialise, already has designs available for 3-D-printed high heels. Other ideas could be lace locks or trim that snaps to the side or bottom of shoes. “Millennials and Gen Xers are more interested in individualized products than a logo,” explained Jason Goldberg, SVP of commerce and content practice at interactive agency Razorfish. “At the moment, 3-D printers work best with things made out of plastic or that are ornamental as opposed to functional.” 2. IMAGE RECOGNITION See It, Snap It, Buy It Google’s purchase last month of image recognition startup Moodstocks alerted the world to the potential of this technology. One company already operating in that space is Slyce, a mobile image technology that recognizes products such as footwear in the real world, according to CEO Ted Mann. It’s being used inside the apps of at least 20 retailers, among them Neiman Marcus, Shoe Carnival, Nordstrom, Shoes.com and JCPenney. In the search bar of a company’s app, a camera icon appears, allowing users to launch Slyce’s universal scanner. Once the camera snaps a picture, the app utilizes 3-D optic recognition and shows either an exact match or a shoe with similar attributes. “If a retailer carries a wide variety of brands, we’re trying to get as exact a match as possible,” said Mann. “We want to get that precise pair of New Balance sneakers, or the most visually similar, but still that same brand.” Another area Slyce is working on involves “using chat-box messaging as a medium for delivering visual search results,” according to Mann. “You submit a picture of something [through a messenger program] and get back an exact match to that product.” Right now, Facebook is the prime messenger platform marketers have their eyes on, given it has more than 1 billion users. 3. 3-D SCANNING The Fit Is It Photo technology is also reaching new heights when it comes to getting exact measurements to achieve the best possible shoe or insole fit. Not unlike the premise of Adidas’ Futurecraft 3-D shoe prototype, some retailers have embarked on 3-D foot scanning to help improve the shopping experience. Zappos.com, for one, recently tested Intel’s RealSense technology. Its three cameras can “‘see’ like the human eye to sense depth,” according to Intel, and scan to create a digital 3-D version of a foot. Volumental is a 3-D scanning technology that utilizes RealSense cameras to assess feet and give recommendations on shoes. According to the company, Nordstrom is using its scanning device, as is New Balance, which has it in its Boston and Taipei flagship stores. In another iteration, an app in beta called Fitfully offers a 3-D foot scan that is completed via users’ iPhones. It’s geared toward online retailers and promises to take 30 seconds to reveal a pressure map of how a foot will fit a particular shoe. 4. AUGMENTED REALITY Even Better Than Virtual Reality Most market observers agree that virtual reality is an effective marketing strategy for retailers and brands — think watching Milan fashion shows via an Oculus Rift headset after the fact, or trekking the mountains via Merrell’s or The North Face’s VR experiences. Augmented reality, however, may serve as a bigger revenue-driver, helping consumers find the right products and actually make purchases. The difference, in part, comes from the fact that VR does not yet allow users to see their bodies, while AR can show what products look like on the body and offer 360-degree views. Nike in early July filed a patent for an augmented-reality design system, and such brands as Adidas and Lacoste have tested augmented-reality experiences and shoe try-ons. There is also the new line launched by High Beam Shoes to enhance “Pokemon Go” fun by lighting up and playing music when users are close to a Pokemon. The shoes will be available in the fall. That said, some footwear firms are testing more robust VR systems as well as planning for a switch-over to all-virtual prototypes, akin to Adidas’ virtual footwear wall found in some of its stores. Slyce’s Mann predicted that image recognition, augmented reality and possibly 3-D scanning could all unite one day to create a truly seamless buying process. “There will come a time when you’ll see a pair of shoes you like, you’ll be able to use your glasses or some other wearable to key in on those shoes, know what they are and maybe even buy them right there on the spot,” he said. 5. SMART SHOES Change Is Upon Us Looking good is not enough — products of the future need to be high-tech wonders as well. Already there are Altra and Under Armour sneakers that track distance and stride, while self-lacing or adjusting shoes are available in different iterations. Nike recently stepped up innovation in that area. And a company called Powerlace, which raised more than $25,000 in a recent Kickstarter campaign, promises to use a person’s weight to auto-lace sneakers. Then there’s Shift Sneaker — kicks that change color based on mood or fashion. The product is a creation of U.K.-based Rehabstudio. According to the firm, it uses “experimental technologies,” and although the concept is not available yet, it could be the next evolution of smart sneakers. The idea is that reactive textiles with adept fibers and mini LED lights change the colors of the sneakers via downloadable design packs. Colors can also change based on movement, temperature or location. But it’s not just about aesthetics. For instance, if an athlete uses the running pack, the sneakers will glow red, blue or green to show runners whether they’re on time, behind desired time or ahead. “We believe that in the future, when you buy a single pair of sneakers, you will actually be buying 1 million pairs [due to all the color options],” Shift states on its website. For his part, Razorfish’s Goldberg doesn’t disregard the idea. “Younger demographics want personalized and unique products. One of the ways is to build electronics into them,” he said. 6. ENDLESS-SHELF PROGRAMS In-Store Shopping with Online Efficiency At Aldo, a focus on omnichannel retailing has resulted in a test of in-store iPads and touchscreen TVs that consumers can use while shopping in 25 of the brand’s retail stores to see the types of footwear or specific shoes available in that store or other locations, said Grégoire Baret, senior director of omnichannel experience for Aldo. To take it a bit further, customers’ endless-shelf requests can prompt store associates’ mobile devices, improving the speed at which shoes are brought out by “runners” from storerooms. “Requesting a product and getting it for a consumer is reduced to the core: scan a product to check availability and tap a button to request it automatically from a runner. This means less time lost in the back-store and more face time for added value with our consumers,” said Baret, who added that conversion and engagement with customers is increasing. On Aug. 16, Aldo opened what Baret calls its “most advanced retail location to date” in Westfield World Trade Center in New York. The company will also be adding a request try-on feature directly from its consumer app, said Baret. In addition, Aldo is working on adding predictive product recommendations to its website. 7. DRONE DELIVERY Not As Creepy As It Sounds The rumors are true: Amazon Prime Air is testing drone delivery with more than a dozen prototypes in the U.S., the U.K., Austria and Israel, promising to deliver packages weighing up to five pounds in 30 minutes or less within 10 miles. Customers will get a message on their devices when a package is arriving at their home via an unmanned aerial vehicle, which uses sense-and-avoid technology to make it to delivery locations in one piece. In an introductory video to promote the service, Amazon specifically calls out the ease of a shoe delivery (youth size 3 Puma soccer cleats, to be specific, the left foot of the first pair having been eaten by a hypothetical family’s dog). “In time, there will be a whole family of Amazon drones — different designs for different environments,” the video narrator explains. While Amazon declined to comment on rollout timing beyond previous statements that research “will take some time,” Goldberg suggested that the fairly uniform weight and size of shoeboxes could make for a solid choice in drone delivery. However, he added, drone delivery may not be the go-to for another few years because it’s “not economically viable,” not to mention the hassles of navigating sticky government regulations. Still, at least one giant budget retailer, Walmart, is testing drones in its warehouses to handle inventory and speed up cataloging. So there might be a place for drones at the moment after all. 8. DATA COLLECTION  Knowing Is the Whole Battle By this point, it’s clear that data is more important for competition than ever before. As seen in many of the entries reported here, firms that put the power of data to use will stand apart from their peers. “Now that you literally can see how millions of customers are using your product and how it wears, you can imagine things proactively,” said Razorfish’s Jason Goldberg. For example, to provide curated assortments and improved “clienteling,” Under Armour and Nike are among the companies building communities online through social media and tracking technologies, which makes sense for customizing future shoe orders and, eventually, products. Looking ahead, Goldberg sees the possibility of home webcams placed in closets — or even existing home security systems — to capture daily what consumers wear and then analyze the shoes or colors worn most. “It’s collecting new valuable data about what you like or use to make curation better,” he said. “In five years, I would not be surprised if we are all wearing some kind of device and are wired to our phone,” predicted NPD Group’s Matt Powell. “We’ll all be measuring something.” However, Goldberg added, “The hurdle for none of these is technology — it’s customer adoption.” As finicky consumers have proven, the crux is sticking with a technology longer to make its benefits last. — Illustrations by DAVE HOMER   Want More?

Schindler • 08/25/16 3:00pm Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. (Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Recent headlines have brought attention to the seedier side of Hillary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state during President Obama’s first term. This scheme, which gives every appearance of being about pay-for-play, solicited donations from foreign big-shots in exchange for access to the boss of American foreign policy. I’ll leave to others to assess the legality of this shady business—for now it’s the national security implications we need to discuss. It’s a big deal when the person who’s possibly our next president—and if polls are accurate, she probably will be—has sold access to foreign bidders before taking the oath of office. It’s especially worrisome when some of those foreigners are in Moscow. I’ve previously explained how Donald Trump possesses unsavory Russian ties. He parrots Kremlin propaganda, his inner circle includes people on Moscow’s payroll, and top American intelligence officials have called him an “unwitting agent” of Vladimir Putin. This is a serious matter deserving close scrutiny. Just as serious is how the Kremlin has forged links with nearly all the presidential candidates this year, not just Trump—so much so that, no matter who wins on November 8, Putin will, too. Hillary Clinton also possesses Moscow links that merit investigation. I’ve previously explained how Kremlin money found its way to the Podesta Group, the prominent Democratic lobbying firm that just happens to be headed by the brother of her campaign chairman, John Podesta (who co-founded the firm). However, recent revelations indicate that Hillary’s dubious Kremlin ties go far deeper. A new report by Peter Schweizer, who’s spent years investigating the dubious and convoluted finances of Clinton, Inc., raises troubling questions about just how deep Hillary’s Moscow’s ties are—and whom exactly they’re with. Schweizer shows that John Podesta sat on the board of a Dutch-registered company that took $35 million from the Kremlin. The company was a transparent Russian front, and how much Podesta was compensated—and for what—is unclear. In addition, Podesta failed to disclose his position on that board to the Federal government, as required by law. ‘In the old days, the KGB had to recruit spies to steal Western technology—now they do deals with you.’ Even worse is how Clinton, Inc. profited from the Russian “reset” that was one of the big achievements of Hillary’s tenure at Foggy Bottom. Never mind that the reset was a disaster, culminating in Kremlin aggression against Ukraine. Hillary’s signature program at the State Department ended in unambiguous failure. Yet Clinton, Inc. did very well out of the temporary warming of relations with Moscow. As part of the reset, Hillary encouraged and enabled American and European investment in Russia, particularly in high-tech firms. A key role was played by the Skolkovo Innovation Center, a sprawling complex in Moscow’s western suburbs that was established in 2009 as Russia’s answer to Silicon Valley. With encouragement from the State Department, American companies jumped aboard. Cisco pledged $1 billion of investment in Skolkovo in 2010, and Google and Intel quickly joined the bandwagon. All three “just happened” to be major investors in the Clinton Foundation too. This was the consistent pattern. As Schweizer explained, “Of the 28 U.S., European and Russian companies that participated in Skolkovo, 17 of them were Clinton Foundation donors” or had hired former President Clinton to give speeches. How much money these Skolkovo benefactors gave to Clinton, Inc. cannot yet be determined, but Schweizer concluded that it’s somewhere between $6.5 million and $23.5 million, with the proviso that since the Clinton Foundation has yet to reveal all its donors, the true figure could be much higher. Then there’s the matter of what Skolkovo actually is. In truth, it’s nothing like Silicon Valley except in outward appearance. It’s a fully state-driven enterprise—funded largely by the Kremlin and acting on its orders. It does the bidding of the Russian government, and President Putin has taken intense interest in his high-tech complex, understanding its value to the country’s defense and security sector. Therefore, it’s no surprise that Western intelligence considers Skolkovo to be an extension of Russia’s military-industrial complex—and its intelligence services. A July 2013 unclassified study by U.S. European Command that surveyed Skolkovo activities suggested, in delicate language, that Russia’s Silicon Valley is “an overt alternative to clandestine industrial espionage.” Stealing the West’s hi-tech secrets has long been a Kremlin forte, and Skolkovo is merely the newest effort to purloin our advanced technology. The FBI was less guarded. In April 2014, in a rare public statement, the Bureau’s Boston field office warned American firms about dealings with Russian entities, naming the Skolkovo Foundation as a particular source of concern. Terming it “a means for the Russian government to access our nation’s sensitive or classified research, development facilities and dual-use technologies with military and commercial applications,” the FBI added that Skolkovo had commercial contracts with Kamaz, a Russian defense firm that builds armored vehicles. “The FBI fears that Kamaz will provide Russia’s military with innovative research obtained from the Foundation’s U.S. partners,” warned the Bureau. Then there’s the matter of Skolkovo’s links to Russian intelligence, particularly the powerful Federal Security Service or FSB. Schweizer dryly notes, “Skolkovo happens to be the site of the FSB’s security centers 16 and 18, which are in charge of information warfare for the Russian government.” This is the polite way of saying that some of Russia’s state-linked hackers are at Skolokovo. It’s more than a little ironic that the hackers who have pillaged the Democratic National Committee and stolen Hillary’s emails may be sitting in the very hi-tech compound that Clinton, Inc. helped Russia develop. These assessments by the Pentagon, the FBI and Schweizer are unclassified. In private, Western security experts are less guarded. “It’s an obvious Kremlin front,” explained a Pentagon intelligence official about Skolkovo. “In the old days, the KGB had to recruit spies to steal Western technology, now they do deals with you. The theft is the same.” One European intelligence official added that his country’s security service concluded, after close observation, that several top Skolkovo officials are actually FSB officers: “We’ve seen guys from Skolkovo acting like intelligence collectors, not tech entrepreneurs,” he elaborated. In the heady days of the reset, back in Obama’s first term when America’s foreign policy establishment hoped to get on Vladimir Putin’s good side, perhaps helping Moscow develop its own Silicon Valley seemed like a good idea. However, Hillary Clinton should have been more careful about partnering with the Kremlin in a sector that’s so important to our national security. Above all, Clinton, Inc’s shady pay-for-play scheme should have never made a buck off technology transfers to Russia’s military and intelligence services. Exactly how Hillary profited off deals with Skolkovo—and how much—is something the American public has a right to know before November 8.

Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today A lot of rumors about the release date of the much-awaited MacBook Pro 2016 are thriving as the year progresses, with people saying that it is going to be launched soon, along with the iPhone 7. According to Mobile & Apps, some sources report that the upcoming Apple laptop will have slimmer and lighter features as compared to earlier versions. As for its other design-related specs, the MacBook Pro 2016 will also reportedly have an OLED touch panel, and it will be the butterfly keyboard switch that serves as a replacement for the function keys on the keyboard. Also, the upcoming laptop is rumored to have a Touch ID button with its panel. Furthermore, it is also expected for the MacBook Pro 2016 to have a USB Type-C port enhanced with the Thunderbolt 3 functionality in order to ensure a faster data transfer. For its processor, Neurogadget reports that the Apple laptop is rumored to be powered by the latest generation of the Intel Kaby Lake processors. As most tech enthusiasts know, this processor has not been released yet, so supposedly, once this Intel processor is released, the newest MacBook Pro will be released after a short time. However, should the September 2016 release rumor prove to be true, the laptop will instead have an Intel Skylake processor instead. As for its software features, the MacBook Pro 2016 is rumored to run on the latest macOS Sierra. What this means is that Siri, the iPhone's personal voice assistant, will be introduced for the MacBooks as well, in the same way Cortana was introduced in the latest Windows 10 OS. Siri is expected to feature some neat functionalities such as Voice Feedback, Switch Control accessibility and file management. With this, the MacBook Pro 2016 is rumored to launch in September, but without any official confirmation, fans should just wait for further announcements.

By sharing these trends with our readers, we hope to provide insights into what the financial world is concerned about and how to position your portfolio. There was no central theme this week, except perhaps for the presence of three assets sensible to interest rates – namely the U.S. dollar, mortgage-backed securities and inverse bonds, all situated on the bottom of the list. Further up on the list, telecom ETFs have taken first place, followed by semiconductors. Both assets have outperformed the broad market lately. Telecom: Fed Lends a Hand Telecommunication stocks have claimed first place on this week’s list for no obvious reasons. Telecom ETFs have seen their traffic increase over 70% this week compared to the same period a week ago, despite a sluggish performance in the past five days. For example, iShares U.S. Telecommunications (IYZ B+) has slumped 0.22% since last Thursday, but is up 10.63% since the beginning of the year. Telecom stocks have posted a better performance than the broad market year-to-date and over the past twelve months, as many of these defensive stocks were attractive for their stable dividends. The two largest U.S. telecom companies, AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ), which make up a fifth of iShares U.S. Telecommunications, each pay an annual dividend of more than 4%. Indeed, these two stocks have outperformed the telecom ETF, with Verizon jumping nearly 14% since the beginning of the year and AT&T soaring more than 18%. Whether this outperformance will continue depends on the companies’ abilities to innovate over the long-term and the Federal Reserve’s actions in the near term. In no small part telecom stocks have been boosted by the Fed’s decision to delay an interest rate hike. The lack of action from the Fed prompted investors to search for better riskier yields in defensive stocks, including telecom firms. Over the longer term, however, the companies face challenges from new powerful entrants, such as Google (GOOGL), but also from startups strictly focusing on the emerging Internet of Things market. The largest carriers are counting on the IoT for the next wave of growth. Semiconductors: Better United Semiconductors stocks have taken the second spot on the list, not far behind telecom, with a 67% increase in viewership over the past week. Semiconductors have performed even better than telecom stocks over the past period. For instance, iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX B+) has risen 0.83% since last Thursday, extending year-to-date gains to as much as 20%. The reason for such an outstanding performance is excellent earnings results for the latest quarter reported by some industry giants, including Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Nvidia (NVDA). The three companies beat or posted earnings in line with analysts’ estimates. Turning to the smaller capitalization semiconductor companies, there is a full-fledged consolidation process underway, as many players are desperate for synergies and cost savings. Just recently, Analog Devices agreed to acquire Linear Technology in a deal worth $14.8 billion, while a bit earlier Japan’s Softbank announced plans to take over British-based ARM Holdings. Inverse Bonds: Need Inflation ETFs benefiting from rising bond yields have had a bad year so far, with interest rates hovering near record lows. Inverse Bonds have seen their viewership increase nearly 63%, closely behind semiconductors. iPath US Treasury 10-year Bear (DTYS A) has continued to flounder over the past five days, down 3.80%, extending year-to-date losses to as much as 41.29%. The future performance of these ETFs largely hinges on one big economic variable – inflation. Low inflation in the U.S. and across the developed world has emboldened central banks to launch unprecedented monetary stimulus measures, boosting bonds of all stripes. Although the Federal Reserve has terminated its asset-buying program long ago, low interest rates and subdued inflation have kept yields in check, with the 10-year Treasury notes returning only 1.5%. Going forward, inverse bonds are hardly expected to perform any better, given that inflation for the most recent month was 0%. The Federal Reserve’s minutes for July revealed that all policymakers agreed there was no risk of inflation running amok anytime soon, suggesting they will not hurry in accelerating the interest rate cycle. U.S. Dollar: All Eyes on Wyoming The U.S. dollar has taken fourth place on our weekly list, with a 40% increase in traffic. The greenback has been somewhat volatile lately, moving sideways, as investors await a clearer signal from the Federal Reserve about its plans to raise interest rates. PowerShares DB US Dollar Index (UUP A) has risen slightly over the past week, 0.12%, but it is still down 4.48% since the beginning of the year. Volatility in the dollar is expected on Friday, when Federal Reserve’s Janet Yellen is due to speak at the annual Jackson Hole symposium. Although the most powerful central bankers gather to exchange ideas on economics, they could drop hints about the future monetary policy. As of now, the Fed is not expected to raise interest rates soon, making the dollar a poor investment. A subdued inflation report for the latest month proved another headwind for the greenback. Mortgage-Backed Securities: Bad Legacy Bites Mortgage-Backed Securities are last on our weekly list with a 24% rise in traffic, despite a somewhat weak performance lately. For example, iShares MBS (MBB A) has jumped 0.15% in the past five days, extending year-to-date gains to 2.14%. Although the low interest rates should have boosted the MBS market, many of the instruments are shunned by investors because of their link to the financial crisis. The underlying fundamentals, however, look strong, with the housing industry in good health. New home sales are continuing to rise. In July, about 654,000 homes were sold on an annualized basis compared to the downwardly revised 582,000 in the previous month. The Bottom Line This week the outperformance of telecom and semiconductors ETFs have attracted our readers. Semiconductors ETFs have performed better than telecom ETFs, but the latter provides better yields and are more stable. Meanwhile, mortgage-backed securities, the U.S. dollar and inverse bonds, all sensitive to interest rate movements, are expected to become volatile over the next few days as central bankers descend on Wyoming for the annual Jackson Hole symposium. By analyzing how you, our valued readers, search our property each week, we hope to uncover important trends that will help you understand how the market is behaving so you can fine-tune your investment strategy. At the end of the week, we’ll share these trends, giving you better insight into the relevant market events that will allow you to make more valuable decisions for your portfolio.

Livemap… Want a HUD in your motorcycle helmet? Livemap survives where Skully crashed By Bill Roberson — August 24, 2016 5:10 PM Subscribe to this topic Bill Roberson/Digital Trends One of the hottest trends in motorcycle gear today is the connected helmet. Once anathema to motorcyclists who treasured their rides as blissful solace from the intrusions of our increasingly high-tech world, connected helmets are finally becoming a thing. Resistance has slowly broken down as riders swapped earplugs for iPod earbuds, and eventually, earbuds for Bluetooth modules and speakers that add music, navigation (via voice prompt), and communication with their significant other (via smartphone) to their lids. Even bicycle helmet makers have gotten into the act. While motorcycle touring riders on glossy full-boat rigs like the Honda Goldwing and Harley Ultra Classic have used wired systems for intercom, CB, and music for decades, the rise of the multi-function wirelessly connected helmet is essentially as new as the smartphone. In 2013, two men started work on what they hoped would be revolutionary helmets with groundbreaking built-in technologies. Dr. Marcus Weller began work on the Skully helmet, a bucket with a next-level, full-on, computer-in-your-helmet system. It included a 180-degree rear camera piping full-time video to a small heads-up display (HUD) up front, along with voice-controlled navigation, music, and communication. At almost the same time, a young Russian entrepreneur named Andrew Artishchev also began work on a high-tech helmet. Called Livemap, Artishchev’s concept had an interesting tech twist. Artishchev’s helmet projects GPS and other information right into the visor and the rider’s sightline. The Skully P-1 (as it was known in 2013) was intended to give riders 360-degree situational awareness and connectivity while riding. We questioned the safety aspect of what appeared to be a helmet full of distractions, but Dr. Weller, a psychologist, was convincing in explaining that his approach would actually keep riders’ eyes on the road more than ever, since checking mirrors and glancing at instruments or GPS displays could now be relegated to the helmet’s nearly line-of-sight display module. In 2014, the Skully project, now called the AR-1, smashed crowdfunding records and eager tech-hungry riders ponied up to $1,500 apiece for the sci-fi-looking buckets. They then waited for production to get underway. And waited… And waited… As we recently witnessed, the Skully story went terribly, horribly wrong: The project cratered into bankruptcy amid charges of corporate shenanigans and lavish spending of donors’ money. If you’re one of the lucky backers who actually took delivery of one of the small number of Skully helmets that actually got produced, software updates won’t happen anytime soon — and eBay might be a smart option. But the idea of projecting data into the rider’s line of sight in such a way as to be more helpful than obtrusive (and possibly dangerous) is a worthy goal, just as it is in cars and fighter planes. Meanwhile, as Skully’s leaders fiddled, Artishchev pressed on with his Livemap system. Rather than use a small HUD viewscreen the rider sees in his peripheral vision, Livemap projects GPS and other information right into the visor and the rider’s sightline, so the rider can see directions laid out before him without taking his eyes off the road. This was essentially the same goal Weller had with Skully, according to our 2013 interview, but Weller’s design was different, and perhaps inferior in concept in some ways to Artishchev’s. Indeed, the Livemap idea garnered an Intel Make It Wearable semifinalist award in 2014. In the months before Skully became a crowdfunding pariah, Digital Trends met with Artishchev in Los Angeles to take a look at his prototype and talk to him about the technologies involved. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends The LiveMap helmet consists of a small HUD projection system similar to those fighter pilots have used for years, but with some crucial differences. The image a pilot sees is typically thrown from a small projector onto an angled, transparent eyepiece in front of her eyes, so wherever she looks, the HUD view remains more or less in place. The LiveMap helmet emulates this approach, with some accommodations for the helmet’s use on public roadways. But Livemap’s display activates only as needed rather than staying on all the time, which likely will help battery life. As an added challenge, the traditional fighter pilot HUD locates the imaging hardware atop the helmet. This is fine for throttle jockeys lining up a missile strike, but a total no-go for motorcyclists who need their helmets to protect their heads first and foremost. Also, the regulatory bodies that certify motorcycle helmets will definitely frown on metal and glass bits that could be driven through the helmet liner and into a rider’s head in the event of a crash. Artishchev’s solution? Shrink the projection system and incorporate it into the chinbar area, similar (but likely more complicated) to what Skully eventually executed. With a key difference: Artishchev’s projection system needs to be projected up into the visor in such a way as to be readable, while still fitting into the chinbar. To make that approach work, the trickiest part of the tech may very well be the visor itself. This is constructed as a hybrid of regular visor material (plastic) with very thin layers of a super-thin semi-reflective material on highly polished spaces in the visor on which the projected data lands, and at a steep angle no less. The visor must also remain essentially transparent as to not obstruct the rider’s vision in any way. And, of course, riders need to be able to lift and move the visor in the same way they do with a normal helmet. The projected data, a colorful and transparent mix of lane markers, arrows, letters, and numbers looked clear and legible. The first prototype Artishchev put together used an overhead system as proof of concept. However, he showed Digital Trends a new prototype with a more normal form factor — the projection electronics are now located in the chinbar and a hardwired computer (and eventually, an app-running smartphone, of course) for control of streaming and displaying data. To his credit, Artishchev’s second prototype — which we were able to sample in static operation but not out on the road — ably demonstrated his approach, permitting a clear view ahead while also showing direction data and other information in the rider’s field of view. The visor was clear when worn, and the projected data, a colorful and transparent mix of lane markers, arrows, letters, and numbers, looked clear and legible. The direction information is neatly presented in a small area in the line of sight; it doesn’t take over the whole visor. Again, the projection system is not omnipresent like it was in the Skully lid, it only pops up as needed in Artishschev’s design. But with the helmet off, the projection screens in the visor are clearly visible. It’s a complicated visor. The effect when wearing the helmet was both interesting and a bit off-putting at first, but it’s easy to see how a rider could quickly get used to it and make good use of the system once a pattern of control over the data is made habit. Future technical improvements include an Android operating system, a global maps database, LTE connectivity, and other data points including weather and traffic. A front-facing 4K camera for recording ride footage is also planned but was not present on the helmet we sampled. The primary key to moving the Livemap helmet towards actual production, of course, is greatly shrinking the electronics and projections system in the chinbar to fit a normal helmet profile. It’s not an easy (or cheap) task, especially for a guy who isn’t crowdfunding his development costs. Also, the prototype visor is very delicate, and it will take several generations of refinement before it can be both functional and durable, a serious challenge considering the regular beatings a helmet visor takes from bugs, road debris, accidental drops, and generally banging into stuff. But Artishchev is without a doubt onto something good with the Livemap. When Digital Trends first contacted Artishchev, part of his presentation included leveling complaints against the Skully team (and some other companies), whom he accused of appropriating his approach and ideas. Please enable Javascript to watch this video Just recently, Digital Trends spoke with Skully when it appeared full-scale production of the AR-1 was about to commence. The company had offered to send a marketing representative along with a production helmet to our Portland, Oregon, location for an up-close inspection and test ride. We hoped to ask them about Artishchev’s allegations and compare the technologies; that clearly isn’t going to happen. Despite Artishchev’s accusations, there are clear differences between many facets and functions of the helmets, including the display system and the depth of the tech involved. This is especially notable in regards to the rear camera, the self-contained in-helmet computer system and custom OS that were centerpieces of the Skully AR-1. It’s all semantics now, but the beat goes on for Livemap and other helmet makers looking to move skid lids beyond their once-simple jobs as protectors of our delicate noggins. Artishchev, as we mentioned previously, is not using crowdfunding to keep his LiveMap helmet project alive, and if you’d like to contact and support him, go to his website. The Livemap helmet is priced at $1,500 and is available for pre-order with a target delivery date of summer 2017 for U.S. markets and later dates for international locations. According to his website, Artishchev will show a third-generation prototype helmet at CES this coming January.

In verschiedenen Medien macht aktuell ein bereits im Juni bekannt gewordener Hinweis auf USB 3.1 Gen 2 in macOS Sierra die Runde. Dieses neue USB 3.1 bietet 10 Gbps und ist nur über USB-C-Anschlüsse verfügbar. Dabei darf allerdings nicht der Fehler gemacht werden, USB 3.1 Gen 2 mit Thunderbolt 3 gleichzusetzen, auch wenn beide USB-C-Anschlüsse voraussetzen. USB-C ist wie Lightning ein Multifunktions-Anschluss, der verschiedene Übertragungsprotokolle anbieten kann. Zwingend kombiniert werden muss USB-C mit Thunderbolt 3 jedoch nicht, wie das aktuelle 12" MacBook Retina mit Intels Skylake-Prozessor beweist. Anders herum schreibt Thunderbolt 3 allerdings USB-C als Stecker vor. Drei Möglichkeiten Bei der Konkurrenz gibt es auch ältere Skylake-Computer mit USB 3.1 Gen 2 sowie Thunderbolt 3. Für Apple ergeben sich daher drei Möglichkeiten, eine Aktualisierung der Macs durchzuführen. Zum einen könnte Apple tatsächlich die neuen Kaby-Lake-Prozessoren von Intel verbauen, die von Haus aus sowohl Thunderbolt 3 als auch USB 3.1 Gen 2 beherrschen. Zum anderen könnte Apple aber auch auf Skylake-Prozessoren setzen, bei denen Thunderbolt 3 im Prozessor enthalten ist, während über einen Zusatzchip USB 3.1 Gen 2 realisiert wird. In beiden Fällen gäbe es nur noch USB-C. Es wäre aber auch möglich, dass Apple wie bisher Thunderbolt 3 in den Prozessoren ignoriert und weiterhin bei Thunderbolt 2 mit eigenem Thunderbolt-Anschluss bleibt, während dazu USB 3.1 Gen 2 über einen USB-C-Anschluss hinzukommt. Kombinationsmatrix Protokoll  Geschwindigkeit in Skylake in Kaby Lake USB 3.1 Gen 1 5 Gbps integriert integriert USB 3.1 Gen 2 10 Gbps optional integriert Thunderbolt 2 20 Gbps optional optional Thunderbolt 3 40 Gbps optional integriert Thunderbolt 3 ohne 5K Ein (Vermarktungs-)Problem bei Thunderbolt 3 ist nämlich, dass Intel im letzten Moment die Unterstützung für 5K-Displays mit DisplayPort 1.4 gestrichen hat. Um solche hochauflösenden externen Displays betreiben zu können, bleibt damit nur der Weg über externe Thunderbolt-Grafikmodule, in denen ein Grafikchip das erforderlich DisplayPort 1.3/1.4 für 5K-Displays bereitstellt. Apple müsste in macOS Sierra allerdings diese externen Grafikmodule über Thunderbolt 3 unterstützen, wofür es bislang in macOS Sierra jedoch keinen Hinweis gibt. Thunderbolt 3 über USB-C Abgesehen von der doppelten Bandbreite in Höhe von 40 Gbps und dem erforderlichen USB-C-Stecker könnte Thunderbolt 3 daher für Mac-Nutzer keinen Vorteil bieten. Sofern Apple nicht doch noch ein externes Grafikmodul vorstellt, werden hochauflösende 5K-Displays erst mit Thunderbolt 4 und dem enthaltenen DisplayPort 1.4 zur Verfügung stehen. Bis dahin bliebe der 27" iMac der einzige 5K-Mac. 0 0 18 Kommentare Kommentare struffsky25.08.16 15:48 Von Apple ist zu erwarten: Maximale Gewinnmarge.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek I Got Scammed by a Counterfeiter on Amazon. Here’s How You Can Avoid Them Amazon, for all its conveniences, isn’t like walking into a traditional retail store. Amazon is a full marketplace that connects you not only to their own store, but to third-party sellers. This was driven home for me when I recently bought one of the top mini PCs on Amazon and found it came with a pirated Windows license. The lesson: Be careful with third-party sellers on Amazon. Anything not sold by Amazon itself has not been thoroughly vetted by them, and could be a counterfeit or pirated product. That’s true even if a product is marked “Prime”–just because something ships from Amazon’s warehouses doesn’t mean the product is legitimate, or sold by Amazon themselves. How I Got Burned I wanted a cheap mini PC to use as a media center for my TV, so I headed to Amazon–where I do a lot of my shopping–and searched for one. What I didn’t realize at the time was that three of the top six search results for “mini PC” on Amazon come with pirated Windows licenses. (The other three results are a Chromebox and two barebones PCs that come without Windows licenses.) The particular PC I purchased was sold by “MarsKing“. Sure, that’s a Chinese manufacturer I’ve never heard of, but it’s solid Intel hardware inside. It was also marked by Amazon as the “#1 New Release” in this category and had solid 4-to-5-star reviews at the time. It even had a “Prime” logo, which meant that it would be shipped to me from an Amazon warehouse. Looks legit, right? Nope! The PC came with a KMS Loader activation crack installed and was using a KMS key–a common way to activate pirated Windows licenses. Windows Defender found the KMS activation crack and complained about malware as soon as Windows Update ran automatically. After I left a bad review and returned the product to Amazon, MarsKing contacted me through Amazon with an offer: “We would like to sell you a new pc box with legitimate [Windows license] at 50% money off as apologize.” I didn’t take them up on it. Other manufacturers are sneakier. PowerLead, which makes the top mini PC on Amazon, describes its product as such: “This PowerLead Windows 10 Smart TV Box Mini PC is with trial win 10 operating system. If you need to buy the original version, please update online”. But someone in the comment helpfully notes that the PC seems to activate anyway. It’s unclear as to how. The Problem: Amazon.com Isn’t Just One Store Most people don’t realize this, but Amazon doesn’t actually sell most of the products on Amazon.com. Instead, most products sold on Amazon.com actually come from “third-party sellers”. Amazon just functions as a marketplace, connecting you and the seller. Even if a product is marked as “Prime” and is from Amazon’s own warehouse, it may be simply “fulfilled by Amazon”: a seller ships its products to Amazon’s warehouse and then Amazon ships them to you. Amazon isn’t actually selling the product, and hasn’t vetted it. In 2015, a RW Baird report found that 83% of the products purchased from Amazon.com were sold by third-party sellers. Surprised? So was I. Amazon doesn’t do a ton to make the distinction between third-party sellers and sold-by-Amazon products. And, apparently, they don’t vet third-party-sold products very closely either, even if Amazon’s doing the shipping. In July 2016, CNBC wrote that counterfeiting on Amazon.com had “exploded” in 2016, according to many Amazon sellers. The problem, often, is that third-party sellers will list cheaper options on the very same product page, but those cheaper options will be counterfeits. But, as we saw with PCs, it’s possible that manufacturers might actually assemble products with pirated software and other flaws and market them as legitimate. In 2013, the Daily Dot purchased a counterfeit charger from Amazon. It melted the first time it was connected to a power outlet. We’d be particularly worried about buying phone and laptop batteries from third-party sellers on Amazon, as counterfeit phone batteries are a serious danger that could cause explosions and fires. How to Avoid Counterfeit Products and Pirated Software on Amazon We wish Amazon would do more to combat this problem. But in the meantime, how can you avoid situations like this when shopping on Amazon.com? Here are a few tips. Know Who’s Selling the Product There are three types of products you’ll see on Amazon.com, and you should be aware of the difference. They are: Ships from and sold by [Name of Third-Party Seller]: When you purchase this product, Amazon gets a cut–but Amazon isn’t otherwise involved in the transaction. The product is sold by the third-party seller and is shipped from them directly to you, not unlike eBay and other online marketplaces. Most counterfeit and pirated products will probably be shipped directly from a third-party seller. Sold by [Name of Third-Party Seller] and Fulfilled by Amazon: Products that are “fulfilled by Amazon” may have the “Prime” logo that makes them look like they’re sold by Amazon–but they aren’t. You’re still buying a product from a third-party seller. The third-party seller ships that product to Amazon’s warehouses and Amazon ships it to you. However, Amazon doesn’t necessarily confirm that the product is legitimate before shipping it to you. Ships from and sold by Amazon.com: The product is actually sold by Amazon.com, and it should almost certainly be legitimate. Watch out for products sold by third-party sellers when shopping on Amazon.com. Not every third-party seller is bad, of course, and many are selling legitimate products (I’ve bought many of them in the past). But be careful, especially if the product’s price seems a little too good to be true or the reviews indicate a problem. Speaking of which… Read the Reviews (but Know What You’re Looking For) This should go without saying, but check out the reviews–not just the 5-star rating–for any product you buy on Amazon, especially if it’s from a third-party seller. Many reviews will specifically call out a counterfeit product, which should immediately be a red flag. That said, good review scores don’t necessarily indicate a product is legitimate and authentic. A product may have a bunch of fake five star reviews to make it look more legitimate, not real reviews from actual customers. While bad reviews are obviously bad, very good reviews can also be suspicious. If you see many five star reviews without much explanation or very similar writing, that suggests the positive reviews may be fake. Be sure to check the recent reviews, too–not just the overall product reviews. A product may have a lot of positive reviews from past transactions, but a few recent negative recent reviews may suggest that they’ve changed something about their product. Narrow Your Searches to Products Sold by Amazon.com You can also choose to search for products sold by Amazon itself, although Amazon doesn’t make it easy. After searching Amazon for a product, scroll down in the left sidebar and find the “Seller” section. Click the “See More” option and then select “Amazon.com” to see only products sold by Amazon. Of course, this will get rid of a lot of products from your search results too. In a lot of cases, this may not be a problem–but for certain categories that Amazon doesn’t sell a lot of products for (computer parts, lawn & garden, or cosmetics, for example), this tip may not be too useful. What Amazon Says We reached out to Amazon, who declined to comment on this story in particular. They did, however, point us towards its official policies: The A-to-z Customer Guarantee and Amazon Anti-Counterfeiting Policy. The A-to-z guarantee guarantees purchases made from third-party sellers, entitling you to a refund if the seller ships you a product that doesn’t match the description, fails to ship you the product within the advertised ship time, or won’t accept the product for a replacement. The anti-counterfeiting policy forbids the selling of counterfeit products on Amazon and says that Amazon may terminate seller accounts and destroy inventory in Amazon fulfillment centers if it discovers counterfeit products. Amazon does still seem to have good customer service. I was able to return the PC to Amazon with no issues–all I had to do was fill out a quick online form and say the product wasn’t what was advertised. I then shipped it right back to Amazon’s return department using a free mailing label Amazon had me print out. But these policies are after-the-fact protection. Shopping on Amazon isn’t the same as shopping at Best Buy or another brick-and-mortar retail store. It’s more like shopping on eBay–Amazon.com is often the middleman that connects you with a seller, not the store itself. Amazon doesn’t necessarily examine or vouch for the products being sold on its website before they reach you. That’s something most people don’t understand about Amazon, but should. JOIN THE DISCUSSION (44 REPLIES) August 25, 2016 Jim Cole This is why I avoid software key sites, like the Kinguin network and all those other jokers. Just because you're 'signed up' with a kosher-looking website, doesn't mean you're actually dealing with them. (Yes, I've been burned by G2A,Kinguin et al). Of course, Amazon is a whole order of magnitude better and more trustworthy than them, and I've been lucky, I suppose, in that the kinds of things I buy from Amazon are not really prone to dodginess (books mostly, even rare and collectable volumes). Good article though, with sound advice. Thank you! August 25, 2016 Jerry Howard The article is very informative but...Is not Best Buy or other brick and mortar store a "middle-man" for a manufacturer (seller)? Don't tell me K-Mart looks for the quality and originality of every product it sells. "Ships from and sold by Amazon.com: The product is actually sold by Amazon.com, and it should almost certainly be legitimate."LOL Do you know this to be the case? As you pointed out I absolutely love Amazon for their "almost no questions asked return-exchange policy". If I buy a Samsung TV from the Amazon whse or a One-Hung-Lo TV from China thru Amazon I know Amazon will back it up. August 25, 2016 Jim I also notice other online retailers are acting as a portal for other merchants. Look at Newegg.com they have other retailers selling their products on Newegg's website. Same buyer beware cautions should be taken as dealing with Amazon. August 25, 2016 Whitson Gordon Manufacturer and seller are not the same thing, at least the way we're using them in this discussion. In the Best Buy or K-Mart case, they are the seller. They get the product directly from the manufacturer (or a distributor who works with the manufacturer), and choose which products to sell in their store. If an item is sold by Amazon, it works similarly. In that case Amazon is not a middleman, they are the seller. But Amazon also acts as a middleman for other sellers, too, who can create an Amazon Seller account and use Amazon's web site as a tool for their own store. Most sellers are probably good, and selling legitimate things and just trying to make a living with their business. But in some cases, that seller may be selling a falsely advertised product. It could be their own product, like a mini PC with an illegitimate Windows license, or maybe it's a counterfeit version of someone else's product, like a bottle of Armani perfume that's been watered down. August 25, 2016 Amazon is going to eventually be burned by this one. They are complicit in the sale AND delivery of counterfeit goods. No amount of EULA or T&C lawyer trickery is going to get them out of it. And it will cost them billions. Buyer beware... August 25, 2016 Just Because Alright Re: Amazon reviews on a certain product:If you go to the fakespotdotcom website and paste the Amazon review page url in, it will analyze the reviews and give you a likelihood % if any reviews seem to be faked. Most helpful. Companies have been know to post reviews on their own products,and disparaging comments on their competitor's amazon products. August 25, 2016 Straspey While I give little credibility to reviews - I find that in many cases one can gather more useful information from the ten or fifteen "negative" reviews, as opposed to the fifty or sixty "positive" ones. I go right to the negatives, and read them with a critical eye. For instance - if you're reading reviews about a room space heater, and someone gives a bad review because the unit failed heat up their entire five-room apartment - then you realize the consumer had unreasonable expectations and discount his complaint. However - if the review says the unit operated perfectly for two weeks and then just stooped working and went dead - and you see that complaint from more than one consumer - that becomes a red flag for me and I proceed to look elsewhere. I have over 400 purchases on Ebay over a fifteen-year period, and have been disappointed less than five times over that span. When a seller has 2,500 feedbacks - but 375 of them are negative, with complaints like "Received wrong item. Seller did not respond to my emails" - and - "Item arrived damaged. No communication from seller." -- I avoid doing business with them - even in light of the other 2,125 positives. I probably would not buy a computer on Ebay - although I have purchased a number of used, high-end stereo components over the years, all with good results - but I probably would not buy a computer on Amazon either, because I'm hesitant to take the risk. August 25, 2016 There is a website- www.fakespot.com that allows you to enter the URL of the Amazon product you are looking at and report if its algorithm indicates the reviews are suspicious- Who is to say the site is not subject to manipulation I don't know, but I have found its responses pretty well mirror what my opinion is. August 25, 2016 jim beam Good read; however maybe the title is a bit misleading when the subject matter example pointed at an example of pirated software, not a counterfeiter...? a counterfeiter is more a party that creates a fake of something. This example referenced is not a fake; it is actually Windows but it's pirated with a gray/black market app. August 25, 2016 jim beam I don't see Amazon being burned. They're a big company- yes. But I can bet they're already working on a strategy to combat and help minimize counterfeiters. August 25, 2016 Daisy Another thing to watch out for is sellers who list their product on a listing for a different item. A while ago I was shopping for a new tablet. I decided on a Samsung Galaxy Tab E, which has (in the version sold in the US) 16GB of internal storage and is shipped with Lollipop. After I ordered it, though, I realized the seller had added a note that the unit ships with 8GB internal storage and an 8GB SD card. (This wasn't readily apparent on the mobile version of the site when I was browsing from my phone, but was obvious when I looked at it from my computer.) I contacted the seller and asked if they could verify that the model number was the same as on the listing page, and that's when it came out that the one they were selling was an international version with only 8GB internal storage and running KitKat instead of Lollipop. Fortunately I was able to cancel the order before it shipped. On top of not even being the same product (albeit with the same model name for some reason) I doubt the warranty would have been valid since it wasn't intended for sale in the US. (It was listed as shipping from the US - I had no idea that was even something to watch out for before this.) August 25, 2016 Dr Nobody First, I am surprised this is your first encounter with things like this on Amazon. Seriously. Second, this is definitely not a matter of counterfeit, this is something entirely different. However, counterfeiters have quickly been becoming the plague of Amazon & Ebay, to the point where you can no longer trust anything you buy there anymore. It doesn't matter if it's a seemingly harmless, pointless item that you'd never think they'd counterfeit. They still do it. Everything from make-up, to those green produce bags, to electronics, to whatever you can possibly think of. I have been screwed for the past year because of this crap. I'm disabled & can't go to stores, so I relied heavily on the ability to buy things from places like Amazon. Now I avoid it like the plague & am out here floundering, searching for reputable websites that I know actually source their products the right way, and aren't just a bunch of jerks from China trying to make a quick buck. It's disgusting. I'm surprised that it's not in the news, or mentioned more often, since it was not like this previously and now makes up at least half or more of the items available there. Amazon has gotten less and less caring about it, and in fact they will even take the side of these counterfeiters. They've also removed reviews from real users who have had this happen & are trying to warn other customers. It's really despicable. They couldn't care less because they're too big to care now. Good luck trying to avoid this, too, since there's really no actual way to do that. You can't get information on where a seller is located, these jerks have been gaming the ratings system for years, and you can forget about ever trusting another review again. There are not only tons of websites where these companies find people to pay to leave stupid fake reviews, but the companies themselves have giant rooms filled with people on computers doing this shit. I'm not trying to sound like a dick, but honestly, I think one of the best ways to deal with this would be to disallow sellers from IP addresses in China. Sure, it wouldn't be 100% successful, but it would do well to weed out quite a bit of the scammers. That and Amazon needs to start requiring proof of location & other things from sellers. I'm sick of getting ripped off. If you think it's racism, think again, the majority of cyber crime comes from or is committed there. Look it up. Still, this is all irrelevant, since the article is clearly about getting something with a pirated copy of Windows on it, which I believe is a different matter. However, I do think it's likely to be the same people doing it. My suggestion is not to use Amazon anymore. It's no longer trustworthy or useful. Believe me. That's all aside from the fact there's an entire different kind of scam going on there with people taking hardcore advantage of the system to push crappy products & basically buying reviews while somehow still adhering to their guidelines, and they all use these disgusting guides all over the web, or in books, that basically tell you how to scam your way to the top on Amazon & get featured as best product (often by a really nasty trick where you just list your product in an irrelevant category with barely any other products, and then get a few more purchases than the measly few the others have, and BAM, you're #1 product, and most people only see that part, not that the broom is the #1 product being sold in the baby pacifiers category. I don't think that's within the Amazon guidelines, either!). If I see one more "I received this at a discount for my unbiased review", I swear I'm going to puke. August 25, 2016 Dr Nobody Most? While that may have been true a few years ago, this is sadly no longer that case. Not even by a long shot. Most of the sellers on Amazon are either counterfeiters, selling counterfeit items, or they are trying to push brand new things onto consumers that are junk (worse than As-Seen-on-TV crap) using extremely unscrupulous tactics & violating Amazon's own terms. Unfortunately Amazon is just an ocean of scammers these days, whatever way you want to look at it. August 25, 2016 Koam "A counterfeiter" is not a "them" - Editors take note. August 25, 2016 Koam Reviews for the product are not meaningful, period. One product is sold by many sellers. The reviews are for the product, real or fake and tell you nothing about whether the seller has a real or fake item. The seller reviews are where to look. Sellers should have extremely high ratings and many reviews over time. Anything below 4.8-star average should make you look more closely at the details of the reviews. August 25, 2016 Dana Simpkins First, caveat emptor. There's a reason this phrase has been around so long we still remember it in Latin. You will glean more information from the 2 and 3 star reviews than you will from the 1 and 5 stars. 5 stars are either plants or don't provide useful information. 1 stars are usually disgruntled employees or former customers, or folks with high expectations. Read your 2 star folks' reviews and you will see how the product could be improved. 3 stars are how they sort of missed the mark. Some reviews are actually hilarious...Haribo Sugar Free Gummy Bears-Amazon...that's all I am going to say. I have social anxiety disorder. I don't do well shopping in crowds, so online shopping is wonderful. Amazon Prime has been my shopping bestie for eight years now, and I have had to return three things in eight years. Three. Did I mention I have items on subscription? Two of the items were merely credited to my account and I was not required to actually return them. I even order my college textbooks from Amazon, renting them when available. Customer service is something that Amazon takes pride in, and they are industry leaders in customer service. This is why so many brick and mortar stores have felt the pinch from their success. In summary, we must do our homework to protect ourselves. August 25, 2016 Straspey I play an instrument for which I use a specialized device designed to assist in tuning the instrument - especially since I don't always tune it the same way every time I play - The manufacturer is no longer producing new units, however they can repair and refurbish an older one - which became necessary in my case when the small internal speakers inside the device began to fail. The repair guy told me they did not have any replacement speakers in stock, however he sent me an Amazon link to a place where I could buy a pair directly from a supplier. The repair guy was very clear that the speakers would coming from China and might take a while to arrive - but I should just be patient. I ordered two pairs at some ridiculously cheap price of around twelve dollars, and sat back to wait. About three weeks later the package arrived with the two sets of speakers - exactly the model we ordered - and in perfect condition. I packed up my tuning box, along with the speakers, and sent it off to be repaired. A week later it came back like new - the new speakers providing a strong, true tone - allowing me to keep using the device for the very sophisticated business of tuning my instrument to pitches other than A=440 and in alternate temperaments other than "equal". Next, I needed a case of some sort to keep the device protected when not in use and also when traveling. For that, I went on Ebay - where I found a distributor located on the West Coast - but who's inventory was obviously coming from China. They seemed to have exactly what I was looking for, so I bid on one of their auctions and ended up buy a brand new small hard case intended for a "Go Pro" camera for about four dollars - with free shipping. The case arrived in less than a week and I was so pleased with it - and with the communication from a very friendly Ebay seller - that I bought a few more to give to friends who also use the same device. I'm fortunate in that my positive experiences on both Amazon and Ebay far outweigh the few disappointments I've had over the years. All it takes is for one to really pay attention and - when possible - a friendly email will go a long way to setting up a transaction with happy results. August 25, 2016 Zinc Whiskers Customs has been stopping Windows mini PCs from Chinese re-sellers if they think the purchase price is less than the legit cost of a Windows license. For some reason they've been giving Amazon a free pass for the same boxes. http://www.cnx-software.com/2016/07/04/have-us-customs-declared-war-on-tv-boxes-and-mini-pcs/ Some Android TV boxes are also getting stopped if they're pre-loaded with Kodi and use the phrase "Free TV". August 25, 2016 Whitson Gordon Not just pre-loaded with Kodi--but pre-loaded with Kodi and piracy-related add-ons, if I recall. This is something Kodi has been fighting against as it's been hurting their image (Kodi on its own does not give you free TV, it's merely a video player and organizer). August 25, 2016 Bruce Bevitz I bought Apple cables supposedly OEM. The boxes looked correrct. A prior cable purchase lacked the Apple logo on the box. The latest had the Apple Logo,and the vendor states they are O.E.,M, but would not work. I bought a cable from the Apple store, and at first glance the packaging looked the same, but the inside packaging and hang tag were different. The bar code on the flap was also different. One seller was from China. the other from the U.S.A. I complained, and got refunds, but they are still selling the same crap even though I contacted Amazon. August 25, 2016 cody j interesting,great article..alot of people dont know about the 3rd party 'racket'. My folks bought a ' record (vynal) to cd' unit ,that came with no instrucs and didnt work.,and as you said ,they ''assumed' it was from Amazon direct. ...turns out it was from a 3rd party seller, who admitted he bought it CHEAP from one of those HUGE outfits that deal only in customer returned merchandise(which you can buy for cents on the dollar),and just re listed it..My folks DID get their money back ,tho, shipping back included..but now we look for the Amazon only label...or go elsewhere. This is a good article,thanks ! August 26, 2016 Pradip Shah There is a problem with Amazon's review policy also. If you have a bad experience or have been scammed ans returned your purchase, Amazon still won't allow you to write an honest review. Of course I am referring to their Indian arm. Recently I bought a set of containers shipped by Amazon, The seller was supposedly offering 30 % discount on M.R.P. (Maximum Retail Price as is required by Indian law) which seemed like a good deal. When the material arrived I saw a very large sticker offering 50% promotional discount on the M.R.P by the manufacturer themselves. So in effect the seller was marking it up by 40% which is against the law. Amazon simply would not allow me to state this fact in the review. So in effect they allowed this particular seller to continue with his scam! August 26, 2016 What about this: If goods shipped by Amazon from their fulfillment center include or are counterfeit software, then surely said software must be deemed to be stolen property (which it really is isn't it?). In which case shouldn't Amazon be prosecuted for handing stolen property? I'm no legal eagleBut to me its like a mate of mine says look I've got these computers which I'm selling for $500.00, I'll do all the advertising, I'll drop them all off at your place and when someone buys one all you have to do is ship it off to them and I'll give you 10% of the $500.00 plus the freight cost. Trouble is he stole them. Isn't that illegal? Isn't that handling of stolen property? Is that what Amazon is doing? They of course can say "oh poor me, I'm not very smart, I didn't have the time, I didn't know they were stolen, I trusted them" (as i understand the law its not accepted as a defense, doesn't prevent you from being prosecuted, everyone caught says "oh i didn't know" don't they?) In that case shouldn't the police then confiscate the computers, freeze shipping of all goods in the warehouse until proof that none of the other stock in their warehouse is wholly or partly comprised of stolen property? rgdsBadger August 26, 2016 Ouch that's nasty, isn't there a site where you can publicize that they block bad reviews? If not there damn well should be. rgdsBadger August 26, 2016 Pradip Shah Unfortunately I am not a twitter otherwise I could have taken them to task. Similarly I have had a major problem with Dr. Scholl footwear manufactured by their manufacturing and marketing licensee, Bata India who are probably the largest manufacturers in India, who avoid honoring the warranty on the product. I now feel it is about time I got onto Twitter and started voicing my experiences and opinions. August 26, 2016 Sheila Nauman Todd I have bought and sold products from Amazon since their onset. I do not like to buy things with less than a 3 star rating. I do read a smattering of good and bad reviews before purchase. I have run into third party sellers where the product is now shipped from China. I recall earlier this year ordering a USB for my husband. The seller had a tracking device so we could see where it was - it literally took weeks to get to the States. My husband said I guess there still are slow boats from China. As a seller you don't get much support from Amazon unless you go looking for it. When you do they are most helpful. Mostly I sell used books and have had more problems with the post office than Amazon I did have a problem with some software I tried to sell.I think Amazon has agreements with some of these vendors and they pulled the sale. It was brand new software in the box that we were gifted but could not use. I had a hard time explaining this to Amazon that I wasn't trying to break their rules. At one point I told them that if the rule was this solid why did they allow the listing? Amazon needs to ferret out the bad people but it also needs to let folks know up front what isn't acceptable. For instance, had they said this product cannot be sold on Amazon because of xyz. I simply would not have listed it. Instead they tried to make me the bad guy yet they were in total control of allowing the listing in the first place! Last month I tried to sell a Fitbit that my husband had won in an office contest. He already had one. Amazon told me it considers Fitbits medical devices and I could not sell in on Amazon. Or, do they have an agreement with Fitbit no third-party vendors? Kinda like the agreement Starbucks might have in a strip mall - no other coffee vendors. August 26, 2016 Whitson Gordon A few people have made similar points about Amazon's protections, and I've heard this before too. From what I hear, eBay goes out of their way to protect their sellers--sometimes to the detriment of the buyers. Amazon, on the other hand, protects their buyers. August 26, 2016 Straspey WhitsonGordon: From what I hear, eBay goes out of their way to protect their sellers--sometimes to the detriment of the buyers. "What does eBay Money Back Guarantee mean to sellers?" Sometimes, buyers and sellers don't agree. Hey, these things happen. Learn how eBay Money Back Guarantee can help you navigate through the process. "How does eBay Money Back Guarantee benefit me?" eBay Money Back Guarantee is designed to inspire buyer confidence and streamline the resolution process when there are issues with a transaction. It also encourages buyers to buy with the assured satisfaction and quick response they expect from a trusted retailer. http://pages.ebay.com/resolutioncenter/BuyerProtectionForSellers.html In most cases, eBay leans heavily in favor of the buyer, because without buyers, there would be no business. eBay does provide relief for sellers who have not been paid by the buyer or winner of the auction in the form of reimbursement of seller's fees - but since a seller never ships the item before receiving payment, their losses are considerably less in contrast to a buyer who - after having paid for the item (plus shipping) - receives a broken, faulty, incorrect item - or nothing at all. August 27, 2016 Whitson Gordon Ah, you might be right, I might have it backwards, eBay is notoriously protective of buyers, much to the detriment of sellers. My apologies, not sure why I remembered that so wrong! August 30, 2016 I think this sums it up very well.Basically, anything not sold by Amazon but by a 3rd party should be suspect. In particular, anything that can be knocked off, will be. Case in point: replacement toothbrush heads for the Philips Sonicare electric toothbrushes. It should be noted on the illustration that the heads are shown with the writing on them obscured. Being knockoffs this is necessary to hide the fact that they don't dare say "Philips" on them. Extrapolating from the posted reviews it appears that, extrapolating, tens of thousandsor more have fallen for this scam. And don't think the famous Amazon guarantee comes to the rescue - by the time the bristles fall off, the warranty period is gone.Buyer beware, as always. Got Feedback?

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek Steam In-Home Streaming vs. NVIDIA GameStream: What’s the Difference? Both Steam In-Home Streaming and NVIDIA GameStream allow you to stream games from a powerful gaming PC and play them on another device, bringing the power of your gaming PC to your living room or a slower laptop or tablet. But what’s the difference between them? RELATED ARTICLES How to Use Steam In-Home Streaming How to Stream Games With NVIDIA GameStream to Any Computer, Tablet, or Smartphone The Basics Both Steam In-Home Streaming and NVIDIA GameStream function similarly. They let you “stream” games from a solid Windows gaming PC to another device over the network. For example, you might have a solid gaming PC in your office, but want to play a game on the TV in your living room. Rather than unplugging your PC and hauling it to another room–or buying another powerful, expensive PC just for your living room–you can just hook up a cheap PC to the TV in your living room and stream the game. Your gaming PC does the work, rendering the game while the image is sent to your TV. You hook up one or more game controllers–or a keyboard and mouse–to the device connected to the TV and it sends the input to the game running elsewhere in your home. RELATED ARTICLE How to Get Better Performance from Steam In-Home Streaming Streaming will never work as perfectly as hooking a powerful gaming PC directly to your TV. There will always be a small amount of input lag and perhaps some graphical artifacts due to the encoding. But, with a solid enough network connection and a powerful enough computer, you can have an excellent experience that’s much better than having a less powerful gaming PC hooked up to your TV. While the TV in your living room is the usual example, it doesn’t have to be a TV. You can use this solution to stream games from a high-power gaming PC to a laptop or tablet, allowing you to play games your laptop just wouldn’t be able to play. GameStream Has Stricter Hardware Requirements Steam’s In-Home Streaming is the most forgiving in terms of hardware requirements. Valve recommends the computer you stream from have a quad-core CPU, and that the client PC support hardware-accelerated H.264 decoding. Practically any recent PC should have this feature. NVIDIA’s GameStream requirements are more strict. Your computer must have an NVIDIA graphics processor–AMD or Intel graphics  won’t work. That NVIDIA graphics hardware must be either be either a desktop-class GTX 600 series or higher GPU, or a notebook-class GTX 660M or higher GPU. You can check whether your PC supports this feature by opening the NVIDIA GeForce Experience application and looking under My Rig > GameStream. Steam Streams to Most PCs, While GameStream Is…Complicated RELATED ARTICLE How to Stream Games With NVIDIA GameStream to Any Computer, Tablet, or Smartphone Both of these solutions require you stream from a Windows PC, although Valve says it’s working on allowing you to stream from a Mac or Linux computer as well. But, if you have a powerful gaming PC, it’s probably running Windows anyway. The device you stream to is a different matter. Steam In-Home Streaming allows you to stream to any computer running Steam. This means that you can stream from a Windows gaming PC to a PC running Windows, Mac, or Linux, or a Steam Machine running SteamOS. There’s no way to stream to a computer running Chrome OS, though. NVIDIA GameStream, on the other hand, isn’t meant to stream to other PCs–it’s only meant to stream games to NVIDIA’s SHIELD devices (see below). But, thanks to an unofficial, open-source project named Moonlight, you can use GameStream to stream to a computer running Windows, Mac, or Linux, or even a Chrome OS computer. That is, as long as Moonlight is kept and up-to-date. Just remember that, since it’s unofficial, it could contain bugs or become abandoned at any time. Valve Offers the Steam Link, and NVIDIA Offers SHIELD Hardware Both platforms also offer dedicated hardware devices for streaming. For Steam In-Home Streaming, you can purchase a $50 Steam Link that’s designed to connect to the TV in your living room. This device isn’t a true Steam Machine; instead, it’s just designed to connect to a PC and use Steam In-Home Streaming to stream to your TV. NVIDIA GameStream is officially designed to be used only with NVIDIA’s own NVIDIA SHIELD hardware. NVIDIA currently offers a SHIELD Android TV device designed to connect to your home entertainment center, a SHIELD tablet, and a handheld SHIELD gaming device. It’s worth repeating that NVIDIA offers no official Windows, Mac, or Linux clients for GameStream. That’s why you need to use the unofficial Moonlight client mentioned above if you want to use GameStream on a PC. Only NVIDIA’s own SHIELD hardware is officially supported as a client. GameStream Can (Unofficially) Stream to Smartphones and Tablets, But Steam Can’t Steam’s In-Home Streaming offers no way to play games on an Android smartphone or tablet, an iPad, or an iPhone. However, that open-source Moonlight client for NVIDIA GameStream does offer Android and iOS clients , allowing you to play games on Android tablets, iPhones, and iPads. It’s a definite unique feature for GameStream, but it’s also unofficial. And, let’s be realistic–it sounds kind of cool, but you probably won’t want to play most PC games on your phone. GameStream Can Stream Over the Internet, Not Just In the Home Steam’s In-Home Streaming only functions on your local network. In other words, In-Home Streaming only functions in your home–it’s in the name. You can’t stream games remotely without messing with VPNs, and even then it may not work well. NVIDIA GameStream does offer some support for remotely streaming games, so you can leave your gaming PC on at home and stream games from it to another device over the Internet. Of course, you won’t have ideal performance, but it’s a neat feature nonetheless. Which Offers Better Performance? RELATED ARTICLE How to Get Better Performance from Steam In-Home Streaming Which offers the best performance? It’s impossible to actually say. Performance will mostly depend on your network–we recommend a fast wired Ethernet network to improve your streaming performance–and the hardware in the PC you’re streaming from. We’ve used both and they both seemed to perform similarly, at least in ideal conditions. If you’re using AMD hardware, Steam’s In-Home Streaming is the only option for you, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. If you have recent enough NVIDIA hardware, you can also give GameStream a shot and see if one works better for you with your hardware and on your network. But you might stumble into bugs when using NVIDIA GameStream along with the unofficial Moonlight client, as NVIDIA doesn’t officially support this. So in the end, the best option may be the one that supports the operating systems and devices you use. JOIN THE DISCUSSION (4 REPLIES) August 25, 2016 Keith R. Starkey I'll never go with NVIDIA. I have had way too many problems trying to get their card to work--sometimes it just won't work--with games. There's always too many settings that have to be tweaked, and when you find a forum that lists multiple how-to pages to do so...nah, I'm out. August 26, 2016 Miguel Mayol Chromebook with Crouton or with new Android compability Steam under wine will also be able to be used as clients. But better if they have Ethernet connector or a USB to Ethernet plugin. August 26, 2016 Whitson Gordon Funny, I've had much more trouble with AMD drivers than I ever have with NVIDIA.

(Photo by Carsten Koall/ Getty Images) Lisa Su, AMD president and CEO, stated during the AMD special event in San Francisco that the upcoming Zen processor will lay the foundation for a new line of products. AMD Zen's Goals During the AMD event, gaming and performance computing enthusiasts heard mixed news. The bad news is that the first Zen chips that were expected later this year will be delayed until early 2017. The good news is that the long-awaited Zen CPU architecture is constantly delivering a significant increase in processor performance in benchmark tests. Top Tech News reports that the upcoming AMD Zen processor could potentially pose a threat to competitor Intel's CPUs. Advanced Micro Devices made radical changes for its flagship Zen design with the aim to become a force in the server and personal computer markets yet again. At next week's Hot Chips symposium in Cupertino, California, it is expected that AMD will reveal more details about the in-development Zen CPU core. AMD Zen To Bring 40 Percent Performance Improvement According to Computerworld, chip designers at AMD started to work on Zen's design four years ago with the goals to keep power efficiency stable and to improve CPU performance as much as possible. Ultimately, AMD decided to settle for a 40 percent improvement in Zen's performance over Excavator its predecessor processor. Mike Clark, a senior fellow at AMD, explained that going for 40 percent performance improvement was a very aggressive goal, but the team knew that they had to do it in order to stay competitive. When it introduced Zen in 2015, the company promoted the 40 percent CPU improvement goal during an overhaul of its chip roadmap. Recent benchmark tests demonstrate that Zen chips achieved the 40 percent improvement goal. Compared to low-double digit improvements claimed by Intel in recent x86 chips, AMD's impressive boost in CPU performance will be a radical improvement. AMD Zen Core Features AMD's Zen-based Summit Ridge 8-core 16-thread desktop processor arrives on top in benchmark tests when compared to an Intel Broadwell-E processor set to the same clock speed. According to Mark Papermaster, AMD senior vice president and CTO, the Zen architecture has indeed proved to deliver a 40 percent clock improvement over previous generations of AMD processors. In terms of design features, Zen comes with a number of changes, including simultaneous multithreading (SMT) and a new cache hierarchy. The new architecture fixes most of the design errors made by AMD in its previous line of Bulldozer-based CPU cores. In fact, Intel has already used SMT to great effect.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 25 August 2016 | MYT 3:00 PM CrowdStrike, other cybersecurity firms rejoining industry cooperative A good sign: People familiar with the situation told Reuters said that two other "next-generation" security companies are expected to integrate with VirusTotal by the end of next month, a hopeful sign that a serious rift between older and newer security companies can be healed in service of the general good. — Reuters SAN FRANCISCO: Some information security companies that were shut out of the leading system for sharing data on malicious software are revealing more about how their own systems work in hopes of rejoining the cooperative effort, a shift that should improve protections for customers throughout the industry.  CrowdStrike, one of the most prominent young security companies threatened with exclusion from some shared services, said it has integrated part of its system for detecting malicious software with VirusTotal, the main industry repository for disclosing and rating risks of malware and suspect files.  Alphabet Inc's Google runs the VirusTotal database so security professionals can share new examples of suspected malicious software and opinions on the danger they pose. In May, the 12-year-old service said it would cut off unlimited ratings access to companies that do not share their own evaluations of submitted samples.  CrowdStrike is opening up a machine-learning process for malware evaluation, after discussions with VirusTotal on how to make the systems compatible.  "It will be very helpful to have the engine out so people can see for themselves how well it is working," CrowdStrike chief technology officer Dmitri Alperovitch told Reuters ahead of a public announcement on Aug 24.  VirusTotal did not respond to a request for comment. People familiar with the situation told Reuters said that two other "next-generation" security companies are expected to integrate with VirusTotal by the end of next month.  More are likely, the people said, a hopeful sign that a serious rift between older and newer security companies can be healed in service of the general good.  Some newer companies disparage the way that older vendors such as Symantec Corp, Intel Corp and Trend Micro Inc recognise malware based on signatures, or characteristics that have been spotted before. The younger companies say they use behavioural monitoring, machine-learning and other modern techniques to stop fast-changing malware.  Symantec, Intel, Trend Micro and other older companies say they also use similar new methods.  But some of the younger companies still used VirusTotal's assessments from old-line companies, without contributing their own evaluations. The dispute was partly based in technological compatibility with VirusTotal's system, an issue CrowdStrike said it and VirusTotal had solved.  Dennis Batchelder, general manager of an industry group called the Anti-Malware Testing Standards Organisation, predicted that more new companies would re-integrate with VirusTotal. Machine learning systems would benefit from access to the VirusTotal database, he said.  But some of the companies who parted with the VirusTotal ratings said they had no plans to make up.  "We did make attempts early on to engage with VirusTotal with the hopes that they would find a way to take advantage of our behaviour-based detection model," said SentinelOne chief marketing officer Scott Gainey. "To our knowledge, those interfaces still do not exist today."   And Stuart McClure, chief executive of Cylance Inc, pointed out that his company and others can still get samples of malicious software from VirusTotal, just not the opinions of other companies about those samples.  "We don't integrate with VirusTotal," McClure said by email.

It’s a semi-tock with optimized microarchitecture, offering support for Thunderbolt 3, native USB 3.1, and DisplayPort 1.2.” “According to Krzanich, Kaby Lake processors are already shipping to Intel’s manufacturing partners and will launch in new devices coming this fall,” Clover reports. “Krzanich did not provide a further breakdown on when chips appropriate for some of Apple’s machines long overdue for updates will launch.” “Intel often launches low-power 4.5W Y-series chips and 15W U-series chips first, neither of which are suitable for use in the machine that people are most curious about, the MacBook Pro,” Clover reports. “According to an old Intel roadmap, Kaby Lake chips appropriate for use in the MacBook Pro, the iMac, and the Mac mini won’t launch until the very end of 2016 or the beginning of 2017, meaning any Apple machines released in the fall of 2016 may be limited to Skylake chips.” Read more in the full article here.

UGH!!” Shadowself Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - 6:17 pm · Reply I said this over a year ago on this site… Anyone who thinks Apple will ship Macs based upon Kaby Lake processors in 2016 is nuts. Kaby Lake is NOT shipping in quantity. It’s barely past the prototype stage for any of its models. It will be sampling for *some* models in the next month or two. Full production won’t happen for *any* model until November or December (just so Intel can claim they high full production for Kaby Lake in 2016). Yes, some vendors will announce Kaby Lake laptops (or laptop convertibles) this year with Kaby Lake, but they will not ship those in the tens of thousands per week. Not this calendar year. The problem is that Apple *COULD* have refreshed the entire set of non Mac Pro lines with Skylake earlier this year. Apple could have even supported TB3 and USB 3.1 with stand alone chips. Then early next year updated the entire line with Kaby Lake with the CPU integrated capabilities. Many, many Mac users would have been happy with that. Now Apple has the dilemma of either shipping Skylake systems before the end of this calendar year that they *could* have shipped four or more months ago (and be immediately declared as behind the times), or they can wait until 2017 to refresh the line base upon Kaby Lake and take the *very* real risk that many pro users are going to jump ship before then. thetheloniousmac Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - 10:39 am · Reply Yes. You did say this, and it bummed me out then, and it still does. thetheloniousmac Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - 10:42 am · Reply I’d say no point in shipping Skylake. All they have to do is break a tiny little bit of silence and say “We’re waiting for Kaby Lake” and most people will be satisfied. Lots of people will wait for Kaby Lake anyway. But they will be silent, and people will bitch and moan. spyintheskyuk Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - 2:26 pm · Reply And that last sentence seems to be far too common of late, ie wait for a better solution, but end up waiting so long that their products ship for long periods with original more inferior solutions, and when they do launch its not far short of an opportunity for another update anyway had they gone with the less advanced chip option. Well that’s if they didn’t aim to try to save money by only updating well past the date when it is appropriate anyway, so exacerbating the timing problem further. The loss of sales by waiting as a result must surely put the logic of that policy into question. BigDave Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - 8:00 pm · Reply Intel processors are two generations ahead of what ships in the MacBook Pro. You can’t blame Intel. Apple didn’t ship with Broadwell. Apple didn’t ship with Skylake. When Apple doesn’t ship with Kaby Lake, you’ll be complaining that it is because Intel is late with Cannonlake. Intel is progressing. Apple and Tim Cook are standing still. Voice of reason Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - 8:10 pm · Reply The 2015 13″ MacBook Pro has a broad well chip, the 2015 iMac has a sky lake chip, the MacBook has a sky lake chip, the Mac mini and 15″ MacBook Pro are the only ones using a Haswell chip. The Mac Pro used the most current Xeons until this past May…. You’re very wrong. BigDave Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - 9:18 am · Reply Well, I’m referring to the 15″ MacBook Pro (probably because that’s what I have). Regarding that, I am very correct. You are correct about the 13″ MacBook Pro. The Mac Mini is not only two generations behind; it uses a crippled processor (two cores only). Again, you can’t blame that on Intel. Blame Tim Cook. Voice of reason Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - 5:17 pm · Reply This is why I’ve been so patient with the Mac refreshes. Intel is dropping the ball on processors, there is no reason they couldn’t give Apple early access to the Kaby lake chips for MacBook pros, like they did with the core 2 chips on the original MacBook Air. But with Apple now being one more company relying on intel’s roadmap and production, they are hamstrung what they can get from them. As MDN says A-series macs and Intel macs could easily ℅ exist, and I don’t think that’s the worst idea especially if the A10/A10x chips are markedly faster than their predecessors. Now if the Kaby lake chips don’t provide the generational improvement over sky lake? Then going with sky lake is fine for performance, and making some battery optimizations, storage improvements, and Polaris 11 graphics would make up for that in many ways. They may have to build a custom thunderbolt 3 board, but they’ll do it. Goddamned Intel. Wrong Again Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - 6:15 pm · Reply I give them slack, too. I have the money to buy (been saving money now for years LOL!) and I have the desire for a new system (haven’t bought since 2013) but since I’ve already waited this long, I’ve been waiting for the “next” thing. Looks like the next thing won’t be coming until next year at the earliest, so I’m content to continue to wait until Intel can actually make something that Apple wants to use. OH, and if the chips next year are all dual core until late in the year, then we’re still not going to see an update.😦 Shadowself Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - 6:36 pm · Reply Intel is NOT “dropping the ball on processors”! Intel has announced its roadmaps for processors 12 – 18 months in advance. Yes, there was a significant slip a couple years back. But since that time Intel has been very up front with their plans and have matched those plans within a couple months for the last couple years. Ax series Mac will not do what Intel Macs will do. A lot of the Mac users (even pro users) depend upon software written for Intel and/or Windows/Linux. If you want to run that on an A10/A10X architecture you’ll have to do software translation at the lowest level. That is a huge hit. The only reason why Apple could get away with it for the 68000->PowerPC jump was the PowerPC was *so* much faster than the 68000 series chips of the day. It barely worked (but it did work) for they PowerPC->Intel shift because the chips being offered by IBM had pretty much hit a wall. No one in their right mind is suggesting Intel has hit a wall with their CPUs. Are you seriously suggesting Apple move to Ax series chips which are slower than Intel’s current chips for the vast majority of what Macs do then take a translation hit on top of that? Kaby Lake is the “Optimization” stage of what is now a three stage process (is: shrink, new architecture, optimize — was: shrink, new architecture). Kaby Lake’s optimization includes things like updated PCIe lanes, TB3 onboard, USB 3.1 onboard, better internal graphics engine, Optane storage, etc. There are reasons to want to move to Kaby Lake. Voice of reason Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - 7:42 pm · Reply The Ibm chips didn’t “hit a wall”. Performance wise, they’re still well ahead of intel offerings. It was “performance per watt” since apple was focusing on mobile systems. Intel has dropped the ball on processors, since Rachel iterative generation hasn’t provided the performance increase that apple came to expect in the first 6 years of the Intel relationship. For example, my 2012 MBP (as I’ve stated previously) isn’t much slower than the current systems. And in raw compute, is maybe 6 seconds slower on large encodes. Now if the kaby lake chips are significantly faster? Then use them. (The Polaris 11 gpus will be much faster than what we currently have) but if they’re not? Then use the sky lake. No one else seems to give razer any shit when they use last gen tech in their “gaming notebooks”…. Wrong Again Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - 8:28 pm · Reply “there was a significant slip a couple years back” You could have stopped right there as we’re in agreement.🙂 Now, if we can agree that Intel has been REALLY late with a 4 processor mobile ready Skylake processor, we’ll still be in agreement. Intel JUST announced that they will be producing ARM processors. I’m sure it’s because they know Apple’s serious about going the A9 way and they don’t want to be left out. JerryR Thursday, August 25, 2016 - 1:14 am · Reply Sure, Intel really really needs to be in the 7% of PCs that happen to be Macs. Let Apple put Ax CPUs in Macs and watch their market share drop by at least half. Perhaps Mac sales will even drop below Win phone sales? Now that would be spectacular. Danox Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - 5:24 pm · Reply Apple move on Intel is Motorola and IBM all over again. Derek Currie Tuesday, August 16, 2016 - 10:02 pm · Reply JV Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - 12:12 am · Reply ARM based macs are out of the question for now, that’s a fact we know. How, you may ask? Well, Bitcode. (Bitcode is the intermediate language of the LLVM compiler that enables Apps to automatically support any CPU architecture without changes. With that Apple can change the CPU architecture and all Bitcode-Apps would just magically work with native speed.) If Apple wanted to change CPU architecture, it would first enable, then encourage, then mandate all new App Store submissions to use Bitcode, and then launch the new architecture after there’s enough Bitcode-Apps available. Without that they’d need emulation, which is impossible with current (low) performance difference between ARM and i64. If Apple had any plans for ARM macs, Bitcode would be mandatory in the Mac App Store. But Mac App Store doesn’t have *any* support for Bitcode at all. So, there you have it: no ARM macs in the pipeline for the foreseeable future. However, Apple supports and encourages the use of Bitcode in (iOS) App Store. They are closer to running iOS with i64 than running macOS with ARM (xBox killing game console version of AppleTV or iOS Apps on macOS?) Rather than waiting for ARM based Mac, I’m hoping for an i64 CPU designed by Apple. I don’t have very high hopes, but that would explain waiting for so long without updates. Voice of reason Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - 4:57 am · Reply That’s a good argument, and would make sense if there wasn’t a history of Apple holding back compilers until the release of a “universal” binary support like during the Intel transition. Rosetta wasn’t even hinted at in code until it was announced with the 1st gen Intel iMacs and MacBook Pro. And I doubt that any developer who is trusted with that type of information would put any evidence of it in their systems. Apple recommends bitcode for arm devices because although they are different architectures (32 vs 64 bit) they are all still the same instruction set (risc) and it is required for older versions of software to run on older iOS devices that still use 32 bit arm devices. With the advent of iOS 10, and it dropping support for the A5, this won’t be necessary at the OS level anymore, which is another reasons that iOS 10 is smaller than previous releases, but is still required on apps that will support older hardware. On the Mac side, since i-64 chips are x86 cisc chips with the amd developed 64bit extensions, it makes little sense for Apple to tip it’s hand with any mention of a universal solution like Rosetta until they announce systems running on arm processors. And if they are able to get a hypothetical A10x “desktop” chip with better performance than any Intel offering, llvm support would be baked in to the version of macOS that ships with these machines. However, I doubt Apple would even hint at or announce such a transition before they actually do it so they can leapfrog the industry just like they did with 64bit mobile CPUs. Remember that PA-Semi had a PowerPC risc variant that was much faster than the core 2 series when Apple bought them, and there is no reason that team couldn’t have been developing both the arm processors for mobile and a true Intel replacement. Every time one of apple’s chip partners has gotten lazy, and not allowed them to move the way that they want, they drop them…. It’s happened 4 times. (Mos 6502- Motorola 68000, 68k-PowerPC, PowerPC-Intel, Samsung arm/strong arm-A series) and there weren’t any clues in any of the OS versions that hinted at these switches until Apple had publicly unveiled them. JV Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - 7:03 am · Reply That’s a good argument, and would make sense if Apple was not supporting Bitcode for iOS. Why they can give that hint for iOS but could not do the same with macOS too? There would be less of a hint if both had support. In fact Apple told about Intel transition in WWDC, June 2005. First Intel Mac came out in January 2006, half a year later. It was not a surprise at that point. Half a year even though as emulator Rosetta worked with existing PowerPC binaries “as is” — developers didn’t need to do very much for the transition so Apple got full app library support for free (well, for the cost of emulation.) Back then Apple could afford emulation because the new architecture was so much more powerful. Not so this time — Intel to ARM is on par at best, so emulation is not an option. You need at least twice the power, and the power per watt is even bigger problem — emulating i64 on ARM would consume MORE, not less, than native i64. You don’t want an ARM based MacBook that’s both slower and hotter than an Intel machine. So the only viable way to have comprehensive library of supported apps on day one (and Apple simply must have it) is Bitcode. Just adding Bitcode support in macOS would help only if the apps were compiled to Bitcode beforehand (as it is not an emulator.) Zero 3rd party apps are. There are two ways to get 3rd party apps compiled to Bitcode: promote Bitcode years in advance or reveal the transition at least half a year early like with the Intel transition. But not on launch day. That’s simply too late when emulator is out of question (and as seen with Intel transition, even emulation was announced half a year early.) Early announcement could kill sales, so that’s not desirable. That leaves promoting Bitcode as the best option. But that does not mean revealing a transition too early, or at all: Apple can require Bitcode for all its platforms and it still would not reveal a transition. There are multiple other reasons to require it, like a possibility to reoptimize the apps when there are new extensions for instruction sets or security fixes in compilers etc. Apple can have good reasons for requiring Bitcode for all platforms forever without ever making a transition. So, by requiring Bitcode for other reasons Apple could really make the transition as a real surprise, unlike the Intel one that they were forced to announce half a year early. Bitcode support is not a hint of transition but as long as there is no Bitcode support, that’s a hint of no transition. Voice of reason Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - 10:00 am · Reply That’s a little bit circular but I get what you’re saying. I guess my response to that would be that I predicated my argument on the hypothetical A10x desktop chip being more powerful/faster than any Intel offering, providing similar benefits to how Rosetta worked. I don’t think Apple would transition to a less powerful chip design. And I don’t see a reason why the pa semi team couldn’t out design Intel since they did it 8 years ago already, I guess we’ll see but I think putting bitcode into the developer release would tip their hand since Apple doesn’t support 32 bit macs anymore of the same instruction set. That’s why it makes sense on iOS platforms and the watch. The watch effectively runs a shrunken and optimized A5 called the S1, it’s 32 bit, so having the llvm built in makes sense, also because the watch works with 32bit hardware in the A6 (iPhone 5/5c). And because there are still a ton of 32bit iOS devices that can run iOS 9, which is when at wwdc 2015 they started requiring it. When >90% of the install base is on 64bit hardware, they’ll probably drop support for it. I think we just are coming at this from different angles, and I do see your point, I think we’re just not agreeing. scott Wednesday, August 17, 2016 - 11:45 am · Reply They do need to have these ahead of everyone else.

He previously covered technology for Bloomberg News. Follow @tculpan Facebook Twitter Email Print Share Aug 24, 2016 5:36 AM EDT Semiconductor companies have a reputation for being volatile, capital intensive and brutally cyclical. The sector's in one of its periodic slumps, with revenue expected to fall again for the second year in a row because of weak demand in China, a dearth of hit products from Apple and Sony, and the fading appeal of desktop computers. So why is the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index -- home to Texas Instruments, Intel, Broadcom, and Taiwanese foundry operator TSMC -- trading at levels not seen since late 2000? It's risen 20 percent this year versus a 6.7 percent gain in the S&P 500 index, and is on an eight-week winning streak. Sure, analysts predict top-line growth will come back soon. Yet the rate will pale next to historic ones. Analysts at Bryan Garnier see a return to 0.6 percent average revenue increases for the next three years, compared to an average of about 9 percent between 1986 and 2015. Some of the stock gains can be ascribed to the fact that forward 12-month earnings expectations are rising, even as actual earnings are falling, something not seen since 2009 after the financial crisis. SOX it to Me While average earnings among members of the SOX Index have fallen, analysts have raised estimates for the coming year. This divergence hasn't been seen since 2009 after the financial crisis. Source: Bloomberg Yet even taking that into account, investors appear to have bid up the sector beyond what sell-side analysts predict for next year. Price-to-earnings ratios are near their highest in three years: Chips Ahoy Valuations among members of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index are approaching a three-year high as investors drive up prices Source: Bloomberg Of course, the chief reason for the euphoria is deals, and the prospect of more of them. The chip sector has been consolidating rapidly since early 2015 with $92.6 billion of deals completed, and $84.3 billion pending, according to Bloomberg data. The frenzy means investors are probably ascribing takeover premiums to potential targets, such as Maxim Integrated with a $11.7 billion market value and Microsemi at $4 billion. Value of recent chip deals $93 billion But M&A isn't the only reason for the frothiness. Demand for chips used in cars, gaming, and video is growing rapidly even as smartphones and PCs struggle. This benefits chipmakers carving out specializations such as Nvidia, Infineon and NXP. Bryan Garnier reckons automotive chips will grow 6.8 percent on average from 2015 to 2018, and industrial chips by 7.5 percent. And despite the lofty P/E ratios, there may still be some value around. Neil Campling at Northern Trust Securities urges a focus on returns on invested capital. Using that measure, some chipmakers such as Texas Instruments come out well. It delivered a 20.7 percent cash return on invested capital on average in the past three years: Texas Hold 'Em Chip maker Texas Instruments isn't beloved by analysts, who mostly have hold ratings on the shares, but it has a track record of solid cash generation Source: Northern Trust Securities Cash return on invested capital is a metric used by Northern Trust. It's similar to ROIC but uses cash instead of profit Finally, with the much-ballyhooed "Internet of Things" apparently around the corner, we'll need lots of chips to connect all those intelligent fridges and robocars. Investors are right to look forward to a silicon-infused future.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search CrossOver will soon run Windows apps on Android, Chrome OS JC Torres - Aug 24, 2016 2 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Yes, you read that right, but don’t worry (or perhaps be worried), it isn’t as straightforward or as magical as you might think. CodeWeavers, creators of the CrossOver software that lets users run some Windows software and games on Linux and macOS will be starting a tech preview of CrossOver for Android, which will do the same for Android devices and Chromebooks. Of course, there will be rather big limitations to this almost miraculous arrangement, from what devices you can run CrossOver on, to which Windows apps you can run. CrossOver is a piece of software known as an “API compatibility layer” that basically translates Windows system calls into equivalent Linux or BSD (which macOS is based on) calls. CrossOver itself is based on an open source project called WINE (a “backronym” that means “WINE Is Not an Emulator”) that has allowed otherwise inaccessible Windows software, like Microsoft Office or even some games, to run on those operating systems. It’s not a perfect solution and it doesn’t always work for all Windows programs, but both WINE and especially CrossOver have matured enough to be reliable for the most common and most popular software. The big news here is that CodeWeavers has brought that same CrossOver software to Android, which, although based on Linux also, is a very different beast as far as software layers go. This, in turn, has even led to CrossOver for Android running on Chromebooks via the still in development Android app support on Chrome OS. OS-ception ensues! There are some big “but’s” in this upcoming technical preview, however. First and foremost, CrossOver for Android will only run on Intel-based devices. While many Chromebooks do qualify, there are only a few Android tablets, and even fewer Android smartphones, running on Intel’s mobile chips. And even if you were to get one of ASUS’ beefy Intel ZenFones, that doesn’t mean it will be OK to run usually complicated Windows programs in such a cramped screen. CrossOver for Android is still in a very limited tech preview, and for good reason. It helps set the expectations down to a more realistic level. You aren’t suddenly going to be able to, say, run the latest Windows games on your Android tablet or Chromebook, though maybe someday that will be possible. CodeWeaver itself admits that CrossOver for Android isn’t even yet at a mature stage. Plus, Android’s limitations, both in software and hardware, will mean that some Windows applications might never really be supported. It’s an interesting and good start, but still just a start nonetheless.

The email came from recently installed sensors, software and communications technology from Qualcomm and OSIsoft, which provides real-time, detailed data about energy, water and gas use at the ballpark. On Wednesday, the Padres and tech companies involved held a press conference to talk about the technology and how it can reduce power and water use. "Our goal is to take this same architecture and help any large scale venue — a campus, a mall, any place where you have a lot of people coming together under one roof — and help them achieve their sustainability goals," said Kiva Allgood, head of Qualcomm’s smart cities programs.

There are several companies betting big on the growth of the Internet of Things industry, with Qualcomm, Intel and others aiming to stand out. Smart cities, where sensors help public workers departments and building managers cut energy and water use, is expected to grow fast in the next decade. Petco is the third demonstration project for Qualcomm’s smart cities technology, which links together sensors to provide immediate and detailed data about power and water use. Qualcomm did a similar project with OSIsoft at the smartphone chip makers San Diego campus. It also used the technology to monitor infrastructure at San Diego International Airport. The company claims its gateway technology can "connect the unconnected" without the hefty costs of installing new systems. According to Qualcomm, ballparks are difficult for facilities to manage. They go from empty to full of fans in just a few hours. Many were not built with sophisticated instrumentation and control systems to monitor water or power. At Petco, Qualcomm supplies so-called edge intelligence gateways — boxes that collect the sensor data using wireless and wire line technologies. The gateways then ship sensor readings to OSIsoft’s data center, where its software platform interprets what’s going on for the Padres in real time. The technology gives Petco managers a very detailed, real-time view of where water and power are being used, said Jake Flohr of OSIsoft, which is based in the Bay Area. Instead of getting monthly reports on overall water use, the system lets stadium officials drill down to know how much water is being used on field irrigation, in bathrooms or at concessions during any given game or event, he said. "It gives them a good idea specific to each area of the stadium and allows them to take a more pinpoint approach to reducing their footprint," said Flohr. There are roughly 230 large stadiums in the U.S. Many are in regions that are experimenting with smart cities technologies to reduce energy and water use. The Padres’ goal is to reduce operational expenses by more than 25 percent in the next five years at Petco, said Randy McWilliams, senior director of facility services for the Padres. "By using the gateways together with the open data infrastructure, we can see exactly how much water, power and gas each operation uses ballpark-wide, and can work with our operators and tenants to manage usage and increase the reliability and overall performance of the venue," he said. mike.freeman@sduniontribune.com Twitter @TechDiego Copyright © 2016, The San Diego Union-Tribune US Politics Latest Most Popular Jobs Homes Cars Customer Help Today's Paper 67°

A survey conducted among 7,600 university students of the UAE by international employment research company Universum, revealed that Google continues to win the hearts of business studies students. The search engine company seems to be the top choice, giving employees a perfect work/life balance, job security, and the chance to be entrepreneurial and creative in their career. Google also provides an incredible reference for anyone's future careers. For engineering students: 1. Google 2. Apple 3. Microsoft 4. Emaar 5. Masdar 6. Adnoc Group 7. Dubai Airports 8. Etihad Airways 9. Intel 10. Dewa As part of Universum's Middle East Talent Survey 2016, done over a six-month period, the research uncovered university students' attitudes about employers and what drives their career choices. Students of all nationalities and study streams said their top career motivators are high earnings and professional training. Emiratis expected an average monthly salary of Dh17,395 per month in their first job, while non-Emirati respondents expected Dh11,888 per month. "Graduates all around the world are clear about the fact that if they have Google on their resume, they can land any job they want going forward. Globally, students know about its fantastic work environment to the incredible perks and benefits, while also being able to work on exciting new technologies. This combination makes for an irresistible choice among graduates today," said Claudia Tattanelli, chairman of the Strategic Advisory Board at Universum. Emirati students eye ?clean energy Emirati engineering students, however, put Masdar in the top spot as the ideal employer. For commerce students: 1. Google 2. Apple 3. Emaar 4. Dubai Airports 5. Etihad Airways 6. Microsoft 7. Emirates Group 8. L'Oreal Group 9. Adnoc Group 10. Ernst & Young (EY) Ahmed Baghoum, executive director for Human Capital and Services at Masdar, said: "We are honoured to be trusted by Emirati youth - for the second year in a row. Our mission to advance the clean energy industry in Abu Dhabi and around the world resonates well with their future ambitions." Another field gaining popularity among locals is aviation. Etihad has been named one of the best places to start a career. Ray Gammell, Etihad Aviation Group Chief for People and Performance, said: "To be voted by students as the top employer in the airline industry within the UAE is a wonderful recognition that reflects Etihad Airways' commitment to attracting and developing Emirati talent to build the nation's future aviation leaders. It's also no surprise that Dubai Airports is placed in the top 10 ideal companies ranking for both Emiratis and expats students across all disciplines. As for personal career goals, students of all nationalities and study areas prioritised work/life balance, job security, and the chance to be entrepreneurial and creative in their career. Friendly work environs and respect for employees are also key drivers, along with a prestige-name employer who provide the best training and development. saman@khaleejtimes.com Share More > Vote MORE FROM Nation Travel Short trips you can take from Dubai this Eid Al...

News & Analysis Power9 Opens IBM to Partners One chip, four variants and tons of eDRAM Rick Merritt 8/24/2016 02:49 PM EDT 3 comments NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet CUPERTINO, Calif. — IBM’s Power 9 processor, described for the first time at Hot Chips yesterday, could become a break out chip, seeding new OEM and accelerator partners and rejuvenating Big Blue’s bid against archrival Intel in high-end servers. The 14nm Power 9, first mentioned in March, takes a bold if somewhat fragmented strategy in the hot area of accelerators. It is IBM’s first Power chip to emerge as a family to enable a range of scale up and scale out system designs. Like past IBM microprocessors, to reach new performance levels it uses a gob of memory—including a whopping 120 Mbyte embedded DRAM in shared L3 cache riding a 7 Tbit/second on-chip fabric. Across a range of benchmarks, Power 9 should deliver from 50% to more than twice the performance of the Power 8 when the new chip arrives late next year, said Brian Thompto, a lead architect for the chip. New core and chip-level designs contribute to the performance boost. Versions of Power9 using DDR4 DIMMs could attract OEMs competing on costs. (Images: IBM) Click here for larger image IBM will release four versions of Power 9 (shown above). Two will use eight threads per core and 12 cores per chip geared for IBM’s Power virtualization environment; two will use four threads per core and 24 cores/chip targeting Linux. Both will come in two versions — one for two socket servers and 8 DDR4 ports and another for multiple chips per server with buffered DIMMs. The diversity of choices could help attract OEMs. IBM has been trying to encourage others to build Power systems through its OpenPower group that now sports more than 200 members. So far, it’s gaining most interest from China where one partner is making its own Power chips. Use of standard DDR4 DIMMs on some parts will lower barriers for OEMs by enabling commodity packaging and thus lower costs. Power9's 120 MByte L3 is parsed out in 10 MByte blocks shared by two cores.

In a letter sent by the Hawks to Gordhan on Monday, Major-General MS Ledwaba states that Gordhan’s alleged actions “amount to” unauthorised expenditure and/or fruitless and wasteful expenditure in terms of the Public Finance Management Act and corruption in terms of the Prevention of Corrupt Activities Act. Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan (Matthew Le Cordeur, Fin24) This is the first time it has been revealed that the law enforcement agencies are investigating Gordhan for corruption. In his letter, Ledwaba writes that Gordhan (as finance minister) had “approved that then deputy commission of Sars, Ivan Pillay, could take early retirement at 56 with full retirement benefits” from 1 August 2010 and that his employer should pay his early retirement penalty to the amount of R1 258 359 “despite the early retirement being for personal considerations of the employee when ordinarily the employee must pay the early retirement penalty in terms of the law”. Intel unit Ledwaba says Gordhan also approved the reappointment of Pillay as deputy commissioner on a contract basis for a further three years. The Hawks are further investigating Gordhan for the creation of an intelligence unit inside Sars. In a letter by Gordhan’s lawyer Tebogo Malatji to the Hawks, the finance minister slams the Hawks’ claims as “unfounded”. “The offence of corruption (under the Act) in the first place requires that the perpetrator ‘gives or agrees or offers to give to any other person any gratification’. The minister did not give or agree to give gratification to anybody. He merely gave official approval to the proposal of the commissioner that Sars allow Mr Pillay to take early retirement and be re-appointed.” No legal obligation to go to the Hawks - Gordhan Malatji’s letter continues: “The giving of gratification in any event does not amount to corruption in itself. It is corrupt only if the gratification is given to the recipient ‘in order to act, personally or by influencing another person so to act’, in an unlawful manner. “There has never been any suggestion that the minister approved the commissioner’s proposal that Mr Pillay be allowed to take early retirement and be re-appointed to persuade him to act unlawfully in any way.” Gordhan believed “in good faith that the transaction was entirely lawful. It means that he in any event lacked any mens rea” (the intention or knowledge of wrongdoing that constitutes part of a crime). Ledwaba asked Gordhan to appear before a Brigadier Xaba of the Hawks at 14:00 on Thursday. Gordhan has since refused to appear before the Hawks, saying he was under no legal obligation to present himself to the police.

By coincidence there are two in tech this week and both have more than an artificial leg to stand on. On Thursday it will be 25 years since Linus Torvalds sent out a BBS message asking for help with a new operating system that became known as Linux, and today it is 25 years since Tim Berners-Lee set up the first web server. As sceptics might note, you could easily suggest other birthdays but as milestones go, these are pretty good. I’ll post my memories of a quarter century of Linux in a couple of days but first let’s stroll down Random Access Memory Lane and recall how the web changed the world. In 1991 I was working on one of the many catalogue-sized computer magazines that existed back then, providing a live threat to the future of forestry. It was a golden time for direct-market PC makers like Dell, selling ‘off the page’ and back then momentum was perpetuated by new(ish) phenomena such as LANs, email, new versions of Windows and Intel’s latest and greatest chips. In those days, online services meant CIX for geeks, AOL for online newbies and CompuServe for a demographic somewhere in between. That was in the UK at least; other countries tended to have home-grown favourites alongside the big US firms. The buzz among many of us tech news reporters barking up the wrong tree was a Microsoft project codenamed ‘Blackbird’ that evolved into MSN. The company, all powerful at the time, had invested vast sums into displacing AOL from its leadership position but Bill Gates pulled off a smart U-turn when he praised the work of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and turned his attention to making MSN a web portal rather than a ‘walled garden’ proprietary network. The web initially punished the heck out of 38.8 dialup modem connections (and even the fancy-pants on the latest 56kbit/s devices or, precious bane, ISDN, but it got a big lift through freebie ISPs and then DSL broadband, and a generation never looked back, even if networking scientists as brilliant as Bob Metcalfe predicted a comms meltdown. We had the juice for animated GIFs and images, even video if you scrunched your eyes up. Behind the ship’s wheel of Netscape Navigator we early-bird surfers had access to wave after wave of innovation: the Pointcast push news network, SportingLife.com, Hotmail free messaging, Yahoo for everything else, Amazon and AbeBooks, AltaVista for search (surely nothing could beat it), Motley Fool, ZDNet (my employer) and CNET for tech… halcyon and innocent days, at least for those of us who didn’t immediately equate online with porn. Suddenly, technology journalists were in at the beginning of something that had interest to the rest of the world (a novelty), but then the crash of 2000 saw most startups who had floated reduced to rubble. It was very common in those days to meet CEOs of companies that had sunk to less than one per cent of their 52-week highs, although they were in shorter supply than when they were describing themselves as building the modern equivalent of the railways and racking up multibillion-dollar valuations. The sharp decline and seeming inability for web companies to generate profits meant the old guard were free to return to their old wheelhouses. Ziff-Davis UK focused its attention on a new weekly newspaper and B2C, the joke went, now meant, ‘back to consulting’ rather than building your own dotcom startup. One of the few web successes, eBay, was filled with the Sun ‘Starfire’ servers that were the back-ends of those that had, appropriately enough, Icarus-like flown too close to the sun. But, after a pause, with Web 2.0 early promise was fulfilled and with Salesforce.com we even had a B2B application that was purely in the cloud, even if we called it SaaS at the time. It helped of course that 3G networks and smartphones had become mainstream, making the web a mobile rather than deskbound utility. Today we exist in, on, within and as part of an internet world; we are all a part of its silken web for better or for worse, stuck in ‘always on’ working patterns and with never a fact, form of entertainment or business opportunity - no matter how intelligent, criminal or lubricious – more than a second or two away from our fingertips. Twenty-five tumultuous years: a quarter-century in the ether and if we have learned anything it might be that everything we thought might happen was wrong. Only a brave man, fool (or professional pundit) could predict what all this will look like in 2041.   Also read: Ethernet inventor Bob Metcalfe still rings the changes Scott McNealy steps down, stays busy Cloud computing is 15 (even if that’s nebulous) At 10 years old, an evolving Hadoop Forward to a friend TAGS: World Wide Web Consortium, Internet Technologies, Browsers, Web & Communications Software PREVIOUS ARTICLE «Will our home devices be the next DDoS?

Take the story of Anatoly Klyosov, connecting Russia to the western world for the first time in 1982, as an example. A bio-chemist who was not allowed to leave the soviet territory for security reasons. The internet enabled him to participate in meetings with his counterparts at Harvard University, University of Stockholm and beyond. With the evolution of the internet, the purpose of connecting to the internet has also evolved. People, now, can not only hold conversations but also get both public and private sector services at home such as healthcare, education, statistics, legal, financial, telecommunication and others. People are able to do business from home with the help of e-commerce and provide services beyond the traditional national boundaries. The discussion here is how to enable people to connect to the internet and take advantage of all the benefits that the internet provides to them. What factors play crucial role in setting up the environment for connecting the unconnected individuals whether living in urban part of the world or rural. Surprisingly 57% of the world's population are urban unconnected. 68% of the population in Asia Pacific has no broadband connection. At a regional IGF event in Taipei, Taiwan, the Asia Pacific regional Internet Governance Forum, where more than 500 Internet Governance practitioners and experts participated. I was given the task to present our group's understanding and analysis of the theme "Cyber Connectivity" where four sessions were held. We had sessions on Disaster and Disabilities in terms of Crisis & Management, Overcoming challenges in APAC outreach and participation in the new Internet era, Promoting alternative access models at the last mile & Fostering MSME (Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises) participation in the digital economy. A number of use cases and examples of internet connectivity that has taken place in the region over the past decade were shared. Mahabir Pun from Nepal presented his efforts in connecting the remote rural villages of Himalaya, Vu Huang Lien shared his experiences of connecting the rural parts of Vietnam, Google representative shared their plans on connecting more people in India and Intel shared their experiences which they called "connecting people to their potential" where they spent US$ 1 billion globally on providing hands-on training and entrepreneurship skills. All diverse sessions had somewhat common barriers or challenges for connectivity. While some of the challenges were not of relevance to participants from urban parts of Japan or Taiwan but the rural parts of the same countries and many other developing and least developed countries still face most of the challenges that I will highlight briefly. While each of these challenges or needs could be and should be elaborated in-depth to verify them and study them further, I will be as concise as possible to highlight their hindrance in connecting or enabling the next ~4 billion to connect. * * * 1. Government realization and support for broadband connectivity: One of the fundamental challenges to internet growth is the governments' realization and support to the provisioning of internet access. This support could be in form of national policies and legislatures which will enable the market for either foreign investments or domestic economy. Google's representative Paul Harwood also emphasized on government support to local innovation, he said "Innovation in high speed Internet access should be a top public policy priority. Policy makers need to make sure that their countries are Internet ready". 2. Basic Infrastructure: In countries with rugged mountains especially with Himalayas that passes through Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan and China, or small Islands scattered all over the Pacific such as Vanuatu, Cook Island, Samoa, Fiji, Hawaii, Tonga etc. running fiber optic is challenging and very costly, which makes internet access almost "unaffordable" for end-users. Landlocked countries of Central Asia or Africa, in particular, face the challenge of fiber optic not available beyond the urban parts of the countries. The cost of IP transit takes a toll on the infrastructure development. 3. Basic Literacy: Literacy and internet have direct correlation, the increase in literacy rate allows in the increase of internet usage. A person's ability to read, write and speak in a language that computer applications usually support, is crucial in using the internet. 4. Localization: Some say local content will increase with large number of people getting online, however in the absence of technical possibility for people to write in their own language makes it hard for local content to grow organically. Large Operating System (OS) vendors play crucial role in the enablement of people to read and write in their local languages. There are still a large number of languages that are not supported by the leading desktop or mobile OSs. Language support in operating systems and applications is one hurdle to creating local content and language standardization is another. National localization policies should provide the standardization recommendations to Vendors to accommodate more languages. 5. Local Content: The lack of relevant local content, either locally produced content in a non-local language or local language content produced for that locality, is crucial for allowing citizens to use the internet for their development and livelihoods. The inability of writing text in an application because of OS not supporting the language or unavailability of broadband internet for users to upload large sized videos further deteriorates the content problem. 6. Digital Skills: Aside from basic literacy which allows a person to navigate the internet, digital skills were deemed necessary for making good use of the vast offerings of the internet. Digital skillset are required for using technology at home, at work and for entrepreneurial initiatives. The benefits and services of the evolving internet requires a continuous effort for awareness and education. 7. The need for speed: High speed internet service or broadband internet is required for citizens/consumers to participate, contribute and help evolve the development of the internet. 8. Affordable prices: Studies show that the next 3-4 Billion unconnected people are from the poorest socio-economic group and this would require new business models in order to allow them to connect. Two areas where government and private sector need to focus are; affordable prices for broadband and mobile data, and affordable prices for devices. 9. E-payment: Electronic payment system is considered to be a barrier to e-commerce. Without an e-payment infrastructure and electronic transaction laws, local innovation and entrepreneurship in e-commerce could be a major challenge. 10. Cyber-security: Cyber-security incidents were considered a major threat to enabling people to come online or adopt new(er) technologies. Three recommendations were highlighted. Awareness about how end-users can protect themselves against cyber-security incidents. Reactive measures (CIRT establishment and collaboration at regional, sub-regional and global level for information exchange). Proactive measures for mitigation of cyber incidents. 11. Social and organizational cultures: Change could be identified as one of the big barriers for individuals and organizations to adopt new technologies. Technology applications are built-in with biases that limit people from adopting and using it. At the organization level, there has been internal digital divide within an organization or among the organizations. Take the example of e-government; one government entity will be better equipped to deliver public services through internet while others will be finding it difficult to communicate via email within their organizations. 12. Legal framework: The legal framework is one of the environment factors that facilitates the digital developments. Privacy and data protection laws, cyber-security laws, electronic payment & transaction laws etc. enable individuals' online protection as well as allows digital economy development through foreign or local investment. Large corporations don't make entries into economies that don't provide them legal protection. 13. Regulatory framework: A strong regulatory framework mitigates the negative implications of the internet on business as well as on society in general, by addressing the challenges faced by women and children online for example. Strong and positive regulation provides positive image of the use of the internet especially in cultures that associate negative aspects of the internet such as hacking, financial and social crimes, with the use of the internet. It's also important to consider that regulators at the national levels need the necessary skillset to design, develop and formalize regulatory policies. One of the fundamental difference between local initiatives and foreign or corporate investments for connectivity was that corporate initiatives were focused on wiring more people. Whereas local initiatives had organic approach and their home-grown efforts were addressing the needs of the local communities. Their approaches were providing a package of connectivity and application. Providing the understanding of the variety of benefits that a home user or an entrepreneur can get from connecting to the internet paves the next few steps for them. This enablement of the user should be fundamental to the connection. By Said Zazai. More blog posts from Said Zazai can also be read here.

The car will initially be used for commercial ride-hailing or ride-sharing services; sales to consumers will come later. “This is a transformational moment in our industry and it is a transformational moment for our company,” said CEO Mark Fields, as he announced the plan at Ford’s Silicon Valley campus in Palo Alto, California. Ford’s approach to the autonomous car breaks from many other companies, like Mercedes-Benz and Tesla Motors, which plan to gradually add self-driving capability to traditional cars. Just last month, BMW AG, Intel Corp. and the automotive camera maker Mobileye announced a plan to put an autonomous vehicle with a steering wheel on the road by 2021. Instead, Ford is taking the same approach as Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which supports moving directly to self-driving cars once the technology is perfected. “We abandoned the stepping-stone approach of driver-assist technologies and decided we were going to take the full leap,” said Raj Nair, Ford’s chief technical officer. Nair says Ford will continue developing systems that assist the driver, like automatic emergency braking or lane departure warning. But he said semi-autonomous systems that can operate the car but then cede control back to the driver when an obstacle is encountered are actually dangerous in Ford’s view. Engineers couldn’t figure out how to make sure drivers stay engaged and ready to take over. So, Ford decided to remove the driver altogether. “We learned that to achieve full autonomy, we have to take a completely different path,” Nair said. Jeremy Carlson, a senior analyst with IHS Automotive, says he doesn’t know of another automaker who’s taking Ford’s approach. But there are challenges either way, he said. Riders may have a hard time trusting fully autonomous cars, for example, but semi-autonomous cars can be dangerous because drivers may not understand what the vehicles can and cannot do. “I don’t think there’s going to be any one right answer,” he said. Ford’s vehicle will be specifically designed for commercial mobility services, like taxi companies, and will be available in high volumes. Ford says personal ownership of self-driving cars will come later. Ford didn’t say whether it would work with a ride-sharing partner or try to establish services on its own. Rival General Motors Co. has a partnership with the ride-hailing company Lyft and has also bought a self-driving software company called Cruise Automation. Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford also said it plans to double the staff at its Palo Alto research centre by the end of next year to nearly 300 people. It will buy two more buildings next to its current building in order to expand its campus, Fields said. Ford will also make several investments and partnerships to speed its development of autonomous vehicles. Ford and Chinese search engine company Baidu will each invest $75 million in Velodyne, a company that makes laser sensors that help guide self-driving cars. Velodyne, based in Morgan Hill, California, says it will use the $150 million investment to expand design and production and reduce the cost of its sensors. Laser sensors—dubbed Lidar, which stands for light, detection and ranging—can also be used in conventional vehicles as part of driver assist systems. Ford said it has acquired Israel-based computer vision and machine learning company SAIPS for its expertise in artificial intelligence and computer vision. It also invested in Berkeley, California-based Civil Maps for its three-dimensional mapping capabilities. Ford has also formed a partnership with New York-based Nirenberg Neuroscience LLC, a machine vision company that has developed devices for restoring sight to patients with degenerative eye diseases.   News from © Canadian Press Enterprises Inc. 2016 Share This Post Tweet Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Print this page Related Posts Ford CEO looks to autonomous cars, sharing economy Ford teams up on autonomous driving Exec: Most Lyft rides in autonomous cars in five years Nissan keeps self driving simple and not quite autonomous Cash rebates may boost electric car sales: officials Impact Auto Auctions launches new website Salary Calculator Calculate More REDWIRE Services Subscribe to Print E-newsletter Advertise Contact Us View Digital Edition Browse Print Archives View Digital Edition Browse Print Archives View Digital Edition Browse Print Archives Manufacturing Network Sitemap Copyright Notice Privacy Policy © Copyright 2016 Annex Business Media × Close REDWIRE Powered by FRASERS REDWIRE is News you can use from Leading Suppliers.

The company's GTX 10-series graphics card have also made a mark in the desktop space, providing an opportunity for system builders to come up with powerful, single-GPU configurations capable of running the best VR games and demanding 4K setups. Called the Titan Hadron, the latest machine from Stoke, UK-based system builders Overclockers UK promises oodles of gaming grunt, courtesy of Nvidia's GTX 1060 GPU. But, as we now know, there's no such thing as a cheap Pascal card. Even at the mid-range, Nvidia's card pushes up the Hadron's price to £1,091/US$1,4453/AUS$1,894, with an offer currently shaving £30/$US40/AUS$52 from the price. However, it's important to note that the cost includes a number of enviable features. Among them are an SSD along with a capacious HDD, an overclockable, top-tier Intel processor and, of course, one of the beefiest graphics cards around. Micro machine One of the more interesting aspects of the Titan Hadron is its design. Overclockers has gone for Fractal Design's Node 804 Micro-ATX case, which separates warmer running components from cooler ones while allowing for unrestricted airflow to the Asus Z170M motherboard and sixth-generation Intel Core i5-6600K processor inside. We're a fan of the case's unassuming appearance. Black materials dominate without appearing bland, in part thanks to a brushed aluminum finish on the front panel that contrasts with a plastic mesh along the bottom. Viewed head-on, it looks like a high-end subwoofer that's part of an expensive speaker set-up. Rotate the Titan Hadron on its side, and the mask slips, revealing a view that's more typical to PC gamers. A transparent side panel provides a view of the various components inside, which are bathed in a green light that emanates from the top of the case's roof. Spec sheet Here is the Overclockers UK Titan Hadron configuration sent to TechRadar for review: CPU: 3.5GHz Intel Core i5-6600K (Quad core, 6M Cache, up to 3.9GHz using Turbo Boost) Graphics: Gainward GeForce GTX 1060 Dual (6GB GDDR5) RAM: 8GB DDR4 (2,400MHz) Storage: 240GB SSD; 1TB HDD (7,200 rpm) Ports: 1 x USB 3.1 (Type-C), 3 x HDMI, 2 X DisplayPort, 2 x DVI-D, 3 x USB 3.0, 2 x USB 2.0, 1 x VGA, headphone/microphone ports, Ethernet Size: 12.09 x 13.54 x 15.31 inches (H x W x D) Weight: 13.22 pounds (6kg) Don't be fooled by its name – the Titan Hadron isn't powered by Nvidia's wallet-intimidating Titan X; nor does it fire tiny particles around super quickly, for that matter. It actually opts for a more sensible choice of card in Gainward's GeForce GTX 1060, which sports 6GB of GDDR5 memory. Compared with Nvidia's newer GTX 1060 that has half the video memory at 3GB, the version on offer here is much more suited to 1440p gaming, much less 1080p. The Intel's 6600K Skylake processor is more than capable of matching the Nvidia part, the 'K' denoting that it can be overclocked to provide horsepower for gaming. It's more than up to the task out of the box, but overclocking is a welcome option to have for enthusiast users who can get their hands dirty in MSI Afterburner or another tool of choice. You won't get caught short for ports, as there's an abundance of I/O around the back. That includes a USB 3.1 Type-C port for speedily transferring data to an external hard disk or hooking up a compatible peripheral. There are two more USB 2.0 ports on the right hand side of the case, located alongside headphone and microphone ports, the power button and slot loading CD drive. These can be fiddly to access if the machine is facing a direction that hides them out of view, forcing you to run your hand along the edge to find them. Relocating them to the top of the case wouldn't have been a bad move. Benchmarks Here's how the Overclockers UK Titan Hadron performed in our suite of benchmark tests: 3DMark: Cloud Gate: 19,409 ; Sky Diver: 23,179 ; Fire Strike: 10,072 Cinebench CPU: 599 points; Graphics: 126 fps GeekBench: 3,980 (single-core); 11,498 (multi-core) PCMark 8 (Home Test): 4,568 points GTA V (1080p, Ultra): 43 fps; (1080p, Low): 163 fps; (4K, Ultra): 14 fps The Division: (1080p, Ultra): 60 fps; (1080p, Low): 150 fps Steam VR Bench: Ready Nvidia says that the GTX 1060 is good for GTX 980-grade frame rates, and our benchmarks show that to be true. The Titan Hadron scored 10,072 in PCMark 8's Fire Strike benchmark, compared to the 9,284 achieved by the 980-powered Asus GX700. Overclockers' machine also scored higher in Cinebench R15's graphics test (126.3 fps versus the GX700's 101.26 fps), and more than double in our demanding GTA V 1080p Ultra settings benchmark (43.3 fps versus 21 fps). With the exception of extremely demanding games, like GTA V, the GTX 1060 is capable of maxing out games at 1080p; it's also a solid performer at 1440p. We played Doom at that resolution on Ultra settings and got a consistent 55 - 70 fps, depending on which environment we were in. As expected, it struggled at 4K, straining to reach around 30 - 45 fps at 4K on Ultra and frequently dipping to as low as 25 fps. It almost goes without saying that the GTX 1060 isn't as powerful as the GTX 1070, losing out in every GPU benchmark compared to the StormForce Tornado that we recently reviewed. At £899/US$1,180/AUS$1,540 the Tornado also costs less despite having the more powerful GPU. On the other hand, it only comes with a weaker (and not overclockable) Core i5-6500 CPU and misses out on an SSD, both of which are major scoring points in favor of the Titan Hadron. Final verdict There's a lot to like about the Titan Hadron. We found favor with its minimal, no-nonsense case that provides easy access to components and makes a refreshing change from conventional tower PCs. Nvidia's GTX 1060 has proven itself to be a great option for 1440p gaming, striking a balance between cost and performance, and the version with 6GB of video memory on offer here leaves you confident you can whack up the graphics options to hit that magic 60 fps mark. Its SSD provides nippy loading of files, and that overclockable CPU provides an avenue for more advanced gamers to eke out even more power. On the other hand, the machine is simply not up to the task of fluid 4K gaming on Ultra, or even High settings, depending on the title – you're going to need a machine like the StormForce Tornado with a GTX 1070 for that. And, considering the Titan Hadron costs more than a grand, that might be a deal-breaker for some.

It is only relevant for shared libraries developers, and even then, not always. However, I think it is beneficial for everyone to be familiar with how things work at a lower level, so I decided to write this post. A few weeks ago I got a report about an increase private dirty pages from our libraries that essentially caused increased memory consumption for every application linking to the EFL. The main culprit was the object system (Eo), which I maintain, so I decided to take a look. As the first step I manually reviewed the code. This led me to a mistake in related code which I eventually fixed. My fixes improved the situation a bit, but the main issue was still there. So I started investigating... Note: unless specifically mentioned otherwise, all of this post assumes Linux on Intel hardware, though while the details may vary, the concepts should apply almost everywhere. Introduction to Memory Pages in Linux First, if you are not familiar with the concept, read about the topic on Wikipedia. Pages are essentially blocks of virtual memory, and are the smallest unit of data being managed by the OS, in our case Linux. The page size is usually 4KiB, and is the case here. When an executable is being compiled, all of the information in it is being mapped to different sections depending on usage. For example with clang (may change based on compiler): static const int a = 5;
 will be mapped to .rodata, that is "read-only data". Another example is executable code (actual instructions) that would be mapped to .text. Then the linker decides how to map all of this into actual memory, and thus, into pages. Pages have permissions associated to them: read (R), write (W) and execute (X). For example, for security reasons, the stack is marked as RW, because you want to be able to read and write to the stack, but not executable in order to protect from a certain class of attacks. The actual executable code, is marked as RX, that is, you can read it, and execute it, but not modify it. A nice feature of non-writeable pages is that they never change (duh...), so the OS can reuse them and thus save memory. So for example, if your executable size is 2MiB, it'll be loaded into the memory once, it won't be loaded for every instance of the application. The OS is smart enough to share these pages. As a side note, Linux also implements Copy-on-Write for RW pages, so even if a page is RW, it may be shared across different instances assuming the data hasn't been written to. Pages that can be shared are called clean, and ones that have been written to are called dirty. There is more to be said about pages, but we've covered all we need in order to investigate the issue, so we will stop here. The Issue Reported Now that we know a bit more about pages we can more intelligently discuss the issue reported. The problem was that the EFL in general, and heavy users of Eo in particular, all of a sudden had a lot of private dirty pages. This means, a lot of pages of memory that are mapped from the library itself (in the executable, not allocated on runtime) that are being written to and thus can't be shared and have to be duplicated for each running process; a big issue for heavily used libraries. RW pages exist for a reason, so it could just be that these were legitimate usages, though judging by the amount of pages, this seemed unlikely. The first step was to find what is mapped to these pages, so I started there. Finding the Memory Users Unfortunately, while nm is a very useful command to mapping symbols to memory regions, so I know which symbols are mapped to RW pages (most likely); it doesn't (and can't) indicate which symbols map to dirty pages. Even more unfortunate is that I am not aware of any tool that provides that information (please let me know if you know of one!). I was just about to write one, when I saw that all of the relevant RW pages in my test case were dirty, so any memory in those would be relevant. Note: in order to check which variables got mapped to RW pages I used pmap. Using this tool I was able to see the address range for each page, and using some debug output I was able to get the addresses of the symbols in question and so was able to know which was stored in RW pages. Using pmap is very easy; more on that in the next section. I already knew which structures were the largest in Eo, so I decided to guess and see if they were mapped to RW pages or RO. My guess was spot on, and I found a few symbols that should be RO, but were actually RW. For example:  static const Efl_Event_Description *_event_desc[] = {
      // SNIP ...
 };
 This is a common mistake due to the confusing syntax C uses for const. This is an array of pointers to const Efl_Event_Description. This may look correct at first glance, until you realise the array itself is not constant. It should be:  static const Efl_Event_Description * const _event_desc[] = {
      // SNIP ...
 };
 This change saved us a few pages in the more event heavy areas, which is a first step, but the problem was still there, so the search recommenced. I then stumbled upon static const Efl_Class_Description _class_desc = {
    // SNIP ...
};
 This looks innocent. The Efl_Class_Description type is a struct, and const was correctly applied. This should have definitely been RO, but for some reason it was put in a RW page. Seeing this, and other similar structures, I knew I found what I was looking for, now I just needed to figure out why it was happening. After thinking about it for a bit, and considering a few different ideas, I suspected it was related to the fact that while these structures were constant, some of the fields were referring to other symbols, and in some cases, due to relocation, the linker would have to figure out the address at runtime, and thus won't be able to mark the pages as RO. This could be easily checked with nm, though I haven't thought about it at the time, so I went on investigating by other means. I ended up writing a small contained example, so I know if I was right or not. I ran my example in both gcc and clang. Unfortunately gcc gave me some less than optimal results, so I will use clang in my examples. Checking my Hypothesis In order to check my hypothesis I wrote a small program (issue.c): #include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define PAGE_SIZE 4096
#define ALLOC_SIZE (PAGE_SIZE * 1000)

typedef struct
{
   const void *invalidater;
   const char data[ALLOC_SIZE];
} Invalid;

static const char ro[ALLOC_SIZE];
static const Invalid rw = { NULL, { 0 }};

int main()
{
   printf("%zd\n", (size_t) getpid());
   printf("%p %p\n", ro, &rw); // So they are not optimised out
   scanf("\n"); // Keep the program running
   return 0;
}
 This program attempts to allocate two variables: ro: 1000 pages of read only memory. rw: 1000 pages (and one pointer) of read only memory that I suspected was going to be RW. Upon running it prints its PID and then waits. Now I can run it and inspect exactly what's going on. For that I will use pmap (and redact some of the non-relevant output). Let's compile and run our program: $ clang issue.c
$ ./a.out
11835
0x4006a0 0x7e86a0
 And then in another terminal: $ pmap 11835
11835:   ./a.out
0000000000400000   8004K r-x-- a.out
0000000000dd0000      4K rw--- a.out
 As you can see, both variables have been mapped to RO pages (the first). This is what we expected (which wasn't the case with GCC), because we don't rely on anything that we don't know on compile time. This was just a test to see everything works. Now we are going to change the program to check my hypothesis. We will change the NULL in the declaration of rw to some symbol which may be relocated, for example strlen, and then compile and run again: $ clang issue.c
$ ./a.out
11941
0x4006e0 0x7e86e0
 And then in another terminal: $ pmap 11941
11941:   ./a.out
0000000000400000   8004K r-x-- a.out
0000000000dd0000      4K rw--- a.out
 And... It still works. At this point I started to question myself, maybe I was wrong and something was going on. Then I realised there is still one thing that is different between my test case and libraries that exhibit the issue that may be related. They are libraries, and thus have position independent code, so I tested once more, this time with PIC enabled: $ clang issue.c -fPIC
$ ./a.out
12002
0x4006d0 0x9e8818
 And then in another terminal: $ pmap 12002
12002:   ./a.out
0000000000400000   4004K r-x-- a.out
00000000009e8000   4004K rw--- a.out
 Voila! We managed to replicate the issue. Verifying with nm As I mentioned before, this would have been easy to verify with nm, so I'll also show that for completeness. Though even with nm, I would have needed to enable PIC to trigger the issue. Relevant nm output for the RO (issue not present) case: $ nm -f sysv ./a.out
rw |07e86e0| r | OBJECT|03e8008| |.rodata
 As you can see, rw is put into the .rodata section, that is read-only data. Relevant nm output for the RW (issue present) case: $ nm -f sysv ./a.out
rw |09e8818| d | OBJECT|03e8008| |.data.rel.ro
 Here, rw is put into the .data.rel.ro section, which is a section that is read-only after relocation, which means, not read-only. My Pages are RO and not RW I got reports from two different people (thanks Daniel Hirt and Mark Mossberg!) that their pmap output looked something like this: $ pmap 10214
10214:   ./a.out
0000000000400000   4004K r-x-- a.out
00000000009e8000   4004K r---- a.out
0000000000dd1000      4K rw--- a.out
 The reason for that is most likely linker differences. One way to verify this is indeed the case: $ strace ./a.out
... SNIP ...
mprotect(0x9e8000, 4100096, PROT_READ)  = 0
... SNIP ...
 As you can see, the program is calling mprotect to change the page (look at the address) to be RO. If you read the previous section about nm, you probably saw rw was put into the "read-only after relocation" section, which means the linker was allowed and encouraged to mark the pages read-only after it has finished the relocation updates. As mentioned above, I took a short-cut checking for RW pages instead of private dirty pages because I had complete overlap between the two. This short-cut may not work for your case, though the nm output should still give you the information you need. Solving the Issue Two solutions come to mind. Either separate the "truly constant" values from the relocatable values. So for example, if we had a struct like: struct {
     int ro;
     void *symbol;
};
 Split it to two separate structs. Or alternatively, reconsider parts of the design, maybe using the pointers in the struct is not even needed and it's enough to pass them to a function. This way the structures won't be mapped to RW memory, but would be temporarily stored on the stack before the function invocation, reducing the memory usage. I have already reduced some memory in Eo users by using the second method. I will soon complement that with the first method to reduce it even further. Preliminary tests show significant reduction in memory usage, so a big win. Lessons Learned While I knew the theory behind it, I was surprised to see how code I assumed would be mapped to RO pages ended up in RW pages that get dirty immediately. More specifically, that any structure that has a pointer to anything, even to a constant string, like: static const char * const rw = "test";
 would end up in RW pages. Review your libraries and make sure you are not wasting memory, and remember that heap memory is not the only memory that can be wasted. Please let me know if you spotted any mistakes or have any suggestions for improvement. © Tom Hacohen

In the fourth quarter of 2015, the worldwide wearable device market took a big step forward primarily led by the growing popularity of fitness trackers and the Apple Watch. According to the International Data Corporation, vendors shipped a total of 78.1 million units in 2015, an increase of 171.6% over 2014. The company found that wearables can exist and are welcome in the mass market, leaving substantial room for growth in multiple areas including new vendors, form factors, applications, and uses. Their analysts forecast that in addition to tracking information like steps taken and calories burned, fitness wearables will include predictive information that suggest ways users can lead healthier lives, integrate with popular applications and social media, and embrace new form factors like clothing, footwear and eyewear. This not only will drive market growth but expand the fitness wearables patent landscape. There are several companies that share the majority of the revenue in the fitness wearable market, with  Fitbit being the worldwide leader along with Apple, Xiami, Samsung, Garmin, Nike, Sony, and Google. Figure 1, Fitbit Fitness Wearables Patent Analysis Gartner lists six companies that share the majority of the revenue in the fitness wearable market: Samsung, Nike, Garmin,  Fitbit, Sony, and Google. To create patent analysis models, the technologies of the products made by these companies were considered, characterized, and refined by applying a set of about 100 keyword phrases to the patent portfolios. These refined keywords were applied to all US patents, to determine what other companies may have patents that are applicable to these products and services. Over 300 companies were considered. The results for a selection of these companies are shown below with the six leading companies in bold and medical companies listed in red. Figure 3, Snapshot of Technology Patents and Applications in the Fitness Wearables Market Near the top of the list we find several older established companies (Samsung, Microsoft, Apple, Qualcomm, Intel and Philips) that have diversified into wearables. The top six wearables companies here range from diversifying companies like Google, Samsung, and Sony, a diverse apparel company Nike, and focused wearable companies Garmin and particularly  Fitbit. The focused wearable companies tend to be at the bottom of the list, where a larger percentage of their portfolio applies to the wearable market. Finally, the patents found for power, processor, and wireless are more about using and integrating these technologies, rather than fundamentally building them. How recent are the applications and patents found in the patent study? Figure 4, IoT Wearables Granted and Applications Patents by Publication Year Histograms of the age of these patents bear out further observations (Figure 4). Most clearly, the rate of innovation in sensor systems is growing both in terms of applications and allowed patents. Sensors are not simply a clever component that senses the environment. Increasingly today they are systems combining several sensors for different environmental aspects into a microcontroller and analog to digital converter to provide a digital output. Growth of Innovation In 2015, the wearables segment was dominated by smart watches, fitness bands, smart glasses and Bluetooth headsets. The total 2016 market for this segment is estimated to be $28.7 billion US dollars. The growth of innovation in sensor systems, and the current level of market revenue suggest that we are still a year or two away from the first licensing cycle in wearables market. Recently, we tore down 12 wearable products. We discovered socket wins for 41 companies led by Texas Instruments (41), STM (11), and Qualcomm (7). Sensor wins were led by STM, Samsung, and nine others while sensor systems were led by AKM, Texas Instruments (TI), Invensense, and four others. TI, Maxim, and 10 others led the use of power management devices, processors were led by TI, STM, and 13 others, radios were led by Nordic, Broadcom, TI, and six others and other functions were delivered by 16 different companies. The diversity of technologies, the innovations in low power and analytics and the wealth of established technology that is being repurposed for this market indicates that there will be strong licensing positions held by a wide assortment of well established companies. Companies entering the market will have to prepare for licensing by driving their rate of patent applications, purchasing patents, taking licenses or being acquired as part of a round of market consolidation.  Fitness Wearables Company Patent Portfolios The companies examined in the initial patent study fall into several groups regarding their position in the market and licensing positions. Newer companies like  Fitbit and Garmin, which are successful in the wearables market are just starting to build their portfolios. Others, like Nike and Google, are successful in other markets and have diversified into the wearables market. Using Our Patent Analytics solution powered by KMX, we visualized the patent diversity for group of these patents. Each dot represents a patent, a group of patents sharing similar keywords creates a peak, and each peak indicates the top three keywords found in patent cluster. Patent clusters that are significantly different are further apart and may be separated by white space. We developed models that separate patents into four areas based on the type of analysis required to prove the claim. Process (yellow), which refers to structure and materials, physical properties of the materials, and mechanical aspects Package (green), which includes mechanical assemblies interfacing the physical and electrical domain Circuit (blue), which refers to electronic schematics of PCB, packages, or semiconductor die, and range from transistors to common circuits like amplifiers, PLLs, converters, and digital logic System (red), which includes the operation of products, where several separated blocks are combined to deliver a feature or function, either at the electrical, data, or software levels In the following landscapes, patents applicable to wearables are painted black, and are similar to one or more of our models for sensor, sensor systems, power, process, radio, and product features. A Closer Look At  Fitbit Consider  Fitbit (Figure 5). Their portfolio is relatively new with 81 US applications, 69 recent granted patents, and eight design patents. The structure of the portfolio appears to be centered on notifications, with four branches related to the monitoring fitness and activity, geo-location, heart rate, and biometrics in a portable fashion.  As an example, the top 15 keywords among many for peak “coupon apparatus page” are shown. About 58% of the portfolio is found to be similar to our six models for wearables. This is a high percentage, suggesting that this is the primary market for  Fitbit. Most  Fitbit patents are systems related; perhaps only a handful are strongly circuit in nature. This implies that  Fitbit is an integrator, combining its own building blocks or those from other companies to create a higher value end product. Fitbit may be in a good position for licensing negotiations, as their portfolio of recent systems patents may patent high-level value features of the recent innovations marketed in this wave of wearable products. Figure 5, Fitbit Wearables Patent Landscape A Closer Look at Microsoft Microsoft’s portfolio consists of 8,696 applications, 25,677 patents, and 3,692 design patents. Their portfolio consists mostly of software patents, with about 300 patents that are circuit related that are likely related to their Xbox gaming system, which includes Kinect and handheld peripherals. About 962 Microsoft patents are similar to the six wearables models in the initial study.  These patents are painted black in the full portfolio on the bottom left of Figure 8, are widely distributed. This suggests these patents are diverse in technology and may cover a broad range of technologies in wearables products. A landscape was created of only the 962 patents found to be potentially applicable to wearables, in the right half of Figure 8. The top right area generally surrounding and above peak “image motion point” is about sensors and sensor systems, and many of the product features of Things. The left side around peak “event query search” combines sensor systems and processing. The bottom area, generally around and below peak “message activity service,” describe interactions of communication, wireless, and power. Considering that Microsoft also has a very wide range of other technologies innovations patented, they would have the best position leveraging the wearables market among all companies considered in this study. Figure 8, Microsoft Wearables Patent Landscape Conclusion The fitness wearables market is driving millions of shipments per year in silicon and devices. By 2019, IDC predicts that the worldwide wearables market will grow to around 155.7 million units. In addition to driving revenues — the fitness wearables market alone is projected to reach nearly $30 billion US dollars in 2016 as noted. The patent licensing landscape for this market is on the verge of explosive growth, especially since many of the patents used in IoT technology are nearly 20 years old. Many companies new to the IoT market may have strong and expansive portfolio positions for assertion. Even so, understanding the market players, their experience, and their patents in similar products is vital in creating a product and IP strategy that can deliver a high return in the IoT market.

Nouveau Gets A LED Driver To Control Light-Up GeForce Logos Written by Michael Larabel in Nouveau on 24 August 2016 at 09:16 AM EDT. 19 Comments For those with a TITAN X or other high-end GPUs that have a configurable light-up "GeForce" LED sign along the edge of the graphics card, a new Nouveau driver allows manipulating those LEDs. Martin Peres of Intel OTC who continues hacking on Nouveau in his spare time received a donation of a GeForce GTX TITAN graphics card. He decided to play around with the "useless" feature of being able to manipulate the brightness of the LEDs powering this light-up display. He's written a basic LED driver that hooks up to the LED subsystem and in turn allowing to sync the blinking to the CPU/disk/network activity or other manual controls. Martin noted with the fun patch where he implemented this LED control support in less than 200 lines of code, "Users may also implement some breathing effect or morse code support in the userspace if they feel like it." This configurable LED support for the GeForce logo has long been exposed under Windows on supported hardware. 19 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

(PRNewsFoto/UBM EMEA Routes Ltd) MANCHESTER, England, August 24, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- One of the rising stars of the Chinese economy, the emerging city of Chengdu, will move closer towards its ambition of becoming the main transport hub for western China when it hosts the World Routes aviation forum next month (24-27 September).      (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150730/250177LOGO ) World Routes is an annual event that brings together airlines, airports, tourism authorities and governments to plan new air services. It travels to a new location every year to stimulate different aviation markets. This year's host city, Chengdu, is the capital of Sichuan Province and one of the fastest developing cities in the world. Chengdu's GDP increased by 7.9% in 2015 to over 1.08 trillion Yuan (1.1% higher than the national average) and 271 Fortune 500 companies including IBM, Intel and Microsoft are based in the city. Chengdu's tourism industry is also booming. Around 2.3 million oversea visitors travelled there last year (16.3% more than 2014) to see attractions such as the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding where pandas have been brought back from the brink of extinction. The host of World Routes 2016, Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport, is already mainland China's fourth busiest airport with over 50 airlines serving 199 destinations. Last year the airport handled 42 million passengers and this number is expected to reach 45 million by the end of 2016. Direct international routes include San Francisco, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London, Moscow, Paris and Melbourne. China is investing massively in aviation to create a one trillion yuan ($153.8 billion) market by 2020. A construction programme will increase the number of airports from 300 to 500, one of which will be in Chengdu. It will be the one of only three cities in China to have two airports (along with Beijing and Shanghai) when Chengdu Tianfu International opens in 2020. Chengdu has 3,000 years of history and was part of the ancient network of Silk Road trade routes.

A total of 15 companies will participate, including telecommunication providers SK Telecom, AT&T, Deutsche Telekom and China Mobile, and device manufacturers Ericsson, Nokia, Samsung, Huawei, Intel and LG. The cooperative body will discuss ways to ensure interoperability with existing networks, including fourth-generation long term evolution, or LTE, networks. The group is also expected to discuss early-stage system standards for 5G as well as ways to further develop the technology. The fifth-generation mobile network is expected have higher internet connection speeds along with other improvements such as expanded coverage and higher signal efficiency. The new body will have a consultative relationship with an existing international organization called the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), which has been authorized to set telecommunications standards and hopes to establish initial standards for 5G networks by 2018. Industry experts are now focused on how the newly-formed cooperative body will affect decisions by 3GPP. While 3GPP has already begun discussions this year on 5G standardization, it will take time as it plans to establish standards in stages. Once all details of the standards are set, commercialization of 5G will begin. “To successfully commercialize 5G and take the lead in longer-term technological developments after the launch of 5G, cooperation with global telecommunication providers and device manufacturers is a must,” said Park Jin-hyo, head of SK Telecom’s network technology research and development center. SK Telecom has been working with device makers such as Ericsson, Nokia and Samsung to jointly develop devices and technology for 5G.

(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150730/250177LOGO ) World Routes is an annual event that brings together airlines, airports, tourism authorities and governments to plan new air services. It travels to a new location every year to stimulate different aviation markets. This year's host city, Chengdu, is the capital of Sichuan Province and one of the fastest developing cities in the world. Chengdu's GDP increased by 7.9% in 2015 to over 1.08 trillion Yuan (1.1% higher than the national average) and 271 Fortune 500 companies including IBM, Intel and Microsoft are based in the city. Chengdu's tourism industry is also booming. Around 2.3 million oversea visitors travelled there last year (16.3% more than 2014) to see attractions such as the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding where pandas have been brought back from the brink of extinction. The host of World Routes 2016, Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport, is already mainland China's fourthbusiest airport with over 50 airlines serving 199 destinations. Last year the airport handled 42 million passengers and this number is expected to reach 45 million by the end of 2016. Direct international routes include San Francisco, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London, Moscow, Paris and Melbourne. China is investing massively in aviation to create a one trillion yuan ($153.8 billion) market by 2020. A construction programme will increase the number of airports from 300 to 500, one of which will be in Chengdu. It will be the one of only three cities in China to have two airports (along with Beijing and Shanghai) when Chengdu Tianfu International opens in 2020. Chengdu has 3,000 years of history and was part of the ancient network of Silk Road trade routes. PresidentXi Jinping's 'One Belt, One Road' strategy aims to create a modern day Silk Road through improved transport connections to western Asian, the Middle East and Europe, putting Chengdu in an even stronger position to bid for increased air services. Adrian Newton, group director at UBM EMEA, the organiser of World Routes, said: "Chengdu is a prosperous city with massive potential for the aviation industry. Our delegates are excited to explore the opportunities created by Chengdu's powerful economy and the desire to create more international air services." Some of the biggest international airlines have registered for World Routes including Air China, American Airlines, British Airways, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Iberia, Japan Airlines, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Lufthansa and Qantas.

Join For Free Discover how powerful static code analysis and ergonomic design make development not only productive but also an enjoyable experience, brought to you in partnership with JetBrains.  The new JDK™ 9 early access release contains a JDK enhancement proposal JEP 143, Improve Contended Locking, to improve the performance of contended monitors. Monitors are used by the Java synchronized statement to lock access to a code block. If the synchronized block is called by several threads, the monitor becomes contended. This can degrade performance dramatically. So let us look at the performance improvements of contended monitors. The graphic shows the time of one method call. The lower numbers mean better performance. The test consists of 8 threads accessing a synchronized block, and all threads are accessing the same monitor. You can download the test here. The test was run on an Intel i5 4 core CPU. As we can see, JDK 9 improves the performance of contended monitors. Let us now look at a direct comparison between JDK 8 and 9. Comparison Between JDK 8 and JDK 9 The following shows how much improvement the switch from JDK 8 to JDK 9 will bring. The graphic shows the time of one method call for a contended monitor at different threads. As we see the performance of JDK 9 degrades mutch slower than the performance from JDK 8. One advice to improve the performance is to use reentrant locks instead of synchronized blocks. So let us see if this advice is still true for JDK 9. Reentrant Locks vs. Synchronized Let us look at the performance of a contended reentrant lock vs. a contended monitor of a synchronized block. The graphics show the time of one method call at different threads. As we see in JDK 9, the performance of the synchronized statements is almost as fast as the reentrant locks. Conclusion As we have seen, JDK 9 improves the performance of contended monitors. In JDK 9 contended monitors are almost as fast as contended reentrant locks, but JDK 9 also has a JDK enhancement proposal JEP 285, Spin-Wait Hints, to improve the performance of locks. I will look at this in the next article on this blog. Besides testing the performance of multithreaded code you should also test the correctness of your multithreaded code.

The tie-up is the latest between automakers and tech companies hoping to speed driverless cars to market. Here’s a rundown of who’s working with whom: UBER/VOLVO/TOYOTA/OTTO Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies and Volvo Cars signed a $300 million deal for Volvo to provide SUVs to Uber for autonomous vehicle research. The Volvo SUVs will be part of Uber’s self-driving fleet of taxis in Pittsburgh. Both companies will continue to develop autonomous vehicles separately. Uber also is buying Otto, a startup that has developed software that lets big rigs drive autonomously. Earlier this year, Toyota Motor Corp. bought a small stake in Uber for an undisclosed amount. LYFT/GENERAL MOTORS/CRUISE AUTOMATION General Motors Co. invested $500 million in Uber rival Lyft Inc. earlier this year. The companies are developing a fleet of autonomous electric taxis that could be deployed through Lyft within the next year. GM also acquired Cruise Automation, a startup that makes autonomous vehicle software, for $581 million. LYFT/DIDI CHUXING/UBER/APPLE Chinese ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing invested $100 million in Lyft last fall. The partnership allows U.S. customers use the Lyft app to hail Didi rides while in China and vice versa. Uber recently complicated that deal by selling its China business to Didi in exchange for an 18-percent stake in the Chinese company. And there’s another wrinkle: Apple Inc., which is believed to be working on its own autonomous cars, invested $1 billion in Didi in May. GOOGLE/FIAT CHRYSLER Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which has been working on self-driving cars since 2009, is working with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to build 100 self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans. The vans will let Google double the size of its autonomous test fleet. VOLKSWAGEN/GETT Volkswagen AG invested $300 million in Uber competitor Gett Inc. in May. Gett said it would provide Volkswagen with the technology to expand beyond car ownership and into ride- and car-sharing. BMW/INTEL/MOBILEYE BMW AG, Intel Corp. and Israel’s Mobileye NV are teaming up to build and commercialize driverless cars. The companies say they could have autonomous vehicles in production by 2021. BMW’s iNext electric sedan will serve as the platform for the technology. Intel makes the computer processors necessary to operate self-driving cars, while Mobileye makes advanced camera systems. The vehicles would likely be used by ride-sharing fleets. FORD/VELODYNE/BAIDU Ford Motor Co. is aiming to have fully self-driving cars – with no steering wheels or pedals – in ride-sharing fleets by 2021. Ford and Chinese search engine company Baidu Inc. – which has also invested in Uber – are investing $150 million in Velodyne, which makes the laser sensors that help guide self-driving cars. Ford also acquired Israel-based SAIPS for its expertise in artificial intelligence and computer vision, and invested in Berkeley, California-based Civil Maps. AUDI/MERCEDES/BMW/HERE Last fall, Nokia Corp. sold its digital mapping business, Here, to a consortium of German automakers for $3 billion. Audi, BMW and Mercedes say precise maps are a key to developing autonomous cars as well as advanced driver assistance features. NISSAN/NASA Under a five-year partnership, researchers from Nissan and NASA are working on autonomous driving systems and human-machine interface projects with software that can be used on both cars and planetary rovers. Nissan hopes to have self-driving cars on the road by 2020. Copyright 2016 Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

Join For Free Discover how AppDynamics steps in to upgrade your performance game and prevent your enterprise from these top 10 Java performance problems, brought to you in partnership with AppDynamics. The new JDK™ 9 early access release contains a JDK enhancement proposal JEP 143, Improve Contended Locking, to improve the performance of contended monitors. Monitors are used by the Java synchronized statement to lock access to a code block. If the synchronized block is called by several threads, the monitor becomes contended. This can degrade performance dramatically. So let us look at the performance improvements of contended monitors. The graphic shows the time of one method call. The lower numbers mean better performance. The test consists of 8 threads accessing a synchronized block, and all threads are accessing the same monitor. You can download the test here. The test was run on an Intel i5 4 core CPU. As we can see, JDK 9 improves the performance of contended monitors. Let us now look at a direct comparison between JDK 8 and 9. Comparison Between JDK 8 and JDK 9 The following shows how much improvement the switch from JDK 8 to JDK 9 will bring. The graphic shows the time of one method call for a contended monitor at different threads. As we see the performance of JDK 9 degrades mutch slower than the performance from JDK 8. One advice to improve the performance is to use reentrant locks instead of synchronized blocks. So let us see if this advice is still true for JDK 9. Reentrant Locks vs. Synchronized Let us look at the performance of a contended reentrant lock vs. a contended monitor of a synchronized block. The graphics show the time of one method call at different threads. As we see in JDK 9, the performance of the synchronized statements is almost as fast as the reentrant locks. Conclusion As we have seen, JDK 9 improves the performance of contended monitors. In JDK 9 contended monitors are almost as fast as contended reentrant locks, but JDK 9 also has a JDK enhancement proposal JEP 285, Spin-Wait Hints, to improve the performance of locks. I will look at this in the next article on this blog. Besides testing the performance of multithreaded code you should also test the correctness of your multithreaded code. Read more about a new way to unit test your multithreaded application. If you have a question or remark please add a comment below. The Java Zone is brought to you in partnership with AppDynamics.

Google Pixel: Devices are a dangerous distraction from the new AI interface Will 5G give Samsung a chance at global Radio Access Network glory? Google’s latest operating system project, Fuchsia, may be largely a mystery, but it reinforces a truth that platform vendors are having, grudgingly, to acknowledge: one operating system does not fit all. For a company which has put so much effort into making Android an OS for all purposes, Google has a remarkable number of potentially conflicting platforms, now including Chrome OS, Brillo and Fuchsia. Even though it looks like an experimental OS for embedded devices, Fuchsia was described by its own Google team as being designed for “modern phones and modern personal computers”, which might be just how Android and Chrome OS would describe themselves too. So is Google hedging its bets, extending Android to cars, homes and wearables while developing alternatives just in case? Or is there a more coordinated master plan at work? The failure of one-size-fits-all OSs Many companies, of course, develop parallel systems, creating dilemmas for the marketing departments – especially companies with a culture of innovation and semi-open source activity like Google (though the same parallelism used to characterize the far more controlled Samsung too). But Google’s multi-headed OS hydra may well have a greater commercial logic behind it. If it can create a fully optimized platform for each key emerging area of connected experience, and then marry them all together at the applications layer with the ubiquitous Android, it might achieve what Unix, Linux and Java promised, but failed to deliver all these years. All those, not to mention the proprietary unified OS attempts like successive generations of Windows, ran up against the huge challenges of extending a single OS across very different hardware systems, user and developer communities, and user experiences. The fragmentation becomes even worse with the rise of a new host of connected devices, and companies which missed out on the mobile market because of Android’s dominance have been eagerly grasping the opportunity to devise a fully optimized software environment for virtual reality headsets, for smart clothing, for industrial robots, for drones, for car dashboards, for connected light switches. Can all these target devices, and many more, with their very varied screens, interfaces and applications, really be served by one OS? No, say the firms whom Android pushed aside, such as Samsung with Tizen and Huawei with LiteOS. Google increasingly seems to be saying no too, despite the proliferation of new Android strands for specific device types. Chrome OS enables devices – initially lightweight laptops but now streaming gadgets like Chromecast and others – which are inherently cloud-connected, while Android, in its commercial implementations, is optimal with downloads and offline/online. Then there is Brillo for embedded, ultra-low power devices – it is used in the Google Wi-Fi OnHub while its associated application layer framework, Weave, is used by the Nest home devices subsidiary, along with the Thread connectivity protocol – and access to Android apps and services. This is the key – different OSs, but with various levels of integration with the huge Android base of developers and applications. Brillo is essentially a stripped-down version of Android, while Chrome OS is entirely separate, based on the Chromium code base which is increasingly strategic to Google (it also underpins the browser and the CoreOS containers). But Chrome OS has also become increasingly entwined with Android, enabling Chromebook users to harness those apps and offline services too. Fuchsia’s early details The details of Fuchsia are few and far between at this early stage, but it appears to be an ambitious project, with one core component drawing a lot of attention – it won’t be using the Linux kernel at all. It appeared on GitHub with just the description "Pink + Purple = Fuchsia (a new Operating System)". It can be trialled on an ARM or Intel computer or a virtual machine, and its next port is said to be to a Raspberry Pi to test its low power credentials further. It uses Google’s own Dart programming language. While a non-Linux OS might be commonplace for very low end embedded devices, Fuchsia is more than a simple RTOS (real time OS), since it has "grown-up" capabilities such as advanced graphics and 64-bit support and a capability-based security model. This points to an attempt to create a Linux-free OS and potentially create a whole new approach to open OS development (and IPR) a quarter-century after Linus Torvalds made his breakthrough. Fuchsia will run on the newly developed Magenta kernel (based on the Little Kernel project), instead of the Linux kernel that forms the heart of all Linux distros – including Android and Chromium. As such, Google’s new OS looks like it will be entirely homegrown. The GitHub repository notes “LK is a kernel designed for small systems typically used in embedded applications. On the other hand, Magenta targets modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of RAM, with arbitrary peripherals doing open-ended computation.” Whether that makes it more efficient than the Linux kernel remains to be seen – after all, that codebase has existed for quite a long time now, but has been the source of near constant development from the open source community. Those open source advocates are likely going to be quite uncomfortable with a Googlespawned OS, but for Alphabet itself, there might be some strategic advantages to the homebrew platform. This would most likely be targeted, in its commercial stages, to compete with the rising number of specialized lightweight systems which sit somewhere between a full platform and a real time OS (RTOS) like VxWorks. The latter’s developer, Intel unit Wind River, is playing in this space, as is ARM with mBED OS, and up the stack a little, there are numerous vendor efforts like Tizen, and open source alternatives. The Magenta kernel has been designed to compete at the RTOS end, against the likes of FreeRTOS and ThreadX, which are operating systems designed for devices that are incredibly hardwareconstrained – and thus more likely to be found in remote IoT deployments. These embedded devices often use non-Linux kernels, and so that realm won’t be too unnerved by Google’s proposition. How far will Fuchsia cannibalize Android, or ride on it? But Magenta is also being built to scale up to far more powerful compute platforms such as phones and PCs, so if it succeeds there in future, Google will have to make difficult decisions about the risks of moving away from Linux; the level to which Magenta would be allowed to cannibalize Android; and how the two OSs could be converged. It seems impossible that the company would throw away the ingrained advantage that its Android base brings it, whether in embedded devices or new generation smartphones. Fuchsia could conceivably be the basis of something like Android 7.0, or rather the open source AOSP component that underlines the OS itself, but it is more likely that Google will work on enabling Fuchsia developers and users to have Android compatibility where required. But the sheer amount of work and risk to replace Android – even if Fuchsia proves more optimal for upcoming user experiences; even if the replacement takes place over many years – is daunting. Far better to keep Fuchsia focused on powering embedded or hardware- constrained devices at the network edge, and reworking Android as radically as necessary to enable it to leave iOS in the dust when mobile users start to embrace new experiences driven by hyper-contextual awareness, AI-driven search and query, voice and image recognition, and virtual/augmented reality. The old OSs and tools will struggle to keep pace with all that, and Google may be recognizing this – in far better time than Microsoft did with Windows as the web and then the mobile eras dawned. But on phones and PCs, it is already introducing software which will revolutionize Android and Chrome without the need for a brand new platform. Project Tango has had a rocky start, but promises augmented reality experiences which will become as natural to the user as the search box and the maps tools are today. And as part of the Chromium project, Google is working on bringing VR support to its Chrome browser, a move which could help transform the web and mobile experience. According to Google’s Francois Beaufort, the Chrome Beta and Chrome Dev channels have a setting that “allows users to browse the web while using Cardboard or Daydream-ready viewers”. Daydream is the VR platform which Google unveiled at its I/O conference this year, while Cardboard is its low cost technology for turning a handset into a VR viewer. These are the projects which will change the rules in the next phase of mobile and IoT usage, and will help to tie users and OEMs into Android, reluctantly or not. It seems impossible that Google would sabotage all that with yet another PC/phone OS, while in the embedded world, it may have a chance to burrow far more deeply into the IoT and all its many devices than it can with Android. The Fuchsia team A selection of the leaders of the Fuchsia development indicates the broad operating system heritage, spanning more than two decades and several iconic platforms, which is being tapped for Google’s latest adventure: Travis Geiselbrecht: worked on the failed but hugely influential BeOS from the 1990s as well as iOS and Danger’s Hiptop product, which was later acquired by Microsoft. Brian Swetland: also worked on BeOS and Hiptop, but has spent many years on the Android core too. Chris McKillop: yet another Hiptop alumnus and a member of the original iPhone team. He was also an original member of a team which created webOS – later owned by Palm and then Hewlett-Packard – and contributed to the QNX automotive OS which was acquired by BlackBerry. Adam Barth: a long-serving member of Google’s Chrome team who also built his own OS, called Tau. Most recently, he has helped develop Google’s Flutter tool which aims to make it easier to write software to run on both Android and iOS.

Set caching to this drive, render out to this drive. OR, would it make sense to have large/comlex media such as 6K R3D files reading from this drive? For short commercial projects, the selects would not be over 500GB I don't think. OR would it be much better to have the PCIe SSD as the system drive? And not cache to it, I'd figure out a different idea for caching. I don't know what it would speed up over the regular SSD other than boot up times? Any suggestions welcome!     #2   Peter Karlsson View Profile View Forum Posts Private Message Visit Homepage Senior Member Join Date Jan 2007 Location Stockholm Posts 548 08-24-2016, 02:45 AM Choose fast system drive as well.. There are many background I/O all the time going on, so putting in a old drive doesnt make sense.. Question.. Why RX480? Davinci is optimized for CUDA these days, no?

However if you need to cache to uncompressed UHD/4K, then you need PCI SSD, or really fast RAID. Those uncompressed UHD files can be 1GB+ per sec, so your SSD can fit only a few minutes of footage.     #4   Milano Questa View Profile View Forum Posts Private Message Senior Member Join Date Jan 2013 Posts 292 08-24-2016, 05:52 AM You need about 2gb Ram per core to get most out of your CPU.     #5   Ben Miller View Profile View Forum Posts Private Message Junior Member Join Date Nov 2012 Location Los Angeles, CA Posts 17 08-24-2016, 02:16 PM I'm going to 2nd Peter here. If youre spending that much on processors, upgrade the video cards. And you can NEVER have a SSD that is too fast. Is Xeon even worth it? Check this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b36UZrx4gpY     #6   Martin Landsburg View Profile View Forum Posts Private Message Member Join Date Oct 2010 Posts 51 08-24-2016, 11:13 PM Thanks for all the feedback so far! I'm mainly building a system that can handle R3D's well, and perform in at least workable level with Neat Video on a 4K timeline. With 6K R3D's, my new (now old) Mac Pro cylinder would often crash, or at best render at below half a frame per second. I then did a test with a variety of setups at a place that builds medium-high end work stations, dual 6-core (all they had in stock at the time) with an M6000 Quadro, a GTX 1070 and RX480. The RX480 was twice as fast with Neat Video, and equal to both cards without. 6K Full Debayer, lowest compression on a 25p and one 50p clip. 15.5 fps no neat video for all cards. M6000: 1.2 fps with Neat Video. RX480 was 2.7 fps. After Effects used to require 2GB per core ...not sure how it is now without hyperthreading, not an AE guy but I heard it's in a massive overhaul of the core engine so may take a while to optimally use system resources? Again, this machine is for Resolve only. Also, from scouring forums, I gathered that R3D in particular benefit more from more cores vs higher clock speed as Davinci is a multi-threaded app that scales up to as many cores are available. The dual 6-cores were all maxed out to 100% during playback, no grades applied. I got a good deal on second hand OEM (with warranty), dual CPUs for $700 so it is cheaper than a 8-core or 10-core i7. Thanks for that youtube link though, that is the CPU model I bought 2x of. From his test, it still beat the i7, and it was a single Xeon, not dual. Will see how it fares!

I did several tests and got quite good results without Neat Video. Realtime 25fps playback of 6K 6144x4140 timeline, 6K 50fps R3D clip in Full Res Premium 10-bit after a bit of tweaking with the bios (turbo boost on). With Neat Video, I got good results within the preferences>performance tab, up to 5.75 fps on a 4K timeline. (This is much better than the 1.2fps Quadro M6000 or 0.7fps GTX 1070 that I tested btw!) However, in actual playback, it would get me 1-2fps, maybe 3fps, but grind to a halt halfway through the clip. This may be because Davinci doesn't see all of the GPUs? AMD panel shows one GPU as Primary, with the other two showing up but marked as (disabled). GPU-Z and system manager show no issues. notes: GPU usage during the neatvideo test averaged no more than 15%, CPU usage on turbo only 54% RAM only 8GB of usage with 24GB free     #8   Matthew Riggieri View Profile View Forum Posts Private Message Senior Member Join Date Oct 2008 Location Baltimore, MD Posts 358 09-06-2016, 10:15 AM Do you have the full version of resolve?     #9   Martin Landsburg View Profile View Forum Posts Private Message Member Join Date Oct 2010 Posts 51 09-06-2016, 10:16 AM Yes, listed under system specs.     #10   Martin Landsburg View Profile View Forum Posts Private Message Member Join Date Oct 2010 Posts 51 09-06-2016, 11:58 PM As further notes: Pre-allocated memory set to 4000 MB No SLI or crossfire Only one monitor attached to one of the GPUs     Page 1 of 2 12 Last Jump to page: Quick Navigation DaVinci Top Site Areas Settings Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home Forums Red Digital Cinema Recon NAB 2016 DRAGON WEAPON RAVEN RED DISCUSSION Crucial Ordnance EPIC-M OWNERS The DSMC System EPIC RED ONE SCARLET REDLINK DEVELOPERS .

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ BENGALURU: Karnataka has asked technology companies, hotels, malls and movie halls to ensure their guards are trained to protect employees and visitors during terror attacks or face legal action. State police, in a circular issued last week, also directed hotels and technology companies to be equipped with luggage scanners and weapon detectors and keep the police posted on foreign visitors. Failure to follow these directions would result in legal action, the department warned. The circular didn't mention any immediate threat and the directives are a precautionary measure following a spate of popular venues emerging as prime targets in other countries, police said. In Paris, gunmen and suicide bombers targeted a concert hall, a stadium and restaurants and cafes on November 13, killing 130 people. Every year, thousands of foreigners visit Bengaluru, a vibrant city with an assortment of pubs and malls as well as a large, young population of engineers that has attracted global technology giants including Google and Intel to set up offices here. The cautionary circular was the outcome of a meeting home minister G Parameshwara recently held with senior police officers, where he discussed terror attacks and instances of youngsters from Karnataka reportedly joining terror outfits such as the Islamic State. "The circular is a precautionary step," said Alok Mohan, Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order). "Star hotels, malls and cinemas need tight security measures in place in the event of a terror attack. They should be in a position to cooperate with police by giving us information on people visiting from other countries." The circular states that hotels, besides having specially trained guards, should record details of foreigners along with their photographs, address and purpose of visit and pass these on to the local police.Technology companies should provide details on foreign delegates visiting them on work or to participate in seminars and conferences. "We are taking extra measures," said Bhaskar Rao, Additional DGP (Crime and Technical Services). "We want to keep track of foreigners visiting Bengaluru and other parts of the state. Details on where they go and what they do will be recorded till their exit. Eventually, this will be shared with other states," he said. Some clusters of technology companies in Bengaluru already have elaborate security measures in place. NS Rama, chief executive of Electronic City Industries Association, said the technology hub that's home to Infosys and other large companies is provided protection by the Central Industrial Security Force, or CISF, a paramilitary force under the Union home ministry . "CISF vehicles patrol the campus all the time. Infosys has its own CISF cover. We have four security wings in place and individual companies have their own security as well," Rama said. "We will follow the suggestions and directions given by the police." Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now! FROM AROUND THE WEB Want to post your ad?

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile The Definitive Roundup – iPhone 7 & iPhone 7 Plus Specifications, Design & Features Summarized By Ramish Zafar Posted Sep 7, 2016 29Shares Share Tweet Submit The iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus will be with us in less than a month. The pair have surfaced regularly on the rumor mill over the course of this year. While no major changes are expected in terms of design, Apple should nevertheless introduce some upgrades to differentiate this year’s devices from last year’s pair. iPhone sales have seen their first slump in years after all, and Cupertino’s hard pressed to reverse this trend. The amount of leaks and rumors which have surfaced so far can very rightly be said to be countless. If you’ve been following us regularly for the past couple of months, we’ve covered quite a bit about the upcoming devices. This covers leaks related to specifications, to blueprints and alleged image leaks. Given that the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus are expected to be launched next month, it’s time to do a complete roundup of everything that’s surfaced so far. If you’re looking for an iPhone upgrade this year, head over below to find out more on what to expect this year. The Definitive iPhone 7 Rumor Roundup; Design, Blueprints, Specifications And More Apple’s approach on this year’s iPhones will be different from last year’s pair. In 2015, it was all about upgraded materials, camera specifications and 3D Touch. This year, we’re expecting a more subtle approach. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have seen very diverse rumors so far. For starters, we’ve been hearing more about new color options for the pair. These include new variants such as Space Black and Deep Blue, which should breathe new life in the lineup. In terms of hardware, little information has surfaced on Apple plans for the A10. Given that 10nm isn’t expected to reach complete maturity until next year, the A10 is expected to come with 14nm FinFET on board. We’re also expecting the devices to be slightly thicker than last year’s pair. Starting from that, take a look below at some alleged blueprints of the devices which surfaced earlier. We’ll progress gradually from blueprints, to design to performance and finally to miscellaneous. Dimensions: The images which you can see above represent almost every design detail that’s leaked on the iPhone 7 so far. In terms of dimensions, the pair are expected to be slightly thicker, with the iPhone 7 rumored with a width of 0.34 inches. In addition, the smaller variant of the device is also expected to feature a larger rear camera sensor. This will fall neatly in line with Apple’s policy of almost regularly updating the lineup’s camera specifications. All done with dimensions, let’s move over to the design of this year’s devices. Apple’s expected to continue with the spaceship approach of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s lineups. This has rightly led some quarters to comment that the iPhone 7 will in essence be the last of the theme introduced with the iPhone 6. Before you get too disappointed however, there will be some changes this year. The most definitive of these in terms of aesthetics will be redesigned antenna bands. Design: Rather than the antenna bands for the iPhone going around the back, this time we’ll see a different approach. According to leaks so far, the pair will come with antennas going around the top and bottom. In addition to this, the second change this year will be the removal of the 3.5mm earphone jack. This will create a more simpler bottom for the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. Still, we’re not sure how Apple intends to sort out earphone connectivity this time around. Some sources claim that we’ll get to see a lightning to 3.5mm dongle being provided with the iPhones. Others claim bluetooth earphones for the pair. It’s a bit unclear at the moment as to what approach Apple will actually take. However, disappointingly, the space freed up by the removal of the earphone jack won’t be supplemented with extra speakers. Rather, according to sources, we should see the microphone being adjusted here. Hardware: Coupled with design, we’ve also been seeing several hardware related leaks take place over the past couple of months. These range from the motherboard of the devices to its display panel surfacing in alleged images. The pictures of the device’s logic board show little differences. The few images that have leaked so far don’t contain any components. Therefore, hardware changes under the hood are difficult to predict at the moment. Nevertheless, if you take a look at the third image above, you’ll see that we just might be looking at an Intel LTE modem on the device. Santa Clara’s rumored to make a presence on the devices this year as well, so it’s possible that you’re looking at the real deal right here. Images of the display panels of the devices are slightly more interesting. Taking a look at them above, you’ll see that the home button appears to be slightly changed this year. It’s hidden under the flex cable for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Whether we’ll get a Touch sensitive capacitive home button this year is unclear – Apple will have to make quite a bit of adjustments if this does turn out to be the case indeed. Resolutions for the device are unknown as well, though the rumor mill claims that the 4.7 and 5.5 inch devices will get 1080p and 2K displays. Apple loves its optimum 326ppi though, so we’re not sure whether this will materialize. Advertisement Camera: The camera for the iPhones this year should once again be the one to come with the lion’s share of changes. The smaller iPhone 7 will get OIS and a larger camera sensor, as you can see in the images above. While we know the benefits of OIS, it’s not clear how the larger sensor will affect photography. It’s most likely to improve low light scenarios, especially as Samsung’s Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge improved in this area significantly. The larger iPhone 7 Plus on the other hand might feature the lineup’s most significant camera upgrade so far. Rumors for the device’s camera have revolved around a dual camera setup for quite a while. Image, component and render leaks have further boosted these claims. Information so far suggests a dual camera for the iPhone 7 Plus. Apple appears to finally be following in the footsteps of Android once again. While Cupertino’s been as stubborn as ever for display resolution, the dual camera just might actually materialize this year. As far as technical specifications for resolution go, we’ve got no concrete information at the moment. Miscellaneous: Finally, let’s move towards the ‘other’ rumors for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Interestingly, these are the ones that sound quite promising for the devices. For starters, Apple’s rumored to finally do away with 16GB as base storage for the pair. This should entice a lot of users to upgrade, especially if the second rumor of a $100 price decrease for the pair also turns out to be true. Coupled with this, there’s also been talk of 256GB storage for the iPhone 7 Plus. Space Black, Deep Blue and 32GB as starting storage with a $100 price decrease. These just might be Apple’s taglines for the 2016 iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. What defining change this year’s pair will see? We’re not sure right now. The removal of the 3.5mm earphone jack and a dual camera seem to be ‘it’ at the moment. Of course, before you proceed towards lambasting us in the comments section below, keep one thing in mind. All of this information is preliminary in nature. Treat it with a grain or a bag of salt; depending on your preference. The rumor mill has been accurate previously as well, so we’d recommend a grain.

Benchmark Awards Reports Blogs Topics CXO Challenge Whitepapers What's On At 25, Linux has grown up and gone pro By Juha Saarinen on Aug 25, 2016 3:43PM Happy birthday, Penguin. The open source Linux operating system kernel that powers innumerable distributions turns 25 years old this year. Sporting just 10,000 or so lines of code in 1991 when Finnish CompSci Master’s student Linus Torvalds released the kernel to the public as a hobby project, Linux has grown up considerably in the last quarter of a century. It has swollen to just under 22 million lines of code, and is found everywhere from Google Android mobile devices to home broadband routers and virtual machines. Torvalds is still the torch-bearer for Linux but is trying to move away from having a final, and often rather rude, say on what code goes into the kernel. Now 46 and a family man, Torvalds has backed off not only from coding for the kernel but also signing off patches for it. Just 0.2 percent of the total number of kernel patches, or 169, were signed off by Torvalds this year. Torvalds can nowadays take a backseat with much more ease thanks to the thousands of developers hacking away on Linux, many of them being paid to do so by hundreds of large IT companies. The Linux Foundation has added up some of the stats, noting that since 2005, around 14,000 developers from over 1300 companies have contributed to the kernel. It is being developed as a common resource on a massive scale by organisations that are often fierce competitors in other areas. Large IT giants such as Samsung, IBM, Google, AMD, Cisco and Intel are now official Linux hacking outfits. This also means that the volume of contributions from unpaid developers has declined, dropping to just 7.7 percent this year. This is because Linux kernel developers are in short supply, and those who are able to get their code into the mainline repository will be inundated with job offers from large tech corporations, according to the foundation. It noted that while corporate participation in the development process is crucial, no single company dominates the kernel development. This means there is no one entity that can push the kernel development in a particular direction and restrict what others can do with it, although they can improve it for their own specific needs. Having less volunteer developers could become a problem, however, if it leads to a shortage of kernel programmers in the future. Short release cycles for the kernel are critically important for Linux in order to bring in new code and features quickly to stable releases, the foundation said. But Linux development is showing no signs of slowing down, with an increasing rate of change as many more developers and companies take part in the project. “The Linux kernel is one of the largest and most successful open source projects that has ever come about,” according to the Linux Foundation. “Above all, 25 years of kernel history show that sustained, cooperative effort can bring about common resources that no group would have been able to develop on its own."

The garage is part of Methodist LeBonheur Health Care's $480 million expansion in the Memphis Medical District. (Yalonda M. James/The Commercial Appeal) Posted: Aug. 25, 2016 5 Comments SHARE By Wayne Risher of The Commercial Appeal Posted: Aug. 25, 2016 5 The city's leading minority business group wants Memphis companies to buy more locally, expand the economy and boost firms owned by African-Americans, women and other minorities. Buy Local B2B (Business to Business) is a strategy that could inject an estimated $17.4 billion a year into the Memphis economy and at least $1.7 billion into minority businesses, said Luke Yancy III, president and chief executive of the Mid-South Minority Business Council Continuum. Yancy described the program Thursday during the CEO/Presidents Roundtable at the organization's 2016 Economic Development Forum. He called on executives on the panel, in the audience and at the Greater Memphis Chamber to embrace Buy Local. Citing a recent survey of business executives, Yancy said MMBC conservatively estimates that Memphis companies are doing 52 percent of their purchasing or nearly $35 billion a year outside Memphis. The group's goal is to get half of that outside spending diverted to Memphis and for minority businesses to pick up nearly 10 percent of the new spending. The call to action comes against a backdrop of a widening wealth gap between whites and minorities and calls for Memphis and Shelby County governments to rectify historically disproportionate spending with white firms. "The economic pie in Memphis has not grown significantly for the past several years and the minority participation rate is, quite frankly, dismal," said Mary Frances Winters of The Winters Group, a diversity consultant who led the panel discussion. Buy Local is borrowed from the Billion Dollar Roundtable, 18 Fortune 1000 companies that have achieved an average 9.8 percent spending rate on minority- and women-owned businesses, Winters said. "The Buy Local strategy transcends the idea of taking from one demographic group to another," Winters said. "We often times have a scarcity mentality that the pie is fixed. We're talking about expanding the pie for everybody in this plan." Yancy said: "This study that the MMBC has done, I consider it very accurate. We called a number of companies. We pulled a lot of data. So I think the number...is a very conservative number. So hopefully with the chamber's help, with the Chairman's Circle and others, we can adopt a Buy Local strategy and impact minority receipts and small business receipts immediately." Chamber president Phil Trenary, who was one of the panelists, said afterward that he expects the chamber and its leadership group, the Chairman's Circle, will take up the Buy Local idea in the future. Trenary said the chamber is focused on related initiatives including certification for women- and minority-owned businesses, pairing of mentors and proteges and growing the number of jobs and minority businesses. Joining Trenary on the panel were Jerry Collins, chief executive of Memphis Light, Gas & Water; Gary Shorb, chief executive of Methodist Le Bonheur HealthCare; and Frank Sanders, vice president, technology and manufacturing of Intel Corp. Collins and Shorb said they divide large contracts into smaller pieces when possible to improve the prospects of minority and local companies winning the business. Collins said MLGW spending on minority, women-owned and local businesses doubled between 2012 and last year. "It is my belief a strong supplier diversity program is always in the best interest of the customers of MLGW," Collins said. Sanders said the computer chip maker went out on a limb in 2015 and committed to spend $1 billion a year with diverse companies by 2020. At the time, Sanders said, "Our spend was about $140 million. Do we have a clear path in understanding how we're going to get there? No. The bottom line is we recognize that was such an important imperative that we had to figure out a way to go do it. We had to be bold. We had to make a commitment. We strongly believe that what gets measured gets done." Shorb said Methodist embedded minority firms within prime contractor Turner Construction Co. on its Olive Branch and Methodist University construction projects to help build the minority firms' business capacity. Spending more with minority firms "can't be just a program," Shorb said. "It's got to be part of the culture of an organization. It's got to be an expectation of the leadership."   About Wayne Risher Wayne Risher is a business reporter for The Commercial Appeal.
