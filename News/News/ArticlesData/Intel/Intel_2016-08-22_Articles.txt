Yes Zen may be the turning point in an industry where Intel has grown complacent about its status as top dog. In early benchmarks, AMD's Zen competes favourably. In a recent showing, AMD showed off Zen as capable of delivering 40 percent better per clock than previous generations of AMD hardware. Not only that though, but it showed a head to head between a new, Zen Summit Ridge CPU with 8 cores, 16 threads, and a Broadwell E Core-i7 with the same number, competing very evenly. This is clock for clock and the Zen CPU is set at 3.0GHz for now, but we would expect that figure to rise in the coming months as development continues and cooling options improve. AMD will offer a full range of Zen chips when they finally debut, with everything from server chips, right through enthusiast desktops, to laptops, low end tablets and mobile. It's hitting every point and will offer strong competition against all competitors at all price points - supposedly. That's quite a hard target to aim for, especially since high performance probably means AMD won't be as competitive as it usually is on price. But it needs to bring the fight to Intel to force that competitive development which so drove forward the Conroe developments back in the mid '00s.

  News Apple Google Microsoft AMD Stock Skyrockets Further After Zen Unveiling, Up 330% By Talha Amjad  /  3 months ago Share Tweet AMD Stock has been rising ever since AMD Zen was announced but that does not stop there. Now after the unveil of the architecture by Lisa Su, AMD Stock has skyrocketed more than we expected it would. AMD stock has increased another 11% which makes the total increase an amazing 330%. AMD returned to making a profit in Q2 2016 and the stats have increased significantly since then. Zen-based Summit Ridge desktop CPUs will take on Intel in the consumer market but that is not all AMD is looking at taking from Intel. AMD is looking to get a share of the server business as well. AMD was a rival to Intel from the start but a series of products gone wrong and some bad decisions led to the company’s demise. Intel is a big player in the market and it will not be easy taking on the giant but AMD stocks are doing well and with AMD Zen, the company could be making some moves after all. If AMD decides to go on with this then come 2017, AMD will be facing off Intel in the CPU market and Nvidia in the GPU market, both at the same time. The team red vs team green debate is a much argued one and there is now going to be an AMD vs Intel debate as well. But there is no denying that the competition between the two companies will bring great advantages to the users. AMD has brought the heat to Nvidia as well and AMD is trying to capture the low end to mid end GPU market which is the biggest of them all. We can see the approach the company is taking here and it is a clever one to say the very least. What do you think about AMD stocks and its chances against the big boys?

Read more about the stories in today's news: Microsoft to Acquire Genee for Smarter Office 365 Scheduling Google Pulls Plug on Chrome Apps for Windows, Linux, Mac Intel Brings Xeon Chips to AT&T's Network Virtualization Effort Strike Force Works With FCC to Eliminate Robocalls       Today's topics include Microsoft’s plan to acquire Genee AI for Office 365, Google's withdrawal of support for Chrome apps on Windows, Linux and Mac, Intel's expansion of its partnership with AT&T to make the Xeon chip available for network speed improvements and AT&T, Alphabet, Apple and more major tech companies' joint effort to stop robocalling. Microsoft announced on Aug. 22 that it is acquiring Genee, an artificial intelligence and virtual assistant technology startup from Mountain View, Calif., for an undisclosed amount. Genee's technology will be used to enhance Office 365's scheduling and meetings management capabilities, Rajesh Jha, corporate vice president of Microsoft Outlook and Office 365, said in an Aug. 22 announcement. Dovetailing with Microsoft's "Conversations as a Platform" vision, Genee enables business professionals to set reminders and carve out time for meetings, calls, dinners and other events in their calendars in much the same way a personal assistant would. Google will end support for Chrome applications on Windows, Linux and Mac platforms over the next two years. Starting in early 2018, users of packaged and hosted Chrome apps will no longer be able to run them on these platforms. Google will, however, continue to support all types of Chrome apps on Chrome OS for the foreseeable future, a company executive announced Aug. 19. In a blog post, Google Vice President of Product Management Rahul Roy-Chowdhury said the decision was prompted by the fact that many of the capabilities offered by Google apps are now available natively in popular browsers. At Intel Developer Forum 2016 Aug. 16-18, the chip maker made it clear it wants to be the provider of the basic technologies for the internet of things. As part of the effort, Intel officials at the show announced an expanded partnership with AT&T, which will adopt Intel technology as it builds out its software-centric network. The two companies already partner in a number of areas, including 5G networks and drones, and now Intel products will be used in the carrier's high-profile project to use technologies like software-defined networking and network-functions virtualization to make their networks more flexible and scalable. By leveraging Intel's Xeon server chips, AT&T is hoping to take the various networking tasks that traditionally have run on specialized and expensive hardware and put them into software that can run on standard x86-based systems. AT&T, Alphabet, Apple and 30 other technology and communications companies have joined the Federal Communications Commission in an effort to eliminate robocalls. Described as "a scourge" by the FCC, those irritating, automated, prerecorded calls are the No. 1 consumer complaint to the FCC. Members of a newly formed Robocall Strike Force, led by AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson, met for the first time Aug. 19. "What we're going to have to do is come out of this meeting with a comprehensive playbook that we all go out and begin to execute," Stephenson told the assembled members Friday. They included carriers, device makers, OS developers, network designers, regulators and lawmakers.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Over the last 20+ year's he's helped numerous business see the benefit in adopting a wide range of Open Source technologies, and  has spoken at a number of regional and international conferences including OSDC, linux.conf.au, OpenStack Summit, Linux World and OSCON. In his spare time he still hacks on MythTV, and debugging random new bits of hardware that really should » More about me Learn how you can contribute Almost open: BIOS and firmware update tips for Linux users Posted 23 Aug 2016 Steven Ellis (Red Hat)Feed 49up 7 comments Image credits :  Original photo by Rikki Endsley. CC BY-SA 4.0 I suppose I'm lucky in that for more than 10 years my primary work environment has been Linux-based, yet all to often I've been forced to dig out a DOS or Windows image because I need to patch some BIOS device firmware. These days I don't own anything that has a valid Windows license, and even my 2008 white MacBook has spent most of its life running either Ubuntu or Fedora. Luckily most hardware manufacturers have started to provide bootable images for patching system firmware, and for enterprise-grade hardware they even provide Linux-ready tools. In this article, I'll walk through my recent firmware update on Linux, and I'll share a few recommendations based on that experience. In the consumer/prosumer landscape there has been a shift toward UEFI-based systems for desktops and laptops, and along the way many manufacturers appear to have removed the option for the BIOS to update from a USB Stick. Historically we'd only see firmware updates for enterprise-class spinning rust (hard drives), but many SSD manufacturers are also providing regular firmware updates for consumer-class devices. Whilst we often should stand by the old adage "If it ain't broke, don't fix it," I'm a strong believer when standing up a new environment to make sure all my firmware is current. So begins my journey... My update adventure For many years I've been involved with the MythTV project (open source DVR), including at one point producing consumer-ready systems in New Zealand (myPVR). Recently I was after an Intel-based compact PC that could operate as a MythTV front-end, was capable of running Kodi (open source theater system), and could also be occasionally re-purposed as a hypervisor for my home lab. I picked up a GIGABYTE BRIX based on a quad-core N3150 processor, and re-purposed spare RAM and hard drives, for a simple and effective solution. The integrated Intel HD Graphics are capable of H265/HEVC at 24 frames/second, plus the CPU has VT for hardware accelerated virtualization (sadly only upgradable to 8GB RAM, but enough for a simple testbed). With any new equipment, my first step is to try a live USB image to test the hardware. I have a number of bootable images on hand, including Fedora, Ubuntu, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and these days I tend toward a 64-bit image for testing as ultimately I'll be running a 64-bit operating system. I also confirmed that the system was set up with VT enabled for hardware accelerated virtualization as a surprising number of systems still ship with this setting disabled in BIOS or UEFI.   Great tools at this point within a live image are dmidecode and lspci to pull firmware and hardware information:

 The only device I'm expecting to have potential issues with is the Realtek 522a-based MicroSD card reader. All other devices are well supported by modern Linux distributions. Looking at GIGABYTE's site confirmed a new firmware update for the UEFI-based BIOS, which resolves some issues with USB devices and selected monitors. Given one of my primary use cases is as an HTPC, good monitor support is critical, so it was time to update. A quick check of the supplied brix_bios_gb-bace-3150_f3.zip update confirmed the lack of Linux tools, and I've never tried a firmware update from the UEFI firmware directly from the UEFI shell. The BIOS-style front end also has no options for updating the firmware. Searching online for AMI UEFI patching pulled up an old Phoronix article for MSI hardware (MSI: Update your BIOS from the Linux desktop) indicating that a tool called afulnx_64 might be an option. Being somewhat wary of patching my system using random tools from file-hosting sites, I discovered that GIGABYTE ship a version of the tool for their rack-mount enterprise focused systems. Let's try out the afulnx_64 executable from the tools folder in the ZIP file provided by GIGABYTE: 
./afulnx_64 
Error: Cannot locate kernel source.
e - Error: Kernel source files cannot be found.
 The tool needs to build a kernel module in order to patch my BIOS. From a security perspective, this is a little worrying, but looks like a better approach than some of the UEFI tools Matthew Garret has spoken about in recent years. In addition there have been a number of recent security vulnerabilities, including one labled ThinkPwn, in the UEFI for a number of key Intel chipsets that has affected producs from Lenovo, Gigabyte, HP and many others. Keeping an eye on new UEFI releases for your hardware might be considerably more critical than the old days of BIOS updates, especially given the power of the UEFI subsystem on modern hardware. Lenovo:  System Management Mode (SMM) BIOS Vulnerability HPSBBHF3549 ThinkPwn UEFI BIOS SmmRuntime Escalation of Privilege The Register: Gigabyte BIOS blight fright At this point I tried looking at truly open alternatives, such as flashrom: $ sudo flashrom --programmer internal -V flashrom v0.9.9-rc1-r1942 on Linux 4.4.0-28-generic (x86_64) flashrom is free software, get the source code at https://flashrom.org flashrom was built with libpci 3.3.1, GCC 5.3.1 20160225, little endian Found Macronix flash chip "MX25U6435E/F" (8192 kB, SPI). This chip may contain one-time programmable memory. flashrom cannot read and may never be able to write it, hence it may not be able to completely clone the contents of this chip (see man page for details). No operations were specified. Restoring MMIO space at 0x7fc38d7470fc Not looking good so back to the afulnx_64 tool . Luckily, most live USB images will let you install additional packages, so I pulled in the kernel headers and tried afulnx_64 again. I couldn't get this to work with Ubuntu 14.04 or 16.04, but it did work with RHEL 7.2 Being paranoid about my new hardware I first checked the current bios install to confirm that the tool "appears to work":

 Well that was about two months ago, and the hardware has been performing perfectly since. Recommendations More vendors should allow UEFI BIOS updates directly from the BIOS-style interface. UEFI shell command-line isn't for the casual user. If your vendor supplies a bootable image, try to use that first. Investigate what supported tools are available, but consider using a live image for patching. I'm somewhat wary of tools that build and install their own kernel modules.

My Gigabyte board also supports the following firmware update procedure: copy firmware file to a DOS/WinVFat formatted USB stick, boot the box and immediately press a Hotkey (iirc it's F2) and then let the built-in BIOS update feature grab the new firmware version from the USB stick and initiate the update process. Hope this helps. Vote up! 0 Vote down! 0 Steven Ellis on 16 Oct 2016 Permalink I've got several older motherboards that still support BIOS updated via F2 or similar Hot Keys.

The annual Intel Developer Forum usually gives us a glimpse into the chipmaker's plans for new PC and server processors, as well as a look at how the company plans to actually make the next generation of chips. There was a bit of that at last week's show – including a preview of the upcoming Kaby Lake generation of Core PC processors and some interesting news on the manufacturing side – but the focus of the show was on other topics, as Intel is trying to be viewed as more than just a PC chipmaker. In the opening keynote, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich did preview the 7th generation Core or Kaby Lake chips, saying Intel hasn't stopped pushing the boundaries of PCs and that powerful microprocessors remain important. (Kaby Lake demos) On stage demonstrations included 4K content using 10-bit HEVC encoding on a 2-in-1, much faster editing of VR content within Epic's Unreal Engine, and playing Blizzard's Overwatch game on a version of the chip with embedded Iris graphics. Like the previous generation Broadwell and Skylake chips from the last generation, this will be based on 14nm technology. I expect we'll hear more in the run up to the IFA conference in the next couple of weeks. But Krzanich's focus was on four themes. He talked about "redefining the experience of computing" with a focus on "merged reality," and unveiled the Project Alloy untethered VR headset. Krzanich discussed "building a world of visual intelligence" while showing the firm's RealSense 3D camera system, featuring a Yuneec Typhoon H drone with Intel RealSense technology, and Project Aero, a platform for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Within this area, he also presented a new device called Euclid that combines compute, sensors, and communications in a system about the size of a candy bar, demoing the device in a robot that could follow you on the stage. This included the RealSense Camera 400, which he said was thinner and smaller, while doubling the range of the system. Krzanich then brought up Elmar Frickenstein, who heads the automated driving group at BMW, to discuss the partnership that Intel, BMW, and Mobileye set up last month to push autonomous vehicle technology. (Krzanich and Immelt) His third point was "a cloud designed for innovation," and Krzanich talked about how even though people are expected to use 1.5 GB of data per day in 2020, autonomous cars will generate 4,000 GB of data every day, and an airplane will create 40,000 GB of data per day. He brought up GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt who talked about the company's vision for digital transformation, saying every industrial company has to become a digital company, as well as how both GE and Intel are using sensors and automation in running their factories. John Gordon, chief digital officer of GE's Current, showed off a lightpole with sensors connected to GE's Predix platform, and Krzanich talked about the importance of collecting and using metadata. In this area, he announced a Curie Knowledge Builder toolkit, which allows on-chip pattern matching so smart devices can identify special movements, like the swing of a tennis racket, without moving the data to the cloud. This will be broadly available in the first half of 2017, he said. (Krzanich and Joule) The final area Krzanich focused on was "empowering the next generation of innovators," and to that end he announced Intel's Joule, a new developer platform for the Internet of Things, which included a small system board with a module that was also shown off in VR glasses. This is shipping in volume in September. (Murthy Renduchintala) Other keynotes followed these directions. Venkata "Murthy" Renduchintala, President of Intel's client and internet of things business and its systems architecture group, followed Krzanich with a keynote that echoed many of the same themes. He particularly focused on 5G technology, and said the exploding amounts of data generated by IoT applications will require new thinking about how the network is architected, and promising Intel would be offering "end-to-end" solutions including work on next generation software-defined networking. Renduchintala brought up a panel of executives from AT&T, NTT DoCoMo, and GE Current to talk about the challenges and opportunities this has created. Examples ranged from better technology for firefighters within a building to better communicate with leaders on the outside, who could have a better picture of the full fire, to getting food trucks to the right places to meet demand. (Diane Bryant and Silicon Photonics) Diane Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of Intel's Data Center Group, also unveiled a number of products. The most attention went to Knights Mill, the next generation of the company's Xeon Phi many-core processor. This adds support for single- and half-precision calculations to the current Knights Landing version, with Bryant talking about how such features are useful for training deep learning systems. This is clearly meant as a shot at Nvidia's Tesla products, which already support single- and half- procession calculations, and thus can do those shorter calculations used in training faster than double-precision ones. She said that today 7% of servers are deployed in support of machine learning, and that Intel powers 97% of such systems (mostly regular Xeon systems). Baidu announced it will use Intel's solutions, including Xeon Phi, and Bryant also mentioned Intel's recent acquisition of machine learning startup Nervana, without giving many details. I thought the bigger technical story was the announcement that the long-promised silicon photonics product is finally ready for shipment. This is currently designed to interconnect racks of servers within a data center, and especially the so-called "east-west" traffic, which is doubling every year. What makes Intel's solution so different is its integration of the indium phosphide laser onto the silicon, which Bryant says allows for the laser to be automatically aligned and more precise than other optical solutions. The initial version will be offered at 100 Gb/second, with Bryant saying this should scale up to 400 Gb/second. Intel has been talking about silicon photonics for a long time – Bryant said the project has taken 16 years – so seeing it ship is a big step. Bryant also announced the availability of Intel's Rack Scale Design, an architecture for managing racks of computers with pooled network, compute, and storage resources. She said Dell, Ericsson, Inspur, and QCT would have such systems available by the end of the year, and I also noted that Supermicro had a system on the show floor it said was compatible. This includes new telemetry for managing the servers. Much of the focus was on software-defined networks and the move to 5G, with Bryant joined by AT&T Chief Strategy Officer John Donovan to talk about an expanded collaboration agreement and how network functions virtualization was changing the networking arena. The third day of the show included more of a focus on FPGAs – field programmable gate arrays – as Intel talked about its acquisition of FPGA maker Altera, now known as Intel's Programmable Systems Group. Krzanich gave a keynote –joined by Dan McNamara, who heads the new group - that focused on FPGAs both as standalone products and as part of packages including Xeon processors. He held up the latest FPGA from the company, the Stratix 10, the first made on Intel's 14nm process. Overall, I was intrigued but not overwhelmed by the products – Kaby Lake sounds like a minor upgrade, but the changes in Xeon Phi, the introduction of silicon photonics, and the greater prominence of FPGAs could be big. Still, it is Intel's attempt to move in new directions that is probably the biggest underlying story.

The platforms support up to 384 GB of DDR4 memory and are based on the good-old Intel C612 PCH. Due to high TDP of Intel’s Knights Landing CPUs, Supermicro had to use a custom closed-loop liquid cooling for its SuperWorkstation SYS-5038K-i. Intel officially launched its Xeon Phi x200 many-core Knights Landing platform in June, but the company disclosed most of the details regarding its new processors last year at Supercomputing15. As discussed, every Xeon Phi x200 in LGA packaging has up to 72 cores (based on highly-modified Atom Silvermont microarchitecture) running at up to 1.5 GHz, with up to 36 MB of L2 cache, 16 GB of on-package high-performance memory (MCDRAM), six-channel DDR4 DRAM controller as well as 36 PCIe 3.0 lanes. The Xeon Phi x200 chips in LGA3647 form-factor can run as a host, directly with an operating system on board (including Windows Server 2016) which is an upgrade over the older Xeon Phi parts which only ran as co-processors on the PCIe bus. Moreover, the internal PCIe 3.0 root complex gives the Xeon Phi some PCIe lanes to allow other coprocessors to be plugged in - either additional Xeon Phi accelerators in the card form-factor, or AMD/NVIDIA cards, to maximize the compute horsepower. SuperServer 5028TK-HTR Since Intel Xeon Phi x200 processors are designed mainly for high performance computing, so as a result the OEM developers that build servers for customers tend to focus their efforts primarily on ultra-dense platforms. One of the first Xeon Phi x200 solutions from Supermicro will be the SuperServer 5028TK-HTR, which packs four hot-swappable half-width nodes based on the company’s K1SPi motherboards into a 2U form-factor. Each 5028TK-HTR sports 12 3.5” hot-swappable SATA/SAS storage devices (three per node) as well as a 2000 W redundant PSU. Meanwhile, the K1SPi carries one P1 socket, six DDR4 DIMM slots (for up to 384 GB of DDR4), two PCIe 3.0 x16 low-profile slots, a PCIe 3.0 x4 slot, an Intel i350 dual port GbE controller, the Aspeed AST2400 BMC platform management. Supermicro’s SuperServer 5028TK-HTR (as well as the K1SPi motherboard) support Intel Xeon Phi x200 processors with up to 250-260 W TDP. Machines supporting Knights Landing models featuring Omni-Path fabric will be announced at a later date. SuperWorkstation 5038K-i While HPC is a very important market for products like Xeon Phi, there is a segment of Xeon Phi clients who use them in desktop environments for financial analysis, oil and gas exploration, simulations as well as other applications. Also, HPC developers typically want a system-under-the-desk to actually develop their software with immediate results. Specifically for them, at the request of Intel, Supermicro introduced its SuperWorkstation 5038K-i desktop machine featuring the company’s K1SPE motherboard. The workstation is a self-contained unit sold complete, with CPU, DRAM, storage, PSU and cooling. The chassis can fit in two 5.25” ODDs (or other peripherals), six 3.5" and four 2.5” storage devices. The tower is equipped with multiple fans and come with one 750W power supply made by Seasonic as well as a custom-made closed-loop liquid cooling system with two 120 mm fans. The K1SPE mainboard features one P1 socket (with eight-phase power delivery), six DDR4 DIMM slots (for up to 384 GB of DDR4), two PCIe 3.0 x16 slots, a PCIe 3.0 x4 slot, 10 SATA connectors, two GbE ports (via Intel i350), an IPMI LAN port, Aspeed AST2400 for graphics and management, USB 3.0 ports and so on. Despite the fact that the K1SPE uses regular ATX form-factor (with ATX12V and EPS12V power connectors), it will not be sold separately. Both SuperServer 5028TK-HTR and SuperWorkstation 5038K-i machines should be available from Supermicro shortly, but only as complete systems. Therefore, their exact pricing could not be determined because it depends completely on exact configurations and quantity. We have been told that the workstation, the 5038K-i, is actually on back order with a number of customers already, however Supermicro is ramping up production as a result. Additional from Ian: We've put in a request for a 5038K-i sample, which will run Windows Server 2016. As it's a full x86 core (with additional VPUs), I want to see how well our regular x86 enterprise workloads translate into the Xeon Phi sphere. With a low single thread frequency but up to 72 cores, this test should be an interesting one.

POST A COMMENT 8 Comments View All Comments ddriver - Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - link Superservers and superworkstations sound oddly childishly named. Curious how the phi would do in traditional workstation (not enterprise) tasks as a main processor. Reply nathanddrews - Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - link My guess is that it would be really slow for the majority of tasks, but be extraordinary at very threaded tasks. Pricing will be the primary consideration, I think. I'm not aware of any workstation applications that benefit from having more than 8-10 cores, so you might be better off with a dual Xeon setup or something so you can get high single threaded performance and probably faster multithreaded performance. (unless your applications use 50 threads...) I'm sure there are applications/scenarios where this excels, I just can't think of any. Can't wait for benchmarks! Reply ddriver - Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - link Well, most demanding tasks in HPC actually scale quite well, almost perfectly. Those usually divide the work and do it in multiple passes. However I am also curious about async massive multithreading scenarios, where scores of thread do their own thing and exchange results rather than working on parts of the same workload. Reply mtroute - Thursday, September 08, 2016 - link Don't expect screen melting geekbench scores. To take advantage of Phi codes need to be optimized considerably. Vectorization, data locality, memory and cache optimization. This is a true parallel processor that with the right code modernization, will melt your screen.. Reply Kevin G - Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - link Yes, I'm eager to see how a high thread count, low IPC platform does across an array of tasks. Even though they're Atom based cores, I'm eager to see if performance is 'good enough' for the per thread aspect while exploiting the massive amount of parallelism for high throughput. Reply ddriver - Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - link "atom based" doesn't mean much in terms of actual performance, at least the kind of performance I am interested in, actually comes from the SIMD units, and this thing has 512bit wide simd while atoms don't even have avx - that is they cap out at sse3, which suggests the simd units are 128bit wide. So while this may have low IPC for scalar, this is by far not the case for vector execution, which matters for practically 100% of the computation intensive tasks. Reply beginner99 - Wednesday, August 24, 2016 - link I would like to have that one and also know some scenarios were it would be great. Now I will have to wait 10 years till software catches up... Reply BlueBlazer - Wednesday, August 24, 2016 - link A review of that workstation would be nice, at least we can see how Intel's Knights Landing actually performs (including workstation and server style workloads).

Despite the name 'workstation', this board is based on the consumer-grade Intel X99 PCH rather than the server oriented parts, and as a result it supports overclocking. Part of the 'Workstation' feature set means that it has qualified support for NVIDIA Quadro PCIe cards, compatibility with ECC memory, and a U.2 connector for storage. The manufacturer claims that the mainboard uses special components that can improve the endurance of the board, although the warranty is still listed as three years. Typically, workstation-class motherboards for Intel Xeon E5 v3/v4 processors in LGA2011-3 packaging are based on the Intel C612 PCH, which has the same I/O features as the desktop-class Intel X99, but also supports a number of additional capabilities, which are important for business environments, such as vPro, RSTe, SVT and so on (you can read more about Intel’s 612 chipset here). When it comes to professional workstation vendors that supply machines to large corporations, those technologies make a lot of sense and are generally welcome. However, for prosumers and for many professionals working in small/medium businesses, these options might not be required, which is why a lot of motherboard manufacturers offer Intel X99-based workstation-class mainboards that fully support overclocking but continue to have numerous workstation features (such as support for ECC, when Xeon CPUs are installed). This is the focus of the X99A Workstation. The MSI X99A Workstation (7A54) motherboard features one LGA2011-3 slot for Intel Core i7 as well as Intel Xeon E5 processors, though it is interesting to note that the maker does not list Intel Xeon SKUs in its qualified vendor list. Along with the eight-phase power delivery (which uses solid-state chokes), the mainboard carries eight DDR4 memory slots that not only support non-ECC/unbuffered memory modules with XMP 2.0 (and up to DDR4-3333 supported in OC modes), but also RDIMMs with ECC with applicable CPUs. For add-in cards, the motherboard has three PCIe 3.0 x16 slots (which can work in x16, x16/x16, x8/x16/x8 modes with CPUs featuring 40 PCIe lanes) as well as two PCIe 2.0 x1 slots from the chipset. When it comes to storage-related capabilities, the MSI X99A Workstation comes with one M.2-22110 slot, one U.2 port running in PCIe 3.0 x4 mode, and a SATAe port (unavailable when M.2 and U.2 are used). For traditional HDDs/SSDs/ODDs, the motherboard offers 10 SATA 6 Gb/s ports (including two ports from SATAe). So, in total the motherboard can support up to 12 storage devices. The chipset diagram shows what is in play, and the M.2 configuration is a little odd given that 2 lanes come from the PCH and another two from the CPU despite standard CPU bifurcation stops at x4. In this instance I would have suggested that MSI merely considers the M.2 a CPU device with x4, given that the system would support it, but because Intel has 28-lane CPUs for the platform this can cause differences in bandwidth available. MSI shared the storage support matrix to help users looking into the X99A Workstation: For audio and networking, the MSI X99A Workstation uses the Realtek ALC1150 solution (with PCB separation and filter caps) with 7.1-channel analog as well as S/PDIF outputs. For networking, the motherboard has an Intel I218LM and an Intel I210AT Gigabit LAN controllers, with teaming support listed. The mainboard also features ASMedia’s ASM1142 controller to enable one USB 3.1 Type-C (10 Gbps) and one USB 3.1 Type-A (10 Gbps) connectors on the rear panel. In addition, the motherboard supports eight USB 3.1 Type-A (5 Gbps) and eight USB 2.0 ports. The MSI X99A Workstation should be available shortly, but pricing has not yet been decided.  Gallery: MSI Unveils X99A Workstation: Overclocking-Capable Motherboard for Workstations   Source: MSI Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment.

Reply Eden-K121D - Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - link I still prefer Asus x99 deluxe 2 because of the wifi Reply asmian - Tuesday, August 23, 2016 - link Why provide a redesign of X99 that STILL has SATAe, a completely dead and useless connector? If there were a SINGLE available device for it, there would be minimal logic to this, but I'm incredulous that a refresh wastes board space and unnecessary I/O complexity supporting this. Reply evilspoons - Thursday, August 25, 2016 - link The design is probably just a revision of the previous board, and as such it would've been way more work to remove than just leave in. Reply Systab - Friday, August 26, 2016 - link This MB would be amazing if you could OC the current gen of Xeons while keeping ECC. I suspect this is still impossible due to chipset/CPU restrictions. So you either can install a Broadwell-E and get OC but no ECC. Or you can install Xeon E5 v4 get ECC but lose OC capability. Am I right that you can not OC Xeon E5 v4s no matter the MB chipset ?

A 24-core chip accompanies the main system processor to make the holographic display possible. It's both powerful and pricey. HoloLens has two processors. The main CPU is an Intel chip that has been documented since Microsoft launched the first developers edition of the HoloLens back in February. This is accompanied by a separate Holographic Processing Unit (HPU) box that has been shrouded in mystery over the past few months. Yesterday, Microsoft revealed what's inside the HPU. As reported by The Register, it detailed the unique processing box at the Hot Chips conference yesterday. The mysterious HPU contains a custom-built 28nm processor that works with the main Intel chip to power the holographic display, primarily taking responsibility for sensor processing. The processor is built by TSMC and has 24 distinct cores. It is joined by 1GB of low-power DDR3 RAM and is capable of performing a trillion calculations every second. When running HoloLens' complex algorithms, it is over 200 times faster than the Intel CPU alone. Despite the high performance, the entire HPU draws just 10W of power from the wall. The extremely high performance of the HPU is necessary because of the workload it's tasked with. It handles all of the environmental sensor processing for the HoloLens, aggregating data from the sensors on the outside of the wearer. It then considers input controls, such as gestures, and the HoloLens' environmental sensing features. Each of the 24 cores has its own assigned task to work on. Needless to say, this isn't your standard processor. Microsoft has worked directly with TSMC to design the chip for the specific demands of the HoloLens. This is why it acts as a co-processor rather than running the entire device. It isn't capable of supporting the HoloLens' operating system. It's purely a computational machine, crunching through calculations at an otherwise impossible rate. The main processor is a 14nm Intel Atom x86 Cherry Trail chip with its own 1GB of RAM. It's not a high-performance CPU and is akin to the low-power chips found in budget laptops and tablets. It's good enough to run Windows 10 and Universal Windows Apps, however. It hands off to the HPU when it needs to access sensor values. The bespoke nature of the HPU is likely to become an issue when trying to reduce costs of the HoloLens and begin selling it to consumers. Microsoft has extensively modified the TSMC chip it's based on, going so far as to add its own instructions to optimise holographic calculations. The hardware could become more standardised over the next few years, however. As more headsets hit the market, it's likely they'll all start demanding a common set of processing features that chip manufacturers will be able to bake into their products. HoloLens began shipping to developers in March. It is now available to buy without pre-ordering from the HoloLens website, making it easier for developers to get started building holographic apps. Next year, the Windows Holographic platform will be delivered to every Windows 10 PC, allowing you to use these apps on a headset powered by your existing devices. HoloLens is currently the only supported headset, although third-party products such as Intel's Project Alloy are expected to arrive in the next year.

To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Intel released a new IoT developer board at its recent developer conference, according to Engadget. Dubbed “Joule,” it's the most powerful IoT developer kit Intel has ever developed, according to the company. The kit is similar to Arduino and Raspberry Pi in that developers use it to make IoT projects. However, Joule is said to be a lot more powerful than either of those systems. In a press release, Intel noted that the Joule platform will be available in two models and begin shipping this September. Intel says the platform will allow developers to take a concept into a prototype faster and at a lower cost. The Joule is a high performance system-on-module (SOM) running on Linux, which makes it ideal for the industrial IoT in particular. These developer boards are critical for the continued success and expansion of the IoT. A recent IoT developer survey from the Eclipse Foundation found that 84% of developers have used open hardware platforms, like Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Of those that have used the developer boards: 19% say their company deploys IoT solutions using an open hardware platform 33% prototype using the boards 32% have experimented with the boards 9% plan to experiment with them in the next six months Thanks to companies such as Intel, the IoT Revolution is picking up speed. And when it does, it will change how we live, work, travel, entertain, and more. From connected homes and connected cars to smart buildings and transportation, every aspect of our lives will be affected by the increasing ability of consumers, businesses, and governments to connect to and control everything around them. Imagine “smart mirrors” that allow you to digitally try on clothes. Assembly line sensors that can detect even the smallest decrease in efficiency and determine when crucial equipment needs to be repaired or replaced. GPS-guided agricultural equipment that can plant, fertilize, and harvest crops. Fitness trackers that allow users to transmit data to their doctors. It’s not science fiction. This “next Industrial Revolution” is happening as we speak. It’s so big that it could mean new revenue streams for your company and new opportunities for you. The only question is: Are you fully up to speed on the IoT?

Samsung’s semiconductor sales rose 11 percent on-quarter to US$10.3 billion for the second quarter, while Intel’s sales fell 1 percent to US$12.9 billion for the same quarter, data compiled by IC Insights showed.  In the first quarter, Intel reported US$13.1 billion in sales of semiconductors and Samsung posted US$9.3 billion, according to the data. Hit by slumping prices of DRAM chips, widely used in personal computers, Samsung‘s semiconductor sales had been on a decline. However, a rebound came in the second quarter, thanks to strong sales of NAND memory chips for smartphones and other portable devices. Samsung has also been narrowing the annual market share gap with Intel. The market share gap between Samsung and Intel stood at 5.3 percentage points in 2012, 4.2 percentage points in 2013, 3.4 percentage points in 2014 and 3.2 percentage points in 2015.

Source; AMD Photo: Rulison, Larry Reports: Chip made by GlobalFoundries beats Intel 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Malta A next-generation computer chip that GlobalFoundries is making at its Fab 8 factory in Malta for Advanced Micro Devices is generating significant hype in the semiconductor industry for its performance against chip giant Intel. The buzz over AMD's new "Zen" processor, which reportedly performs slightly faster than Intel's top chip, helped lift AMD's stock price last Friday by 10 percent. But it also demonstrates that Fab 8, which employs roughly 3,000 people in Saratoga County, has turned the corner in its quest to become a major commercial force in the chip industry after years of work and billions of dollars of spending on manufacturing development, which has included the licensing of 14 nanometer technology from Samsung. "It is our relentless focus on execution that is now allowing our customers to differentiate their products and to bring them to market on time," Fab 8 general manager Thomas Caulfield wrote in a blog post Friday. "Another great example is the latest news from AMD, who recently gave a performance preview of its next-generation 'Zen' processor core." More Information http://www.amd.com/en-us/innovations/software-technologies/zen-cpu Caulfield was referring to an event that AMD CEO Lisa Su held last Thursday at the St. Regis hotel in San Francisco to demonstrate the performance of the company's new Zen chip against the Broadwell-E, Intel's top central processor. Video of the head-to-head test, along with reports of the event by tech journalists, show that the Zen chip was slightly faster than the Broadwell-E. The event was held just a block away from where Intel was holding its annual developer forum. That's a major coup for AMD, which has struggled to gain market share from Intel, the world's largest chip maker and match its processor speeds. Caulfield says that AMD, which spun off its manufacturing in 2009 to create GlobalFoundries, is benefiting from its close relationship with GlobalFoundries. Under the terms of the spin-off, AMD must buy a significant amount of chips from GlobalFoundries each year, a move that was designed to help GlobalFoundries sustain itself as it grew its customer base. "It is the powerful combination of AMD's design expertise and GlobalFoundries' (14 nanometer) technology that allows Zen to deliver a landmark increase in processor performance over previous generations," Caulfield said. It is rare for companies like GlobalFoundries to disclose which customers it serves at its factories, so there has been a lot of speculation about exactly what chips are being made at Fab 8. Some have speculated that Fab 8 hasn't been able to leap past research and development as it has changed direction and its plans for Fab 8 over the years. However, AMD spokesman Drew Prairie told the Times Union on Monday that both AMD's Zen central processing chips and its Polaris graphics processors are being made at Fab 8. Zen is being released next year, and Polaris is rumored to be going into some of the next MacBook Pro models that Apple releases later this year. "Customer traction remains strong across a number of segments, with more than 20 active engagements in the mobility, consumer electronics, and high-performance computing sectors," Caulfield said. lrulison@timesunion.com • 518-454-5504 • @larryrulison Today's Deals Powered by SHOP NOW Play-Doh Kits at Walmart Deals from $3 + pickup at Walmart WalmartPosted 1 hr 26 min ago SHOP NOW Xbox One S 1TB Console Bundle from $300 + free shipping WalmartPosted 1 day 3 hr ago SHOP NOW Walmart Clearance Sale + free shipping w/ $50 WalmartPosted 1 day 4 hr ago SHOP NOW Gap Black Friday Sale: Extra 50% off sitewide + free shipping...

View Latest Posts >>> MI5 blocked arrest of ISIS-supporting radical preacher Choudary for years By Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor on August 22, 2016 …by  Russia Today,  Moscow How many head choppers did Choudary send to ISIS? [ Editor’s Note: My first Press TV Debate show with a major jihdai was with Britain’s Anjem Choudary back on October 21, 2013. I thought I had died and gone to heaven. It was great fun, as was hearing about his recent conviction for supporting the Islamic State. I will shed no tears for his conviction for aiding and abetting IS, but the big story in all this is why was he allowed to funnel large numbers of British jihadis into their ranks so MI-5 could gather Intel… on what at that cost? What Intel could that be for allowing such a large “aiding and abetting” operation to go on, the classic “the cure is worse then the disease”? Cutting off the head of a snake usually produces quick and positive results. His underlings would fill in behind him, providing a new stream of jihadi recruiters to monitor, so it’s not like Choudary’s arrest would have caused lay offs at MI-5. Missing in the equation is the carnage that those Choudary-facilitated ISIS (their name in 2013) recruits inflicted on the Syrian people. Or was it because they were fighting Assad, and that was considered a good use of British Jihadis, including getting some of them killed. But what about the hard core veterans who return to Britain? Where did that future threat weigh in on the equation? One thing you can be sure of, MI-5 will never tell you. One of the major things Top Secret is used for is hiding major screw ups to protect the reputations of those making them and their post government employment opportunities… Jim W. Dean ] ____________ “Bye, bye Anjem, so long and good riddance.”  ~ Jim W. Dean – First published  …  August  21, 2016 – The cops were watching Choudary, but were they using him as a magnet? Counterterrorism officers were repeatedly blocked by British security service MI5 from pursuing criminal investigations against Britain’s highest-profile radical preacher, Anjem Choudary, it has been claimed. Last week, Choudary was found guilty of supporting Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS, ISIL), which seized territory in Iraq and Syria and inspired terrorist attacks across Europe. Following his conviction, it was revealed that the 49-year-old former lawyer had been linked to at least 15 terrorist plots since 2001. Police also believe he has connections to as many as 500 of the 850 young British Muslims who have traveled abroad to join IS. According to the Telegraph, counter-terrorism officers often felt they had enough evidence to build a case against the cleric, only to be told to hang fire by MI5 because he was crucial to one of their ongoing investigations. The situation led to a build-up of tension between the two sides, with police feeling “frustrated” that Choudary was not being brought to justice, a source told the newspaper. He was eventually prosecuted after swearing an oath of allegiance to IS and posting YouTube videos in which he praised the group. One counterterrorism source says the decision not to prosecute him earlier came from MI5. “I am gobsmacked that we allowed him to carry on as long as he did. He was up to his neck in it, but the police can’t do full investigations on people if the security service say they are working on a really big job, because they have the priority,” he told the Telegraph. “That is what they did constantly. While the police might have had lots of evidence, they were pulled back by the security service because he [Choudary] was one of the people they were monitoring. “It was very frustrating and did cause some tension, but we were told we had to consider the bigger picture.” Security expert Will Geddes said while police and security services had a good record of working together, there was often a difficult balance to strike between prosecuting evidence and gathering intelligence. “Whilst the cops always want the collars the spooks want the information and it is a challenge getting the right balance. “Choudary was certainly clever and knew where the line was, and that was part of the reason it took so long to get him. But it was certainly possible that MI5 wanted to continue to monitor him because he was the focal point of so much,” Geddes told the Telegraph. “Given how influential he was in terms of setting up the forums for those guys to get inspired, it made perfect sense for the intelligence agencies to say ‘we haven’t exhausted this yet.’ “In the end though he got caught because he believed his press too much and he got carried away by his own media profile.” Choudary faces up to 10 years in prison when he is sentenced on September 6. ____________   Related Posts: MI5 ‘blocked’ arrest of ISIS-supporting radical preacher Choudary ‘for years’ US now “ISIS’s Air Force” – false flags hit NYC, Jersey Israel major player in Syria destruction: Analyst NEO – Will a Kurdish State be Born Under the Guise of Fighting ISIL?

Helping terrorism. And it has been Britains strategy for a century to strengthen radical backward islam. Primarily to use against the arabs themselves to prevent nationalism, secularism, progressive panarabic movements. But also over all these years Russia has been the intended target.

If I ran Syrian MI, I’d have sent someone to kill him. Really, what is wrong with these Syrians? It can’t just be that Assad is a softie. They knew perfectly well what Choudhary was up to. Blind Freddy knew. The stinking Khazars would have had a kidon on him in an eye-blink. Christ. Log in to Reply wjabbe  August 22, 2016 at 7:51 pm Does not government secrecy, imposed by the full military force and power of government, defeat every basic principle of humane treatment of people and all the basic rights provided to them in our Constitution and Bill of Rights? Do we want a Hillary Clinton or Obama secretly ordering the murder of people in secret, as our representatives? Does not this simply reduce us back to the dark ages of “an eye for an eye” or “the ends justifies the means” days? Have we not risen above all that after all the efforts of the Founders and blood spilled by good American soldiers defending these basic principles all over this planet? I will take the risks for truth over secrecy any day. Secrecy is the antithesis of truth. Secrecy prevents the truth from being known and exposed as in the Sandy Hook Hoax for example.

Dean, Managing Editor  August 22, 2016 at 9:27 pm Often staff changes are the cause. When Emadi had the website added to his news room responsibilities one of the first things he did was kill the Viewpoints commentary section which we had helped build up during the worst of the media sanctions times from nothing over two years with a huge readership. They never gave a reason. He got fired for sexual indiscretions where the lady had taped his phone calls. So things have changed with new people in charge.

Which chipmaker can deliver better long-term growth at current prices? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Aug 22, 2016 at 9:11PM AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have been fierce rivals in the CPU market over the past few decades. Back in 2006, AMD conquered nearly half the PC market with its low-cost chips, according to PassMark Software. But over the past decade, AMD's chips fell far behind Intel's in terms of performance and power efficiency. Last quarter, AMD controlled just 18% of the market while Intel controlled 82%. Image source: Pixabay. AMD's big mistake was waging two separate wars -- one in CPUs against Intel, and another in GPUs against Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Both rivals had deeper pockets, enabling them to launch CPUs and GPUs which eventually outperformed AMD's. AMD stuck to the low-end CPU and GPU markets, merged CPUs and GPUs together in its APU chipsets, and diversified into embedded chips for gaming consoles, ARM-based processors for data centers, and other markets. Intel dominated the PC and data center markets, but it gradually ran out of room to grow. Global demand for PCs started falling, due to longer upgrade cycles and the rise of smartphones and tablets. Intel paid billions in subsidies to convince smartphone makers to use its Atom chips, yet it didn't gain any ground against ARM-based leader Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). Demand for Intel's data center chips also sputtered due to weaker enterprise spending and aggressive competition from rivals like IBM. Intel has diversified into new markets like the Internet of Things (IoT) and non-volatile memory, but these businesses remain small and competition remains fierce. How fast are AMD and Intel growing? The past decade was disastrous for AMD, with its annual revenues dropping from $5.85 billion in 2005 to $3.99 billion in 2015. During that same period, Intel's annual revenue surged 43%. As a result, AMD stock tumbled nearly 70% over the past decade, while Intel stock has more than doubled. However, past performance doesn't guarantee future returns. Last quarter, AMD's revenue rose 9% annually to $1.03 billion, beating estimates by about $75 million and representing its first quarter of year-over-year growth in two full years. AMD expects revenue for the current quarter to rise 18% annually, and analysts believe that it can post 3% sales growth this year and 6% sales growth next year. Most of that growth will be driven by its EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, Semi-Custom) business, which supplies APUs for the PS4 and Xbox One, as well as the GPU for the Wii U. Sony and Microsoft's PS4 Neo, Xbox One S, and Xbox Scorpio hardware upgrades should continue supporting the unit's growth. Image source: Company websites. Intel's revenue rose just 2% annually to $13.5 billion last quarter, missing estimates by $40 million. Weak PC sales caused its Client Computing revenue to fall 3%, and data center revenue rose just 5% -- much lower than the 15% annual growth rate Intel previously targeted. Intel expects sales for the current quarter to rise another 3%, while analysts see its full-year revenue improving 4% for both fiscal 2016 and 2017. How profitable are Intel and AMD? AMD posted a GAAP net profit of $69 million last quarter, which was a massive improvement from its loss of $181 million in the prior year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes gains from a Chinese joint venture, its net loss narrowed from $131 million to $40 million, or $0.05 per share -- exceeding expectations by three cents. Analysts expect AMD's non-GAAP earnings to rise 61% this year and grow at an average annual rate of 49% over the next five years. Intel's GAAP net income fell 51% to $1.3 billion last quarter due to some big acquisition-related charges. On a non-GAAP basis, net income slipped 6% to $2.9 billion, or $0.59 per share, but still beat estimates by six cents. However, much of that beat can be attributed to the $804 million Intel spent on stock buybacks during the quarter and thousands of job cuts. Analysts expect Intel's non-GAAP earnings to improve 7% this year and rise at an average rate of 5% over the next five years. What do the valuations tell us? It's tough to do an "apples-to-apples" comparison between Intel and AMD's valuations, since the former has been consistently profitable while the latter has a negative P/E due to quarters of losses. However, AMD now trades at just 1.6 times sales, which is much lower than Intel's P/S ratio of 2.9 and the semiconductor industry average of 2.9. AMD's better growth numbers and its lower P/S ratio indicate that it's a better buy than Intel at current prices. However, AMD can only keep growing if console sales keep rising, its GPUs can counter Nvidia's aggressively priced Pascal lineup, and the Zen CPUs dent Intel's PC market. If AMD misses those targets, it could quickly give up its gains, so it's still a much more speculative play than Intel -- which remains a decent income-generating stalwart for conservative investors.

Samsung's semiconductor sales rose 11 percent on quarter to $10.3 billion for the second quarter, while Intel's sales fell 1 percent to $12.9 billion for the same quarter, the data compiled by IC Insights showed. In the first quarter, Intel reported $13.1 billion in sales of semiconductors and Samsung posted $9.3 billion, according to the data. Hit by slumping prices of DRAM chips, widely used in personal computers, Samsung's semiconductor sales had been on a decline. However, a rebound came in the second quarter, thanks to strong sales of NAND memory chips for smartphones and other portable devices Samsung has been also narrowing an annual market-share gap with Intel. The market-share gap between Samsung and Intel stood at 5.3 percentage points in 2012, 4.2 percentage points in 2013, 3.4 percentage points in 2014 and 3.2 percentage points in 2015. Meanwhile, SK hynix Inc. was ranked sixth, with its sales of semiconductors at $6.4 billion for the first half of the year, the data showed.

News & Analysis ARM Reaches for Supercomputers Rick Merritt 8/22/2016 03:00 PM EDT 1 Comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet CUPERTINO, Calif. – ARM has developed vector instructions to propel its 64-bit V8 architecture into high-performance computing. Fujitsu helped develop the extensions for use in a follow on to its K Computer, a Sparc-based system at Japan’s Riken Institute that hit 8 petaflops in 2011 making it the most powerful system in the world at that time. The effort catapults the ARM processor core for the first time into the realm of supercomputers, a rarified territory Intel’s x86 has come to dominate. ARM hopes it can expand its presence there the way Intel did, slowly replacing homegrown processors from the likes of IBM and Cray. ARM’s strength is in its potential for relative power efficiency compared to the x86. The trait could serve supercomputer designers who can’t practically deliver the massive power to drive the exascale-class systems they want to build. The current Neon SIMD instructions ARM supports are limited to 128 bits focused on use imaging and video in client systems. Its scalable vector extensions (SVE) supports 128 to 2,048 bit lengths in increments of 128 bits. Users can write vector code once and run it on any size vector design without recompilation, something it claims no other architecture can do. SVE is a new set of instructions aiming at scientific workloads not DSP-based media acceleration. Fujitsu said it hopes to use them deliver by 2020 a post-K Computer with 50x the capability and 15x the efficiency of the previous system. SVE is a load/store architecture that uses up to 32 vector registers and 16 predicate registers plus control registers and a first-fault register. Predicates are used to manage a variety of decisions about control loops. ARM left room in its programming space for future extensions to SVE. The SVE specification, being developed with numerous partners, will be available by early next year. ARM is just starting work on how it will make open source Linux patches for the extensions. ARM showed significant scaling benefits with different vector lengths on SVE. Results are simulations based on compiled code with varied length of vectors. (Images: ARM) Click here for larger image All ARMs 64-bit licensees have access to the SVE technology. ARM had multiple partners involved in developing it but would not release any other names, Nigel Stephens, an ARM fellow and lead architect said after a talk at the Hot Chips event here. For Fujitsu the collaboration was an opportunity to forge a partnership at the start of ARMs push into high-performance systems. Sparc remains the preferred architecture for the companys business servers, however Fujitsu sees an opportunity for a new class of technical and scientific systems based on ARM chips, said Toshio Yoshida, lead architect for the processor in Fujitsus post-K computer targeting exaflop performance in 2020. The Fujitsu system will use a 512-bit SIMD vector unit with a version of its Tofu interconnect and other accelerator cores for I/O, Yoshida said. He would not comment on what leading edge process node the chip currently targets. Fujitsu chose the 512-bit vector length because it adequately doubled the 256-bit SIMD of its prior Sparc-based system. "We want to step slowly into this area," said Yoshida. SVE fits in 28-bit encoding region and is only available on 64-bit ARM cores. — Rick Merritt, Silicon Valley Bureau Chief, EE Times Related posts: China Tops U.S. in Supercomputers Google Preps for IBM, ARM Shift Intel Grabs ARM for 10nm Foundry China takes fastest supercomputer crown Email This Print Comment More Related Links Macom Buys Applied for Comms Intels Nervana Attacks GPUs Virtual Reality Will Stay Hot Samsung Makes 10nm Qcomm SoC Taming erratic cellular latency with "extreme asynchronous" IoT firmware design Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] User Rank Author Efficiency tb100   8/23/2016 6:07:15 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate This is very interesting. I remember when IBM had the top speed supercomputer BlueGene, which they built with their low-end PowerPC processor (440 or something like that). It was a low-end chip, but it was extremely power-efficient (MIPS/Watt), so they could pack a lot of them into a small area and ended up with more processing power than computers designed with high-end, power-hungry chips. If this ARM is as efficient as they say, it could be used in a similar way to build a power-house supercomputer.

Read more about the stories in today's news: Next Apple Watch Won't Have LTE Due to Battery Life Issues: Report Intel Ready to Ship Silicon Photonics Modules This Year Twitter to Extend Protective Controls to All Users CNN to Gather News Using Drones, Sets Up UAS Unit       Today's topics include Apple's decision not to include LTE as a feature in its next Apple Watch, Intel's announcement that it has begun shipping the first of its photonics modules, Twitter's plan to extend its protective features to prevent cyber-bullying and CNN launches its drone program after setting up an unmanned aircraft systems unit. Apple's next Apple Watch will still have to be used alongside an Apple iPhone because a desired feature—built-in LTE cellular service—is not delivering adequate battery life in the smartwatch in testing. As a result, users desiring LTE service will have to wait for a later version of the Apple Watch. Mobile carriers have been urging Apple to update the Apple Watch so it can work with LTE on its own, without an iPhone, for some time. LTE service would allow the device to access sports score alerts, email and mapping information for users without having to connect with an iPhone. Intel officials are ready to bring silicon photonics—in development for 16 years—to market. At the Intel Developer Forum last week, Diane Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of the company's Data Center Group, announced that the chip maker has begun shipping silicon photonics modules, the first products in an expected portfolio that officials have said will help meet the growing demand from cloud service providers for more network bandwidth, better scalability and faster connectivity. Silicon photonics refers to the use of pulses of light rather than electrical signals over copper wires to move large amounts of data at high speeds and over long distances. The first silicon photonics-based components will enable the transfer of data at 100 gigabits per second over distances of 2km or more, and will come in a pluggable model and an embedded form factor. Twitter, which continues to struggle to find a balance between supporting free speech and empowering bullies and harassment, is planning to introduce new features that will give users control over what they see and whom they interact with, the company announced Aug. 18. In "the coming days," Twitter plans to extend Notifications and a Quality Filter to all users—features that currently are only available to "verified" account holders, which are designated with a blue checkmark icon. As of Aug. 18, users have the ability to limit notifications to only people they follow on mobile and Twitter.com. Users can tap the Settings icon and then select Notifications. CNN will now use unmanned aerial drones to help it gather news in a wide range of situations as part of the company's newly created CNN Aerial Imagery and Reporting unit. The news broadcasting company unveiled the CNN AIR efforts in an Aug. 18 announcement that also revealed that CNN has hired two full-time drone operators to fly the devices. "For the first time in the company's history, CNN will have a designated unmanned aircraft systems unit … to fully integrate aerial imagery and reporting across all CNN networks and platforms, along with Turner Broadcasting and Time Warner entities," the company said in a statement. CNN has been working with the Federal Aviation Administration since 2015 on research to safely use drones for newsgathering, according to the company.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

By Brooke Crothers Published August 22, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook0 Twitter0 livefyre Email Print HP Chromebook 13 G1  (Hewlett-Packard) Hewlett-Packard’s Chromebook 13 is the best evidence yet that the Chromebook is here to stay. Built around Google’s Chrome operating system (OS), Chromebooks are inexpensive laptops that are beginning to challenge the hegemony of Windows and the Mac. In brief: the Chromebook, for many, can be your only laptop. I can say that with authority because I’m very attached to Windows and Mac machines. Despite that, I have been happily using HP’s Chromebook 13 exclusively for a couple of weeks. Chromebooks are powerful if you give them time Jumping to another operating environment is always jarring. There’s no way to avoid the initial gotchas, pitfalls, and frustration. Chrome OS is no different. The flip side is, it can also open your eyes to a better way of doing things. And Chrome OS could be a better way for lots of consumers looking for an inexpensive platform that is essentially self-repairing, secure, extremely fast, and where all future operating systems are ultimately headed. Chrome OS is based on Google’s popular Chrome browser. So, if you’ve spent time in the Chrome browser, you’ll have a pretty good idea of what to expect. Chrome OS is presented as a “desktop” -- just like Windows or Mac -- with icons and a settings bar (the latter analogous to the Control Panel in Windows or System Preferences in OS X). But everything takes place in the browser. That gives you access to Google’s excellent office suite, its Pixlr image editor, Google Photos, the Chrome Web Store, Play Music, Play Movies, Google Hangouts, and lots more. The HP Chromebook 13 G1 The Chromebook 13 G1 is HP’s 2016 high-end Chromebook, starting at $499. Believe or not, that’s pricey for a Chromebook, which often sell in the $199 to $399 range. For $499 you get a lot, though. For starters, HP includes a 13.3-inch 3,200-by-1800 “QHD+” display. When HP announced the Chromebook 13 G1, I had to do a double-take on the display specs. In short, you won't find a 2016 Windows PC or Mac with that kind of display for anything close to $499. Other specs for the $499 model include an Intel Pentium 4405Y (1.5GHz) processor, 4GB RAM, and 32GB of storage. While the processor, RAM, and storage specs may seem meager, they’re not. That’s the beauty of a Chromebook— you don’t need a fast processor or a large hard drive. The new 2016 Chromebooks with Intel’s lower-end 6th Generation Pentium or Core M processors are fast. And because the storage takes place in the cloud, 32GB is adequate. Other notable HP Chromebook 13 specs include a 2.84 pound weight (but it feels lighter because of the good weight distribution), a 0.5-inch thickness (laptops don’t get much thinner than that), and a sturdy aluminum chassis. Related: Is the iPad Pro the future of laptops? Apple thinks so Discounts abound as Apple's laptops show their age The best laptops to buy this summer The HP Chromebook 13 I’m using goes for just over $800. That extra cost is mostly pegged to the faster Intel 6th Generation M5 processor and 8GB of RAM in my model (instead of 4GB). Battery life is good. I found the 3-cell, 45Wh battery delivered a long time between charges. What most reviews (which found battery life lacking) miss is that a laptop with a very-high-resolution display, like HP’s Chromebook 13, is never going to last long between charges without a really big battery. But I got more than seven hours doing lots of productivity work, watching a short movie, and the usual social media and Web browsing. All in all, the HP Chromebook 13 is a high-quality laptop that delivers a lot of bang for the buck and presages a bright future the Chrome OS. Caveats The following caveats don’t apply to HP’s Chromebook specifically, but to any Chromebook. If you’re wedded to Windows and Microsoft Office, the Chromebook probably won’t be a satisfying experience. I’m a heavy Office 365 and OneDrive (Microsoft’s online file hosting service) user. While the Chrome OS gives you access to the online version of Microsoft Office, many of the full Office features are missing. That said, I found that the Google office suite is a powerful replacement and I would be perfectly happy using it full time (as I’ve been doing). Another thing to keep in mind is, you don’t have access to the range of apps available to Windows and Mac users. In my experience with the Chromebook, however, I always found ways to get things done and almost always found a comparable app online. Chrome OS Offline: Whether I’m using Windows, Mac, or Chrome OS, I’m always online (as are most people these days). That said, Chromebooks are designed as cloud devices that rely on being connected to the Web. But Chromebooks are much better at working offline now. For example, when I was writing this review in Google Docs, I turned off the Wi-Fi, and Chrome immediately notified me that all changes were being saved offline.   Finally, the question that always gets asked is, why do I need a Chromebook if I can just run the Chrome browser on my Windows PC or Mac? My response: true, but why not consider a cheap Chromebook that’s fast, secure, manages and updates itself automatically, and has almost none of the clutter and overhead that Windows and macOS have. Besides, the kind of OS that Google is offering is the future of the PC and Mac. Look no further than Apple’s iOS.   Advertisement Trending in Tech 1 Best Black Friday deals on iPhone 7, Galaxy S7, FitBit, and the Apple Watch 2 Apple just patented an iPhone that clips to your clothes 3 Twitter fail: CEO Jack Dorsey accidentally suspended from platform 4 Facebook has reportedly developed News Feed software to suppress posts in China 5 Last-Minute Black Friday TV Sales See all Trends Scitech Connect Subscribe to the daily Geek Sheet for the top science and technology stories.

The British company ARM Holdings, which was recently acquired by the Japanese telecom and Internet company SoftBank, has announced a new kind of chip architecture dedicated to high-performance computing. The new designs use what’s known as vector processing to work with large quantities of data simultaneously, making them well suited to applications such as financial and scientific computing. This isn’t ARM’s first association with supercomputers. Earlier this year, Fujitsu announced that it plans to build a successor to the Project K supercomputer, which is housed at the Riken Advanced Institute for Computational Science, using ARM chips. In fact, it was announced today that the new Post-K machine will be the first to license the newly announced ARM architecture. ARM has built a reputation for building processors known for their energy efficiency. That’s why they’ve proven so popular for mobile devices—they extend battery life in smartphones and tablets. Among the companies that license ARM’s designs are Apple, Qualcomm, and Nvidia. But the company’s energy-efficient chips also create less heat and use less power, which are both desirable attributes in large-scale processing applications such as supercomputers. Intel will be worried by the purchase. The once-dominant chipmaker missed the boat on chips for mobile devices, allowing ARM to dominate the sector. But until recently it’s always been a leading player in the supercomputer arena. Now the world’s fastest supercomputer is built using Chinese-made chips, and clearly ARM plans to give it a run for its money, too. It remains to be seen how successful ARM-powered supercomputers will be, though. The first big test will come when Fujitsu’s Post-K machine is turned on, which is expected in 2020. Intel will be watching carefully the whole way.

Source; AMD Photo: Rulison, Larry Reports: Chip made by GlobalFoundries beats Intel 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Malta A next-generation computer chip that GlobalFoundries is making at its Fab 8 factory in Malta for Advanced Micro Devices is generating significant hype in the semiconductor industry for its performance against chip giant Intel. The buzz over AMD's new "Zen" processor, which reportedly performs slightly faster than Intel's top chip, helped lift AMD's stock price last Friday by 10 percent. But it also demonstrates that Fab 8, which employs roughly 3,000 people in Saratoga County, has turned the corner in its quest to become a major commercial force in the chip industry after years of work and billions of dollars of spending on manufacturing development, which has included the licensing of 14 nanometer technology from Samsung. "It is our relentless focus on execution that is now allowing our customers to differentiate their products and to bring them to market on time," Fab 8 general manager Thomas Caulfield wrote in a blog post Friday. "Another great example is the latest news from AMD, who recently gave a performance preview of its next-generation 'Zen' processor core." More Information http://www.amd.com/en-us/innovations/software-technologies/zen-cpu Caulfield was referring to an event that AMD CEO Lisa Su held last Thursday at the St. Regis hotel in San Francisco to demonstrate the performance of the company's new Zen chip against the Broadwell-E, Intel's top central processor. Video of the head-to-head test, along with reports of the event by tech journalists, show that the Zen chip was slightly faster than the Broadwell-E. The event was held just a block away from where Intel was holding its annual developer forum. That's a major coup for AMD, which has struggled to gain market share from Intel, the world's largest chip maker and match its processor speeds. Caulfield says that AMD, which spun off its manufacturing in 2009 to create GlobalFoundries, is benefiting from its close relationship with GlobalFoundries. Under the terms of the spin-off, AMD must buy a significant amount of chips from GlobalFoundries each year, a move that was designed to help GlobalFoundries sustain itself as it grew its customer base. "It is the powerful combination of AMD's design expertise and GlobalFoundries' (14 nanometer) technology that allows Zen to deliver a landmark increase in processor performance over previous generations," Caulfield said. It is rare for companies like GlobalFoundries to disclose which customers it serves at its factories, so there has been a lot of speculation about exactly what chips are being made at Fab 8. Some have speculated that Fab 8 hasn't been able to leap past research and development as it has changed direction and its plans for Fab 8 over the years. However, AMD spokesman Drew Prairie told the Times Union on Monday that both AMD's Zen central processing chips and its Polaris graphics processors are being made at Fab 8. Zen is being released next year, and Polaris is rumored to be going into some of the next MacBook Pro models that Apple releases later this year.

Fujitsu's PrimeHPC FX10 systems with ARM processors will power Japan's next Post-K supercomputer.  Credit: Fujitsu More like this After conquering the iPhone, chip designer ARM chases supercomputers Fujitsu turns to ARM for Post-K supercomputer See the powerful megachips that will clash at Hot Chips Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles ARM conquered the mobile market starting with Apple's iPhone, and now wants to be in the world's fastest computers. A new ARM chip design being announced on Monday is targeted at supercomputers, a lucrative market in which the company has no presence. ARM's new chip design, which has mobile origins, has extensions and tweaks to boost computing power. The announcement comes a few weeks after Japanese company Softbank said it would buy ARM for a mammoth $32 billion. With the cash, ARM is expected to sharpen its focus on servers and the internet of things. ARM's new chip design will help the company on two fronts. ARM is sending a warning to Intel, IBM and other chip makers that it too can develop fast supercomputing chips. The company will also join a race among countries and chip makers to build the world's fastest computers. The chip design is being detailed at the Hot Chips conference in Cupertino, California, on Monday. Countries like the U.S., Japan and China  want to be the first to reach the exascale computing threshold, in which a supercomputer delivers 1 exaflop of performance (a million trillion calculations per second). Intel, IBM and Nvidia have also been pushing the limits of chip performance to reach that goal. Following Softbank's agreement to buy ARM, it should come as no surprise that the first supercomputer based on the new chip design will be installed in Japan. The Post-K supercomputer will be developed by Fujitsu, which dropped a bombshell in June when it dropped its trusty SPARC architecture in favor of ARM for high-performance computers. Fujitsu aided ARM in the development of the new chip. Post-K will be 50 to 100 times speedier than its predecessor, the K Computer, which is currently the fifth fastest computer in the world. The K Computer delivers 10.5 petaflops of peak performance with the Fujitsu-designed SPARC64 VIIIfx processor. The new ARM processor design will be based on the 64-bit ARM-v8A architecture and have vector processing extensions called Scalable Vector Extension. Vector processors drove early supercomputers, which then shifted over to less expensive IBM RISC chips in the early 1990s, and on to general-purpose x86 processors, which are in most high-performance servers today. In 2013, researchers said less expensive smartphone chips, like the ones from ARM, would ultimately replace x86 processors in supercomputers. But history has turned, and the growing reliance on vector processing is seeing a resurgence with ARM's new chip design and Intel's Xeon Phi supercomputing chip. The power-efficient chip design from ARM could crank up performance while reducing power consumption. Supercomputing speed is growing at a phenomenal rate, but the power consumption isn't coming down as quickly. ARM's chip design will also be part of an influx of alternative chip architectures outside x86 and IBM's Power entering supercomputing. The world's fastest supercomputer called the Sunway TaihuLight has a homegrown ShenWei processor developed by China. It offers peak performance of 125.4 petaflops. ARM has struggled in servers for half a decade now, and the new chip design could give it a better chance of competing against Intel, which dominates data centers. Large server clusters are being built for machine learning, which could use the low-precision calculations provided by a large congregation of ARM chips with vector extensions. ARM servers are already available, but aren't being widely adopted. Dell and Lenovo are testing ARM servers, and said they would ship products when demand grows, which hasn't happened yet. ARM server chip makers are also struggling and hanging on with the hope the market will take off someday. AMD, which once placed its server future on ARM chips, has reverted back to x86 chips as it re-enters servers. Qualcomm is testing its ARM server chip with cloud developers, and won't release a chip until the market is viable. AppliedMicro scored a big win with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which is using the ARM server chips in storage systems. Other ARM server chip makers include Broadcom and Cavium.

The debate is just beginning. August 18th, 2016 - By: Mark LaPedus Chipmakers are currently ramping up 16nm/14nm finFET processes, with 10nm and 7nm just around the corner. The industry also is working on 5nm. TSMC hopes to deliver a 5nm process by 2020. GlobalFoundries, Intel and Samsung are doing R&D for that node. But 5nm technology presents a multitude of unknowns and challenges. For one thing, the exact timing and specs of 5nm remain cloudy. Then, there are several technical and economic roadblocks. And even if 5nm happens, it’s likely that only a few companies will be able to afford it. “My current assumption is that 5nm will happen, but it won’t hit high-volume manufacturing until after 2020,” said Bob Johnson, an analyst at Gartner. “If I were to guess, I’d say 2021 to 2022.” At 5nm, it will cost $500 million or more to design a “reasonably complex SoC,” Johnson said. In comparison, it will cost $271 million to design a 7nm SoC, which is about 9 times the cost for a 28nm planar device, according to Gartner. For those who can afford to migrate to 5nm, there are two main transistor contenders at this node—the finFET and the lateral gate-all-around FET. Gate-all-around (GAA), sometimes called the lateral nanowire FET, is a finFET on its side with a gate wrapped around it. In fact, momentum is building for gate-all-around in the industry. “GAA transistors provide better electrostatics than finFETs, which should allow for some additional gate length scaling,” said Mark Bohr, a senior fellow and director of process architecture and integration at Intel. But the jury is still out on the feasibility of gate-all-around, prompting the industry to consider finFETs at 5nm. Regardless of the architecture, the challenge is to develop 5nm designs that go beyond niche-oriented markets at the high end. Otherwise, the return-on-investment is questionable. “I know there will be a 5nm generation, covering a range of product types,” Bohr said. For now, gate-all-around is generating the most buzz, although this technology presents several challenges in the fab. Making the patterns, gates, nanowires and interconnects are all challenging. In addition, process control could be a nightmare. And, of course, the ability to make gate-all-around FETs in a cost-effective manner is key. To help the industry gain some insights into gate-all-around FETs, Semiconductor Engineering has taken a look at the basic process flow and the challenges with this technology. Additionally, there is a discussion on futuristic devices, such as complementary FETs and vertical nanowires. What is gate-all-around? Today, chipmakers are ramping up finFETs, but not everyone is at the leading edge. In logic, for example, the sweet spot is still at the 40nm and 28nm planar nodes. Many foundries, in fact, have recently “experienced a surge in 28nm business, especially from communication customers,” said Po Wen Yen, chief executive of United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC), during a recent conference call. For example, UMC’s 28nm fab utilization rate is more than 90% in Q3 of 2016, up from around 70% in the previous period, Yen said. The market also is heating up at the high end. Starting at 22nm and 16nm/14nm, chipmakers migrated from planar devices to finFET transistors. The reason is that finFETs help solve the short-channel effects in planar devices. In finFETs, the control of the current is accomplished by wrapping around a gate on each of the three sides of a fin. Eventually, the finFET runs into several issues, though. “Post-7nm, we do see some challenges,” said Kelvin Low, senior director of foundry marketing for Samsung. “We have enjoyed increased Vcc (supply voltage) performance gain every time we scale down the CPP (contacted poly pitch). We think we are at a cliff right now at 7nm CPP dimensions. So something has to be done with different device structures and different stress techniques to address this trend.” Moreover, the copper interconnects—those tiny wiring schemes in devices—are becoming more compact at each node, causing an increase in the resistance-capacitance (RC) delay in chips. “We expect RC delay to go up significantly,” Low said. Generally, though, the finFET can be extended to 5nm, although that may require new channel materials. One idea is to inject silicon germanium (SiGe) for pMOS. “This will allow you to get more performance without having to scale the (fin) height,” said Mike Chudzik, senior director of strategic planning at Applied Materials. “Actually, it doesn’t allow you to scale the gate length. But it enables improved mobility.” But once the fin width reaches around 5nm, the finFET runs out of steam. “You can scale your fin,” Chudzik said. “Then, all of a sudden, you get quantum confinement. Your bandgap goes up as the fins get very, very narrow. And then your threshold voltage shifts up.” That’s why chipmakers are interested in gate-all-around. “(Gate-all- around is) much more complicated than what we’re doing now, but it’s a natural progression of the finFET,” said Dave Hemker, senior vice president and chief technology officer at Lam Research. On the surface, gate-all-around resembles a MOSFET, where a gate is sandwiched between the source and a drain. In addition, gate-all-around also consists of a finFET. But unlike today’s finFETs, where the fins are in a vertical fashion, the finFET is turned on its side in gate-all-around. Gate-all-around FET also incorporates three or more nanowires. The nanowires, which form the channels, are suspended and run from the source to the drain. The dimensions are staggering. For example, IMEC recently demonstrated a gate-all-around FET in which each nanowire is 8nm in diameter. A high-k/metal-gate structure, which controls the flow of the current, fills the gap between the source and drain. Still, the question is clear—Why go to gate-all-around? “Actually, I suggest it’s not particularly better in electrostatics,” Applied’s Chudzik said. “You want to go to gate-all-around because of variability and variability performance.” Others agreed. “It’s not like from finFET to gate-all-around that you get a huge advantage,” said David Fried, chief technology officer at Coventor. “You get a little bit of extra electrostatic control of the transistor.” The big benefit, according to Fried, is the ability is to scale the gate length. “So, you get the full wrap around and a little bit of electrostatic control,” he said. “Gate-all-around also says you will get some gate scaling.” So, which architecture—the finFET or gate-all-around—is superior for 5nm? It’s unclear right now, as each technology has some advantages and disadvantages. Chipmakers face some tough decisions. “There will be two or three or more finFET nodes, and it will really be a question of whether you’re changing the material, or whether you go to horizontal nanowire,” Lam’s Hemker said. “The transistor hasn’t changed, but (the question is) can you get the I^on/I^off with the feature size that you need?” In addition, there are other options on the table at 5nm, such as 2.5D stacked die and 3D devices, among others. EPFL’s conceptual image of a gate-all-around FET. Making gate-all-around There are several ways to make gate-all-around FETs. In one simple flow, a chipmaker first decides on the channel materials for the pFET and nFET structures. The options for pFET are silicon, germanium (Ge) or SiGe. For the nFET, silicon, SiGe, Ge or a III-V material could be used. Ge and III-V have higher mobility properties than silicon, but these exotic materials suffer from defect and reliability issues. So, perhaps a simpler approach is to use silicon and/or SiGe. “Silicon germanium is a more benign material than jumping to germanium and III-V,” said Dan Mocuta, director of logic devices and integration at Imec. Case in point: Imec’s gate-all-around process starts by forming a super-lattice structure on top of a bulk CMOS substrate. Imec’s super-lattice, square-shaped structure consists of a stack of alternating layers of SiGe and silicon. Ideally, a stack would consist of three layers of SiGe and three layers of silicon. Making a (flat) finFET Once the super-lattice stack is developed, the finFET is formed. In gate-all-around, the fin is on its side. Still, the process steps follow a traditional finFET flow. Using traditional doping techniques from an ion implanter, a source and drain are formed on top of the super-lattice square stack. A source is formed on one end of the stack, while the drain is developed on the other end. Following that step, the top of the super-lattice structure is patterned in the form of the letter “H”. Then, after several lithography and etch steps, the structure then resembles the letter “H”. The H-like figure is lying flat. The two tall structures (I I) in the H-like figure at each side represent the source and drain. The middle portion (-) is part of the fin. This process presents some challenges. For the patterning steps, there are two lithographic options today—extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography and 193nm immersion. Both EUV and immersion would also require a multiple patterning scheme at 5nm. Chipmakers could use both technologies at 5nm. Regardless, they want EUV for 7nm and/or 5nm to simplify the patterning steps in the flow. “Without EUV, the mask layers could explode,” Samsung’s Low said. “With EUV, we are talking about less mask layers.” EUV, however, is still not in production amid a number of challenges with the power source, photoresists and the mask infrastructure. Today, ASML is shipping the latest version of its EUV scanner—the NXE:3350B. The 13.5nm wavelength tool has a numerical aperture of 0.33 and a resolution of 16nm half-pitch. ASML also is upgrading the scanner from an 80-watt to a 125-watt source. This, in turn, will boost the throughputs to 85 wafers per hour (wph), up from 55 to 65 wph. In addition, ASML is readying another version of its EUV scanner line—the NXE:3400B. Targeted for 5nm, the NXE:3400B has a 13nm resolution. The company also plans to ship a power source at around 200 watts (or more) by this year or next. But as before, chipmakers want EUV scanners with a 250-watt source to put the technology in mass production. This would enable a throughput of 125 wph. “We still need a lot more work to be done to get the throughput for EUV lithography where we need it to be,” said Harry Levinson, senior fellow and senior director of technology research at GlobalFoundries. In addition, chipmakers also are struggling to obtain EUV resists that enable patterns below 30nm half-pitch. “If we have resist sensitivities of 20 millijoules per centimeter square, we can get close to cost parity with immersion triple patterning,” Levinson said. “Based on the data we’ve seen to date, we don’t think we are going to be able to have sufficiently low line edge roughness with 20 millijoule per centimeter square resists. But perhaps for the 7nm node, 30 millijoules per centimeter square might be possible. That doesn’t bring us to cost parity with immersion triple patterning. But given some of the other advantages with EUV lithography, particularly the cycle time, this still may be a true value proposition and justify the use of EUV lithography at 7nm,” he said. Making nanowires The next step is perhaps the most difficult in gate-all-around—making the nanowires. After the patterning steps, the structure resembles an H-like figure. As stated above, the two tall structures (I I) represent the source and drain. The middle portion (-) is where you make the nanowires. For this step, Imec and others have developed a replacement metal gate process. Initially, the middle portion is a super-lattice structure, which consists of an alternating layer of SiGe and silicon. Using a replacement process, the goal is to remove the SiGe layers in the alternating stack. This, in turn, leaves the silicon layers with a space in between them. Basically, each silicon layer forms the basis of a nanowire. And each nanowire has been strained with SiGe to boost the channel mobility. Ideally, a device would have three separate nanowires. Each nanowire runs in a horizontal direction. And each nanowire is suspended and runs from the source to the drain. Basically, the three nanowires are placed on top of each other (top, middle and bottom). The nanowires are separated by a space and are not touching each other. Typically, chipmakers use an etch tool to remove materials in this gate replacement process. But traditional etchers won’t necessarily work at the required dimensions for gate-all-around. The challenge is to remove the SiGe in the gaps that measure 15 angstroms or less. (One angstrom equals 0.1nm.) The other challenge is to remove the SiGe without disturbing the other parts of the device. For this process, chipmakers would use a next-generation etch technology called atomic layer etch (ALE), which selectively and precisely removes targeted materials at the atomic scale. In theory, ALE can remove the SiGe between the silicon layers without causing damage or leaving residue. “The idea is to remove the silicon germanium selectively to the silicon,” said Matt Cogorno, global product manager at Applied Materials. “So with this selective etch process, you create these nanowires.” There are some challenges, however. “There is a parasitic channel formed under the nanowires. You have to find a way to cut off that leakage through that parasitic channel,” Imec’s Mocuta said. “The way we do that is what we call ground plane doping. We dope the region before we deposit this super-lattice structure. That cuts off the leakage and improves the sub-threshold slope.” Imec’s gate-all around FET with two stacked nanowires. Gates and interconnects Now, the device requires a gate. Using atomic layer deposition (ALD), high-k/metal-gate materials are deposited in the tiny gap between the source and drain. So, in effect, the gate surrounds each of the nanowires. “There are some serious deposition challenges here,” Coventor’s Fried said. “In a finFET, you look down into a gate trench. You see the fin there. You deposit materials everywhere. You have to worry about the sidewalls of the fin a little bit. But you can see where you are depositing.” It’s a different story for gate-all-around. “Now, when I look down, I see these wires. I need to deposit materials all the way around them in places I can’t see. And I need to get a high-quality conformal coating,” Fried said. Others agreed. “You don’t have any line of sight at all. Not only are you coating around the wire, but you have to coat on the underside of the wire. It’s really dependent on chemistries that work perfectly,” said Mohith Verghese, director of global product marketing at ASM International (ASMI). The solution? “We will see a re-emergence of thermal ALD. It’s completely chemistry dependent,” Verghese said. Generally, thermal ALD involves a binary process with two reactants—A and B. The first reactant, A, is pumped into the ALD chamber. The wafer is processed and then the chemistries are purged. Then, the second reactant, B, undergoes the same step. Ultimately, though, the interconnects could be the biggest roadblock at 5nm. To solve the RC delay issues, chipmakers will need new breakthroughs. “It’s a difficult problem,” Lam’s Hemker said. “You will need to attack this problem on all fronts. It’s going to take a comprehensive solution of materials, equipment, integration schemes and device layouts.” What’s next? In R&D, chipmakers are also looking at 3nm and beyond, although it’s unclear if these nodes will ever happen. For 3nm, the industry is exploring horizontal gate-all-around FETs and vertical nanowire FETs. “We’re doing work with some universities on vertical nanowires, too, which are great if you can actually make them and make contacts to them. Now you’ve decoupled transistor performance from the density. You have to shrink them down and make them smaller and smaller, so leakage goes up every generation. This way the leakage is dependent on how tall is the wire, and the packing density is the diameter. So now they’re more independent. You still have to etch these things and fabricate them and there’s a lot of work that has to be done,” Hemker said. In addition, the complementary FET is also generating some buzz. This device resembles a horizontal gate-all-around. One nanowire is an nFET, while the next one is a pFET. And so on. “You isolate these devices and stack them in the third dimension,” Coventor’s Fried said. “That would be a paradigm shift. It’s a complete shift in getting circuit density. That’s really challenging.” Related Stories Will 5nm Happen? 5nm Fab Challenges Tags: 10nm 14nm 5nm 7nm ALD ALE Applied Materials ASMI ASML bandgap contacted poly pitch Coventor EUV finFET GAA Gartner gate-all-around FET GlobalFoundries horizontal nanowire FET IMEC Intel Lam Research Samsung UMC Mark LaPedus   (all posts) Mark LaPedus is Executive Editor for manufacturing at Semiconductor Engineering. memister EUV pellicles can’t handle 250 W at this point AmazighNArif I am more concered about the density.

Manufacture-ability at 5nm is also discussed. In order for 5nm to happen it must be manufacture-able. Depositing such an ultrathin 5nm film uniformly and reliably over 12″ wafers at manufacturing line will be extremely difficult and may not be manufacture-able. If not manufacture-able, that is the end of 5nm. In my opinion the nanowire or gate-all-around(GAA)device that doesn’t have the substrate unlike conventional transistors will not work at any technology node. When electrons and holes are generated at the drain during normal GAA device operation, electron go to the positively biased drain with no harm but where the hole to go? Only place for holes to go is the n+ source because of thin BOX(Burred Oxide) layer below, thus forming a parasitic n+source and p+hole diode, resulting in n+source and p+hole diode leakage current failure. That is the end of GAA device.   Trending Articles Why EUV Is So Difficult One of the most complex technologies ever developed is getting closer to rollout.

  SOFTPEDIA® DESKTOP Windows Games Drivers Mac Linux MOBILE Android APK Phones Tablets WEB Webscripts Web Browsers NEWS Softpedia > News > Security > Virus alerts FLASH SALE: SpyShelter Firewall      30% OFF! Two Free Decrypters Available for WildFire Ransomware GO Intel McAfee & Kaspersky both provide free decryption tools Aug 23, 2016 21:55 GMT  ·  By Catalin Cimpanu  ·  Share:  Intel McAfee and Kaspersky have published two decrypters that can unlock files encrypted during WildFire ransomware infections. Both tools are available for download via the NoMoreRansom website, a collaboration between the two companies, the Dutch police, and the Europol European Cybercrime Centre (EC3). WildFire appeared in the spring and targeted only the Netherlands WildFire is a ransomware that was first spotted in mid-April, under the name GNL and then Zyklon. The ransomware rebranded at the end of May, taking the current WildFire name, which it still uses. During June, and later July, WildFire devs started a series of massive spam floods to distribute their ransomware, mostly targeting users living in the Netherlands. Security researcher MalwareHunterTeam told Softpedia that Wildfire ransomware campaigns continued in the month of August, even if not reported by security vendors as the initial wave of spam. Based on data Softpedia received from MalwareHunterTeam, and from a later OpenDNS analysis, we presumed that Russian developers are behind this new ransomware variant. Dutch police confiscate WildFire C&C servers At the time it was discovered, security researchers said the ransomware wasn't decryptable because it featured a solid encryption scheme. Researchers investigating this threat caught a lucky break when the crooks behind WildFire decided to register custom Dutch domains and host servers in the Netherlands. "By working together with the police on this case, we had something much better in our hands: The botnetpanel code!" said Kaspersky's Jornt van der Wiel. After police confiscated the crooks' servers and gained access to the ransomware's decryption keys, researchers created two free WildFire decrypters. Further, because they had access to the C&C server statistics, security researchers concluded that during the last 31 days, WildFire infected 5,309 computers, with 236 users paying the ransom. WildFire authors made 136 Bitcoin ($79,000). Below is a screenshot of Kaspersky's tool. The decrypter created by Intel McAfee is a command-line utility and might be too advance for non-technical users.

Mobileye and Delphi Automotive announced a partnership to develop fully automated vehicle systems by 2019. The two companies aren’t talking about what many describe as “driver-assisted technology.” Mobileye and Delphi specified that they are planning to have SAE Level 4 and 5 automated driving solutions ready for automakers to install in their vehicles. Related: Updated – Is BMW teaming up with Intel, Mobileye to develop autonomous vehicles? Level 4 autonomy means that even though a human driver is in the vehicle, for most driving modes the on-board system handles all driving, monitoring, and fallback safety tasks, even when the human is not capable. Level 5 doesn’t need a human in the vehicle at all for any driving modes. Related: Delphi hopes to make self-driving taxis a reality in Singapore by 2022 The two companies are going to produce the “Central Sensing Localization and Planning” (CLSP) platform which will be the hardware, software, and system components, in other words, the whole deal for a complete automated driving solution. The CLSP platform will draw from each company’s unique technologies. For Mobileye, known for its computer vision systems, mapping, localization, and machine learning focus, this means its EyeQ 4/5 System on a Chip (SoC) with sensor signal processing for real time mapping and vehicle localization. Delphi’s automated driving software, sensors, and systems integration will bring automated driving algorithms with path and motion-planning, and integrated sensor controllers for a full suite of camera, radar, and Lidar. The joint effort will also develop sensor fusion technology and driving behavior modeling with deep learning so the vehicles will know, learn, and be able to drive safely with other vehicles and with pedestrians in complex urban routes. This is not the first autonomous driving venture for either company. Mobileye systems are part of Tesla’s current Autopilot version, although they will not be used in future versions. Mobileye is also working with BMW, Intel, and other automotive and tech companies. Delphi, in addition to developing 48V mild hybrid systems, is also working on creating a fleet of self-driving taxis in Singapore. The two companies have a history of working together on vehicle safety systems dating back to 2002. Neither Delphi nor Mobileye are in the car manufacturing business — their goal is to develop fully operational autonomous vehicle systems automakers can incorporate. Their new partnership intends to draw from the expertise of each and significantly speed up adoption. Mobileye’s Chairman and Chief Technology Officer Professor Amnon Shashua said, “Our partnership with Delphi will accelerate the time to market and enable customers to adopt Level 4/5 automation without the need for huge capital investments, thereby creating a formidable advantage for them.” Delphi’s President and Chief Executive Officer Kevin Clark added, “This partnership will allow us to give our customers an increased level of automated capabilities faster and more cost effectively. The collective expertise of our two organizations will accelerate the creation of new approaches and capabilities that would likely not have been possible working alone. This is a win-win for both companies and our customers.” The newly formed partnership plans to have a demo ready for both highway and urban driving by next January, to be shown at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, and production-ready systems by 2019.

Minyanville Top Trade Ideas for the Week August 22, 2016: Bonus Idea By Scutify Aug 22, 2016 1:57 pm PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten: Intel, $INTC, was a market leader during the dotcom collapse in 2000. It had a price of over $75 in July 2000 before losing over 80% of its value over the next 28 months. Since that time it has retraced 38.2% of the move down and stalled. The chart below shows that one jump to the 38.2% level but also that the 35.25 price level has been a big road block for 2 years. The last year of that price action has shown consolidation against 35.25 and tightening support, rising in an ascending wedge. A break of the wedge pattern gives a price target to 45.25. The move higher since the end of June establishes a secondary target on a Measured Move to 38.50 along the way. Momentum indicators support more upward price action. The RSI is bullish and rising and the MACD is rising too. And the Bollinger Bands® are open to the upside for a move. Above resistance at 35.25 there is some at 37.90 and then you have to go back to November 1999 to find it at 39.50 and 42. There is very little price history above that but some resistance possible at 45.30 and 61.50. This stock is about to get out of a big log jam. Support lower comes at 34.40 and 33.75 before 32.70. Short interest is low at 1.4% and the company is expected to report earnings next October 18th. Options chains show large open interest this week at the 35 and 35.50 strikes on the call side and at the 34.5 strike on the put side. At September Expiry the 35 call strike has far and away more open interest than any other strike on both sides, with the 35 put strike next. That might hold it in this range for another month or draw it back if it moves in the short run. The October expiry, the first after the next earnings report, shows the biggest open interest at the 35 call strike as well. But there is very large open interest at the 36 and 37 call strikes too. Looking to January 2017 sees the 35 strike largest too but also volume at the 37 and 40 strikes. Intel, Ticker: $INTC Trade Idea 1: Buy the stock on a move over 35.25 with a stop at 33. Trade Idea 2: Buy the stock on a move over 35.25 and add an October 35/32 Put Spread while selling a January 2017 38 Call, 12 cents for the collar. Trade Idea 3: Buy the January 35 Call ($1.97). Trade Idea 4: Buy the January 35/October 37 Call Diagonal ($1.50). Trade Idea 5: Buy the January 35/October 37 Call Diagonal and sell the October 33 Put ($1.05).

After reviewing over 1,000 charts, I have found some good setups for the week. These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad Market Macro picture reviewed Friday which with August Options Expiration in the rear view mirror, sees the equity markets are looking settled and stable, digesting their moves higher. Elsewhere look for Gold to consolidate with an upward bias in its uptrend while Crude Oil continues to pump higher. The US Dollar Index looks to continue lower in its broad consolidation while US Treasuries are biased lower in their short term consolidation. The Shanghai Composite looks to continue higher but Emerging Markets look ready to consolidate or pullback short term in their uptrend. Volatility looks to remain at abnormally low levels keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF's SPY, IWM and QQQ. Their charts suggest more sideways motion in the short term with the possible exception of the IWM which is drifting higher. Longer term, the topping candles suggest a pause or pullback may be in order soon. Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad'em well.

By Keith Townsend | August 23, 2016, 8:25 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/shironosov Linux is a general purpose operating system. This comment may sound like an obvious statement, but it's sometimes easy to forget. Because it's a general operating system, it is used across a variety of use cases. The OS is used in Internet of Things (IoT) devices, smartphones, tablets, servers, and data center appliances. However, it sometimes takes a reminder that using Linux for specialized use cases, such as a network or even network function devices, takes some customization of the kernel or the acceptance that performance may be uneven or limited. The Intel-sponsored open source Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) project hopes to extend the usefulness of Linux to include high-performance networking devices. Linux high-performance networking It's a challenge to achieve high-performance networking inside of the Linux kernel. A dangerous oversimplification would be to say that Linux networking is optimized for general purpose computing. According to this deep dive from CloudFlare, a common conception is that Linux maxes out at 50K packets per second (pps). Pps calculation is a bit different than bits per second (bps). While an interface on a server may have a speed of 10Gbps, it doesn't necessarily correlate to how much data gets processed. See: Intel launches silicon photonics (ZDNet) More about Networking Gartner's 10 big trends that will change how IT operates How to deploy a Samba domain controller in under 10 minutes Real-world server room nightmares Subscribe to TechRepublic's Data Center Trends newsletter In the CloudFlare write-up, the experiment used the minimum Ethernet Frame size of 72 bytes or 576 bits. The author was able to achieve a peak throughput of 1.4Mpps, or about 8Gbps on a 10Gbps link. The challenge is primarily that of processor efficiency. The test worked hard to pin threads to specific processor cores to eliminate wasted cycles. According to the article, a realistic goal using the described process is achieving throughput of 1Mpps sustained. 1Mpps doesn't come close to consuming a 10Gbps link. So, why do we see multiple 10Gbps links, or even 40Gbps links in x86 servers? Bypassing the kernel To utilize processors more efficiently in Linux, developers bypass the Linux kernel and dedicate CPU cores to network processing. The CloudFlare example used Linux kernel tools to pin processes to a set of cores and actively managed memory queues. It took a bit of programming discipline to send unprocessed packets between two systems. Add any packet processing, such as IPS, and the performance should drop significantly. DPDK bypasses the Linux kernel and manages the NIC and CPU assignment directly. On a single Intel processor, it's possible to achieve throughput of up to 80Mpps or roughly 46Gbps using the smallest Ethernet Frames. I want to make sure I caveat the above comment and note that it was an Intel processor. DPDK is an open source project and currently has both Intel and ARM distributions. Enterprise use cases The DPDK is a development kit. The audience is creators of network software and devices. However, these devices make their way to the enterprise. An intriguing use case is hypervisors and network functions virtualization (NFV). It's easy to envision an NFV-based firewall or IPS that leverages DPDK to achieve single instance processing of up to 10Mpps without using specialized hardware. DPDK is yet another enabler for software driving the replacement of dedicated hardware in the data center. X86 and ARM servers continue to supplant dedicated hardware for both traditional storage and network use cases. For a deeper dive on DPDK, I suggest this presentation from a Tech Field Day event.

At a press conference after their meeting, Cazeneuve called for social media operators running encrypted services to cooperate with security services and the police into criminal investigations.  "If such legislation was adopted, this would allow us to impose obligations at the European level on non-cooperative operators," he told a joint conference with his German counterpart in Paris. There is still a huge debate within the EU over mass surveillance — an issue that came to the fore following the revelations by former CIA contractor Edward Snowden of mass surveillance by the US National Security Agency (NSA) and Britain's GCHQ.  Although human rights groups have pushed for only selective, targeted collection of communications data, some countries — such as the UK — are introducing legislation allowing for security services to collect bulk communications data — including telephone records, social media usage and web browsing history — in the fight against terrorism.

This was intended to be a preview of tomorrow's Hot Chips presentation, and we've already covered the juicier parts of the presentation in terms of microarchitecture announcements as well as diving deep into the Server-based Naples implementation and what the motherboards told us from memory and IO support.  You can read both here: AMD Zen Microarchitecture: Dual Schedulers, Micro-op Cache and Memory Hierarchy Revealed AMD Server CPUs and Motherboard Analysis There was one other element to the presentation that requires further discussion and analysis, if only to clean up some of the misinformation already present online and to label what was shown with a long list of potential caveats which most people seem to have passed by almost entirely. As part of the show, AMD compared the performance of their Zen engineering sample to an Intel Broadwell-E processor.  In this test, they told the audience that each system was running eight cores, sixteen threads, and will all cores set to 3 GHz (implying no turbo). Memory arrangements were not disclosed, nor storage: we were told to assume comparable setups.  We were too busy trying to decipher what was on screen (and take note of the results) to actually photograph the benchmark as it happened (there are videos online), but the benchmark they showed was Blender, an open source rendering engine, with a custom multithreaded workload. The test was to render a mockup of a Zen based desktop CPU, with an effective workload of 50 seconds for these chips. I've seen numerous reports about this result saying the difference was 1 or 2 seconds, but with rarely a mention of the benchmark length, which is as important. The overall results were   Blender Time to Render / sec Intel Broadwell-E Core i7-6900K 8C / 16T 3 GHz all-core 49.05 AMD ZEN Engineering Sample 8C / 16T 3 GHz all-core 48.07 (-0.98 sec, 1.998%) All things being equal (we'll get to that in a second), this would suggest that an 8-core AMD has a ~2% advantage over Broadwell-E at the same clock speeds. Despite this result, there are a lot of unverifiable parts to the claim which makes analysis of such a result difficult. I want to go through each of them one by one to ensure everyone understands what was presented.  I'll preface this analysis with two things though: one is that AMD was very careful in what they said at the event, and only said as much as they needed to. Thus is why the string of caveats for this benchmark test is fairly long. But also, AMD has to set expectations here: if they choose an environment and test that represents the peak, or relies on something special, users will feel burned again after Bulldozer. AMD has to temper those expectations but still represent a methodology that is effective to them. By leaving so many cards on the table, this can both be a help or a hindrance. But given the measured and calm, professional nature of the event, as opposed to the wild and wacky AMD events of the past, it was clear (either by design or chance) that the words used said only as much as they needed to. Along with the microarchitecture discussions, it was designed to provide a good stepping stone on to the Hot Chips presentation a few days later. So, caveats. Or disclaimers not readily provided. Let's start at the top.  1) The Results Are Not Externally Verifiable At This Time, As Expected We were told the setups of the systems being used, but were unable to confirm the results manually. This is typically the case with a high level, early look at performance and other companies do this all the time. This being said, it would look bad on reports if it to turns out or someone finds a chasm between pre-launch and launch data, so the aspect of reporting this data without understanding this caveat is fundamental. The basis of publishing scientific papers is repeatability and verification - while this wasn't a scientific presentation, it is important to keep it in the back of your mind when you hear any benchmark numbers (AnandTech included - our numbers are designed to be verifiable and we want to have a history of honesty with our readers, especially when it comes to custom software/workloads we cannot disclose).  2) No Memory or TDP Numbers Were Provided We were able to determine that the AMD-based systems were running 2x8 GB of DDR4-2400, although we did not get a look at Intel's memory arrangement. Similarly, due to the ES nature of the CPU, TDP numbers were also not shared however we did see all the AMD systems use either the AMD Wraith cooler (which is rated at 125W) or the new near silent cooler (95W). That tends to peg the system at a peak power consumption and some of AMD's current competitive parts actually use a cooler designed for the bracket above in TDP (e.g. A10-7860K at 65W uses the 95W cooler, A10-7890K at 95W uses the 125W cooler).  3) Blender Is an Open Source Platform One of the issues of using open source is that the code is editable by everyone and anyone. Any user can adjust the code to optimize for their system and run a test to get a result. That being the case, it can be difficult to accurately determine the code base for this test, and is relatively impossible to determine the code base of Blender that was compiled for this test. Even in the base code, there could be CPU vendor specific optimizations in either the code or compiler that influences how the code manipulates the cache hierarchy with the workload and adjusts appropriately. It also doesn't help that Blender has elements in the code called 'AMD', which relates to a series of internal rendering features not related to the company. Going down the optimization for specific CPU microarchitectures leads on to another more philosophical issue... 4) Did It Actually Measure IPC? (The Philosophical Debate)  In the purest sense, measuring the number of instructions per clock that a set of instructions can perform can determine the efficiency of a design. However, the majority of highly optimized code bases do not have general-purpose code - if it detects a particular microarchitecture it can manipulate threads and loops to take advantage of the code design. How should IPC be measured is the main question: using identical code bases makes it easier to understand but are often non-real-world compiler targets, or highly optimized code to show the best of what the processor can do (which means that IPC performance is limited to that benchmark)? With the results we saw, if the difference of about a second in just under fifty seconds translates into a 2% difference, is it accurate to say that this is a 2% IPC increase, or does it rely on optimized/non-optimized code? Optimizing code, or profiling compilers for specific code targets, is nothing new. In the holistic view, most analysts use SPEC benchmarks for this, as they are well-known code structures, even though most benchmarks are compiler targets - while SPEC is not particularly relevant for the real world workloads, it does give an indication about performance for unknown architectures/microarchitectures. 5) The Workload Is Custom  One of the benefits of software like SPEC, or canned benchmarks like Cinebench, is that anyone (with a license) can pick up the workload and run with it. Those workloads are typically well known, and we can get performance numbers out that have known qualities in their interpretation. With a custom workload, that is not always the case. It comes down to experience - an unknown workload can have a lop-sided implementation of certain branches of code which is unknown when it comes to running the results. This is why rendering one scene in a film can take a vastly different time to another, yet the results for the 'benchmark' are significantly different depending on the architecture (one prefers lighting, another prefers tessellation etc.) Using known or standard workloads over long periods of time can offer insights into the results, whereas new workloads cannot, especially with so few results on offer. 6) It Is Only One Benchmark There is a reason for AMD only showing this benchmark - it's either a best case scenario, or they are pitching their expectations exactly where they want people to think. By using a custom workload on open source software, the result is very specific and cannot be extrapolated in any meaningful way. This is why a typical benchmark suite offers 10-20 tests with different workloads, and even enterprise standard workloads like SPEC come with over a dozen tests in play, to cater for single thread or multi-thread or large cache or memory or pixel pushing bottleneck that may occur. Single benchmarks on their own are very limited in scope as a result. 7) There's Plenty about the Microarchitecture and Chip We Don't Know Yet, e.g. Uncore One of the more difficult elements on a processor is managing cross-core communication, as well as cross-core-cache snooping. This problem is overtly exponential, with the plausibility of more direct connections per core as the numbers go up. Intel has historically used a torus (ring) interconnect between cores to do this, with their large multi-core chips using a dual ring bus with communication points between the two. We suspect AMD is also using a ring bus in a similar methodology, but this has not been discussed at this time. There's also the interconnect fabric between the cores and other parts of the chip, such as the Northbridge/Southbridge or the memory controllers. Depending on the test, the core-to-core communication and the interconnect can have different performance effects on the CPU.  8) Clock Speeds Are Not Final, Efficiency Not Known Performance of a CPU is typically limited by the power draw - there is no point getting a small amount of performance for a large increase in power such that efficiency has decreased. AMD has stated that power consumption and efficiency was a premier goal as this microarchitecture was developed. At the demonstration, we were told that the frequency of the engineering samples was set at 3 GHz for all-core operation. We were told explicitly that these are not the final clock speeds, but it at the very least it puts the lower bound on the highest end processor. In reality, 3 GHz could be a walk in the park for the final retail units, depending on how much difference there is between the chips on display and what people will be able to buy. We are under the impression that the CPUs will have turbo modes involved, and those could be staggered based on the cores being used. But this is why I said that 3 GHz is the lower bound of the high-end processor. We know from these results (assuming point 1 in this list) that the best processor from AMD will do at least 3 GHz. There's no indication of power, and thus there's no indication of efficiency either, which is also another important metric left in the ether. 9) We Will Have to Wait to Test Everyone wants the next technology yesterday, so the 'gimme gimme gimme' feeling of new stuff is always there. AMD has already stated that general availability for Zen and Summit Ridge will be Q1, which puts the launch at four months away at a minimum. At this stage of the game, while AMD is trying to be competitive with Intel, they don't want to generate too much hype and give the game away in case it goes incredibly pear-shaped. There's the added element of the hardware and software being finalized or updated. Since I've been reviewing, no CPU manufacturer has handed out review units four months before launch (in all honesty, we're lucky to get a launch date sample a week in advance these days). In fact we'd have to go back to Nehalem and Conroe to find something that was sampled early; however Conroe just passed its 10th birthday and in that case, Intel knew they were on to a clear winner ahead rather than just 'meeting expectations'. Also, early samples of a great product will mean users will wait for it to come out, which results in revenue loss (the Osborne effect) unless you have zero stock and/or an uncompetitive product that no-one is buying. In this decade, no x86 CPU manufacturer has offered samples this far out. I'd be more than happy for that to change and I would encourage companies to do so, but I understand the reasons why.  Some Final Words Much in the same way that taking an IQ test tells you how good you are at an IQ test, it is typically an indication that you are good/bad at other things as well (most well-engineered IQ tests go through a lot of spatial reasoning, for example). In this circumstance, a CPU performing a Blender test is only as good as a Blender test, but given what we know about the Zen microarchitecture, it is probably also good at other things. Just how good, in what metric and to what extent, is almost impossible to say. AMD has given a glimpse of performance, and they’ve only said as much as they needed to in order to get the message across. However it has been up to the media to understand the reasons why and explain what those caveats are. Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment.

The chip handles a trillion pixel-operations/second in a power budget lower than the 4W Intel Atom-based Cherry Trail SoC that acts as its host processor. The HoloLens processing unit (HPU) fuses input from five cameras, a depth sensor and motion sensor, compacting and sending it to the Intel SoC. It also recognizes gestures and maps environments including multiple rooms. Microsoft described the guts of HoloLens earlier this year, but has not until now publicly detailed its HPU. The company evaluated merchant computer-vision chips including those from Movidius but found none that handled all its algorithms at its performance, latency and power targets. The TSMC 28nm chip packs 24 Tensilica DSP cores and 8 Mbytes cache into a 12x12mm package with 65 million transistors. A GByte of LPDDR3 is included in the HPU’s package. Click here to read more ...

The Cluster is housed at the state-of-the-art Supernap Switch facility in Las Vegas. "The opening up of the CNCF cluster is the single most positive thing in the world of cloud native that I have seen this year," said Fintan Ryan, industry analyst at RedMonk. "We are already seeing the CNCF taking a lead in bringing communities and companies together to work in an open collaborative manner. Ultimately this collaboration will benefit everyone using cloud native technology." Access to the $15 million CNCF Community Cluster, a 1,000 node server deployment of Xeon processor-based Intel servers, allows developers to initiate large-scale integration testing before releases, as well as assess the feasibility and scalability of experimental approaches. To be used by open source projects, this infrastructure can be leveraged to run multiple scalability and performance tests and deploy various software stacks easily and at scale. "If you are developing cloud native open source software and want to ensure that it functions at scale, please apply to run it on the CNCF Community Cluster," said Dan Kohn, executive director of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Multiple projects are using or in the process of applying for use, including CNCF-hosted projects Kubernetes and Prometheus, the Apache Zookeeper project and others. "Deploying applications in a cloud is different than in traditional data centers, from performance levels and monitoring to security and system management, to orchestration and deployment, and resiliency of the physical infrastructure," said Jason Mendenhall, executive vice president of Cloud at Switch. "The CNCF Community Cluster will help open source developers resolve issues on the entire cloud native stack." The application for cluster usage lists the requirements, including: That the code being run is 100% open source, That the testing advance cloud native computing (specifically containerization, orchestration, microservices or some combination), and That the testing involve containerized workloads, if appropriate. "The cluster is designed to provide developers with the opportunity to test applications at larger scales than they could on their own. Ultimately, this will make the move to cloud infrastructure faster and easier for businesses of all sizes, allowing enterprises to benefit from the efficiency and agility of a cloud native architecture," said Jonathan Donaldson, vice president, Data Center Group and general manager, Software Defined Infrastructure at Intel Corporation. About the cluster: The CNCF Community Cluster, operated by Intel for the CNCF community, provides users a staged path to first develop and test on a small scale and then graduate to large-scale testing. It includes the hardware needed to develop, debug and run cloud native software on relevant infrastructure at scale. Users of the cluster will be able to experience the rare value that the cluster represents: size and bare metal. The compute node and storage specs include: Compute Node Spec 2x Intel E5-2680v3 12-core 256GB RAM 2x Intel S3610 400GB SSD 1x Intel P3700 800GB NVMe PCIe SSD 1x QP Intel X710 Storage Node Spec 2x Intel E5-2680v3 12-core 128GB RAM 2x Intel S3610 400GB SSD 10x Intel 2TB NLSAS HDD 1x QP Intel X710 To submit a request to use the CNCF Community cluster, file an issue here.

Facebook Twitter Google RSS Cloud Mobile Social Big Data Bleeding Edge Columns Get McAfee’d Dr. Bitcoin smartworld Future Data City of Paradigm Masthead Send Us a News Tip Select Page ARM sets its sights on supercomputers with new chip design by Mike Wheatley | Aug 22, 2016 | 0 comments Fresh from having conquered the mobile market, U.K.-based microchip designer ARM Holdings Ltd. is now setting its sights on powering the world’s fastest computers. It’s just unveiled a new chip design for supercomputers, an extremely lucrative market where until now, it’s had zero presence. The new design, which is based on ARM’s mobile chips, has some substantial tweaks to provide a significant boost in computing power. ARM’s announcement comes just weeks after the company agreed to be sold to Japanese telecoms giant SoftBank Group Corp. in a massive $32 billion deal. ARM is likely to use some of that cash to further its ambitions in the data center and Internet of Things (IoT) spaces. The company’s latest design, which was unveiled at the Hot Chips conference in Cupertino, California, yesterday, also sends a signal to rivals like Intel, IBM and others that it’s just as capable of developing blazing-fast supercomputing chips as they are. Japan’s Fujitsu Ltd. will build the first supercomputer packing the new chips, called the “Post-K supercomputer,” ARM said. Fujitsu recently said it would be dropping its own SPARC architecture in favor of ARM’s designs, and helped with the design of the new chip. Japan, along with the U.S. and China, is racing to be the first nation to build a supercomputer that delivers 1 exaflop of performance, or one million, trillion calculations per second. Companies including Intel, IBM and NVIDIA Corp. also aspire to the same goal with their own chip designs. The Post-K supercomputer will be the successor to Fujitsu’s K Computer, which is ranked as the fifth fastest computer in the world at present. Post-K will be between 50 and 100 times faster than the latter, which delivers 10.5 petaflops of peak performance using Fujitsu’s SPARC 64 VIIIfx chips. ARM’s new design is based on the company’s 64-bit ARM-v8A architecture, and one of its interesting features is it relies on vector processor extensions to deliver a performance boost, much like the earliest supercomputer chips in the late 1980s and early 1990s did. Vector processors later went out of fashion as supercomputer designers looked to IBM’s more affordable RISC chips in the mid-1990s, before later switching to standard x86 processors. But just like any good fashion trend, history is repeating itself and vector processing is in vogue once again, with new designs like ARM’s and Intel’s Xeon Phi chips both sporting them. RELATED:  New Cray supercomputer offers petaflop computing power in one cabinet ARM believes its new chip design will provide both a performance boost and also consume less power – an important consideration given the phenomenal rate at which supercomputing speeds are growing. ARM isn’t the only upstart looking to disrupt the supercomputing space. China’s Sunway TaihuLight, currently the world’s fastest supercomputer, boasts its own homegrown ShenWei processor, which offers a peak performance of 125.4 petaflops. Perhaps more importantly for ARM, the new design will help give it a leg up in the data center chip market, an arena where its so far struggled to make any inroads against the all-powerful Intel. ARM-based servers have been on the market for some time, but adoption remains low. However, with large server clusters quickly becoming the norm for emerging technologies like machine learning, these could clearly benefit from the low-precision calculations that a large congregation of ARM’s chips could provide.

(NYSE:T) and chipset manufacturer Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) announced its collaboration to develop new software-centric network technologies. This will aid AT&T in optimizing its Network for Functions Virtualization (NFV) capabilities for its AT&T Integrated Cloud (AIC) service. Focus on Ethernet Market As per Vertical System Group Ethernet rankings, AT&T tops the leaderboard in the U.S Ethernet market. Notably, its continuous investment and improvement in this space has enabled the telecom giant to emerge as a pioneer as well as gain a strong foothold in the Ethernet market. Moreover, this collaboration with Intel will allow AT&T to provide new software-based network services and capabilities to its customers faster. The company is planning to run open source software on its hardware resources powered by Intel’s chip to enable virtualized network functions going ahead. Network Virtualization – A New Trend At present, cloud based functions are provided by Ethernet providers such as AT&T through a series of expensive dedicated hardware. Through new software-based network services and capabilities, any service provider can run its network functions on a less expensive hardware. This will allow the Ethernet service providers to provide cloud based functions to their clients at much lesser cost thereby increasing margins in the process. AT&T is targeting in getting 30 percent of its network virtualized by the end of 2016, with a goal of reaching 75 percent by 2020. The Bottom Line AT&T is investing heavily to improve its cloud services and consolidate its position in the Ethernet market. However, the company is likely to face challenges from significant players such as Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR –Analyst Report) which has benefitted a lot from the fiber footprint it gained after its recent merger with Time Warner Cable. Moreover, CenturyLink Inc. (CTL – Analyst Report) too has been escalating its cloud capabilities of late. AT&T INC Price AT&T shares were mostly flat in premarket trading Tuesday at $40.86. T has gained nearly 19% since the start of 2016, more than doubling the S&P 500’s 7% rise in the same period. This article is brought to you courtesy of Zacks Research.

Although it was already revealed that the headset uses an Intel Atom Cherry Trail for its main processor, that isn’t actually the one doing the heavy lifting. Instead, it is the 28 nm “holographic processing unit” or HPU fabricated by TSMC that does most of the sensor processing required to deliver a fluid, real-time AR experience. That HPU is quite remarkable in many ways. It utilizes 24, yes 24, Tensilica DSP cores, or Digital Signal Processing, for taking all the data thrown at it by sensors and processing them. All of that happens on hardware so that it’s super fast, as much as a trillion calculations per second. The HPU custom designed for that kind of processing so that it is actually faster doing it on this kind of processor than passing it on to the Intel x86 CPU. The HPU has 8 MB of SRAM and its own 1 GB of LPDDR3 RAM, separate from than it the Atom CPU’s own 1 GB RAM. The chip draws less than 10 w of power, which is remarkable power sipping considering all the processing that it does. By the time the data reaches the Intel CPU, it has mostly been processed already so that the CPU has less to do. It’s almost like how motion sensor data processing on some smartphones, like the iPhone, are offloaded to a dedicated low-power chip to keep the more power-hungry CPU running as seldom as possible. Microsoft has added custom instructions to the HPU, making it a very customized component. As such, it is far from something that can be easily commoditized. We are, however, still at the earliest days of augmented, really mixed, reality, and hopefully, in the future, such hardware will be more common in order to make AR headsets like the HoloLens also more common.

Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, though he served as a local delegate for Donald Trump and spoke in support of him at the Republican National Convention last month, apparently has "no plans to donate to or raise money for Mr. Trump," at least according to a spokesman reached by the Wall Street Journal. It's a bit of a surprising revelation given Thiel's outspoken support for the candidate so far, and given that he previously gave $2 million to a super PAC supporting Carly Fiorina, but maybe not so surprising given the overall chilly reception Trump's been getting from Silicon Valley overall  including the announcement earlier this month that onetime Republican gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman has decided to support Hillary. Back in June, a Trump event in Atherton at the home of Intel CEO Brian Krzanich got called off after an outcry from within Intel's ranks, though Krzanich insists the event was not going to be a fundraiser but more of a private opportunity for Silicon Valley business leaders to discuss issues important to their industry with the candidate. The event was leaked to the New York Times, and subsequently local Republican donor Trevor Traina  founder of IfOnly.com and son of Dede Wilsey  tells the Journal that other potential donors and fundraisers have been scared off, comparing the media scrutiny to a "witch hunt" and saying the Krzanich case "sent a chill down a number of spines." Thiel always seems to have marched to his own drummer, however, and doesn't have a particular corporation's reputation to protect. So why won't he ponying up any cash to defeat Hillary? It seems to be part of a larger trend across several industries, according to the Journal, including tech and finance, with Wall Street donors unhappy with Republicans embracing a law that would break up big banks. Meanwhile, Trump is heading to the Bay Area next week, with a planned fundraiser in the Napa Valley at an undisclosed location on Monday, August 29. As the Napa Valley Register tells us, tickets for that event start at $5,000. A Trump fundraiser is also planned somewhere in San Francisco, possibly the following day, August 30, though the timing and location of that are so far unconfirmed.

From the Olympic Non-Robbery to Ford Getting Out of Cars, to Evil NSA: A Strange Week By Rob Enderle Aug 22, 2016 10:37 AM PT There were three stories that caught my eye last week that I think deserve some additional discussion. One is the alleged robbery of U.S. Olympians followed by questions of whether it really happened because their phones weren't stolen. There may be a legitimate reason for that, and it's one that suggests a lot of folks will be getting huge cellphone bills next month. Another eye-catching story is that Ford is getting out of the car business. The third is an NSA leak that has me wondering if we should reclassify the NSA as a criminal organization. I'll share some observations on all three and close with my product of the week: a new drone equipped with technology from Intel, which apparently is in the midst of an impressive feeding frenzy. The Real Olympic Robbery: Next Month's Cellphone Bill for Attendees The Brazilian Olympics was a bit of a disaster in the making from the start, but it seemed to be going surprisingly well until last week. That was when four top U.S. swimmers went out to party and then said they had been robbed on the way home. Their story wasn't hard to believe, given that robbery is a common event in Brazil. Anyone traveling there on business tends either to get a bodyguard or a lesson in robbery avoidance (which generally consists of advice to stay in your hotel). However, after the Olympians' robbery report, the Brazilian police questioned whether the swimmers were robbed -- in part because they still had their phones, and phones commonly are stolen. (As I wrote this, the story got more interesting. It turns out these guys actually may have broken a bathroom door and been forced to pay for it.) This story reminded me that if they actually were robbed, there could have been reasons their phones weren't stolen. One is that after a ton of pressure from local and national governments, cellphone makers have been implementing programs that make stolen phones worthless. Many phones now can be bricked remotely if stolen, which removes their value. Second, Brazil's mobile operators have been raising rates so rapidly that cellphones there have become unaffordable in large part. Third, unless you are an idiot, you'll buy a cheap prepaid phone when traveling there, because roaming is wicked expensive. That's something I think a lot of folks not used to traveling are going to discover when they get home. Given how many folks likely were taking and sharing videos and pictures, it wouldn't surprise me if many Olympics attendees have cellphone roaming charges in the thousands of dollars. So there may be a good reason why the phones weren't stolen -- and that reason is tied almost directly to why many folks visiting Brazil will get an unholy surprise when they get their roaming charge bill. So, regardless of whether our now tarnished Olympic champions were robbed, many folks returning home may feel they were robbed when they get their cellphone bills. By the way, it does strike me that more of us should have pointed this out before the Olympics. Sorry... Ford Is Getting Out of the Car Business Ford has announced it will have autonomous cars in five years, and those cars won't allow drivers. This plan is very different from what most car makers are working on. Most are working on a model called "guardian angel," which means driving is optional and the cars will step in when their drivers are in trouble, and save their butts. Granted, this is a tad like the cars on rails that they have at Disneyland, but there is still a driver -- even though they clearly are no longer a critical part. Ford's approach is more like a wheeled elevator. It comes with the announcement that the cars will be targeted at firms like Uber, and that Ford is repositioning itself as a mobile company. (By the way, Uber coincidentally started testing self-driving cars this month, but from Volvo. Oops...) Ford's move seems fair, given that Apple, which is a mobile company, is looking at building vehicles that are basically iPads with wheels. Now the model that Uber is driving envisions most folks using Uber rather than buying their own cars. It's consistent with a millennial trend toward not getting driver's licenses and avoiding the whole car ownership thing altogether. So, effectively, the company that founded mass-produced cars in the U.S. has decided to make a change and become Apple -- but with wheels. I'm sure that will work out swimmingly. I should add that Uber, which launched with the promise that you could work for it and work your own hours is now planning to let you become unemployed instead! Just think of all the free time you'll have to ride in Uber cars -- though paying the fare could be problematic. Is the NSA a Criminal Organization? Now I was lead to believe the "S" in NSA stood for "security," but I think I've been misled. Last week, it became clear it should stand for "stupid." The NSA experienced yet another leak -- this time of tools that use secret flaws in U.S. networking gear in order to compromise networks. Using such tools in most countries, including the U.S., is highly illegal. More importantly, given that pretty much every hostile government has hackers, the agency's secrecy regarding the related flaws in U.S. networking products ensured that every connected business and government entity was exposed to attack. As we move to the new ultra-connected world of the Internet of Things, the kind of exploits that could be mounted could do far more than just shut down the country -- they could cause things like Ford's autonomous driverless cars, and coming pilotless planes, to become guided missiles. So, an organization with "security" in its name effectively puts the nation at risk, leaving in place security holes in the hope it can use them to spy on people illegally. Oh, and be aware, since the NSA started doing this, sales of U.S. networking gear in Asia -- its primary target -- have fallen off sharply, thanks to concerns about the NSA's activities, so it got a two for one. It put the U.S. at risk and did serious damage to the technology industry. We put folks in jail for one hell of a lot less, so maybe we should stop thinking the NSA is on our side and start treating it as an enemy combatant. Wrapping Up Last week was a really strange week with the Olympics in Brazil showcasing why you sure as hell don't want to travel to Brazil, and why, if you do travel there, you want to buy a prepaid cellphone in country. Ford, the founder of the U.S. car industry, effectively announced it was getting out of the car business and somehow moving to compete with Apple. The NSA, an organization supposedly founded to protect the U.S., once again was tied to illegal practices that put the country at high risk. Between you and me, I'm sure as hell glad last week is over! Boy, I really love product names that are a good part of a paragraph -- however, the Yuneec Typhoon H Pro 4K Intel RealSense Collision Avoidance Hexacopter is the first semi-pro drone that uses Intel technology, and it is pretty cool looking. Yuneec Typhoon H Pro 4k Intel RealSense Collision Avoidance Hexacopter You might question why something like this would need a 3D-positioning camera, but I've seen reviews of the version of this product that doesn't have the camera, and it has a nasty habit of catastrophically running into things. That has been a long-term problem with drones, and given that they can cost upward of US$1,000, those crashes are painful to watch -- particularly if it's your drone. Now, I'm a DJI Phantom owner, but the Phantom kind of looks like a toy -- even though, in terms of performance, the latest version the Phantom 5 is considered the best in market. The Yuneec Typhoon H Pro 4K Intel RealSense Collision Avoidance (or YTHP4IRCA -- OK, that doesn't work either) drone looks like a pro product. It uses an integrated controller -- not a cobbled-together solution like the DGI (sorry, I still find that annoying). It has retractable landing gear, and it has six motors (two more than the four that are more common for consumer products). That means it actually can lose propellers and engines, and keep flying, where the typical four-rotor drone would become an expensive hole in the lawn. The only things missing are downward-firing sensors, which would allow it to hover more reliably. I expect those will show up in a future model. This drone is so popular it has been selling out everywhere, even though it costs a whopping $1,899. (However, you can get it with free shipping from Amazon.) Surprisingly there were only two for sale at the Intel Developer Forum, and they sold in seconds. I ordered one on Amazon with free shipping, which means I didn't have to schlep it home. Covered in carbon fiber, this version of the Typhoon will create envy every place it goes. With the RealSense camera, it is less likely to commit drone suicide -- and given that I bought one, it is my product of the week. Now I just have to make sure my well-armed neighbor doesn't shoot it down when I buzz his patio.

View Latest Posts >>> Hacking tools stolen from NSA show Chinese cyberfirms were targeted, experts say By Ian Greenhalgh on August 22, 2016 One victim was Topsec, a Beijing-based company that provides network security for the government and PLA, according to analysts [ Editor’s note: The cyber wars, while far less public than the actual shooting wars, are no less real and sometimes no less damaging to the nation states under attack. We have seen Russia turn to domestic microprocessors and software for their governmental and military computing needs, casting aside Intel, Microsoft and other US companies for the simple reason that they cannot trust US products not to be fatally compromised by so-called ‘back doors’ and other exploits that would threaten the security of the systems they are part of. Now China is following suit, a move which will displease the US for multiple reasons; publicly they will talk about the loss of exports, privately they will be upset that this move will make cyber-espionage a much more difficult proposition... Ian] __________ South China Morning Post Hacking tools stolen from NSA show Chinese cyberfirms were targeted, experts say Hacking tools claimed to be pilfered from the US National Security Agency reveal a ­severe security threat to China, mainland experts say, with a leading national provider of network security said to be among the victims of the government hackers. Some of the data was released online over the weekend by the Shadow Brokers, an anonymous group of hackers which said it took them from the “Equation Group”, an elite espionage team widely believed to be operated by the NSA. An increasing number of security experts have since said the data appeared to be legitimate. Topsec is one of the largest security hardware suppliers in China, as big as Huawei. American cybersecurity firm Risk Based Security studied the release and found one victim was Beijing Topsec Network Security Technology, which provides firewall ­services to government arms, including the tax bureau, as well as the military. An analysis of the data by mainland ­cybersecurity company Rising showed China was at a severe risk. “We can tell for certain now that some attacks have been carried out against China,” Rising senior engineer Tang Wei said. “Topsec has been compromised; they are one of the largest security hardware suppliers in China, as big as Huawei.” Topsec provided internet security services for aspects of national space projects, including the maiden launch of the Long March 7 rocket in June and the docking of the Tiangong-1 space station with the Shenzhou-9 and Shenzhou-8 spacecrafts. Topsec has also provided information security for several international events held in China, such as the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, the 2010 Shanghai Expo and the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen in Zhejiang province last year. China and the US have traded accusations of hacking for years, but in 2013 former American intelligence analyst Edward Snowden revealed details about the extent of the NSA’s global surveillance programmes in 2013. He provided documents that showed the NSA was carrying out extensive hacking of major telecoms providers in China, and the Hong Kong headquarters of Pacnet, which owns a key fibre-optic submarine cable in the region. A year later the US Justice Department charged five officers in the People’s Liberation Army over computer hacking and economic espionage. Since the Snowden incident, China has replaced network components developed by overseas companies such as Cisco Systems to prevent infiltrators from exploiting “back doors”. But the code, which was created in 2010 and updated constantly until 2013, suggested domestic providers could be vulnerable to overseas attacks too, experts said. According to Tang, hackers could target vulnerabilities in firewall equipment and infiltrate internal networks run by commercial organisations or the government without being detected. “Many Chinese security companies, including us, are studying the data to patch up security loopholes. But what worries us most is that the tools have been disclosed,” Tang said. Another security expert, who declined to be named, said that although Topsec might not have the best engineers or technology among mainland cybersecurity companies, they were closest to the government. “In terms of government and military purchases, they are No 1, no doubt, leaving the runner-up nearly a block ­behind,” the source said. In addition to Topsec, three American companies – Cisco, Juniper Networks and Fortinet – were targeted by the Equation Group, according to the analysis by Risk Based Security. Another Chinese firm Shaanxi Networkcloud Information Technology was also targeted, according to a blog post by Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute in California. Networkcloud, located in Shaanxi province, is a distributor for Topsec, according to its website. Both Chinese companies did not ­immediately respond to inquiries by the South China Morning Post. The Shadow Brokers is auctioning the remaining tools to the highest bidder, ­saying that it will release them publicly if it receives 1 million bitcoins, valued at roughly US$568 million. ____________ Related Posts: Yes, the election WAS stolen – so who “sent” Trump?

The analyst added, however, that the 1H16 earnings and “our ongoing field work” indicate that the phase of “indiscriminate budget allocations” may be over. Takeaways Thill mentioned that the group’s earnings and channel checks indicate: While the share in overall IT spending was growth, the growth magnitudes were normalizing Binge buying patterns were rationalizing Vendors who had limited scale were being “squeezed out” for bigger platforms Weaker linearity substantiating large stage of spending cycle and intensifying competition Increase in subscription-oriented consumption of security products, with lower appliance-centric consumption, “with diverging stock performance of appliance-first vs. subscription-first vendors the proofpoint.” Related Link: Cybersecurity Expert Talks DNC Hack, How To Keep Your Email Account Safe Subscription-Based Consumption “Appliance fatigue and appetite for software-first architectures have upended most enterprice IT purchasing and cybersecurity is no longer an exception. While the risk of lower product revs is plapably high, this is likely to be felt across the security category, and which we don’t view as a demand depressant nor a vendor specific issue, but an industry-wide phenomenon for bundled software features,” Thill wrote. Recommendations The analyst recommended sticking to Symantec Corporation (NASDAQ: SYMC), Fortinet Inc (NASDAQ: FTNT) and Palo Alto Networks Inc (NYSE: PANW), while commenting that Secureworks Corp (NASDAQ: SCWX) was a defensive play. He termed FireEye Inc (NASDAQ: FEYE) and Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ: CHKP) as “lukewarm.” Thill considers Symantec as the best 2H16 stock with limited downside, renewed leadership and strategic direction, Fortinet as a favored mid-cap GARP play with potential activist involvement and Palo Alto as a good long-term company, but likely soft Q3 results and tough comps in the near term.

Electronic Products and Technology Canada's Leading Electronics Website Subscribe Digital Edition News Products Features EPTECH Shows More Videos Industry Events Buyers Guide White Papers Digital Edition Advertise Contacts Subscribe Feature Shaping tomorrow’s wearables with today’s sensors and wireless technologies August 22, 2016 by Deryl Kimbro, senior business development manager and Mehul Udani, general manager, connectivity solutions Group, Murata Americas Topics Wireless Tags wearable tech More Features More than 50 years ago, Intel co-founder Gordon Moore predicted that the overall processing power of computers would double every two years into the foreseeable future. Moore’s Law, as it was aptly coined, denoted that the number of transistors per square inch on integrated circuits would also double every year since their invention. Based on that hypothesis, the wearable devices that we are so attached to – literally and figuratively – may have been inevitable. However, the foresight that Moore demonstrated could not have predicted how this technology would end up constructing and defining markets so many decades later. Even 10 years ago, fitness trackers were still in their infancy and represented just a glimpse of things to come. Now many analysts and stakeholders agree – the market has moved from its innovation to adoption stage. That, of course, brings new opportunities and challenges. Miniaturization has always been a constant factor With wearable devices, miniaturization has always been a constant factor, but now lower power consumption is also a leading driver. With lower consumption comes a huge demand for greater battery life. Given that, electronics manufacturers are developing sensors that simultaneously allow a decreased footprint and extended battery life. A critical focus area is on medical applications. With an aging population, many companies are looking towards sensor technology to measure the wellness of elderly care patients – especially remote monitoring functions. Someone’s vital signs, exercise habits, sleep patterns, etc. can be shared with doctors and family members throughout their daily lives at home, and not just from a hospital. From the old to the young, the applications are virtually endless. Consider this: parents can now buy baby socks that monitor an infant’s heart and oxygen rates just as easily as they can a car seat or box of diapers. OEMs are actively using science and technology expertise As more wearable electronics hit the market every day, manufacturers are actively using science and technology expertise and focused R&D efforts to anticipate and meet ever-evolving industry demands. Not only do developers require miniaturized, low-power consuming, highly-reliable building blocks, these solutions also have to deliver advanced connectivity. Enter wireless communications products, design challenges and all. On the connectivity front, Bluetooth Smart 4.0/4.1 technology communicates readily with consumer devices such as cell phones, tablets, laptops or the many other Bluetooth Smart Enabled applications, allowing greater wireless connections to sensors and other devices. Moreover, the rollout of Bluetooth Smart 4.2 increased the need for streamlined functionality and connectivity. Security support is also becoming key due to HIPPA regulations. Further, the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) in June announced that its next release, Bluetooth 5, will launch later this year or early next. The technology promises significantly increased range, speed, and broadcast messaging capacity to truly enable the future wearable market. Wi-Fi with 11ac technology can help medical apps What other technology can drive this? Wi-Fi with 11ac technology can help medical applications that need super high throughputs. 11ac technology brings Ethernet speeds to wireless by enabling highly demanding applications. The next generation of 11ac technology allows high throughput at very low power levels. This feature makes it very well suited for the wearable market, since transmissions happen at a very high speed in a short time but stay in sleep mode otherwise. Over the next several years, the wearable market will be driven by smart wearables such as activity trackers, smartwatches, and smart clothing in applications ranging from industrial, and tourism to, of course, healthcare. Those manufactures that are continually pushing the envelope and actively at the forefront of realizing this connected world, will be poised to carve out a stake in the challenging, dynamic, and fascinating wearables market. http://www.murata.com Print this page Tweet Related Bluetooth Smart Technology preps for 67% growth in wearables Enterprise wearables market to reach $18B Agilent Technologies’ new EXM wireless test set Apple watch spurs wireless charging in wearable tech Have your say: Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

It's a smarter alternative too.  2.bp.blogspot.com CNET reported that Intel architects Brad Saunders and Rahman Ismail at the Intel Developer Forum explained how the USB-C could become a far better port for devices in modern day smartphones. Of course, it accounts for slimmer phones in the future. With digital audio, the software and the device makers could help cheaper earbuds take advantage of the features which were reserved for more expensive headphones like noise cancelling and bass boosting.  shopify.com USB concern There's of course the need for new adapters which will only add to the bill but apart from that, there's also the power issue. A USB connected device drains a lot more power than a regular 3.5 mm port. Which might be the factor that stops consumers from making the change. But Intel has revised specifications for the USB-C to detect if the microphone is in use or not. So when it's not in use, it could be turned off to save battery. The difference could become negligible, Saunders said. Intel Better video quality While it may not be able to compete with the HDMI, the USB-C is capable of high speed data transfers. You could connect your smartphone or computer to a display through USB-C to run videos and apps. Also, it will be able to handle multiple connections at once with the help of a hub. Something that wasn't possible with the 3.5mm jack. There is a demand for the smartphones to be able to accommodate multi-tasking and with the USB-C, the possibilities might be endless.  facebook twitter reddit Comment Here ADVERTISEMENT Follow @indiatimes Next on Indiatimes Lifestyle: Mark Zuckerberg Gives Away $95 Million Worth Of Facebook Shares To Charity Spotlight PARTNER 6 Ways Your Bridesmaid Can Help You Keep Calm On The Big Day PARTNER 7 Things That People Who Are Always Lost In Their Own Thoughts Will Relate To 7 Things That People Who Are Always Lost In Their Own Thoughts Will Relate To Parthiv Patel Set To Make Test Comeback After 8 Years And The News Has Broken The Internet!

Graphics Cards Motherboards Cases/Cooling Processors Chipsets Memory Displays Systems Storage Mobile Networking Username: * Password: * Register | Password Reminder Home 14nm Lpp AMD Exposes Zen CPU Architecture at Hot Chips 28 Author: Josh Walrath Date: August 23, 2016 Subject: Processors Manufacturer: AMD Tagged: 14nm LPP, amd, APU, bulldozer, GLOBALFOUNDRIES, Naples, server, Summit Ridge, vishera, Zen Clean Sheet and New Focus It is no secret that AMD has been struggling for some time.  The company has had success through the years, but it seems that the last decade has been somewhat bleak in terms of competitive advantages.  The company has certainly made an impact in throughout the decades with their 486 products, K6, the original Athlon, and the industry changing Athlon 64.  Since that time we have had a couple of bright spots with the Phenom II being far more competitive than expected, and the introduction of very solid graphics performance in their APUs. Sadly for AMD their investment in the “Bulldozer” architecture was misplaced for where the industry was heading.  While we certainly see far more software support for multi-threaded CPUs, IPC is still extremely important for most workloads.  The original Bulldozer was somewhat rushed to market and was not fully optimized, while the “Piledriver” based Vishera products fixed many of these issues we have not seen the non-APU products updated to the latest Steamroller and Excavator architectures.  The non-APU desktop market has been served for the past four years with 32nm PD-SOI based parts that utilize a rebranded chipset base that has not changed since 2010. Four years ago AMD decided to change course entirely with their desktop and server CPUs.  Instead of evolving the “Bulldozer” style architecture featuring CMT (Core Multi-Threading) they were going to do a clean sheet design that focused on efficiency, IPC, and scalability.  While Bulldozer certainly could scale the thread count fairly effectively, the overall performance targets and clockspeeds needed to compete with Intel were just not feasible considering the challenges of process technology.  AMD brought back Jim Keller to lead this effort, an industry veteran with a huge amount of experience across multiple architectures.  Zen was born.   Hot Chips 28 This year’s Hot Chips is the first deep dive that we have received about the features of the Zen architecture.  Mike Clark is taking us through all of the changes and advances that we can expect with the upcoming Zen products. Zen is a clean sheet design that borrows very little from previous architectures.  This is not to say that concepts that worked well in previous architectures were not revisited and optimized, but the overall floorplan has changed dramatically from what we have seen in the past.  AMD did not stand still with their Bulldozer products, and the latest Excavator core does improve upon the power consumption and performance of the original.  This evolution was simply not enough considering market pressures and Intel’s steady improvement of their core architecture year upon year.  Zen was designed to significantly improve IPC and AMD claims that this product has a whopping 40% increase in IPC (instructions per clock) from the latest Excavator core. AMD also has focused on scaling the Zen architecture from low power envelopes up to server level TDPs.  The company looks to have pushed down the top end power envelope of Zen from the 125+ watts of Bulldozer/Vishera into the more acceptable 95 to 100 watt range.  This also has allowed them to scale Zen down to the 15 to 25 watt TDP levels without sacrificing performance or overall efficiency.  Most architectures have sweet spots where they tend to perform best.  Vishera for example could scale nicely from 95 to 220 watts, but the design did not translate well into sub-65 watt envelopes.  Excavator based “Carrizo” products on the other hand could scale from 15 watts to 65 watts without real problems, but became terribly inefficient above 65 watts with increased clockspeeds.  Zen looks to address these differences by being able to scale from sub-25 watt TDPs up to 95 or 100.  In theory this should allow AMD to simplify their product stack by offering a common architecture across multiple platforms.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending MacBook Pro Nintendo Switch Google Pixel iOS 10.1 PS4 Pro All Black Friday Deals Reviews StormForce Tornado review StormForce Tornado review By Kane Fulton PC & Mac desktops  1440p and Ultra HD gaming for under a grand Shares Recommended Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Verdict If you're looking to dive into 1440p and 4K gaming for under a grand, the StormForce Tornado is an attractive choice. Its Nvidia GTX 1070 GPU brings sublime performance, though you might want to add an SSD for extra speed. For 1440p and 4K gaming power Attractive design Plenty of drive bays Good selection of ports Against Hard disk increases wait times Can't turn blue lighting off There's rarely a better time to buy a new pre-built gaming PC than following the launch of a new generation of graphics cards. Pascal is Nvidia's most interesting GPU architecture in some time, if not ever, representing a true generational leap over its predecessor, Maxwell. 14 Nvidia Pascal laptops to up your mobile game The StormForce Tornado comes with the new GTX 1070, which sits in the middle of the Nvidia's triumvirate of Pascal cards alongside the GTX 1060 and GTX 1080. StormForce has twinned the GPU with components that allow for excellent performance at 1080p and beyond. There's even enough grunt for VR and 4K gaming - though you'll have to dial the settings down a notch or two depending on the game for the latter. It can be pre-ordered online for £899 (around $1,180/AUS$1,540) and is set to be released on September 1. Feel the force It's amazing what a change of color can do for a chassis. Decked in white with black external drive bays, this Tornado Gaming Case is much more attractive than the dour all-black version used by ZooStorm, StormForce's sister brand, for previous builds. If a StormTrooper wanted a rig to match their body armor, this might be it. The case's appearance is made more interesting by a mesh design on the front panel, which lights up two fans blowing cool air out of the front with a blue hue. Unfortunately we couldn't find a way to disable the lighting, which is annoying if you want to leave the machine on overnight. The case has a very plastic feel, but it's practical. Removing two screws provides access to the components inside, in addition to three clips that allow the front panel to be taken off and cleaned. Spec sheet Here is the StormForce Tornado configuration sent to TechRadar for review: CPU: 2.7GHz Intel Core-i5 6400 (3.3GHz using Turbo Boost; dual-core, 6MB cache) Graphics: KFA2 GeForce GTX 1070 Standard Graphics Card (8GB GDDR5 RAM) RAM: 16GB DDR4 (2,400MHz) Storage: 1TB SATA (7,200rpm) Optical drive: Yes Ports: 1 x PS/2 keyboard/mouse port, 2 x USB 3.0 ports (front), 1 x USB 2.0 port (front), 2 x USB 2.0 ports (rear), 4 x USB 3.1 ports (rear), 4 x USB 3.1 ports (rear), 1 x HDMI, 1 x VGA, 1 x DVI-D, 1 x LAN (RJ45), 3 x audio jacks Connectivity: 2 x USB 3.0, 1 x USB 2.0, headphone jack, microphone port (front) Size: 190mm x 495mm x 432mm (W x D x H) Nvidia's bruising GTX 1070 is the headline act here, so it's unsurprising that StormForce has had to hand-pick other components to keep the cost below £1,000/US$1,315/AUS$1,709. Manufactured on the 14-nanometer process, Intel's Core i5-6400 sits slap bang in the middle of the company's range of mainstream processors, and its maximum clock speed of 3.3GHz is more than sufficient for gaming. There's enough space inside for further expansion. Free slots include one PCI-e x 16 slot, three PCI-e, two standard PCI slots and five internal bays. Additionally, two free 5.25-inch internal bays present the option to install multiple SSDs, while two free external bays mean you can add anything from a Blu-Ray drive to a fan controller. Benchmarks Here's how the StormForce Tornado performed in our suite of benchmark tests: 3DMark: Cloud Gate: 48,801; Sky Diver: 48,296; Fire Strike: 17,950 Cinebench CPU: 516 points; Graphics: 162 fps Geekbench: 3,555 (single-core); 10,849 (multi-core) PCMark 8 Home: 4,825 points GTA V: (1080p, Ultra): 70 fps; (1080p, Low): 218 fps The Division: (1080p, Ultra): 78 fps; (1080p, Low): 187 fps Other 1070-equipped systems are currently thin on the ground, but the power over Nvidia's previous-generation card is clear when comparing it the Lenovo Ideacentre Y900 with a GTX 970 that we reviewed earlier this year. And, that system costs a full £100 (around $130 or AUS$170) more. Where Lenovo's machine struggled to hit 60 fps on the games we tested on Ultra settings at 1080p, the StormForce Tornado managed it each and every time, surpassing it in titles such as GTA V, The Division and Doom (2016). In The Division, the 1070 managed an average of 61 fps with the resolution set to 1440p; switching over to Doom, it reached an average of 46 fps at 4K. The gap between the two systems is also shown up in PCMark's Fire Strike benchmark. The Tornado almost doubled the Y900's score of 9,629, achieving 17,950 points. Despite its power, StormForce's machine runs quietly under full load with the fans only kicking in during visually intensive scenarios. Nvidia GTX 1080 versus GTX 1070 The Tornado loses marks when it comes to storage - at least in terms of speed. The 1TB SATA drive inside might take you a while to fill, but it renders longer boot and app loading times than what you would get with an SSD. Plus, Steam games take a noticeably longer time to install than we're used to with this drive. Final verdict It's currently difficult to go far wrong with one of Nvidia's Pascal cards right now. However, StormForce has successfully complemented the StormForce Tornado's GTX 1070 inside with an attractive case that's easily accessible and comes with plenty of ports, external drive bays and internal expansion options. It has the muscle to run pretty much any game comfortably at 1080p with each setting maxed out, and you'll get decent performance at 1440p, too. Gaming at 4K resolution will require you to turn the settings down a notch or two if you want to hit those fluid frame rates, which is a fair trade off in our eyes. The StormForce Tornado is only let down by its persistent blue lightning on the front of the case and the lack of an SSD - but at least there's plenty of room inside the case to add your own.

   Mobileye and Delphi Commit To More-Affordable Self-Driving Car System by Jon LeSage August 23, 2016 Tweet Email Print Go Back Print this page Photo Gallery Sorry there are no photos! Hide Mobileye and Delphi Automotive are working together to launch a more-affordable technology for self-driving cars that the two companies say will be available by the end of the decade. Their technology will rely less on costly Lidar sensors, which are being used in most of the autonomous vehicle test projects, according to a Bloomberg report. Finding an alternative, cost-effective technology will make available self-driving car systems to carmakers that might lack funding for autonomous systems, said Amnon Shashua, chairman and chief technology officer of Israel-based Mobileye. The companies are spending “hundreds of millions of dollars” to develop the system, said Kevin Clark, chief executive officer of U.K.-based Delphi. It will be ready to sell by 2016, he said. “Together, we’re planning to build a new class of machine intelligence capable of mimicking true human driving capabilities,” Amnon Shashua, chairman and chief technology officer of Mobileye, said in a conference call on Tuesday. “Our alliance provides a solution with a much smaller investment to our customers” to deploy fully autonomous cars. SEE ALSO: BMW Reportedly Partnering with Mobileye and Intel on Self-Driving Technology Mobileye, a collision software detection maker, joined up with BMW and Intel in June for a development partnership to produce autonomous vehicle technology. The team has committed to rolling out a self-driving car by 2021. Delphi Automotive has become known in recent years in the auto industry for testing out its own self-driving systems, through the Delphi Drive project. Several other strategic alliances have been announced in recent months, which signifies the advancement of the technology and pressure to be competitive in the new field. Uber Technologies Inc. last week announced a $300 million development deal with Volvo AB. During that time, Ford made a pledge to launch a self-driving car for ride-hailing by 2021. The automaker has jointly invested in tech supplier Velodyne Lidar Inc. with China’s Baidu Inc. Google, which has played a leading role in testing the technology, announced a partnership with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in May to test out 100 self-driving Chryler Pacifica plug-in hybrid minivans. Clark said Delphi and Mobileye will demonstrate their new system early next year at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Road testing will begin in Singapore soon after the first of the year, he said. The system will draw on the two companies’ existing technology, which is “camera and radar-centric,” Shashua said. Using their new system eliminates the need for the “redundant sensor,” he said, referring to Lidar.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search PlayStation Now PC launch confirmed, DualShock USB adapter revealed Eric Abent - Aug 23, 2016 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Earlier in the month, we heard that Sony might be plotting to bring its PlayStation Now service over to Windows. As it turns out, those rumors were true, with Sony confirming the jump to Windows PCs today. The company also revealed a new PS4 DualShock adapter, which will allow players to cut out the USB cord and use their controllers wirelessly with their PCs. There’s no word yet on when PlayStation Now will launch on PC, but Sony says it’ll come to Europe first and then to North America shortly thereafter. For those unacquainted with PlayStation Now, the premise is rather simple, as it allows users to pay a monthly fee of $19.99 (or a quarterly fee of $49.99) to stream PS3 games to their current-gen consoles. Have a look at the recommended PC specs for running PS Now: – Windows 7 (SP1), 8.1 or 10 – 3.5 GHz Intel Core i3 or 3.8 GHz AMD A10 or faster – 300 MB or more; 2 GB or more of RAM – Sound card; USB port At the moment, this is the only way to play PS3 games on anything other than the console they were made for, as the PlayStation 4 doesn’t offer any kind of backwards compatibility. Moving PlayStation Now to Windows will give PC players the opportunity to check out more than 400 PS3 titles, though $20 a month is nothing to stick your nose up at, especially considering that $20 can net you quite a few games depending on when you happen to be browsing PC storefronts like Steam and GOG. Still, for those who missed out on the previous console generation entirely, this will offer a chance to go back and play through some PS3 exclusives for the first time, and that might be worth the subscription cost for a few months at least. As for that DualShock adapter, it’ll be available for $24.99 sometime early next month. It’ll be compatible with both Windows and Mac, and can be used with any PC game that supports PS4 controllers.

Medivation Inc. (MDVN) to Be Acquired by Pfizer for $14B Articles > Market Commentary > Another Multi-Billion Dollar Opportunity for NVIDIA Another Multi-Billion Dollar Opportunity for NVIDIA NVIDIA (NVDA) is aggressively focusing on the deep learning market, as it is projected to grow over $100 billion in yearly revenue by 2024. The company stated that deep learning plays a very significant role in changing computing. At present stage, NVIDIA’s GPUs are used by many companies to create their own machine learning computers. For instance, social media giant, Facebook (FB), uses the company’s Tesla M40 GPUs for its Big Sur machine learning computers. This is a huge growth opportunity for NVIDIA and given its track record of being successful in several markets, I think the company will benefit from it. Moreover, the company has already begun marketing some of its GPUs, such as Tesla P100, mainly to the enterprise market for corporate data centres. As a matter of fact, this is likely to surge because server and cloud-computing tasks are becoming complex day by day. In the case of severe data processing, NVIDIA’s DGX-1 deep learning supercomputer is the most efficient and reliable, as it is approximately five times faster compared to Intel’s Xeon Phi. Apart from this, the company picked TSMC’s 16 nanometer FinFET Plus manufacturing technology to manufacture all of its Pascal architecture based graphics processors, which should include the company’s gaming business over the imminent numerous quarters. Image by janeb13 / Pixabay Furthermore, the company also knocked TSMC’s gate for its next generation Tegra SoC, a major component of its trivial but gradually escalating automotive chip business. However, according to a South Korean newspaper, NVIDIA will tap Samsung to create graphics processors grounded on Pascal architecture before the end of this year. The company does not bring huge volume of chips, but it is still a significant user of TSMC’s superior manufacturing technologies. TSMC’s technology is based on 16 nm, and NVIDIA is focusing on the 14 nm manufacturing process. At present, Samsung and Intel are only two firms that have 14 nm manufacturing process. This clearly suggests it is highly likely that the company’s two upcoming graphics processors could either be built entirely at Samsung or with the help of Samsung as well as TSMC. Conclusion The primary reason why I have always liked NVIDIA is because the company has a diversified revenue stream. The company is successfully gaining traction in several high growth markets and the aforementioned opportunity further boosts its growth prospects. Although the stock is trading at a high valuation, I think investors can still add NVIDIA to their portfolios. Published on Aug 23, 2016 By Prudent Investor Copyrighted 2016.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Nvidia's Drive PX 2 computer for autonomous vehicles has a new Tegra chip codenamed Parker. Credit: Nvidia More like this Nvidia to detail its next-gen Tegra mobile chip in August Nvidia's updated Drive PX 2 computer will drive autonomous cars From cars to supercomputers: Nvidia moves ahead with new chips Video Mingis on Tech: Google rolls out the hardware Buying an autonomous car may be in your future, but make sure it has a capable processor installed so the vehicle doesn't get in trouble with traffic police. Autonomous cars could make timely and more accurate decisions with Nvidia's new Tegra chip code-named Parker. The chip has the computing power to allow autonomous cars to recognize a wide range of signs, objects, signals and lanes. Parker can also deliver 4K video to in-car entertainment systems. Details of the chip were presented for the first time at the Hot Chips conference this week in Cupertino, California. The Parker chip is to vehicles what Intel's Core chip is to PCs. It delivers a lot of computing horsepower to autonomous vehicles, considered a new form of "mobile" computing by chip makers. The announcement also raises questions about whether Nvidia will put Tegra chips in mobile devices and board computers like the Jetson. In a blog entry, Nvidia called Parker a "mobile processor that will power the next generation of autonomous vehicles." Parker, like its predecessor Tegra X1, is designed for low-power and battery operation, according to an Nvidia spokesman. The company didn't immediately share details on other uses for the chip. Nvidia has gotten out of the smartphone market, and the future of Tegra in tablets is in question. Last year's Tegra X1 was used in Google's Pixel C tablet, and Nvidia's outdated Shield Tablet uses the Tegra K1, the predecessor to X1. The Parker chip is already used in Nvidia's Drive PX 2, a computer that sits in car trunks. Drive PX 2 will be used by Volvo in road tests of its XC90 sports utility vehicle next year. Car companies and researchers are also developing autonomous cars with Drive PX 2, Nvidia said. Drive PX 2 does the heavy calculations so autonomous vehicles can do their job, but the computer also needs to consult cloud computing services for training and object recognition. The computer supports deep-learning models from companies like Google, Baidu, Microsoft and Facebook. The Parker chip has been optimized to process data related to a variety of deep-learning models. Parker has four 64-bit Cortex-A57 cores based on the ARM architecture, and two homegrown Denver 2.0 CPU cores. It has security layers to prevent the chip from being hacked, according to slides presented at Hot Chips. Nvidia says Parker outperforms other chips, a claim other ARM-based chipmakers like Qualcomm and Apple may contest. However, its CPUs are quickly going out of fashion. The Cortex-A57 cores are being replaced by ARM's faster and more power-efficient Cortex-A72 cores in chips. Parker's GPU blows away the competition. It has a 256-core GPU based on the latest Pascal graphics architecture, and the performance is important for visual computing. Cameras capture images and then work with the GPU and algorithms to recognize objects, signs, and signals. The chip supports up to 12 cameras. The GPU supports hardware-based encode and decode for 4K video based on the H.265 and VP9 codecs. Nvidia claims it can support playback on three 4K displays at 60 frames per second. Gamers would rejoice if Nvidia decides to release a new Shield tablet with the Parker chip. Parker supports LPDDR4 video and is made using a 16-nanometer manufacturing process.

Published Thu, Aug 18, 2016  |  David Dittman, Editorial Director The technology revolution is a multidisciplinary phenomenon cutting across all dimensions of human experience. We’re talking about advances in biotechnology that will help us identify, understand, manipulate, improve, and control living organisms – including humans. New, “smart” materials, agile manufacturing, and nanotechnology are already changing the way we make devices and expanding their capabilities. Conversations like this will lead to cures for diseases like cancer, the eradication of malnutrition, elimination of pollution, extension of life expectancy, and improvement of quality of life. The continuing proliferation and increasing utility of information is the thread tying this revolution together and driving it forward. Since the first transistor was fabricated in 1947, we’ve witnessed a 1-million-time reduction in the size of what we now call computer chips. The state of the art is Intel Corp.’s (INTC) 22-nanometer, three-dimensional Tri-Gate transistor. Processing speed — or “time integration” — has improved by one million times. So today we’re going to talk about one discrete discipline that’s been left behind… but may soon start to catch up. Compared with what’s happening with information storage, energy storage is basically stuck in the 19th century. Since the lead-acid battery was invented in 1859 — in time to power Civil War telegraph communication between armies in the field and military and civilian leaders in Washington, D.C. — we’ve witnessed “energy integration” of about five times. The first lead-acid batteries provided about 40 watt-hours per kilogram. The latest lithium-ion batteries have improved to about 200. Due largely to its high power-to-weight ratio and its low cost, lead-acid remains the standard for powering things like car batteries, backup supplies in cellphone towers, generators for facilities such as hospitals, and stand-alone power systems. People are starting to pay attention, though, and this quiet corner of the technology revolution is about to get a lot noisier. Or disrupted, if you will. Battery buzz has been building because of portable power. Think of devices such as laptops, digital cameras, and smartphones. Now we’re onto electrified transportation, driven by Elon Musk’s Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) and the proliferation of airborne drones, based on major advances in the amount of energy we can integrate within a given weight or volume. The next frontier is the electric grid. The electric grid takes power from where it’s generated to where it’s used. It integrates generating stations that produce electricity, high-voltage transmission lines that carry it to demand centers, and distribution lines that connect to homes and businesses. It’s been called one of the greatest inventions in human history. And it’s also still rooted in 19th century technology. Let’s set aside for the moment issues such as its vulnerability to terrorists and hackers and the mass chaos that can result from disruption and talk about the integration of new storage technology into the grid. Storage will increase grid stability by reducing incidents such as brownouts and blackouts. And it will also solve the “intermittency” problem and enable the utility-scale use of solar and wind power. We can be more efficient and cleaner. Until very recently, options for the long-term storage of wind and solar power were thought to be limited. Chemical energy storage — converting output to hydrogen via electrolysis for future use in vehicles or fuel cells or to methane for use in the gas grid or for direct heat and power generation — was one option. Tesla’s Musk is a champion of compressed air energy storage (CAES). According to the Energy Storage Association, “In a CAES plant, ambient air is compressed and stored under pressure in an underground cavern. When electricity is required, the pressurized air is heated and expanded in an expansion turbine, driving a generator for power production.” CAES is basically a variation on the technology employed by pumped-hydro plants in terms of application, output, and capacity. Pumped hydro, the largest-capacity form of grid energy storage presently available, has been around since the 1890s. It stores energy that’s pumped from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation. Low-cost, off-peak electric power is used to run the pumps. The stored water is ultimately released through turbines to produce electric power. So what about batteries? Well, No. 2 on the World Economic Forum’s annual list of breakthrough technologies is next-generation batteries that will allow for grid-scale energy storage. Companies such as Altair Nanotechnologies Inc. (ALTI), A123 Systems, and Swiss firm Leclanché are doing fascinating work with lithium-ion technology. According to an Altair press release, “Going beyond lithium-ion, Altair’s lithium-titanate-based battery systems are among the highest-performing and most-scalable, with applications that include battery cells for military artillery, battery packs for hybrid vehicles and energy storage systems for large-scale stationary power services.” A123Systems’ website says its “proprietary nanoscale electrode technology is built on initial developments from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.” Established in 1909, Leclanché develops proprietary lithium-ion technologies and operates its own factory, producing lithium-ion titanate as well as graphite/nickel-manganese-cobalt cells. But the most exciting development for storage technology may be the product of one small Scottsdale, Arizona, startup Fluidic Energy. Fluidic’s proprietary zinc-air battery technology and integrated intelligence may be the battery technology innovation that checks the boxes: higher energy density, lower cost, better safety, and longer life. The company has raised more than $150 million in funding from venture capitalists and government sources, and now has the financial backing of Caterpillar Inc. (CAT). Fluidic, which owns more than 100 patents, now has more than 75,000 batteries in use around the world. According to the company’s website: Comparing lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries to Fluidic’s Zinc-Air Battery is like comparing sprinters to marathon runners. Both perform the same fundamental activity, yet each releases energy very differently, over different periods of time. Zinc-Air Batteries, like a marathon runner, exert a steady flow of energy over a longer period of time. They’re capable of storing large amounts of energy and discharging it nonstop for four, eight, 12, or over 72 hours. Spun out from research at Arizona State University, Fluidic is already providing mini-grid solutions to more than 400,000 residents in 100 remote villages and communities in rural Madagascar. And it recently signed a memorandum of understanding to deploy similar solutions in Indonesia. Today, it’s delivering electricity to 2.7 million people, with a stated goal of serving 100 million by 2025. In addition to its mini-grid systems, Fluidic’s batteries are also in high demand in the telecom industry to power cell towers. They also provide critical backup power for national security, military, first-responder, and emergency road and utility repair crews as well as hospitals. And the zinc-air technology is also grid-enabling, safe for use by commercial and residential customers who want to produce and store their own power. That’s some 21st century stuff right there. Money Quote The electric light has caused me the greatest amount of study and has required the most elaborate experiments… Although I was never myself discouraged or inclined to be hopeless of its success, I cannot say the same for all of my associates… And yet through all of the years of experimenting and research, I never once made a discovery. All my work was deductive… The results I achieved were those of invention — pure and simple. I would construct a theory and work on its lines until I found it untenable. Then it would be discarded at once and another theory evolved. This was the only possible way for me to work out the problem. — Thomas Edison, paraphrased from Edison — The Man and His Work by George S.

Comments (1) Ike Kiefer says: August 22, 2016 at 2:37 pm Batteries were not forgotten by science and innovation. Electricity storage has long been the holy grail of electricity technology and a huge focus of effort and spending. Shrinking electricity is just a much more stubborn problem than shrinking computing power because one is dealing with physical particles and tangible quantities of energy and mass rather than merely manipulating intangible bits of information that have no inherent size. Electricity in batteries or fuel cells or capacitors is stored in the orbital configuration of electrons within different compound molecules, and energy and power density are thus limited by the physics of the atom. With electricity storage, we began at the nano-scale. With bits we began with macroscopic pebbles and abacus beads. Even after all the progress to date in shrinking computer chips and data storage, a single bit is currently represented by more than a million atoms on a hard drive, so there is still much room to shrink them. The only way to stably store energy more densely than atomic electrons is in atomic nucleons, and that is the difference between chemical energy and nuclear energy. Is Wall Street anticipating an imminent nuclear energy storage breakthrough? Are investors ready to fund consumer nuclear energy storage for for homes and automobiles?

Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today Those who are waiting for the release of a MacBook Air 2016 edition might be a little disappointed. This is after rumors claimed that Apple Inc. is not planning to come out with one anytime soon. According to reports, the tech firm is currently focused on working on a new MacBook Pro 2016, which makes it a challenge for them to come out with a new version of the MacBook Air. The speculations about the delay of MacBook Air 2016 is backed by the lack of any major upgrade in the MacBook Air product line during the last few years. The Cupertino-based tech giant only offered several minor improvements on their lightest and slimmest laptop since its launch in 2008. In spring 2015, Apple released several under-the-hood improvements on the MacBook Air. They include the addition of the Intel Broadwell chipset, the Thunderbolt 2 display, as well as the high-definition graphics 6000. Other rumors claimed that Apple Inc. is considering to scrap the MacBook Air product line completely, since a number of industry insiders believed that the ultraportable laptop is actually redundant. On the other hand, those who are planning to purchase a new laptop soon could consider getting the new MacBook Pro. It will reportedly come out with a better graphics card that is ideal for gaming, as well as a better display screen. The rumored new MacBook Pro is also expected to feature Intel Kaby Lake, the Thunderbolt 3 port, an ITB SSD and the USB-C port. It will also be lighter and slimmer compared to the current MacBook Pro as well as the MacBook Air. It could also come out with Apple's latest operating system called the Mac OS Sierra which will feature the introduction of Siri on laptop devices. Apple Inc. is expected to unveil its latest products in the company's major event on Sept. 7.

Resend activation e-mail Cars Technica / All things automotive Delphi, Mobileye unite to bring easy-to-integrate autonomy to car makers Demo car will be displayed at CES this year, production-grade systems ready in 2019. by Megan Geuss - Aug 23, 2016 2:37 pm UTC Login to bookmark Last year, Delphi demoed a self-driving car that drove across the country autonomously. Megan Geuss Today, auto parts supplier Delphi and sensor-maker Mobileye announced a plan to build a fully autonomous car system that auto manufacturers can use to make their cars self-driving without investing a lot of expensive R&D. The companies say the system will be production-ready for OEMs by 2019. On a conference call with Delphi CEO Kevin Clark and Mobileye CTO Amnon Shashua, the two executives estimated that car-buyers would likely see such a system in new cars between late 2019 and 2021. Delphi has been working on building self-driving software for years now—Ars went down to its Silicon Valley garage last spring to see an Audi that Delphi had tricked out with its own autonomous system prior to embarking on a self-driving cross-country road trip. Mobileye, too, has a lot of experience—most recently it announced a partnership with BMW and Intel to build self-driving BMW platforms. It also had a falling out with Tesla earlier this year after a driver was killed when his car struck a left-turning truck while the Tesla was in autonomous mode. Most semi-autonomous systems that you currently find in high-end Audis, Volvos, and Mercedes-Benzes already rely on some combination of software and hardware from third-party auto parts makers like Delphi, Mobileye, or Bosch. The Delphi and Mobileye partnership is not especially novel either, as the two companies have worked together on various projects since 2002. What is new is that the companies said that their new partnership will result in “turn-key” Level 4 and Level 5 systems—or “high” and “full” autonomous systems according to the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)—that can be easily integrated into vehicles of all shapes and sizes. Level 5 automation is the highest level described by the SAE. Still, Clark said that all cars outfitted with a Delphi/Mobileye system will still have steering wheels and pedals so that users can take over if they wish. “Regulators want fewer injuries and fatalities,” Clark said on the press call today, “commuters want less traffic.” A partnership between the two companies, the CEO stressed, would help realize those demands more quickly. A press release from Delphi noted that Mobileye will be contributing its work on the EyeQ 4/5 SoC to process sensor signals and map surroundings. Delphi will be contributing intellectual property pertaining to predictive algorithms as well as Delphi’s suite of software for camera, radar, and lidar information. “In addition, teams from both companies will develop the next generation of sensor fusion technology as well as the next generation human-like ‘driving policy,’” the press release added. On the call, the executives would not elaborate on how much the two companies are investing in this effort, but Clark said it’s in the “hundreds of millions of dollars” range. Shashua said that the partnership on this effort “goes beyond simply combining components” and involves building a system than can not only drive autonomously but is also able to do things like “merge into traffic in a way that mimics human behavior.” The Mobileye executive also deflected questions about Mobile’s recent partnership with BMW and Intel to build a fully autonomous BMW platform called the iNext by 2021. “This partnership is a partnership between suppliers,” Shashua said. “Whatever we do with Delphi would definitely help any other partnership we have. “A project of this scale requires as much innovation as possible… it reduces risk and allows us to accelerate this partnership,” Shashua added. “It does not contradict a partnership between supplier and car manufacturers.” Clark stepped in to add that many car makers may choose to develop autonomous systems independently if they “for whatever reason don’t want a turnkey approach.” The two executives stressed that their combined experience in autonomy gives them “tremendous confidence” in the success of the partnership. The Wall Street Journal pointed out that both Delphi and Mobileye have seen slipping share value in the last 52 weeks due to car sales leveling off and auto manufacturers moving toward developing in-house components. This new product could help the two companies sell high-end systems that would reduce automakers’ investment costs and their risk profiles. As of this morning, Delphi and Mobileye shares are up three percent and seven percent, respectively. Expand full story Reader comments You must login or create an account to comment.

Irritable Cisco kicks Nutanix out of partner program SimpliVity has announced an all-flash hyper-converged system and upped its single system VDI count from 2,000 to 4,000. It has also introduced RapidDR virtualised workload recovery and app-aware SQL Server backups. The CN-5400-F forms the high-end of SimpliVity's otherwise hybrid flash/disk product range: CN-1400 - 3-6TB effective capacity* for SME customers, CN-2400 - 5 - 12TB capavity for mid-range, CN-3400 - 18 - 36TB capacity for mid-range, CN-5400 - 20-40TB capacity for high-end, CN-5400-F - 20-40TB all-flash capacity for high-end. SimpliVity says the CN-5400-F, which uses 14 x 1.6TB Intel DC S3610 SATA 6Gbit/s SSDs, can reduce latency by 50-80 per cent for tier-1 applications such as online transaction processing (OLTP). The system can increase application performance by up to 5X, and can also speed Big Data analytics. The CN-5400-F is also claimed to deliver the lowest price per fully-protected VM. SimpliVity has also doubled the number of desktops supported by a single building block of SimpliVity systems from 2,000 to 4,000. It says this is validated by LoginVSI as more than 2x greater than alternative hyper-converged solutions. The 4,000 desktop building block is based on SimpliVity’s hybrid CN-2400 OmniCube model. The increase in desktop density comes from software improvements in the latest OmniStack version (3.5.2) and also from increasing the scale of the building block in terms of the number of nodes. The numbers are impressive: 1,000 logins in 1,000 seconds and 1,000 desktops provisioned in 70 minutes. There is built-in data protection, high availability, and site-to-site disaster recovery. Customers can choose Lenovo or Cisco hardware platforms, including the all-flash version, for SimpliVity's product range instead of its own OmniCube hardware. RapidDR automates the recovery of virtualised workloads via a pre-configured plan, providing a 70 per cent improvement in RTO compared to following a manual playbook. It's called a one-click facility and has, SimpliVity claims, an intuitive, VM-centric, 5-step GUI. SimpliVity Omnicubes Application-aware SQL Server backups offer built-in data protection at no additional cost, eliminating the cost and complexity, SimpliVity says of third-party backup and replication products. Some 83 per cent of SimpliVity customers run SQL Server, and they can automate SQL Server backup and recovery, improve recovery point objectives and automate the recovery process. SimpliVity's producy strategy VP Jesse St Laurent says the company has a "consistently high Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 90," meaning its customers really do like the products and company. All of these new products and features will become available in the fourth quarter. ® * SimpliVity says its effective capacity numbers are a conservative range based on compression and deduplication rates found in standard, primary storage use cases.

Raspberry Pi VC4 Gallium3D Makes More Progress With NIR, Camera DMA-BUF Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 23 August 2016 at 08:54 AM EDT. 7 Comments Broadcom's Eric Anholt has written another weekly blog post covering improvements he made over the past week to the VC4 open-source graphics driver that's known as being the driver for Raspberry Pi devices. Exciting from last week's work is that he was able to work again on making use of the NIR intermediate representation in the VC4 Gallium3D driver, following Intel leading the charge on NIR in Mesa and Freedreno's interest in NIR too. He commented that now he's made TGSI (Gallium3D's default IR) go away from normal GLSL paths, "I also spent a little bit of time last week finishing off the series to use st/nir in vc4. I managed to get to no regressions, and landed it today. It doesn't eliminate TGSI, but it does mean TGSI is gone from the normal GLSL path." He's also made progress on camera integration via DMA-BUF, testing, and more.

Cheshvan 22, 5777, 11/23/2016   In today's headlines:‏ תג בכותרות MainAll NewsTechnology & HealthIsraeli tech. company to develop automated car by 2019 Israeli tech. company to develop automated car by 2019 Israeli and UK tech companies teamed up to create an automated car to be ready for manufacture in 2019. Contact Editor AFP, 23/08/16 14:22 On the road with new technologies Chen Galili (AFP) - Israeli technology firm Mobileye and UK-based auto-equipment maker Delphi said Tuesday that they were teaming up to develop an autonomous driving system which would be ready for vehicle-makers in 2019. A joint statement by the two companies said that Mobileye's vision and sensor systems would combine with Delphi's automated driving software to create what it called "the market's first turnkey Level 4/5 automated driving solution." The US-based Society of Automotive Engineers defines level 4 as "High Automation" in all but the most adverse driving conditions and level 5 as "Full Automation" "under all roadway and environmental conditions that can be managed by a human driver." Last month, German car maker BMW announced that it was joining forces with Mobileye and US computer chip giant Intel on a self-drive project, also for "highly and fully automated driving" to be commercially available by 2021. There is growing interest in self-driving cars following tests over the past few years by Google and research by several major automakers. But on July 1, US electric car company Tesla announced that a driver was killed in a car crash in Florida in May while using the "autopilot" self-driving mechanism on one of its models. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it had opened a "preliminary evaluation" into the performance of the autopilot function in the wake of the crash. A major study released earlier this month said the looming arrival of self-driving vehicles is likely to vastly reduce traffic fatalities, but also poses difficult moral dilemmas. Scientists said autonomous driving systems will require programmers to develop algorithms to make critical decisions that are based more on ethics than technology, such as whether to sacrifice a driver or passenger rather than pedestrians. Mobileye describes itself as the "global leader in the development of computer vision and machine learning, data analysis, localisation and mapping for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and autonomous driving." Delphi says it is "a world leader in automated driving software, sensors and systems integration."

Chrome sings 'When I'm 64' on Windows Video Mingis on Tech: The MacBook Pro show-and-tell Microsoft yesterday released 64-bit versions of its Office 2016 applications for the Mac, following a series of previews offered testers since April. The five apps -- Excel, OneNote, Outlook, PowerPoint and Word -- will be updated to 64-bit for all customers, including those with an Office 2016 retail license, a consumer or commercial subscription to Office 365, and a volume license. Most users will be updated automatically as the suite launches an update app on its regular schedule. Microsoft has been testing the 64-bit versions with Office Insider participants since April. Apple has long urged developers to release 64-bit versions of applications -- the Mac's operating system has supported only 64-bit Intel processors since 2011's OS X Lion -- but Microsoft has been one of the most significant holdouts. For users, the biggest benefit is the ability to work with much larger files -- thanks to the significantly bigger swaths of memory that a 64-bit operating system can access. Unlike the Windows edition of Office 2016, which comes in both 32- and 64-bit flavors, the Mac-specific suite will be available only in 64-bit after September. Microsoft offered users a one-month grace period during which version 15.25 will be provided in both 32- and 64-bit. "There may be situations in which the customer has to change code that's not 64-bit ready," Microsoft said in a support document, referring to possible conflicts with third-party Office add-ons. "If customers can't immediately move forward to 64-bit builds, we will make available a one-time 32-bit update for the 15.25 release in addition to the default 64-bit updates." That 32-bit version of 15.25 must be downloaded manually from Microsoft's site. The support document included instructions for reverting to 32-bit if Office 2016 had already been updated to 64-bit.

Today's enterprises demand portable, agile and interoperable developer and sysadmin tools. The OCI was launched with the express purpose of developing standards for the container format and runtime that will give everyone the ability to fully commit to container technologies today without worrying that their current choice of infrastructure, cloud provider or DevOps tool will lock them in. Their choices can instead be guided by choosing the best tools for the applications they are building. "The rapid growth and interest in container technology over the past few years has led to the emergence of a new ecosystem of startups offering container-based solutions and tools," said Chris Aniszczyk, Executive Director of the OCI. "We are very excited to welcome these new members as we work to develop standards that will aid container portability." The OCI currently has nearly 50 members. Anchore, ContainerShip, EasyStack and Replicated join existing members including: Amazon Web Services, Apcera, Apprenda, AT&T, ClusterHQ, Cisco, CoreOS, Datera, Dell, Docker, EMC, Fujitsu Limited, Goldman Sachs, Google, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Huawei, IBM, Infoblox, Intel, Joyent, Kismatic, Kyup, Mesosphere, Microsoft, Midokura, Nutanix, Odin, Oracle, Pivotal, Polyverse, Portworx, Rancher Labs, Red Hat, Resin.io, Scalock, Sysdig, SUSE, Twistlock, Twitter, Univa, Verizon Labs, VMware and Weaveworks. More about the new members Container adoption is accelerating, but with speed comes risk. With Anchore, users can create a trusted standard for their containers that is predictable and protectable, with development, operations and security teams on the same page from the start. Anchore democratizes certification and empowers users to secure their containers, so they can deploy them with confidence. Anchore, Inc. was founded by enterprise veterans, Saïd Ziouani and Dan Nurmi. The company is headquartered in Santa Barbara, Calif. "Formal specifications will allow us to ensure that the containers which our customers have certified using Anchore's tools will be interoperable and compatible across multiple platforms and container runtimes," said Saïd Ziouani, chief executive officer and founder of Anchore. "We are very excited to join the OCI and help further the development of open industry standards around container formats and runtime." ContainerShip is a hosting platform that makes it incredibly simple for developers to build, scale and manage their web infrastructure using containers. ContainerShip allows developers to launch PaaS-like hosting environments on demand, and provides a pipeline for doing continuous deployment. Teams and individuals get a single pane of glass to manage their entire application and infrastructure lifecycle, while running in any cloud or private data center. "By joining the OCI, we're able to provide input and help guide the direction of container specifications," said Phil Dougherty, co-founder of ContainerShip. "We are excited to be a part of a community that is passionate about container technology and its potential for application portability." EasyStack Inc. is a trusted leader as an OpenStack platform and service provider in Asia-Pacific. The company was founded by some of the earliest OpenStack contributors from IBM China Lab in February 2014. The company provides an open, stable, reliable, high-performance and elastic cloud platform to enterprise customers based on OpenStack with a focus on customers in finance, telecommunications, government, electronics, education and manufacturing industries, among others. "We adhere to an open source philosophy and regularly contribute to core community projects," said Xilun Chen, founder of EasyStack. "We look forward to working with the OCI community to build a container ecosystem around shared industry standards." Replicated is a container-centric platform that enables SaaS companies to manage and distribute an enterprise, installable version of their product on-prem (behind the firewall and into their customers' private data centers or private clouds). Replicated merges the concepts of cloud deployment with an on-prem delivery model while providing key enterprise functionality for identity management (LDAP, AD), audit logging, licensing, reporting and much more. Currently, the Replicated platform powers the enterprise versions for great companies including Travis CI, NPM, Sysdig, CircleCI, CodeClimate, Waffle.io and several others. "We've built a solution that enables SaaS developers to ship the same code to both cloud and on-prem installations," said Marc Campbell, Founder and CTO of Replicated. "Having standards around containers is important for our business because it allows us to run the containers built by different tools on almost any distribution of Linux." About the Open Container Initiative (OCI) The Open Container Initiative is an open governance structure for the express purpose of creating open industry standards around container formats and runtime. Projects associated to the Open Container Initiative can be found at https://github.com/opencontainers.

Robinson The "Internet of Things," a vast network of devices like phones, watches, clothing, and even toothbrushes – all communicating, all collecting and returning data – has been one of the biggest tech stories of the past five years. But I'm here to tell you, it's about to get even bigger, even more profitable, by an order of magnitude. That's because the Internet of Things is about to crack open healthcare at the most fundamental level, with small networked medical, prosthetic, and therapeutic devices set to explode onto the market. I'm talking about "wearapeutics." It's going to be a game changer. But the game can't change without this critical sector that's very much in play right now. I'm going to show you just how big this market is going to get, and the one investment you need to hold long term to get the most potential profits out of this exciting development… There Are Trillions in Untapped Potential on the Table According to McKinsey Global Institute, the Internet of Things-based consumer market alone is likely worth $1 trillion. Factor in the healthcare and medical side, and you're talking another $2 trillion – and all this before taking into account the potential movement into other industries, like energy, transportation, and agriculture – just to name a few. But it's the move into healthcare that's the most exciting. You see, right now, digital healthcare and wearapeutics is a "small" market, worth about $5.7 billion in 2015, according to IoT marketing research firm Parks Associates. But… a decade from now, this segment alone is expected to be worth $97 billion. That's a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 33%, which is to say 33% growth every year for 10 years. This is a conservative estimate, too, so any way you slice it there's a huge opportunity up for grabs here. But profiting from this isn't as straightforward as picking a stock in the company with one cool new sensor, or the best real-time glucose monitoring software. To get the maximum profit from this trend, investors need to "go big" and own something fundamentally important to all this growth. In other words, the best play on this trend is to buy the infrastructure on top of which the wearable therapeutics market will be built. This is what I mean… To Profit, Stake Your Spot in the Semiconductor Sector The shares I'm going to show you represent a ground-floor opportunity to participate in the next leg upward for semiconductor makers: wearapeutics. This fund is already packing serious performance. In the past year, it has risen 21% in an extremely soft market. It really embodies all the innovation underway in wearapeutics and the wider IoT field, so there's plenty of diversity here. Join the conversation. Click here to jump to comments… Michael A.

Kommentarer (23) Audun Rodem 23. aug. 2016 - 10:38 Del   Tweet   Spre   Da No Man's Sky ble lansert på Windows 12. august var det en del som opplevde store problemer med spillet. En andel slet med å få spillet til å kjøre optimalt, mens andre opplevde noen mer snodige feil som å sette seg fast under verdenen. Enkelte fikk ikke til å starte spillet i det hele tatt. Å bli fanget under planeter kan være litt slitsomt. Bilde: Casual-Dragon, reddit Siden den gang har utvikler Hello Games sluppet tre oppdateringer til Windows-versjonen, som de selv hevder retter opp om lag 70 prosent av alle innrapporterte feil.  Nå har de også frigitt akkurat hva de tre oppdateringene har rettet. Noen av rettingene går på tekniske problemer med grafikkort og annen maskinvare, mens andre ting retter opp situasjoner der spillet kunne lukke seg – for eksempel om man «warpet» fra et sted til et annet.  Hello Games er likevel langt fra ferdig med å oppdatere spillet. De jobber for øyeblikket med å rette de resterende 30 prosentene med problemer, samt implementere et nytt og bedre «waypoint»-system.  En komplett og detaljert liste over alle endringene ser du nederst i artikkelen. Middels mottakelse Etter flere år med venting, utsettelser og enorme forventninger fikk spillere endelig kaste seg ut i No Man’s Skys enorme univers den 10. august på PlayStation 4, og 12. august på Windows. No Man's Sky. Bilde: Hello Games Som ventet greide ikke det ambisiøse romspillet å leve opp til de skyhøye forventningene. Vår anmelder var heller ikke frelst, og pekte på at spillet ikke hadde mye å by på under overflaten. – Jeg ser og forstår hvor enestående det er, men i et så gigantisk rom blir det enda tydeligere hva som ikke er til stede. No Man’s Sky mangler unike karakterer og dialoger, det mangler spenning, det mangler rett og slett substans, skrev Andreas Bjørnbekk. Les hele anmeldelsen av No Man’s Sky » Trykk for å se alle endringene » Patch 1 The focus of patch 1 was to add greater support for more hardware. Either specific hardware configs, or hardware outside our min spec. We want as many people to be able to play as possible, and these were our most reported issues. AMD Phenom Support Game is now confirmed working on Phenom CPUs. Thousands of lines of assembly have been rewritten to support AMD CPUs. The game code no longer relies on anything above SSE 2, Havok Physics has also now created new libs for us to add Phenom support. Alt-Tab has improved Some systems/configs were crashing or not pausing correctly on Alt Tab. This should now be resolved. Improved Performance On CPUs with 4 threads or fewer, performance has been improved. On CPUs with exactly 8 threads, performance has also been significantly improved. Framerate Stuttering due to Shader Caching Framerate was initially stuttering due to shaders not being correctly cached by the GPU on some systems. We have replaced the GPU caching system. You may notice some stutter during the Galactic Map intro to the game (the very first time you run), but it should be smoother from then on. This is particularly true on ATI cards. Max FPS Cap On some CPU/GPU configurations, setting Max FPS to 60 or 30 was not giving 60 or 30 FPS (causing stuttering). This has been fixed. Radeon 6xxx Added support for this GPU, which doesn't support OpenGL 4.5 fully. Save Corruption Solution to try to prevent saves getting corrupted no matter what’s going on in background processes (see Patch 3 below, where we also are attempting to recover corrupted saves). Intel GPU Detection We do not currently support Intel GPUS. We are working on this for a future patch, to expand our min spec. In the meantime, the game will now let you know if you are trying to run with an unsupported GPU. This will hopefully flag for some users that their high end GPU has not been selected. Gsync Gsync has been disabled by default, which was causing an issue for some users Mouse Smoothing Generally this is most helpful for players with sub-30 FPS. Smoothing on mouse movement has been improved to prevent hitching or stuttering, and is now adjustable through the Options menu in “Mouse Smoothing”. It defaults to off. If you feel micro stutters in framerate affecting controls, feel free to turn this up. If you feel the framerate is "slow" or "lumpy", please make sure that this is turned off Patch 2 For patch 2 our focus was on the most reported bugs or crashes. Our aim was to improve stability, and make sure player’s saves are safe in future. Stuck under the world It was possible for players to save their game stuck under the terrain, leaving them stuck. This was caused by getting shot down in atmosphere, and their ship reaching ridiculous speeds as it crashed to the planet. This has been resolved. Whilst it won't happen anymore, if you are currently already stuck under the world, we detect this and do our best to rescue you. Crash after warping Occasionally at random the game would lock up after a warp, or return to desktop. This was due to very specific timing in hardware (a threading specific bug) – meaning that unfortunately for some people it was regular, and for others they would never be able to recreate it. This was our most reported crash during gameplay, and has now been resolved. Game failing to save until you died If the player died, and then loaded the game ten times without saving, and then died, player progress wouldn’t be saved from then on until you died again. This is fixed now! This was also causing player’s saves to grow in size. Crash fixes in scanning Quite a rare crash, but in certain scenarios it was possible to scan from space or on planet and crash the game. Crash warping inside a freighter When warping into a battle sometimes the player warped into the inside of a freighter and everything went crazy :( This is fixed now. Patch 3 Patch 3 is targeted at our next most common support requests, fixing the next most common crashes, as well as trying to help players who have become stranded or have corrupted their save files. Stranded in Space Station If you died in your ship while in atmosphere of a planet with a damaged ship, you could respawn in a space station with your launch thrusters and pulse engine damaged. If you did not have the resources to fix them then you could no longer take off and be stuck there. This will no longer happen. Loading Corrupted Save Files Some players have corrupted save files, we’ve been working with them to still load saves even if they are corrupted (this can happen for many reasons outside of the games control). This fix has allowed many players to still load their save even if they have become corrupt on PC. Crash fixes for next three most commonly reported issues: - As the player gathers a huge amount of discoveries, there was a threading issue that becomes more prevalent the more discoveries you have, and could cause the game to crash. - If you had collected a large number of blueprints, in a specific order it was possible to crash the game when you received a new blueprint. This has been fixed. - Players who set a large number of waypoints could find themselves in a situation where they could crash the game in the Galactic Map, this is remedied now (PS. A better waypoint system is coming).

Fujitsu helped develop the extensions for use in a follow on to its K Computer, a Sparc-based system at Japan’s Riken Institute that hit 8 petaflops in 2011 making it the most powerful system in the world at that time. The effort catapults the ARM processor core for the first time into the realm of supercomputers, a rarified territory Intel’s x86 has come to dominate. ARM hopes it can expand its presence there the way Intel did, slowly replacing homegrown processors from the likes of IBM and Cray. ARM’s strength is in its potential for relative power efficiency compared to the x86. The trait could serve supercomputer designers who can’t practically deliver the massive power to drive the exascale-class systems they want to build. Click here to read more ...

At the time it launched, it was the only thin, light and solidly built ultrabook around with decent specifications. Today however, there is a plethora of powerful, gorgeous devices to choose from. Acer’s Aspire S13 is one such device. It’s slim, light, well-built and more powerful than the Air; it’s also more expensive. It does seem like a great device, but is it worth it? Build and design: 8/10 First things first. This laptop is thin, very light and looks rather nice. It’s meant to be a business laptop and the muted black finish does help with that image. The entire device seems to be made of metal, though the lid does have a coating of some sort of plastic. There’s metal under that plastic though, an aspect that we discovered in a rather unfortunate fashion, as you can see below: Sorry, Acer! The device is built very well, with one exception. Everything feels solid and unbendable, but the hinges, they feel like cheap plastic. The hinge mechanism itself is made of metal, but the caps are silvery plastic and very flimsy plastic at that. The plastic pieces around the hinge keep popping open Another complaint we have with the design of the device is concerning the charger. It’s very compact, smaller even than the MacBook Air’s charger, but the contact point is very flimsy. It doesn’t sit snug in the charging port when plugged in and would have felt at home on a cheaper device. These are minor niggles in an otherwise great device though. Don’t let those oversights throw you off. Keyboard and Trackpad: 8.5/10 The keyboard and trackpad are a pleasure to use. They’re comfortable and responsive and the trackpad has just the right amount of friction for my taste. The keyboard is a compact one and lacks a numpad. There are no shared media keys either, but all other functions such as Wi-Fi toggles, brightness and volume controls, etc. can be adjusted in combination with the Fn key. The keyboard is backlit The keys are also very firm in that there’s no wobble when typing. Even if you press a corner, the entire key depresses, which makes for a pleasant typing experience. The touchpad responds fluidly to gesture inputs and the left-click and right-click buttons are also smooth and responsive. The lack of a touch-screen was a bit of a downer, but overall, I’m very happy with what Acer has done with the keyboard and mouse. Features: 6/10 The hardware choice for the Acer Aspire is very sensible. You get a 15W Intel Core i7 6500U processor clocked at 2.5GHz (dual-core with HT), 8GB LPDDR3 RAM and a 512GB SSD. The screen resolution is a bit low at 1920×1080, but it’s enough for a 13.3-inch screen and we aren’t complaining. You get two USB 3.0 ports, one on each side, a USB Type-C 3.1 port and HDMI output. You also get an SD card reader and 802.11ac Wi-Fi with MU-MIMO support, which is to be expected in this day and age. The fact that all of this is packed into a device that’s as slim and light as the MacBook Air is saying a lot. The laptop does lose out for its lack of accessories and relatively low-resolution screen – considering we are seeing higher resolution displays from competition. Display: 7/10 The display on the device is an FHD, 13.3-inch IPS panel. It has a matte finish (Thank you, Acer!) and good brightness levels. Colours are a bit of an issue, they seem a little muted, and black levels are also not up to the mark. We also found banding to be slight problem. Sharpness was on point however, and so were the refresh rates. The resolution is a bit odd for a 13.3-inch screen. Without scaling, everything feels a tad too small and to make things feel right, you need to scale to 125 or 150 percent. The problem there is that Windows doesn’t handle scaling very well and sharpness is ruined. Performance: 6.5/10 In terms of performance, this laptop is right up there alongside the best in its class. Bearing in mind that this device doesn’t come with a graphics card, its CPU performance is actually better than most devices, a step higher up the performance chain. For comparison, the Acer Aspire S13 scored 44431 in 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme with an i7 6500U, whereas the likes of the Asus G551VW and Dell Inspiron 15 7559, both with the more powerful Intel i7 6700HQ, scored a measly 38,374 and 30,851 respectively. 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme is a CPU intensive test that doesn’t stress the GPU much. Even without a dedicated GPU, the Aspire S13 managed 48fps in Grid: Autosport at 720p at the medium preset, which is eminently playable. Obviously, light gaming is possible, but that’s not what the laptop is for. The video conversion time — using Handbrake — was also quite fast at 11 minutes. Another area where the device shines is in the storage benchmarks. Acer very generously equipped the S13 with a 512GB SSD, which leads to stellar read and write rates of 525 MB/s and 414 MB/s respectively. This laptop is overkill for the average user, but as long as you’re not gaming, you’ll never be left wanting for performance. In fact, the PCMark score of 2912 is among the highest we’ve seen in this category. There is one problem in this otherwise perfect performance score and that is overheating. Under heavy load, the CPU temperatures cross the 70 degree Celsius mark and the base heats up to 48 degrees Celsius. This is under heavy load though. Under normal use, the base gets a little warm, but not uncomfortably so. Battery Life: 5/10 Battery life was a tolerable 3 hours in our benchmarks, which translated to about 4-6 hours of use. This is not bad for daily use, though we wish there was more on offer. Verdict and Price in India I enjoyed every moment I spent with the Aspire S13. It’s lightweight and high-performance made it my go-to option whenever I needed something done quickly (it boots up in seconds). If I bought this laptop for myself, I don’t think I’ll be disappointed. The price of Rs 84,000 is also not that bad. You’ll only get Intel i5 powered devices in this price range and few will offer a 512GB SSD. The Acer Aspire S13 is among the best laptops I’ve ever tested and if you’re in the market for a workhorse Ultrabook, it might just be the one for you.

Government partnering with businessses to prevent robocalls KGO by Leslie Brinkley Monday, August 22, 2016 SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- For the first time, the federal government is partnering with the biggest tech, cable and telecom companies to battle a common enemy: robocalls. Robocalls were once confined to landlines. "We just got a lot of calls we have to hang up on or say we're not interested so we only use our cell phone and we did away with our home phone," explained Alice Zhang of Palo Alto. RELATED: New technology unveiled at Intel developers conference in San Francisco But now the intrusive calls are popping up on cell phones, too. It's against the law to call consumers with a commercial message if they're on the do not call list established back in 2003. "I think the laws are largely irrelevant if there are ways to break it with impunity and not get caught. So, the only way to get at this problem is to use technology that can either block these calls or authenticate who is actually making them so that the law can actually be enforced," suggests Larry Magid, a technology analyst. That's why the FCC has formed a new Robocall Strike Force, a high level task force partnering with the brainpower of big companies, including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Verizon and AT&T. This strike force will meet in October to come up with ways to use technology to thwart the scam artists and telemarketers who are spoofing their way into getting us to answer calls often made from foreign countries using free voice over internet. RELATED: 7 on your side: Consumer Reports on how to spot credit card skimmers "It's extremely annoying. It's my private time at home and I don't like to be interrupted," said Gerry Williams of Modesto. Robocalls are not just a nuisance. They rip off millions of dollars from consumers. And now, for the first time, the government and private industry are working on a way to make consumers robocall-proof.

Whether it’s a publication, a web service like Apple Music or an application like Evernote, TechMan may have at one point subscribed. But TechMan is not a total rube about snares out there. For example, a low introductory rate that reverts to the higher regular rate without notice after a period of time. How many of us keep track so we can cancel when the rate rises? Or a free subscription with limited features. Sooner or later you hit something you can’t do unless you upgrade to a “pro” paid subscription, often combined with an introductory rate. Then one day you notice all these small monthly charges on your credit card are adding up. So you examine your charges (monthly and yearly) and decide what you no longer want. There are bound to be some things you have completely forgotten about. Now it’s time to start canceling subscriptions. And there is the rub. Obviously sites don’t put a big, red “cancel” button on the home page. Often you have to dig deep into the site. In iTunes, for example, which is a conduit for many subscriptions, you must go to the iTunes store and under “manage,” click “account,” sign in, go to “settings,” click “subscriptions,” click “manage,” click the subscription you want to cancel, click “edit” and then cancel. That’s six clicks on four pages and that is one of the easy ones. If you try to cancel from the web page of an item you are subscribed to, you can drill down and down and never get to the cancel button. My experience is that the easiest and most time efficient way is to cancel over the phone. Then finally you are no longer paying for issues of “Taxidermy Digest” that you never read. Chipping away. Chipmaker AMD unveiled its new Zen microarchitecture and a pair of CPU chips that the company says rival Intel’s newest chips. AMD’s Summit Ridge CPU will pack eight cores and can run as fast as Intel’s newest eight-core consumer Core i7 chip. The new chip will hit the market early next year, says pcworld.com. Hanging up on robocalls. More than 30 technology companies and the U.S. government are joining forces to crack down on automated, prerecorded telephone often called robocalls. AT&T, Google parent Alphabet, Apple and Verizon are among the members of the “Robocall Strike Force,” which met with the Federal Communications Commission on Friday. “This scourge must stop,” said FCC chairman Tom Wheeler, calling robocalls — which are used by telemarketers and scammers — the No. 1 complaint from consumers. NSA fire sale. A group of hackers known as the Shadow Brokers is selling cyber-spying tools in a web auction. The group claims the tools were stolen from the U.S. government. Analysis of the software for sale suggests that it’s authentic, and likely to belong to the National Security Agency, MIT Technology Review reports. To ride or not to ride.

TenFourFox does support most add-ons The add-ons it does not support are those that contain native Intel code, or, on Tiger Macs (OS X 10.4), add-ons that contain native code that requires Leopard. You can continue to use add-ons compatible with the same version of Firefox in TenFourFox in most cases. TenFourFox no longer supports plugins or Flash As of the previous TenFourFox 6.0, for the following reasons plugin support ships disabled. Sites will now act as if no plugins were installed at all. For details and an in-depth explanation of this policy and other workarounds, see Why aren't plugins supported in TenFourFox?. Plugins on PowerPC are of special concern because Mozilla is making updates to their plugin architecture which may require the plugins themselves to be updated, and there are certain difficult-to-correct bugs with them already on Tiger. Most importantly, Adobe Flash for PowerPC is no longer maintained and has known security risks that can crash or leak data, some sites requires versions not available on the PowerPC, and QuickTime for Leopard will lose its own support with the release of OS X Lion. For these and other reasons, TenFourFox does not run plugins, and they cannot be enabled. Version 45.5.0: Note: The 'Download' link yields the G5 version of TenFourFox.

That mobile strategy should tap mobile cloud: back-end, cloud-based features that extend mobile devices' storage capacities, help handle identity and access management tasks for the devices, provide synchronization and integration with core business systems, and connect with third-party services via API gateways.   In this webcast, Kurt Marko, analyst at MarkoInsights, explains the importance of mobile apps and the competitive advantages of mobile. Watch this webcast to learn of the many benefits mobile offers for businesses, and understand the approach of "go mobile or get left behind." Editor's note: The following is a transcript of the first of four excerpts of Marko's webcast presentation on the advantages of mobile cloud. It has been edited for clarity and length. Part 2 examines mobile cloud app development challenges and how the cloud helps. Part 3 discusses MBaaS features and vendors. And Part 4 provides recommendations and action items.  Kurt Marko: The topic today is mobile cloud. But before we get to mobile cloud, we have to try to take a few steps to understand why mobile is in the enterprise in the first place. There is a very symbiotic relationship between mobile and cloud. In fact, Intel is fond of quoting a stat about the number of mobile devices that drive the sale of one server. And it's in the range of around 400 or 500 smartphones and 100 to 200 tablets. In other words, for all of those devices, when you hear the sales of billions of iPhones, those are generally connecting to some sort of service. And that's typically a cloud-based service. Obviously, in the case of smartphones, many of those are consumer services, but for the digital enterprise, it's critical that as consumer behavior moves to mobile that they have a strategy for doing the same. So that kind of leads us into the mobile app imperative and why companies do need a mobile strategy. Smartphones and tablets are really the preferred device for everyone these days: whether they're customers, employees, business partners. More and more of the time online and in front of a screen is being spent on a mobile device. So, if you want to capture those eyeballs, so to speak, your business has to have a mobile strategy and to mobilize its digital assets. One of the problems: Early on companies were thinking that mobile websites were an added solution to the problem. And they are indeed OK for text-based or information-sharing sorts of applications, but even there you'll find many news organizations and broadcasters have found that people find that engaging with the mobile web is not as compelling as the native app experience. People spend more time in apps than on their mobile browser. And that higher engagement means more business and more productivity: more business for you if your channel is a mobile sales channel and more productivity out of your employees if you have mobilized some of your business processes. There are a number of reasons for that. We won't go into great detail. But the apps provide a cleaner UI and a richer feature set, and include access to a number of the unique mobile capabilities of the device, including location awareness, the use of cameras and other sensors, and offline access. For a number of reasons -- you can look up the stats -- but you'll find that the percentage of users who consider their primary device to be their smartphone is climbing and well in excess of 50% now, particularly among young people. That kind of leads to the conclusion [of] "go mobile or be left behind if you're in business." And mobile provides a competitive advantage. And increasingly, that's going to switch to be a competitive disadvantage if you aren't mobile, since mobile will be considered a baseline by your customers, regardless of the industry that you're in. With customers, particularly in businesses with a lot of customer-facing activities like retail, hospitality, customer service -- I could add financial services to that list -- mobile is extremely popular. All we have to look at for evidence is the rising share of mobile sales during the holiday season: It grabs a greater and greater share of retail dollars every year. With customers, it also provides, if you're doing outbound marketing, better ad targeting, user engagement, and customer reach. I could also add integration with different social networks and social sharing, which allows you to kind of extend your reach to a customer's social circle. For employees, mobile provides competitive advantage and increased productivity and efficiency, the obvious examples being mobile or nomadic workers or field workers like sales and service occupations, but even for your typical office worker who is "day extending" by handling email or checking on their project task list. Obviously, email is quite mobilized by the native apps, but having mobile collaboration capabilities or mobile workflows for managers can ease the friction between the work-and-home-life balance and allow your employees to do a little bit more throughout the day. And generally, for all users, mobile provides a competitive advantage, regardless of the target. The use and the availability of detailed application instrumentation and analytics that at least savvy mobile developers incorporate into their apps provide very valuable usage and customer data that when mined can be used to prioritize new features in the app, new products, find pain points the customers are experiencing, [and] just provide information that you wouldn't have had otherwise.

The number of elective procedures has jumped from just under 500 in 2009 to nearly 4,000 in 2013. , SHUTTERSTOCK.COM The American Society for Reproductive Medicine removed the “experimental” label from egg freezing in 2012. The number of elective procedures has jumped from just under 500 in 2009 to nearly 4,000 in 2013. , SHUTTERSTOCK.COM By TANYA WARD GOODMAN / CONTRIBUTING WRITER Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF The night before her double mastectomy, Melinda (who asked us not to reveal her name) had six embryos removed from her uterus and placed in deep freeze. A diagnosis of breast cancer coupled with the gene mutation known as BRCA1 had rearranged the geography of her life, and she was only in her early 30s. Working quickly to preserve her fertility gave her “a sense of having control over the situation,” she said. Cryogenic storage of embryos has been possible since 1986 and is often used in cases like Melinda’s, in which, due to illness, injury or elective sexual reassignment, a naturally occurring conception is unlikely. The multicelled embryo often has a better chance of surviving the freezing process than an egg, according to Dr. Jane Frederick of HRC Fertility Clinic in Newport Beach. A second option Julie (last name withheld) was happily married and unable to get pregnant. A devout Christian, she was uncertain about in vitro fertilization. “It felt like playing God,” she said. Her pastor offered reassurance, telling her, “If you break your leg, you get it fixed.” Julie went through two rounds of IVF, which involved several weeks of self-administered hormone injections followed by surgical egg removal and intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection fertilization, a process in which the sperm is placed directly into the egg. She and her husband wound up with five embryos, implanted two and became pregnant with their daughter. The remaining three embryos were frozen. “At 28,” Julie said, “I thought it was God’s will that I didn’t have children. I thought that searching for answers and trying to make it work wasn’t OK. But now, I think God gives us science, and it’s there to help.” “Education for women is paramount,” said Dr. Lawrence B. Werlin of Coastal Fertility Clinic in Irvine. “Once women have information about what’s going on with their eggs, their bodies, they can make decisions about what’s going on with their lives.” Actress Jennifer Frappier’s boyfriend suddenly turned out to be “so not the person” of her dreams. “I was turning 35 and my life was not where I thought it would be,” Frappier said. Friends were married and having children, while she was starting from scratch. She read everything about egg freezing she could find. She worried about the expense and about being “baby crazy,” but ultimately, she concluded, “If I don’t do this, I’ll be sad.” The preservation boom Frappier is not alone. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine removed the “experimental” label from egg freezing in 2012. The number of elective procedures has jumped from just under 500 in 2009 to nearly 4,000 in 2013. Freezing eggs as fertility insurance has been quickly embraced by companies such as EggBanxx, whose slogan is “Smart women freeze.” It offers “Let’s Chill” parties in large cities, serving information, encouragement and cocktails. Facebook, Intel and Google offer elective egg freezing as an employee benefit and, as of January, active-duty members of the military have qualified for egg and sperm preservation. Coastal Fertility has seen an uptick in fertility preservation requests and in attendance at quarterly egg-freezing informational meetings. Women are born with all their eggs, Werlin said. “With age, the genetic material breaks down and becomes less viable.” According to Frederick, eggs are most viable between ages 25 and 35. She recommends freezing up to 30 eggs. “The egg is a very fragile single cell,” she said. “It’s mostly made of water. In order to preserve the cell, we use a rapid-freezing sequence known as vitrification.” With this process, Frederick said, about 90 percent of the eggs survive the thaw and about 25 percent result in a pregnancy. A high price for future babies Getting to deep freeze was the end of a long journey for Frappier. “I was solo at the fertility clinic,” she said. She decided to film the process in order to share her story with other women going through a similar experience. The ordeal of twice-daily hormone shots was difficult but also empowering. “Once I gave myself the first shot, I felt so euphoric. It’s my dream; I’m going to assume the right to pursue it.” The right to pursue the dream does not guarantee the funding for the pursuit, however. While insurance companies may cover fertility treatments, coverage for elective fertility preservation is nearly nonexistent. Frappier estimates that the whole thing cost nearly $14,000, plus $365 per year for egg storage. Clinics and companies such as EggBanxx offer financing options. She lauded Apple and Facebook for setting a new standard for employee benefits and hopes this will encourage women to lobby other companies to cover egg and embryo freezing. Viability and other concerns Money is not the only delicate subject in this discussion. Decisions must be made about the disposal of unused eggs and embryos and those that don’t survive the thaw. Once cancer patient Melinda made it through chemotherapy and recovered from her surgery, she and her husband tried to get pregnant naturally. Eventually, they turned to the embryos, only to find that three of the five weren’t viable. She describes how Bon Jovi’s “Livin’ on a Prayer” was playing in the procedure room when they were being implanted. “We started to laugh and cry at the same time. That song will never be the same for us,” she said. The embryos didn’t survive. For Julie and her husband, the outcome was different but equally emotional. “The embryos were babies to me,” she said. “It was very important that we used them.” Of their three remaining embryos, two were intact and able to be implanted. She was happy to have so few embryos because the idea of donating them to another couple – one outcome for unused embryos – was hard. “I prayed about it,” she said. “It would have felt weird to ship those kids all over the country, but I would have. Everyone will do what they will do. It’s so personal.” About 2 percent of Frederick’s patients have donated embryos to other couples. She wishes it were more, but she doesn’t see the embryos as children. “The tissue in my lab is not viable until I put it back in someone’s uterus,” she said. “It’s a possibility, but not a life.” For now, Frappier is holding on to what her mother refers to as “frozen grandbabies.” Raised without a father, she worries that being an African American single mother will make her “another statistic,” but she knows her story is different. Her documentary short, “Chill,” screened in June. “I originally thought it would end with a baby, but for now, it’s ending with my decision to be a mom. That’s me moving toward something, and it’s the movement that counts.” Melinda, too, has continued her forward momentum. She now has two daughters. “I used donor eggs,” she said, “and donor milk. I outsourced my whole pregnancy. My world expanded because of the way I had my children. This is our story.” Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off Most Popular Huntington Beach man dies after mobile-home fire Teen in coma after getting hit by metal object through car's windshield on 57 freeway Police officer, wife die in possible murder-suicide in Long Beach Gas station employee stabbed in Anaheim, two suspects in custody Judge denies Muslim women's request to drop trespassing claim in Urth Caffe lawsuit User Agreement Comments are encouraged, but you must follow our Privacy Policy Policy & Terms of Use Keep it civil and stay on topic.

Swamy, who led lndia and South-East Asia investments for HarbourVest, has joined as the chief executive of Good Parents Inc., a health and wellness start-up operating out of San Francisco and Hong Kong. “Good Parents is focused on enhancing child development and growth via building an ecosystem around engaging parents, health insurance companies, corporate benefit programmes and schools,” Swamy said in an interview from Hong Kong. “Our first product is the Kiddo, the world’s first health and wellness wearable focused on young kids (3-10 years). The Kiddo tracks key biometrics of children and provides health, well-being, stress and development insights in real time via an app,” said Swamy. Good Parents was co-founded in late 2015 by Swamy, along with Jean Rintoul and Bo Vargas. Rintoul was one of the founding members of Basis, the wearable technology company which was acquired by Intel Corp. for over $100 million in 2014, where she worked on algorithms and hardware for the Basis B1 and co-authored several patents. Vargas was the founding chief technology officer of Quanttus, the blood pressure tracking company which came out of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and was invested in by Khosla Ventures and Matrix Partners. Good Parents currently has eight employees in the Bay Area and three in Hong Kong. It has raised $2 million till date in seed funding from Jayesh Parekh and Prem Kumar of Jungle Ventures, Fireside Ventures (Kanwaljit Singh, ex-Helion Ventures), Biosensors International Ltd, Alto Partners and several marque angels across Asia and the US. It has also partnered with Samsung and key advisers at the Health and Food Institute of the University of California, Davis, for enhancing product functionality. The company is now looking to expand its operations in India and is exploring setting up an operations back-office, potential manufacturing capacity and distribution tie-ups in India. The healthcare wearable market is expected to grow exponentially over the next few years. According to an April report from research firm Tractica, worldwide shipments for healthcare wearables will increase from 2.5 million in 2016 to 97.6 million units annually by 2021. By the end of that period, Tractica forecasts that the global healthcare wearables market will account for $17.8 billion in yearly revenue. “The market for healthcare wearables is very much in its infancy, though there is a considerable amount of activity across the healthcare value chain,” said Aditya Kaul, research director at Tractica. Swamy’s is the latest high-profile exit in the PE industry in Asia. Last year, Anand Prasanna, head of Asia for Morgan Creek, left to start an India-focused venture fund called Iron Pillar, along with Mohanjit Jolly of Draper Fisher Juvertson and Sameer Nath of Citibank. Iron Pillar is currently raising $150 million and has also closed several early deals. Prior to this, Menka Sajnani of Auda Private Equity LLC left to join Google in Singapore and has now moved to Jungle Ventures. HarbourVest has more than 280 employees, including 80 investment professionals, deployed in Asia, Europe, Latin America and the US. The team has committed more than $25 billion to newly-formed funds, completed over $11 billion in secondary purchases, and invested $4 billion directly in operating companies.

The nation's aviation agency came across a video of the stunt, and didn't much like the pilot's flying practices.More >>    By Julian Chokkatu Provided by Facebook and Microsoft have come out and said they offer equal pay for their employees regardless of gender — but what about the rest of Silicon Valley? New data from a job recruiting startup doesn’t paint a promising picture for women in tech. Equal Pay Day began 20 years ago by the National Committee on Pay Equity, and while there has been acknowledgment and improvement of the gender disparity in Silicon Valley, the tech industry still has a long way to go. Women in tech make 3 percent less than men Job recruiting startup Hired released new data on its findings of equal pay in Silicon Valley, and found that companies on average offer women 3 percent less than men for the same roles — some offering as much as 30 percent less. These jobs aren’t only in tech-related fields, but also in sales and marketing. Related: Study suggests women’s computer code is preferred, only if their gender is unknown “Sixty-nine percent of the time, men receive higher salary offers than women for the same job title at the same company,” according to the data. Of course, larger companies are under greater scrutiny, and many of the big-names in tech do offer equal pay. Facebook and Microsoft disclosed information surrounding equal pay after facing pressure from an investment firm, Arjuna Capital. The firm filed a shareholder proposal in 2014 asking for nine companies, including Facebook and Microsoft, to release salary data, according to the Wall Street Journal. So far, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Intel have disclosed pay data to the firm, and Expedia says it will in October. “We regularly review our compensation practices to ensure pay equity, and have done so for many years,” Facebook’s Head of Human Resources, Lori Goler, said in a Facebook post. “We complete thorough statistical analyses to compare the compensation of men and women performing similar work. I’m proud to share that at Facebook, men and women earn the same.” Google told Digital Trends that its People Analytics team analyzes performance, compensation and promotion to ensure that there is no gender pay gap at Google. “Since we set salaries based on the market rate of the job (rather than a person’s pre-Google salary), we find that, on average, women get larger pay increases than men when they join Google,” a spokesperson said. While Facebook, along with Google’s parent company, Alphabet, say they offer equal pay, both companies have not disclosed salary data to the firm yet, according to the Wall Street Journal. Women in the U.S. at Microsoft now earn 99.8 cents on the $1 earned by men at the same job title and level. And Microsoft went further and disclosed how much other ethnic minorities make compared to their Caucasian counterparts. “Racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. combined earn $1.004 for every $1 earned by their Caucasian counterparts,” Microsoft’s Executive Vice President of Human Resources, Kathleen Hogan, said. “Breaking it down even further, African American/black employees are at $1.003; Hispanic/Latino(a) employees are at 99.9 cents; and Asian employees are at $1.006 for every $1 earned by Caucasian employees at the same job title and level, respectively.” It’s still mostly an all-boys club But offering equal pay is the easy part — what about the number of women who are actually working at these tech companies? Related: Vimeo to fund five female-directed films this year to help close gender gap The Menlo Park company provided an employee breakdown last May, which shows that only 16 percent of Facebook’s global tech workforce comprises of women with tech-related careers. Microsoft’s also only has a small group of women in its tech workforce — 16.9 percent, as opposed to the other 83 percent that are men. Based on its 2015 data, only 18 percent of Google’s tech jobs are held by females. And Apple is hardly any better — the Cupertino company’s tech workforce is 22 percent female, according to its 2015 data. One thing’s for sure — these industry leaders have realized the gender disparity in their workforce and have spoken out about it. “We believe in equality for everyone, regardless of race, age, gender, gender identity, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a diversity report. “That applies throughout our company, around the world with no exceptions.” Related: Just because Ellen Pao isn’t appealing her lawsuit loss doesn’t mean the struggle for gender equality is over Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly mentioned the importance of a more diverse workplace, but also how more women will help teams perform better, according to CNN. “It’s this problem because it’s not even clear where you would start attacking it,” Zuckerberg said in a 2014 Q&A. “You need to start earlier in the funnel so that girls don’t self-select out of doing computer science education, but at the same time, one of the big reasons why today we have this issue is that there aren’t a lot of women in the field today.” That was in 2014 — and Facebook’s most recent data from less than a year ago only improved by 1 percent. While Google’s disclosure of diversity in its workplace in 2014 may have inspired a wave of companies like Apple and Facebook to follow suit, it’s equally important for these industry leaders to follow through with actions. Last year, companies like Google and Intel announced new initiatives to help create a more gender-balanced workplace. Google pledged $150 million and Intel created a $300 million fund for the next five years. We’ll have to see how these initiatives play out, but hopefully a higher awareness will have more companies hiring more women and other minorities in tech-related fields, while offering the equal pay for equal work.

The nation's aviation agency came across a video of the stunt, and didn't much like the pilot's flying practices.More >>    By Cristian de Looper Provided by Samsung has been a leader in the internet of things space for some time now, but it looks like the company is set to get even more serious about the space — so much so that it’s going to invest a whopping $1.2 billion in the U.S. over the next four years on research and development into connecting everyday devices. According to Samsung, that $1.2 billion will be split evenly between internal research and development, and investing in related startups, proving that Samsung is becoming increasingly partner-friendly. Related: Samsung’s first foldable phone, the Galaxy X, could launch in 2017 Of course, Samsung isn’t new to the internet of things, however its new efforts are an attempt to compete with the likes of Qualcomm and Intel, and will see Samsung creating chips that can be used by other manufacturers in the creation of their own internet of things devices. “At Samsung, putting people at the center of everything we do is our highest value,” said Samsung vice chairman and CEO Oh-Hyun Kwon in a statement. “The same must be true for IoT if we want to realize its full transformative power. Today, IoT is changing individual lives — helping people to age in their own homes. But tomorrow, using IoT, we can give the same independence to millions of Americans.” The $600 million in internal investment will go straight to two of Samsung’s research centers, which are located in the Silicon Valley area. That money will be focused squarely on developing technology to power internet of things devices. For example, it will create chips for other companies to use — a business that Samsung has rather vigorously pursued in the past few years, now sitting as the second largest chip-maker in the world. Just last year the company announced a new series of processors, called the Artik series, which was developed specifically for low-powered internet of things devices. It will certainly be interesting to see what Samsung comes up with over the next few years, especially considering the rate of growth of the internet of things market.

National World Business Tech Sport Entertainment Life & Style Travel Motoring Profile Settings Sign Out technology Search Digital Living Gadgets Games Social Networking Apps Hands on: Microsoft Hololens augmented reality headset ADAM TURNER Last updated 08:07, August 23 2016 MICROSOFT Microsoft's augmented reality HoloLens goggles. Picking up where Pokemon Go leaves off, Microsoft's Hololens delivers a new way of looking at the world. Virtual reality is stealing the headlines this year as the major VR headsets finally hit the shelves, but in the long term I suspect augmented reality will have a greater impact on our lives. VR whisks you away to a fantasy land, blocking out the real world, while AR seamlessly blends the digital and physical realms to place virtual objects into the world around you. A cricket ground floating in the middle of the Two Bulls office. After an early limited release Hololens has just gone on sale to developers in the US and Canada for US$3000. Right now it's aimed at business users and Microsoft doesn't have any immediate plans to sell it to the general public, so you might consider it a work in progress compared to what might eventually be offered to consumers. READ MORE: * With HoloLens, Microsoft aims to avoid Google's mistakes * HoloLens Minecraft coming from Microsoft Melbourne software developer Two Bulls was one of the first in Australia to get its hands on Hololens headsets and prefers the term "mixed" reality to "augmented" reality because Hololens is capable of doing far more than just pasting graphics over your view of the world. Hololens presents a slight different image to each eye to create a sense of depth. WORK THE ROOM All this spatial awareness is thanks to several cameras built into the Hololens headset. It uses two cameras and an infrared sensor to build up a 3D model of the world around you – so it knows the dimensions of the room and location of objects. In this way it's similar to Google's Project Tango AR tablets which were on show at the Google I/O developer conference back in May. Microsoft's Hololens headset is surprisingly comfortable considering its bulk, and it isn't as front-heavy as something like the Oculus Rift VR headset. The dual-band design helps distribute the pressure of the headset across your head, with a thumb wheel to tighten the main headband at the back. On one side you've got brightness controls above your ear, on the other side volume controls for the built-in surround sound speakers. Ad Feedback The computer-generated objects are projected onto the lenses in front of your eyes, offering a slightly different view to each eye for a true sense of depth. Those projected images line up perfectly with your view of the real world to create the augmented effect. Two more cameras in the headset record your view of the world, complete with AR effects, and can send it to a computer via Wi-Fi. Unlike most VR headsets, the Hololens is completely wireless and self-sufficient as it has a tiny built-in computer running Windows 10. You can walk around the room without the need to be tethered to a computer or rely on external tracking cameras, offering a more engaging experience than VR headsets which require you to stand still. The headset's cameras are accurate enough that they can track your hands, letting you reach out to interact with objects as well as use gesture-based controls – similar to Intel's RealSense 3D cameras which will be built into its upcoming Project Alloy headset. JUMP IN I first donned the Hololens headset to discover a large cricket ground floating in the middle of the Two Bulls open plan office in Collingwood. Roughly five feet across, the cricket ground remains perfectly aligned with the floor and doesn't waver as you walk around to view it from every angle. Looking down at the cricket ground, I could watch the bowler run up to the crease and then flick my finger to swing the bat and hit the ball. After a few tidy singles I managed to smash the ball out of the ground, watching it sail through the air and then bounce on the office floor and keep rolling. Wherever I stood, the digital and physical realms lined up perfectly – allowing the pretend ball to roll across the real floor. You can adjust the brightness of the augmented content but in this sunlit office the stadium looked slightly transparent (more so than in the screen shots), yet still very believable. In a darker room objects appear more solid. Unlike VR, you can still see the real world and interact with people around you, so there's no sense of isolation or disorientation. Looking around the office I could see the Earth and Moon floating before me, along with animals sitting on the floor. I could reach out with my hands and touch these objects, pinching their corners to manipulate their size and orientation. Each object has small menus on the side, so you can look at a menu option – assisted by the headset's built-in pupil tracking – and tap your finger on your thumb to select it just like a mouse click. As an alternative to tapping your thumb, the headset also supports a one-button wireless remote control which acts like a mouse click. Just look at what you want to select and then press the button. This might seem like cheating but at times it feels more practical, especially as it means you don't need to hold your hand up so the headset's cameras can see your gestures. The "bloom" gesture – opening your hand upwards like a flower opening its petals – calls up the Windows 10 start menu. From here you can take screen shots, launch apps and even dive into the Windows store to download AR content. The headset also supports voice commands. FIELD OF VISION One limitation is that the Hololens has a relatively narrow field of view, you can see augmented objects straight ahead but they don't extend to your peripheral vision - it's roughly a 30 to 40 degree horizontal field of view. More frustrating at first is that it has limited vertical field of view and if you don't get the headset to sit correctly on your head it crops off the very top of the augmented display. When you look closer at the Hololen's design the reasons for these limitations become clear. The headset isn't projecting augmented content onto the entire visor, only on to small rectangles – similar to bifocal glasses but located in the centre of your vision (you can see this in the photo above). You need to be looking through these small areas to see the augmented content. If the headset sits too low on your face you end up looking over the top of these areas, as if your reading glasses had slipped down your nose. This is frustrating at first but not a deal-breaker and you soon forget about it once you get the headset to sit in the right spot. The field of view issue only becomes noticeable again when you're dealing with fast-moving action such as games which require you to look quickly around the room. Stepping into a small office we fired up Microsoft's Robo Raid first person AR shooter with flying robots bursting through the walls. With target cross-hairs overlayed on my view of the room I could line up the robots by looking at them and then blast them out of the air, using the remote in my hand to fire. At this point the limited field of view made itself felt again, as I could hear the robots breaking through the different walls but had to keep turning my head because I couldn't glance at them in my peripheral vision. If Microsoft was actively pushing Hololens as a gaming platform I'd be more critical, but it's easier to forgive the field of view limitations knowing this isn't intended to be a consumer-grade gaming device. Turns out I'm dynamite with a laser beam, testament to the headset's accurate tracking which ensured the real and virtual content remained in alignment. I was also assisted by the headset's built-in accelerometer and gyroscope which let me duck and weave as my flying foes returned fire. Miss your target and you blow a virtual hole in the real wall, exposing the beams beneath. These holes are more than flat projections, you can walk across the room and peer into the hole from any angle. Used in any empty room with white walls, the Hololens could certainly offer a holodeck-style VR experience and you can create AR content using the same Unity programming environment popular with VR developers.  - Sydney Morning Herald Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next Gadgets story: Award for Blenheim electronics store switched on to customer service Technology Homepage Comments technology headlines Drivers' phones may be locked The PC isn't dead yet Facebook builds censorship tool Twitter boss's account suspended Internet cable milestone No proof?

Next Week Thurs September 1 @ Moz PDX: Being Human in a Data-Filled World with Genevieve Bell, Intel In May, Kevin Kelly shared the possibilities that technology will offer us over the next 30 years. Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Join us in Portland and on AirMo for our Augtember speaker as we explore how to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. Specifically, we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. More details on the event and speaker at the Speaker Series wiki. Speakers The limit is 3 minutes per topic. It's like a lightning talk, but don't feel that you have to have slides in order to make a presentation. If you plan on showing a video, you need to contact the Air Mozilla team before the day of the meeting or you will be deferred to the next week.

Bright, clear holograms. Interesting software selection. Cons Holograms only appear in a small section of your vision. Uncomfortable after extended periods. Gestures look silly. Bottom Line The Development Edition of the Microsoft HoloLens augmented reality headset is a well-executed and tempting look at how we might use computers years in the future. By Will Greenwald Virtual reality has been a major topic of discussion over the last year, with the release of headsets like the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift. VR can put you in completely different places, but it doesn't change how you look at your real-life surroundings. That's what augmented reality is for, and that's why Microsoft designed the HoloLens. The HoloLens isn't a VR headset. You can see completely through it and look at anything around you. Instead, it projects holograms over your surroundings, combining the real environment with computer-generated elements like floating app windows and three-dimensional models. //Compare Similar Products Compare Oculus Rift   %displayPrice%%seller% see it HTC Vive   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Samsung Gear VR   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Zeiss VR One   %displayPrice%%seller% see it The technology used in the HoloLens is leaps and bounds beyond anything Google Glass has accomplished, but it's also much more expensive and a lot bulkier. Microsoft hasn't announced a retail version of the HoloLens yet, but if you really want to try it, you can order the Development Edition for $3,000. It's a self-contained Windows 10 system built into an AR visor, and because it doesn't require any sort of pairing with a smartphone, tablet, or PC, it can function completely on its own. Because it's development hardware, we won't give it a formal score. This HoloLens is not intended to be a consumer product, and that's reflected in its price and ergonomics. It's still an incredible piece of technology, and potentially indicates how we will work with computers in the not-too-distant future. Design The HoloLens consists of a big black headband and a transparent black visor. The headband wraps completely around your head above the ears, with thick, fixed arms that connect to the visor and an adjustable, padded back strap with a wheel that extends or contracts to fit the size of your head. The left arm features a power button and five-LED battery indicator on the back, a micro USB port for charging with the included cable and power adapter on the underside, and two buttons that adjust display brightness on the top. The right arm has a 3.5mm headphone jack on the bottom and volume control buttons on the top. The arms also feature their own speakers, small orange rectangular protrusions that project sound toward the wearer's ears. The speakers offer clear sound for the user, but because there are no headphone earpads to isolate the sound, people around you might hear whatever you're doing on the HoloLens if you keep the volume turned up. View All 10 Photos in Gallery The visor contains the bulk of the electronics. It's a large, smoke-colored plastic shield on the front of the headband that extends over the front, protecting the various sensors and the display. The display consists of a transparent pane over each eye, angled to catch the images projected by emitters built above them. Multiple sensors, including four environment cameras, one depth camera, and an ambient light sensor, cover a wide arc in front of the user. Besides the HoloLens itself and the included Clicker peripheral (explained below), the Development Edition includes a baseball cap-like peg-in-hole plastic strap, short and long nose bridges that click into the nose section of the face mask, a micro USB cable for charging the device, a USB power adapter, and a hard-shell zip-up case. Hardware The Development Edition is designed to be a wearable computer, though it isn't close to a full PC in terms of power. It uses a 32-bit Intel CPU to drive the device, with a separate Microsoft-built Holographic Processing Unit (HPU 1.0) for the holograms. It has 2GB of RAM and 64GB of flash storage, and features both Bluetooth 4.1 LE and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. Microsoft hasn't specified a display resolution for the HoloLens, beyond that the emitters produce 2.3 million points of light projected by two "HD 16:9 light engines." Since the HoloLens is a self-contained system, you can use it without any wires. You charge the headset via its micro USB port. Microsoft says the battery should last between two and three hours of use, which is in line with our experience during the testing period. It takes about two hours to reach a full charge. How Hololens Holograms Work Microsoft's entire concept is based around projecting holograms for an augmented reality experience. The HoloLens visor does a very good job of this, thanks to its extremely bright light emitters. They work with the wave guides on the lenses in front of your eyes to display crisp, colorful images floating in three-dimensional space (to your point of view). Both floating windows for apps and simulated three-dimensional objects are vivid and clear before your eyes. But the holograms don't exist in your complete field of vision. The lenses and projectors only display holograms within a limited rectangular space in the center of your view. If you move your head away from the hologram you're looking at, it will vanish before it hits the edge of your sightline. This is jarring, and prevents the HoloLens from producing a truly immersive augmented reality experience. It's a fairly large display field, but it doesn't come close to the complete field of view offered by the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive virtual reality headsets. Of course, those headsets don't let you see through them to see all of your actual surroundings (though pass-through camera modes let you see what's in front of your VR headset in a rectangle about the size of the HoloLens display). Keeping the HoloLens display lined up with your eyes is vital, as the display's boundaries can otherwise be obscured. I found the visor dipping low on occasion when testing, which made the top of the picture fade away. The included nose bridges in two different sizes can keep the visor lifted at the right angle when used with the adjustment wheel on the back of the headband. I had to tighten the headband to a somewhat uncomfortable extent to keep the visor aligned on my relatively large head. Keeping the headband tight helped make sure the lenses were aligned, but it also put a lot of pressure on my brow, and my forehead felt sore when I finally took the headset off. The HoloLens is a bit more comfortable with the headband pulled back to give a little more slack, but then I had to constantly adjust the visor to keep my eyes aligned with the lenses. That means my fit choices were either annoying (regular adjustments) or ultimately painful (an overly tight headband). Environment Mapping While the HoloLens can't display holograms to cover your entire vision, it can at least position them through your entire surroundings. The multiple cameras and sensors on the visor constantly scan the area around you, mapping walls and other obstacles and tracking your location relative to them. This makes the HoloLens surprisingly accurate for its placement of holographic windows and objects. In our rectangular, flat-walled test room, I easily placed Web browsers, apps, and settings menus along the walls like virtual windows, surrounding myself with objects that stayed in place as if they were physically mounted on the walls. The HoloLens sensed the location of the floor and tables as well, accurately lining three-dimensional holograms around them so they didn't appear to be floating around like ghosts. The environment mapping is less reliable in more open and cluttered areas. PC Labs itself is a large, uneven workspace with multiple aisles, benches, desks, offices, and windows, with a block-patterned, three-color floor to further confuse the sensors. The HoloLens identified the walls of the lab accurately, but made holograms flicker and glitch when I placed them around the open aisles. The visor clearly struggled to figure out whether or not the benches and their shelves were walls or not, and if the wide red and blue stripes of the floor were physical boundaries or flat. Control You can control HoloLens with the included Clicker peripheral or with physical gestures. The Clicker is a small one-button remote that simply lets you click on whatever you're looking at, using a small dot in the center of your view as a cursor. The Clicker generally just performs the click function and relies on head motion for moving things around and selecting them. Hand motion is used almost exclusively for the drag-and-drop command, where you click and hold with the Clicker and your hand in view of the visor, then slowly move your hand to drag objects where you want them to go. This is mostly used for resizing windows and holograms, and scrolling up and down documents in Edge. Physical gestures are fairly reliable once you get used to them, but they'll make you look and feel pretty silly. The two main gestures are Bloom and Air Tap. Bloom involves holding your hand with your fingers together and pointed straight up, then opening up your fingers. The gesture brings up the Start menu, which lets you access all of the apps and features. It's hard to do without wanting to follow up with a shout of "Magic!" Air Tap involves holding your index finger up and bringing it down toward your thumb. You don't need to touch your fingertip to your thumb, but I found it makes the gesture slightly more reliable. This is the basic click gesture, activating any item the dot in the center of your field of view is floating over. You can also hold the gesture to drag objects. I found myself wanting to mutter, "I am crushing your head," while Air Tapping. Both gestures need to be performed in view of the headset's sensors. The area is a bit more forgiving than the holographic display's frame, but generally you get the best results by keeping your hands within the boundaries of the display when gesturing. Besides clicking and using air gestures, the HoloLens supports voice commands and features Microsoft's Cortana voice assistant. Simple commands like, "Remove," and, "Take a Picture," close windows and take photos (with holograms) of whatever you're looking at. You can also use Cortana to input text, which is useful if you don't want to pair a separate Bluetooth keyboard to the HoloLens, since entering text using Air Taps with a virtual keyboard is tedious. Software While it's intended for developers, the HoloLens offers a surprising amount of compelling software for general use. As a Windows 10 device, it has access to the Edge browser, Skype video conferencing, and a variety of other Microsoft and third-party apps on the Windows 10 app store. These apps, which aren't designed with holograms in mind, appear as floating windows you can virtually fix on your walls or floating in space. Microsoft Edge works just as well as it does on a standard PC. I could access Gmail and YouTube easily through the Web browser, which displayed both in desktop mode. A separate YouTube client, called HoloTube, displays a more leanback-friendly interface for browsing videos, and lets you detach the app from whatever location you placed it and make it continuously float in the center of your vision wherever you look. The Holograms app is an entertaining way to decorate your environment with holograms and experiment with the headset's location tracking and placement. It presents a window with a variety of static and animated three-dimensional holograms. Tapping one pulls it out of the window and lets you place it anywhere around you. Once a hologram is placed, you can resize and reposition it as you please. These holograms are treated as persistent decorations in your HoloLens interface; even if you close the Hologram app, the holograms will stay put as long as you use window-based apps like Edge. (They will disappear, along with any windows you have open, if you load a HoloLens app that completely takes over your view.) The holograms are persistent in their virtual locations, meaning you can walk around them and look at them from any angle. HoloStudio builds on the Holograms concept by letting you construct entire scenes of holograms out of various components and using different tools. You can connect multiple parts together, duplicate your constructed objects, and color them to create much more elaborate dioramas than the individual pre-built objects from the Holograms app. As mentioned, a Skype client is available on the HoloLens as well. It offers full voice and video call support, projecting a window in front of your vision with the person you're calling (like VidWindows in Reboot). Because the HoloLens doesn't have a camera on you as you use it, the video feed from your end shows whatever you're looking at, complete with any holograms you want to share with the caller. Games Fragments is one of the most visually impressive demonstrations of what the HoloLens can do for gaming. It's an augmented reality game that puts you in the shoes of a detective who must scan "memories" (incomplete crime scenes) and identify clues to locate where a hostage is being held. The game scanned our test room and used its shape to define both the virtual crime lab and the memories I investigated. I walked around the room watching different fragments of the scene come together as I focused on them, then tapped various clues to get closer looks. Each clue added another detail I could then use to narrow down the search area using a series of location filters, eventually finding out where the crime was happening in time to rescuse a hostage. It's very similar to the AR glasses used by agent Norman Jayden in the game Heavy Rain, only I was wearing the glasses instead of watching a character on my TV use them. Young Conker is a more kid-friendly game where you guide a cartoon squirrel around different levels to collect coins, solve puzzles, and reach objectives. It's much more simple than Fragments, but it similarly uses the shape of your room to determine how to play. Conker will follow the cursor in the middle of your view, running over different obstacles created by the contours of your room's walls and furniture. RoboRaid is a first-person shooting gallery, similar to many virtual reality games on the Samsung Gear VR. You need to look around the room to aim your cursor at attacking robots and hit them with lasers. Instead of tapping a touchpad on the headset like in a Gear VR game, you Air Tap to fire. Physical movement is a big part of this game, and this is where the benefits of augmented reality over virtual reality shine. You can freely move around to dodge laser fire, and since you can see everything that's physically around you, you don't run the risk of knocking things over like with vision-obscuring VR headsets. An Augemented Glimpse Into the Future Even as first-generation development hardware, Microsoft's HoloLens is a very impressive example of cutting-edge technology. This self-contained augmented reality device can project holograms and run apps all around you, letting you turn your entire surroundings into a desktop, or completely overhaul your environment with different effects that follow your walls and furniture accurately. The limited field of vision is the headset's biggest weakness, though, along with a bulky, uncomfortable design. The HoloLens still has a way to go before it finds itself in offices, schools, and homes everywhere. There are some big improvements in field of view and comfort that must be made before this is a feasible consumer technology. Perhaps in five years, everyone will have access to the eventual grandchildren of the HoloLens, with glasses, goggles, and visors that can display holograms anywhere you look. For now, though, this is a $3,000 headset that offers a very tempting glimpse at a promising future. Back to top PCMag may earn affiliate commissions from the shopping links included on this page.

This crash seems to be happen when adding the 12000 table names into SynEdit's internal list. I guess you can live with it when Heidi does not highlight all of these 12000 table names in the editor, but let's say the first 1000 tables only. 5 posts jahsen posted 2 years ago Of course, i understand that this is not a usual problem but i like the program so much and i will be very glad if i could work with it with all my databases. 6679 posts ansgar posted 2 years ago I spent one hour to find the place where table names are being added to the highlighter, with no luck yet. Damn I was sure it was TSynSQLSyn.TableNames. Will keep looking. 5 posts jahsen posted 2 years ago Thank you!!! 6679 posts ansgar posted 2 years ago Fixed in r4817. Highlighter does no longer try to highlight tables when there are more than 1000. 5 posts jahsen posted 2 years ago YOU ARE THE BEST!!! I am gonna' try it out right away! :) 5 posts jahsen posted 2 years ago It works 6 posts Guentiganz posted 1 year ago Hi there, I have the same probleme here. 900 tables and about 600 Triggers. Is it possible to skip highlighting for triggers? Is there any reason to highlight them? Maybe you could higlight the first 1000 items, or may increase this number? thank you 6679 posts ansgar posted 3 months ago The SynEdit guys fixed that slowness issue with many table names! In my tests I simulated 50000 table names without a notifiable waiting time. I merged the changes into HeidiSQL in r5111 so you can test yourself. I also removed the limitation to 1000 tables names now. 6 posts Guentiganz posted 3 months ago Highlighting works fine. Thank you But, Everytime I try to do autocompletion using CTRL + SPACE Heidi executes an show create table for each table and a show create trigger too. in my case there are about 1600 show creates beeign executed. 6679 posts ansgar posted 3 months ago That has nothing to do with highlighting, does it? Well, if you're on a newer MySQL server, these SHOW CREATE queries should be fired as one big multi-statement with semicolons between each single one, are they?

Stumble It! Add to Diigo Bookmark this on Delicious Tweet Facebook LinkedIn Press Release Retailers and manufacturers missing out on billions of dollars in laptop sales Survey shows on average 71% of consumers in US and UK will buy new laptops every two years if offered innovative and irresistible guaranteed future value promotions Chertsey, Surrey, 22nd August 2016: On average 71% of consumers across the UK and USA will upgrade to a new laptop within two years if retailers guarantee them a rebate of 50 per cent on the original purchase price of their current model, according to a new survey of 1,000 consumers split between the two countries. This could help reset the decline of the PC market due to longer upgrade cycles and mobile-device cannibalization as mentioned by Intel CEO Brian Krzanich at a recent investor conference.[1] Opia Survey Infographic The survey, conducted by polling firm Censuswide for risk-managed sales promotion expert Opia, reveals that 73% consumers in the US will upgrade if they are made such an offer, along with 69% in the UK. “Guaranteed future value (GFV) offers have huge potential to help retailers and manufacturers on both sides of the Atlantic bust out of ever-longer refresh cycles in the laptop market,” says Steve Gales, sales director at Opia. “With more than 17 million units shipped in the US in the last quarter of 2015 and an estimated nine million UK consumers obtaining a laptop or notebook in the year, the revenue boost from customers upgrading more often could be colossal. The average US citizen, for example, spends $500 on a new laptop and if they do that every 2.5 years, instead of every five, retailers and manufacturers will see revenue rocket by more than $170bn in a five year period. “Many consumers are hanging on to laptops for five years or more, putting up with ever-poorer performance because they fear having to spend on a new device. Although there are slight differences between the two countries, the survey shows that GFV can remove that fear, encouraging consumers to make new purchases more regularly.” The survey also reveals that 69% of consumers across the two countries view a new laptop as less expensive if the resale value is guaranteed to be 50% of what they paid for it, provided they upgrade within two years. “Since most respondents (59%) in the two countries have previously taken up some form of promotional offer to buy a laptop, they are already open to suggestion if the offer is compelling. Retailers who don’t act fast to implement closed loop upgrade promotions are subjecting themselves to ever-longer refresh cycles and lower revenues.” says Gales. The findings showed that in the US and UK, an average of 85% of consumers wait more than three years before buying a new laptop. In the US, 69% said they did not buy a new PC or laptop because new models were too expensive and are waiting for the right offers compared with 63% in the UK. “These survey results demonstrate clearly how retailers and manufacturers failing to use risk-backed GFV promotional mechanisms are doing themselves out of a significant amount of business. One final example from the survey reveals 35% of US consumers and 30% of UK consumers said a 50% GFV offer could encourage them to buy a more expensive model when they come to upgrade”, concludes Gales.

DRAM will live on as DDR5 memory is slated to reach computers in 2020 The DDR5 DRAM specification will be finalized by the end of this year Agam Shah (IDG News Service) on 19 August, 2016 04:53 0 - - - - print email Hardware experts believed the last DRAM would be the current DDR4, but that's not the case, with DDR5 memory now under development. Specifications for DDR5 memory will be released this year, and deployment of the DRAM will begin in 2020, according to a slide deck presented at the Intel Developer Forum this week. DDR5 DRAM will have many benefits: Users will be able to cram more memory into PCs, and applications will run faster. DDR5 memory will be denser than earlier DRAM, and also consume less power, which could extend battery life in laptops. PCs will need faster and denser memory for applications like virtual reality, and DDR5 will help, said Mike Howard, director of DRAM and memory at research firm IHS. Right now, VR applications are in their early days, but the bandwidth provided by DDR4 may ultimately not be enough, Howard said. Servers will be the first hardware to get DDR5 DRAM, and it could reach desktops and laptops 12 to 18 months later. The server market is the "low-hanging fruit," because many applications, like databases and analytics, are executed in memory, Howard said. HP is doubling memory capacity in servers every year to help deal with information gathered through data sources like sensors and social media networks and then sent to data centers for analysis. DDR5 DRAM could help server makers meet the growing memory needs. Hardware experts expected that DDR4 DRAM would ultimately be replaced by new memory technology like PCM (phase-change memory), RRAM (resistive RAM), or MRAM (magnetoresistive RAM), all of which can also store data when a computer is shut off. Those memory types are still in research or early stages of deployment, and could be expensive to make. "The incumbent always has tremendous inertia," Howard said. "The DDR incumbent will keep rolling by the virtue that it's there." It was also expected that DDR4 would last longer because of the continued decline in PC shipments. But PCs are finding a new life in applications like VR, and the renewed interest is partly driving DDR5 DRAM development. DRAM is a US$40 billion annual business, and companies like Samsung will make DDR memory as long as it's a viable business. Memory makers won't spend billions to retool factories for newer memory types based on promise, Howard said. Some advanced DRAM-like memory has found niche uses. HMC (Hybrid Memory Cube) and Wide I/O are faster than DRAM but haven't been widely adopted yet. Another promising, but more expensive memory, called HBM (high-bandwidth memory) is used in GPUs, but could also be used in PCs some day. A new memory that could dislodge DRAM is 3D Xpoint, which can be used as storage, memory, or both. Intel will sell 3D Xpoint DIMMs starting next year, and the company claims it is faster and 10 times denser than DRAM. But it'll take many years for 3D Xpoint memory DIMMs to be widely adopted, Howard said. DDR5 DRAM will allow smaller and denser memory chips to be made using the latest manufacturing processes. The DDR4 specification, which was finalized many years ago, wasn't designed using the latest 14- and 10-nanometer manufacturing processes, but for the older 40- to 50-nanometer processes. DDR5 could live until 2025, and that may give breathing room for the new memory types to develop, Howard said. "A lot of the DDR5 development gets back to the shortcomings for DDR4," Howard said. DDR5 deployment could follow the same arc as DDR4, which is still ramping as DDR3 slowly fades. Initially, it will be expensive, but as the volumes ramp, it should get cheaper.

Anthony Grifoni STYLISTIC Q572 For work use, Microsoft Word and Excel programs pre-installed on the device are adequate for preparing short documents. Steph Mundell LIFEBOOK UH574 The Fujitsu LifeBook UH574 allowed for great mobility without being obnoxiously heavy or clunky. Its twelve hours of battery life did not disappoint. Andrew Mitsi STYLISTIC Q702 The screen was particularly good. It is bright and visible from most angles, however heat is an issue, particularly around the Windows button on the front, and on the back where the battery housing is located. Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

This is a low-cost, entry-level laptop aimed at first-time buyers or students, just like with the HP Pavilion 15-au072sa. However, it takes a slightly different tack, adding a touchscreen and a 360-degree hinge to turn it into a giant convertible laptop/tablet. Along with this you get a higher-spec 1080p screen that uses IPS technology. That means it’s £80 more expensive than its sibling, but you get a considerably more versatile machine for your cash. HP Pavilion x360 15-bk062sa – Design and Features Although a convertible, this is still a fairly typical 15.6-inch laptop with dimensions of 23.9 x 382 x 250mm and a weight of 2.3kg. Certainly it’s hefty enough that you’ll want a rucksack to carry it around in, not a shoulder bag. If you’re a fan of bold colour schemes, though, then the 15-au072sa should be right up your street. On the outside it’s all metallic red, while the interior has a great contrasting matte-black finish. Related: Best Laptops The act of flipping it around is made a bit more difficult than it should be, though. The screen is held against the keyboard by magnets, and although they’re not particularly powerful, it’s difficult to grip the two parts of the laptop to prize them apart because the edges of the casing are so rounded. And no, the little tab on the front edge of the screen section doesn’t help all that much. BUY NOW: HP Pavilion x360 15-bk062sa for £479.99 from Currys.co.uk Otherwise build quality is decent. The hinges hold the screen securely in place, no matter what position it’s set to, and there are no creaks or groans when you poke and prod the rest of the laptop. Likewise the keyboard is more than acceptable. It doesn't flex or wobble too much when typing, and the key action is nicely defined, so you’re always sure when you’ve pressed a key properly. The layout is also good, with plenty of space, and there’s even room for a numpad. However, like the HP 15-au072sa's keyboard, the layout here is US-style, with some of the keys being slightly different shapes and in odd places compared to a normal UK keyboard. You’ll soon get used to it if it’s your only computer, but it could be a slight annoyance if you’re used to a proper UK layout. As for the trackpad, it’s also pretty good. It’s nice and large, your fingers glide easily across its surface and tracking is accurate. The single click-anywhere button takes a bit more effort than the best, but overall it's still easy to use. One thing you won’t find in its usual place alongside the keyboard and trackpad is the power button, which has been moved to the left side. This is so it’s still accessible when the screen is flipped around into tablet or tent mode. Likewise there’s a volume rocker here and a Windows button on the right edge. Also around the sides are three USB ports (2 x USB 3.0, 1 x USB 2.0), a full-size HDMI, an Ethernet network port, an SD card reader and a headphone/microphone combi socket. That’s a perfectly reasonable selection that’ll mean you seldom need an adapter or obscure cable to hook things up. You do miss out on the DVD/RW drive of the 15-au072sa, though, so if you still use CDs and DVDs this isn’t the machine for you. Or you could just buy an external optical disc drive. Inside you get 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2, so you’re all set for the latest wireless tech. An Intel Core i3-6100U processor lies at the heart of the Pavilion x360, and it comes with Intel’s HD Graphics 520. It’s also joined by 8GB of RAM and a 1TB hard drive. That hard drive will feel slow compared to more typical convertible laptops that tend to use SSD storage, but for the price of this machine it’s to be expected. HP Pavilion x360 15-bk062sa – Screen and Audio HP has equipped the 15-bk062sa with a 1080p screen, so you get plenty of pixels making up a sharp-looking display. At that full resolution some may find text and icons look a little small, but you can use Windows’ scaling options to enlarge everything a bit. It’s also an IPS LCD panel, rather than the cheaper TN type. That means it has much better image quality when viewed from an angle, as you can see in the images below. HP 15-au072sa with a TN display (left) and HP 15-bk062sa with an IPS display However, it’s not perfect. The main issue is the combination of a highly reflective glass touchscreen and the relatively low maximum brightness of 244nits. Many laptops offer up to 300-350nits, while something like the iPad – which also has to overcome a reflective touchscreen – pumps out 450nits. Otherwise it’s a pretty decent display for the money. You get a great contrast ratio of 1,307:1, which means things like films and pictures are really brought to life, as you can see bright colours at the same time as deep, dark colours. Lesser displays can look grey and washed out. SRGB colour space coverage of 62.3% shows it certainly isn’t a display up there with the best, but to expect more for the money would be churlish. However, I would hope for a bit more from this laptop’s speakers. They’re incredibly weak and tinny, and the B&O software enhancements can only do so much to squeeze a little more life out of them. Anything louder than whisper-quiet listening quickly becomes shrill and fatiguing. HP Pavilion x360 15-bk062sa – Performance Overall performance of this laptop is absolutely fine. The Intel Core i3-6100U rattles through any task you throw at it with ease, such that only those regularly doing heavy work like editing lots of pictures and cutting together videos will find they need more power. This is reflected in a perfectly decent PCMark 8 score of 2,163 and Geekbench 3 scores of 2,317 (single) and 5,013 (multi). It can also cope with some very light 3D gaming – a bit of Minecraft and the like – with a 3DMark score or 42,409. Interestingly, though, all these scores are actually slightly lower than the identically equipped 15-au072sa, suggesting HP has either tweaked the CPU’s settings or that the internal cooling is less effective, so the chip can’t squeeze out as much performance. You’ll hardly notice the difference in normal use, but it's worth bearing in mind. That's a sacrifice for having a convertible machine where there’s a little less room to fit in beefier cooling. As hinted at earlier, the main sticking point when it comes to performance is the hard drive. It’s perfectly okay for a laptop hard drive, and 1TB is plenty of space, but if you’ve ever experienced the faster booting, speedier app-loading and general snappiness that an SSD brings then you’ll find it hard to go back to a hard drive. HP Pavilion x360 15-bk062sa – Battery Life For such a large and low-cost laptop, the 15-bk062sa has surprisingly good battery life. It lasted 7 hours and 23 minutes in our PowerMark test, where we loop 10 minutes of web browsing and 5 minutes of watching video, with Wi-Fi on and the screen brightness set to about 100-150nits (60-80%). That’s just about enough for a working day, or a day of lectures, so you can potentially leave your charger at home. Plus, if you drop the screen brightness right down, you probably can get close to the company’s claimed 9 hours of battery life, though overall I’d say that's rather ambitious. Should I buy the HP Pavilion x360 15-bk062sa? This is an intriguing laptop/tablet hybrid. Frankly, the appeal of such a large touchscreen device is rather lost on me, without there also being an included stylus, or something along those lines that actually makes the touchscreen useful. As it is, if feels like a glorified picture viewer. And without the touchscreen being useful, you’re much better off with a less reflective non-glass screen. All that said, there’s little wrong with the way HP has put this device together. It looks quite smart, ergonomically it all works perfectly well, and you get good performance and battery life. The screen is also perfectly decent for the money. As such, if you see the appeal of a flip-around touchscreen device and you're on a budget, the 15-bk062sa is a decent buy. Related: Best laptops for students Verdict Having a 15.6-inch touchscreen seems a little pointless, but this is otherwise a decent entry-level laptop.

The report covers the comprehensive study of the key vendors offering solutions for mobile application security. The report outlines the findings and analysis on how well each mobile application security vendor performs within the criteria. The Vendor DIVE helps vendors to get detailed information regarding their competitors on the basis of their product offerings and business strategies. This report is instrumental in helping the stakeholders such as mobile application security vendors, system integrators, value-added resellers, and other channel partners, in making concurrent business choices on the deployment of mobile application security solutions. Vendor Landscape Most of the vendors provide a complete mobile application security suite inclusive of multiple testing techniques, be it Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), or Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST). These vendors are competing to provide an innovative combination of testing techniques to the end users to address the rising concern about mobile application security. They focus on critical features, such as behavioral analysis, binary code analysis, and proactive testing, to deploy robust application security mechanisms for mobile applications. The following vendors are included in the report: 1. IBM 2. HP 3. WhiteHat Security 4. Veracode 5. Checkmarx 6. Cigital 7. Rapid7 8. Pradeo 9. Appthority 10. Arxan Technologies Vendor DIVE Methodology The Vendor DIVE methodology involves extensive research to identify the key vendors offering mobile application security solutions. A comprehensive list of mobile application security vendors was prepared, through secondary research referring to annual reports, press releases and investor presentations of companies, white papers, directories, and databases. Based on their breadth of product offering, organization size, and other selection criteria, the list was narrowed down to select the key 10 vendors. During the production cycle of the report, in-depth interviews were conducted with various primary respondents, which include key opinion leaders, subject matter experts, directors, and C-level executives of selected mobile application security vendors to obtain and verify critical qualitative and quantitative information. This primary data was collected mainly through questionnaires, mails, and telephonic interviews. Scoring Methodology After completion of the data gathering and verification process, the scores and weightage for the shortlisted vendors against each parameter were finalized. Based on the extensive secondary and primary research, each criterion for the selected vendors was scored on the scale ranging from 0 to 10. After the ratings were finalized, each vendor was placed in the Vendor DIVE matrix based on their score in product offering and business strategy in the mobile application security market.

These over-ear cans from Sony look great and perform superbly. Because they're noise-cancelling headphones, they also act as a superb buffer against external disruption when you're trying to study. They're light and padded, which adds to their comfort on your head over long periods. They have quick-access buttons (volume, pause, forward, back) which stop you having to take your phone out of your pocket so often when listening to music. These buttons also include an on-off switch for the noise-cancelling feature, which gives you options for battery life. They fold up tightly enough to fit into a large coat pocket or a modestly-sized compartment in an average bag Apple iPad Pro 13 (€899 from PC World) 2. Apple iPad Pro 13, Price: €899 from PC World I'm including Apple's top-end iPad here because productivity iPads can now perform at the same level as laptops for most tasks. And this iPad is just as powerful with a gorgeous 13-inch screen. It also works brilliantly with a couple of custom keyboards, not least Apple's own Smart Keyboard. The iPad Pro has a few other major advantages over laptops. First, it's more portable and generally lighter, meaning you can pop it in a bag easier. Second, it recharges using an ordinary iPhone Lightning connection. And because of its top-class screen and four stereo speakers, it makes an unrivalled Netflix or movie screen for a generation that barely watch traditional telly anymore. The downside is that it's fairly expensive: the 128GB version costs over €1,200. 3. Acer Chromebook R11, Price: €399 from Argos Acer's R11 convertible touchscreen Chromebook is nicely styled with a usable keyboard and a reasonably bright touchscreen. It's cheap, cheerful and very usable. The laptop's 11.6-inch screen folds over to turn the device into a large tablet, albeit one running on Google's desktop-like Chrome operating system. As it's a Chromebook, the vast majority of its functionality is based on 'cloud' apps like Google Docs - you won't be using this as an anchor device for an iPhone or iPod. There's also the bare minimum of onboard storage with just 16GB available. It has an HDMI port, a couple of USB ports and an SD memory card slot. It's a nice budget laptop option. 4. Dell XPS 13, Price: €1,189 from Dell.ie If you're likely to need a serious, performance-driven laptop that can handle any kind of college project or software variation, Dell's XPS 13 is a pretty good choice. It has excellent power configurations, starting at an Intel i5 chip, 8GB of Ram and 256GB of internal storage memory. The 2k 'full HD' screen is also impressive. But its design is equally of note here: Dell has all but eliminated the screen's bezel to a hair's breadth. This means that what is supposed to be a 13-inch laptop takes up no more space than a 12-inch or 11-inch laptop, with consequent transportation advantages. The loss of the bezel also means that the XPS 13 is incredibly light. (At 1.2kg, it's over 10pc lighter than Apple's skinny 13-inch MacBook Air.) Battery life is good to excellent, at well over seven hours' use. The backlit keyboard is decent and there's plenty of connections of offer, with USB 3, Thunderbolt and a memory card port. 5. Sony xperia E5, Price: €220 sim-free from Argos Sony's new budget Xperia E5 is bright, fairly powerful and has a decent camera. It feels easy to use despite being more than €300 less than many of the phones you're pitched these days. In other words, you can go full-power on Instagram, Facebook, Gmail, Outlook Exchange, Twitter and your media subscriptions without any real loss of performance on a device that's within the price range of almost everybody. The nearest you'll find to a catch is that its 16GB of internal storage isn't really enough these days (although to make up for this, Sony has added a memory card slot for up to 200GB extra). The speaker on the phone is surprisingly good for a budget model, while the five-inch screen just about makes the snazzy standard with 194 pixels per inch. The E5's 2,700mAh battery life is adequate and gets a general user through a full day's use.

Management teams across the US indicated in their results releases and subsequent conference calls that while global growth remains well below desired levels, it is a macro environment that has persisted for some time and companies have had to get used to it. The outlook for the remainder of 2016 is for sluggish economic growth but from which corporates have continued to adapt through cost cutting and reduced capital expenditures, and deploying cash towards share buyback programmes. Over the longer term, such capital allocation decisions will have a negative impact but in the shorter term, it augments company profitability levels and buys investors time for the much-vaunted global economic growth induced by central banks. READ NEXT Firms lose Luas court appeal One of the frequent pushbacks against investing in the US has been that valuation multiples for the market are not low and by no means cheap, particularly when set against European ones. While this is true and the S&P 500 trades on 17.5 times forward year earnings compared to 15.4 times for the Stoxx 600 index in Europe, the quality of the US companies tends to be higher than those in Europe. When looking at most global industries, the respective bellwethers are typically large US companies that European and Asian competitors try to emulate. Taking the technology sector as an example, US companies dominate through companies that include Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft, Intel, Salesforce.com and Oracle. In Europe, beyond SAP and Nokia, there are few very large technology companies. In healthcare, the world’s leading pharmaceutical, medical device and biotechnology companies are listed in the US. Companies such as Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic, Merck, Amgen and Gilead lead the global field. The US is also relatively safe with regards to its banks. That’s in sharp contrast to the travails facing European banks, notably in Italy. While banks are being negatively impacted by zero interest rate policies of central banks, those that are based in the US are much better placed than their European peers which are grappling with non-performing loans and anaemic economic expansion. From a political stand point, the US is also more attractive than Europe. It is very unlikely that the US will ever face the prospect of a break-up, whereas Europe is currently experiencing the upheaval of a likely exit of Britain from the EU. With the likelihood of Donald Trump being elected president slipping in recent weeks, the risk of a significant change in political governance of the country is reduced. The same cannot be said for Europe, where recent elections have seen increases in support for right-wing parties. Several important elections take place across the region over the next 12 months. It is also likely that the dollar will strengthen from current levels given that the Federal Reserve is best placed among global central banks to continue the process of raising rates from all-time low levels. This dynamic is likely to come at a time when the ECB will want to reduce the value of the euro in order to benefit European exporters. In Japan, further monetary stimulus appears very likely. Should the move towards a more right-wing political establish itself during upcoming elections, there would likely be more downward pressure on the euro against the dollar, benefiting dollar investments made by investors. Overall, despite the elevated nature of the US valuations relation to Europe, the former is an attractive alternative that offers investors less political and systemic financial risks.

PaintShop Pro has long been viewed as one of the more credible alternatives to Photoshop, offering advanced features such as layers and Photoshop-compatible plug-ins, along with step-by-step guides to help you get started with common tasks. And priced from $99, PaintShop Pro is a whole lot cheaper than its better-known competitor. So it’s good to see Corel continuing to improve the veteran image editor with a new version that offers a host of new features – including project templates, pre-built desktop publishing-type layouts to help you create greetings cards, brochures, photo collages and more. PaintShop Pro X9 also now supports Windows Real-Time Stylus for pressure sensitivity on Microsoft Surface and other similar devices. An interactive gradient fill tool allows fine-tuning a gradient by dragging across the image and watching a live preview. Extended camera support includes 15 new RAW profiles and the ability to work with Intel RealSense XDM images. You can now export your edit history, ideal for showing others exactly how you achieved a particular effect. Elsewhere, there’s an updated Text Toolbar with downloadable text presets, Silent Script for faster one-click editing actions, and smart photo fix one-click fixes can now be applied as part of a batch process. Corel PaintShop Pro X9 is available for $99, with a collection of additional photo tools as Corel PaintShop Pro X9 Ultimate for $129, or with Corel’s VideoStudio Pro X9 editor as the new Corel Photo Video Bundle for $179. A 30-day trial is available now for Windows 7 and later. This article originally appeared at softwarecrew.co.uk.

That's the conclusion of a bunch of Comp. Sci boffins from researchers at Australian brain box Data61 and Sydney University, who assessed four major OpenFlow controllers – NOX, Maestro, Floodlight and Beacon. Their paper is at Arxiv. Poor old OpenDaylight was also tested but not reported: “the performance [was] too low to provide any insightful comparison”. To cut to the chase: none of the controllers tested got anywhere close to line speed, whether running on a network processor (based on Tilera chips), or on a Xeon E5-2450-based server (more on the configurations later). On the CBench software defined networking (SDN) controller benchmark, the best the Tilera setup achieved was just under five million requests per second, compared to a line rate of 29 million requests per second. It seems that Intel's long years of work understanding packet processing is paying off: on the x86 setup, Beacon was able to hit 20 million requests per second; the maximum of the other controllers was 7 million requests per second. Line rate? Forget it: the CSIRO/Data61/Sydney Uni benchmark results Since SDN controllers have to deal with traffic as flows (meaning they have to remember MAC addresses so as to track conversations, compared to an Ethernet switch that only has to know which port it's forwarding traffic to), network scalability is also a big problem. None of the controllers stayed near their peak performance with 10 million unique MAC addresses in the benchmark, and the Java-based controllers (Beacon and Floodlight) stagger to a near-complete halt at that scale. The problem, the paper says, is that OpenFlow itself has architectural inefficiencies. The authors pick out serialisation; I/O threading; and, “the key data structure of the learning switch application: the hash table”. Serialisation is by far the biggest overhead: even the most efficient controller “spends a fifth of his time in packet serialisation … this limitation is inherent to the object oriented design principle of these controllers. They all treat each single packet as an individual object, a limitation that induces an unaffordable per-packet overhead.” The authors' proposal is for a new SDN controller design: “treat arriving packets with pre-allocated buffers rather than new objects,” they write. Controllers should also “be aware of the hardware characteristics to limit cache misses on multi-core platforms, or exploit the network-on-chip on many-core platforms”. ® Sponsored: The state of mobile security maturity Tips and corrections 15 Comments Whitepapers Build scalable and secure public cloud services Based on the industry-leading products and technologies your customers demand, Red Hat provides a complete set of platforms, tools, and software components you need to build a scalable, agile, and secure cloud services infrastructure.
